00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.920
PROFESSOR: So today was a
little different than yesterday.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.530
So I thought it
would be good for us

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.480
to just sort of
recap what happened.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.860
Let's go back to the
sixth graders visit.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.152
Thank you, Jamie, for
prepping them for it.

00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:40.110
I woke up this morning.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.330
I was like, I didn't
prep them for it.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.530
If I were them, I would
have been super overwhelmed.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.580
I'm a terrible person.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.919
Was that helpful to you?

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.085
What did you guys think
about that whole experience?

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.130
AUDIENCE: I immediately knew
that whatever ideas I had

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.694
yesterday was completely off.

00:00:58.694 --> 00:01:00.170
And wrong.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.900
180 degrees in the
wrong direction.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.400
PROFESSOR: I mean,
do take what they

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.000
say with a grain of
salt. Sixth graders

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.150
don't always know how to
articulate what they want.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.330
In a pitch, robots always sound
cooler than food decomposing.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.930
But there is a way
to make that awesome,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.190
if that's really what
you're interested in.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.980
So as with everything
in this class,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.540
the feedback is
ultimately for you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.060
to decide what to do with it.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.650
Was there anything
surprising that

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.686
came out of the first hour?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.460
I know it's hard to put yourself
back into that perspective.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.940
That's what I meant yesterday
with the whole thoughtfulness

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.600
quality.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.090
One of the values
of the class is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.550
being able to take yourself
out of the perspective

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.780
that you have here.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.490
We were shooting science out
loud during the first season

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.950
with two grad students
who are in AeroAstro.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520
They were making a video
about how engines work.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.610
And we were discussing
one of the scenes

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.160
that they had planned was to
describe a turbine engine.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.360
And I'll go into this more
during Thursday's lecture.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.810
But one of the
students was trying

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.180
to describe that it's
the turbine blades that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000
push the air forward.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.990
And we he was thinking to
do an animation with it.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.400
And we thought, this
is really complicated.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.160
I couldn't understand
what he was trying to say.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.730
And finally, the other
student who was there

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.210
was like, oh, well there's
one Boeing 777 in the hangar

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.580
in that building over there.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.530
Like, is it worth
filming with it?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.390
And just sort of that
mentality of like,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.070
you have access to an
actual turbine engine.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.652
And it didn't cross
your mind to film it.

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:50.110
And they were
awesome to work with.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410
And you know, that the
whole day of shooting

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.080
was actually really fun.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
But the ability to take
yourself out of the things

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.650
that your experience all the
time, or take for granted.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.610
Creating that window for
people who don't necessarily

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.930
have access to the
world that you live in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.530
is surprisingly difficult to do.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.570
And hopefully the
first hour of classes

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.430
sort of helped you orient
into that new perspective.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.020
But I know that's a challenge
for me a lot of times

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.090
is, I don't think people
are going to think

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.320
this is super interesting.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.260
And it's not the content that's
not interesting to people.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.450
It's just the delivery.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.450
How you package it up.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.280
PROFESSOR: I think that getting
the right angle for-- like,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.590
some of you had
really broad topics.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.090
Right?

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.890
And the thing that's
really hard is

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.400
that there are so many
things within that topic that

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.380
could be really interesting.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.194
And like the food
decomposing thing.

00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:45.110
Actually think there are
a billion really cool

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.470
topics in there that
could be really fun.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.050
Like cheese is technically mold.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.900
And why is some mold
good, and some mold bad.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.400
Right?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.930
And there's some
really cool things

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.290
like that can do about that.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.360
And getting back to microbiome
things, or bacteria,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.340
or there's some really
cool stuff in there.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.200
And just like every
one of your topics

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.560
that you guys brought up.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.080
There's some really
cool little pieces

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.480
of truths inside of there.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.740
And the hard part
is figuring out

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.940
how to give-- I mean,
this is what writers do,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.080
is having the right
angle to your story.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.579
Right?

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.850
And so, many-- I think
all of what I heard,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.460
I heard many your ideas.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm like we're in
the right zip code,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.360
but we haven't quite narrowed
down the right building yet.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.860
Right?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.310
Or the right street.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.560
And for the hard
part is figuring out

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.250
within the topic
of shipbuilding,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.450
or within the idea of hacking,
or building a game, what

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.460
is that little cool
angle that you're are

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.920
going to take to make it really
exciting and interesting?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.460
And snare enough and focused
enough and that kind of thing

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.834
that makes it
really interesting.

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:52.977
Because I do think actually
that lava sounds cooler

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.060
to like a sixth grader
because they're like, lava!

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.740
That's cook.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.360
Right?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.619
But the food one.

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.160
I'm not ready to
give up on that yet.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.285
Like, I think there's a
lot of cool stuff in there.

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:05.210
And the hard part is
figuring out, really

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.280
narrowing down your story.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.570
And then figuring out which
one has more meat to it.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.170
PROFESSOR: I mean, I think
it's a very beautiful story,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.669
actually.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.420
The whole idea of material
objects on this earth

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.915
transforming in a way
that's tangible to us.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:19.040
And maybe that's just like
super romantic sounding.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.840
But I do think that there is-- I
loved what Chris said yesterday

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.720
about making not just
the unfamiliar familiar,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.780
but making the
familiar unfamiliar.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.969
And I think that's a lot of
what of what VSauce does.

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.760
And I think that's a
lot of what Veritasium

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.660
does is it's taking the
things that you see,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.590
and taking the world that you're
used to seeing, and showing you

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.650
a new lens at looking at it.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.620
And I know that
sounds very abstract.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.550
And I'm sure that we've
thrown out a lot of things

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.260
to think about that you're
not maybe quite sure

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.230
how to implement on
a practical level.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.165
And I promise that that's
what we're going to hit next.

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:58.340
And once you guys
write a script tonight,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.230
or just try writing
it, it'll help

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.490
you a lot to sort
of understand how

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.950
to implement these things
practically speaking.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.710
So worry.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.336
I am aware that that might be
a frustration that you have.

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:10.960
PROFESSOR: I wonder if we have
a little time today to give them

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.290
more time to flesh out
their ideas a little more.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.123
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:14.650
Absolutely.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.320
So I was originally
planning on showing you guys

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.730
a couple hosting case studies.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.260
But if you would find
it more helpful to just

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.420
maybe brainstorm script ideas--

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.732
PROFESSOR: I feel like that's
where they are right now.

00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:28.690
If you think I'm wrong.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.899
But I feel like today made
you think a little more.

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:33.190
And now before you go home
and have to really implement

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.815
some idea, maybe it's worth
really making sure each of you

00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:39.760
know what you want to do before.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.370
I don't know.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.500
What do you guys think?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.180
I'm feeling some
anxiety right now

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.680
that like it would
help to flesh out

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.200
your ideas out a little more.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.700
Yes.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.283
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.960
We will totally do that.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.350
I did want to show
you something.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.990
Because for me personally,
it's hard for me

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.630
to hear abstract level ideas.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.630
And I just need
to see an example

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.400
to help understand that.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.520
So.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.630
And again, I'm not saying
that the way I necessarily

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.860
do things or the way George
or any of the teaching staff

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.310
do things is necessarily
the best way.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.810
Because again, best is
not really been defined.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.300
But this was a video we
did during second season.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.530
And it was the first
biology video that any of us

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.917
had worked on, which I
was really excited about.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.375
But it did present
these challenges

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:31.450
of like how do you create a
visually interesting video

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.340
that's worth making as a video.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.840
Because again, I mean,
I think asking yourself,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.940
like why do I need
to make an animation

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.370
about synthetic biology
when I could just

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.430
create a cartoon about it?

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.330
As Chris was saying,
visual elements, just

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.740
pictorial representations of
things are very, very engaging.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.210
We really were asking
ourselves, like what's

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.430
going to be the visual
purpose of her explaining

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.220
what basically became a little
bit about systems biology,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.600
actually.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.940
And one of the things
that we really fixated on,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.950
which is an idea of
hers, was a metaphor.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.870
And so this is about a
four minute long episode.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.630
Would you guys
mind if showed it?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.929
And then we can
workshops scripts.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:16.970
But let me turn off this.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.294
Is the light already off?

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:23.730
You guys can see it OK, right?

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.230
OK.

00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.610
So I'll show this to
you guys and maybe we

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.049
can un-pack what you've think
is successful or not successful

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:37.964
about our attempt.

00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:38.630
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.046
-Paclitaxel is a
compound that can

00:08:40.046 --> 00:08:45.720
treat cancer-- Paclitaxel is a
compound that can treat cancer.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.380
salicylic acid reduces
headaches and fevers.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.910
Carotenoids can turn
your skin orange.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.580
And miraculin changes
your sense of taste.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.140
What do all of these awesome
compounds have in common?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.900
They all come from plants!

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.184
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.640
More than 100,000 natural
compounds occur in plants

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.950
and we barely explore them.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.160
These small molecules
are called metabolites.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.360
Just like how all the DNA in
an organism forms the genome,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.300
all of the metabolites
form the metabolome.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.420
Even though it's metabolite can
be made from only six elements,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.790
there are so many
possibilities that it

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.570
would take scientists thousands
of years to make each one try

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.400
and figure out its usefulness.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.770
Luckily, plants have
already done this for us.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.140
Plants have the disadvantage
of being rooted to the ground.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.030
So over time they've
trial and errored

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.760
making lots of compounds
to see which ones help

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.920
them survive and thrive best.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.420
And because they've
been interacting

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.690
with other species like us for
100s of thousands of years,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.220
some of their chemicals turn
out to be really useful,

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.440
both inside and
outside our bodies.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.550
But to use plants to
their full potential,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.710
we have to know what chemicals
they make and how to make them.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.380
Instead of studying
every chemical one

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.010
by one, what if we could
study all of them at once?

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.690
We could start by mapping
the huge network that

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.400
connects metabolites.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.190
In any living
organism, molecules

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.750
are always on the move.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.380
Being converted and shuttled,
decomposed and built

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.970
back up again and re-used.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.706
It's just like a subway system!

00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:30.116
Except in biology, the
people are the chemicals

00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:34.470
and the train is the enzyme
that converts and moves them.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.410
If you look at a
city from above,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.940
how could you map the
whole subway system?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.050
Similarly, if we
look at a plant,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.800
how could you figure out the
entire metabolome network?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.540
To figure out a
path and a system,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.020
what we actually need
to do is break it.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.800
If we mutate or
disrupt a pathway

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.890
and see how the metabolite
quantities change,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.420
we could figure out the
connections between them.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.450
Let's say the train from
Central to MIT breaks.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.730
We wouldn't see students
arriving at MIT,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.460
and would instead see them
building up at Central.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.690
But not only that.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.600
Anyone else traveling
along the red line

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.160
would also be affected.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.640
So it's the
redistribution of people

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.800
which reveals the
red line subway path,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.050
and tells us where
the train broke.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.320
We can use the systems thinking
to uncover the plant metabolite

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.090
network.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.070
For example, we know about
a compound sinapoyl malate

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.280
which protects the
plant from UV damage

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.200
by interacting with UV light,
making the plant grow green.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.090
But without it, the
plant would glow red.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.170
So if we see a red plant,
it's like seeing no people

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.755
at the sinapoyl malate station.

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:41.420
But we wouldn't yet know
where the train broke,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.100
or what other stations
are along the route.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.500
To do that, we can
mutate a lot of seeds,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.360
plant them, and
choose the reds ones.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.715
Now we can analyze these samples
by using the mass spectrometer.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.740
It measures how much
of each metabolite

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.680
is present in the sample.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.190
Then we can use a program to see
which compounds were effected

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.740
and map that part
of the network.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.930
It's like reviewing
the red line.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.850
Once we figure out how the
entire metabolome works,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.920
we can use it to engineer plants
to create new bio materials,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.790
medicines, and clean energy.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.415
We might even discover
that plants have

00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:26.320
the secret to living forever.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.886
We just need to unlock
their chemical mysteries.

00:12:28.886 --> 00:12:31.266
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:34.130
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:39.670
PROFESSOR: So Anastasia's
topic was-- it

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.400
was really hard to visualize.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.520
It mean, if you can
imagine, our first meeting

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.960
she was talking about basically
mapping chemical pathways

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.450
in plants.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.190
And it's a hard concept
to describe verbally.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.214
And I think that there are
some things that we did well

00:12:54.214 --> 00:12:54.880
with that video.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.440
I still feel like
sometimes it's easy to get

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.120
lost in the metaphor that it
doesn't really do as precise

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.160
of a job as it could.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.340
One of the things I did want to
hit though because someone had

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.054
asked, how do you
know if your idea

00:13:11.054 --> 00:13:12.490
is too-- was it
you who asked, how

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.198
do you know your idea
is too big, or not?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.110
You're not going to
appeal to everyone.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.310
And you're not going to be the
perfect video for every viewer.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.620
And that's OK.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.380
I think understanding your niche
is one of the biggest lessons

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.590
that I learned in
producing Science Out Loud.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.280
At the beginning, our
intention and our goal

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.370
was to be something
like SciShow or VSauce.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.790
Something that kids just
sort of watch on their own.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.250
And we quickly realized that
that won't necessarily be

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.480
the case for us and that's OK.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.840
And that we serve a very
powerful function being coupled

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.540
in classrooms, or after
school programs, or parents

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.970
watching them with their kids.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.700
And that'll dictate what
concessions you might make.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.090
I mean, in this
video, we kind of just

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.105
said whoever is
going to watch it

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.230
is going to understand a
little bit about chemistry

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.540
and biology.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.660
And that is what allowed
us to sort of gloss over

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.380
some of the details
about chemical pathways.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.750
I think that video
worked for us, that there

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.330
was a reason that we
made that video partially

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.860
because Anastasia I think
is really good on screen.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.960
And that if you didn't
have her, and if you

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.820
had just a narrated
video or an animation,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.050
it would be a very
different visual experience.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.260
I don't know if you guys
agree with that or not.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.820
But that's sort of how I felt.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.541
The other thing is, she
naturally as a person is really

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:46.040
like that.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.150
She's really jazzed
about biology.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.370
It's OK if your personality
is not like that.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.640
But the way she wrote
her script-- I mean,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.290
she was probably one of the
best during the day of shoot

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.770
just remembering her lines.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.430
Because the way she
wrote her script

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.380
was the way that she
just sort of talks

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.180
about that stuff in real life.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.030
And that was a big tip that
I wanted to give you guys

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.334
before you started scripting,
was right things the way

00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:12.250
that you would say it.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.190
And George will talk about
this a lot tomorrow, as well.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.790
It's a very, very
obvious statement

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.480
that is very, very
difficult to implement.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.010
I don't know if you guys were
pay attention to that in some

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.380
of the BioBuilder videos.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.621
their purpose is to
be very instructional

00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:30.620
like Natalie was saying.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.180
It's like a very
encyclopedic type of product.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.510
And it works well in
schools, but most people

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.660
don't talk in their
everyday conversation

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.970
like those characters did.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.940
And that's OK for their product.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.860
But if your intent is to engage
someone like Hank Green does,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.690
then you have to
think about the way

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.350
that you're writing your script.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.810
And again that may sound
like a very abstract tip.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.490
So what I would
say is, if you're

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.190
struggling with
that in your script,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.530
literally read your words aloud.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.100
And then put your script away
so that you can't see it.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.630
And just explain
your sentence sort

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.840
of ad libbed to
someone next to you.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.810
So this happens a lot to me.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.840
I actually went through
all the exercises

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.160
that you guys are going
to do this month myself

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.470
to sort of see if what
I was saying made sense.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.630
And George and I created
an episode about snot.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.964
And the writing process for
me was a lot harder for me

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:32.130
than I thought it would be,
even though I've coached

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.350
so many people through it.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.860
And it was because I
fell into this habit

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.720
of being super newscastery.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.390
And that's my personal habit
that-- I'll say things like,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.350
you think this would do this.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.120
But turns out, it doesn't.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.302
Right?

00:16:45.302 --> 00:16:46.760
And I would say,
this sounds awful.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.520
And George would
take my script away

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.840
and he would say, Elizabeth,
what is so cool about snot?

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.690
And I'd say, well it's
awesome because you

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.357
think that it's just
like this crap that

00:16:55.357 --> 00:16:56.315
flows out of your body.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.900
But it turns out that has like
all these really amazing things

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.220
about it.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.610
And he would say, well
you should just say that.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:07.050
So as you script, or as
you try to think of ideas,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:07.930
turn to your partner.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.950
And just tell them as you
would tell anyone what it is

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.959
you're trying to convey, what
it is you're excited about.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:17.000
Do you need to do-- want
to add anything to that?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.650
PROFESSOR: Well,
I think right now

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.890
we've got about 35 minutes
before the end of class.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.405
And I suspect we
have some wrap up

00:17:24.405 --> 00:17:26.530
that we need to do to talk
about what to do tonight

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.329
and what to do to get
ready for tomorrow.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.450
So that really puts us
more at 20, 25 minutes.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.750
Right?

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.090
I feel like maybe
what we need to do

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.710
is old school actually
have each of one of you

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.080
think with paper and pen
and brainstorm a little.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.540
And then come back together
as a group a little bit,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.480
so that you have some time
to really conceptualized.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.980
Like if I were to
do this on my own,

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.000
I'm just saying like, I would
actually do an old school

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.940
spiderweb to get my ideas out.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.520
Which is-- put
this guy down here.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.280
I would actually probably
put my topic in the middle

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.020
and start brainstorming
everything

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.730
that I can about it to just keep
me thinking about what, like--

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.060
and then to maybe realize if
shipbuilding is in the middle

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.736
here and we talked about
ships, like what specifically

00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:16.110
within ships am
I thinking about?

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.180
Did we want to talk
about sea sickness?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.280
All right, then if I wanted
to talk sea sickness,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.020
what would I put in my video?

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.520
Right?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.410
And to really
visualize for yourself,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.630
all the topics, concept,
things you would want to film.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.480
And then start getting
a sense for yourself

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.410
of whether or not this
is a doable concept.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.120
And you may realize
that actually this

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.500
is the branch I want
to keep exploring,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.600
as opposed to this
whole big thing.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.922
And if this were my brain,
that's how this would work.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.130
But if there's a different
way that your brain works,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.840
we want you-- I would
think that you should use

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.930
this time a little bit solo.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.360
And then we'll have a chance
to maybe bounce some ideas off.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.190
So I feel like
people, at least what

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.535
I heard from people was
that this morning was

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:57.160
really helpful.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.576
But it made you
realize you really

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:00.210
need to narrow your
topic and really

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.170
think it through a little bit.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.690
So maybe what we do is we
spend about 10 minutes quietly

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.430
working on our own to really
flesh out our concepts.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.180
And then we get back
together as a group.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.130
Do you need paper.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.092
I have paper.

00:19:13.092 --> 00:19:15.050
Does anyone need-- you
need some paper and pen?

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.550
I'll go grab them in my office.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.320
I'll go get some.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.236
PROFESSOR: Real quick.

00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:21.150
I mean, there are
so many strategies.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.250
And some people have
different preferences

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.800
of beginning to script.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.940
I wasn't going to share
this until tonight.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.940
But maybe it would help
to do it right now.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.030
So when I was sitting
down to script

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.914
the snot episode--
and again, I'm

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:35.830
not saying that this is
the best way to do it.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.420
Nor am I saying it's
the right way to do it.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.202
But I was fixated on
the idea that your body

00:19:41.202 --> 00:19:42.410
makes a gallon of snot a day.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.950
That was really the seed that
began the idea of the episode.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.190
So George, who
you'll meet tomorrow,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.100
said, well just list
every amazing thing

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.850
about snot that you
want to talk about.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.360
So I didn't even start with an
idea of a story or anything.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:03.330
All I did was list
every sort of fact

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.460
about mucus that I
was interested in.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.690
And this is sort of the same
concept of having a web.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.220
I just put in a list.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.270
But it doesn't really matter.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.850
And as I was going
through-- and some of this

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.830
was stuff that I had learned in
a class I took as an undergrad.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.720
So I was looking through
my old notes, basically.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.850
There was a lot
of stuff in here.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:30.270
And I ended up taking out maybe
2/3 of it for the final script.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.560
But this is what got me started.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.870
Mucus as a problem.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.660
Mucus as a solution to things.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.500
Just like random, cool
facts about mucus.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.440
The research that's happening.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.320
And just the process of going
through all of these things

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.040
helped me discover a story.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.720
And just the process did.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.240
So if you would find it helpful
to do sort of a brain dump idea

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.700
in the next 10 minutes,
feel free to do that.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.640
Again, we're not
saying that you have

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.580
to do any of these methods.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.920
But this is what's
helped me personally

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.400
in the practice of doing this.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.380
So feel free to do
something like this.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.470
I had some ideas of
demos I could do.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.290
Ted Ed.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.670
When they recruit
people to write scripts,

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.570
they have a requirement
that you have

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.185
a sharable fact in your video.

00:21:18.185 --> 00:21:20.560
So what's the fact in the
video that's going to go viral?

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.270
So I was brainstorming, what
could be some shareable facts

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.820
in the script?

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.600
And then I was thinking
about what's the point?

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.810
Mucus is alive.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.620
that actually ended up not
making the final video at all.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.930
But the exercise and
the act of doing that

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.930
helped me figure out what
the point of the video

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.260
was going to be.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.590
PROFESSOR: So let's maybe
spend like 5 to 10 minutes

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.740
of just quiet time for you to
really think about your topic.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.145
And then maybe we can like
slowly check in with people,

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.520
and then maybe
come back together

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.478
and see if people are
struggling with anything.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.900
I assume that from
you're head nods that

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.936
sounds like a good plan?

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:01.436
Yes.

00:22:01.436 --> 00:22:03.687
OK.

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:07.180
[NO SPEECH]

00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:58.210
PROFESSOR: Do you
know of omnivores?

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:58.710
What is it?

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.472
Not omnivores.

00:24:59.472 --> 00:25:00.180
What's it called?

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.805
Opportunivores.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.012
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:04.012 --> 00:25:04.970
PROFESSOR: No.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.016
They're people who
like running food.

00:25:09.016 --> 00:25:09.775
It's like a--

00:25:09.775 --> 00:25:10.360
AUDIENCE: They discover?

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.980
PROFESSOR: So I have
this great story

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.326
I'll have to give you if this
is what you decide to do.

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:17.050
A non-fiction piece
that was written

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.745
by a journalist exploring
people who actually live off

00:25:21.745 --> 00:25:24.135
of people's decomposing
food scraps.

00:25:24.135 --> 00:25:25.819
AUDIENCE: Oh, so like freegans?

00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:26.610
PROFESSOR: I guess.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.432
Is that another work for it?

00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:31.915
Like I know-- I actually
do know some people

00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:34.040
who their diets is basically
composed of free food.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.410
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.576
And like what is fermenting?

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:37.380
Fermenting if like
beer and cheese.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:42.030
And like fermenting is a whole
other concept in here, right?

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.888
Which is actually a
really cool concept.

00:25:44.888 --> 00:25:45.388
I know.

00:25:45.388 --> 00:25:49.284
I kind of was like there's a lot
of things like beer and cheese.

00:25:49.284 --> 00:25:51.232
And I was like, what
isn't there anything

00:25:51.232 --> 00:25:52.693
of that I'm interested in?

00:25:52.693 --> 00:25:55.160
I guess the conflict I
have right now is that is

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.076
seems people are more
interested in volcanoes.

00:25:57.076 --> 00:26:00.120
And that's easier because I
actually know a lot about this.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.370
This would be something I'd
have to learn about a lot.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:02.989
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:05.155
AUDIENCE: But that's kind
of what I want to do more.

00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:05.738
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:08.037
AUDIENCE: Is I want to learn
a topic as opposed to just

00:26:08.037 --> 00:26:09.120
going in with what I know.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.742
PROFESSOR: What makes you
excited about this topic?

00:26:12.742 --> 00:26:14.450
AUDIENCE: I don't know
anything about it.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:19.180
And I think that's something
that happens a lot.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.880
Whether it's because
my dorm hall's

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.922
terrible at
maintaining our fridge.

00:26:24.922 --> 00:26:26.381
And there's always
things in there.

00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:27.463
PROFESSOR: That's rotting?

00:26:27.463 --> 00:26:28.510
AUDIENCE: That's rotting.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.740
And I'm looking at
it, and it's like wow.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.680
This is the-- how did
this beautiful broccoli

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.173
turn into this black muck?

00:26:35.173 --> 00:26:38.675
And different things like that.

00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:40.800
That's actually something
that fascinates me a lot.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.175
Like the transformation.

00:26:44.175 --> 00:26:45.650
PROFESSOR: And like
why do things--

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.150
AUDIENCE: And like
different things.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.602
Why things-- some things
decompose in different ways

00:26:49.602 --> 00:26:54.160
like where if meats starts to
rot, then even if you cook it,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.034
it's not going--
that's not good.

00:26:56.034 --> 00:26:56.950
You just can't eat it.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.690
But some things you can kind of
like say, well, if you cook it

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.280
well enough, it'll be fine.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.580
And also like the whole concept
of how you prevent this.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.522
you know like these--
I was looking at it

00:27:09.522 --> 00:27:11.230
and there's like all
these different ways

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.450
that you could prevent--
just like they have the three

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.164
topics of like killing things.

00:27:17.164 --> 00:27:19.060
How to like bacteria
and fungi that cause it.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.378
And it's like attacking
like preventing

00:27:22.378 --> 00:27:23.800
like their functions.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.510
I think they're
like their enzymes.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.814
And then there's more
like controlling a growth.

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.730
PROFESSOR: So maybe-- I
mean I love this story

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.989
that you picked.

00:27:33.989 --> 00:27:36.030
PS remind me sometime to
tell you about the story

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.130
I wrote for Backpacker
magazine where

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.670
I took a whole
backpacks worth of food

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.580
and saw what rotted over
the course of a week

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.800
to see what the best
foods are to take hiking.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.465
So I did a piece on
this in my earlier days

00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:49.520
and it was really fun.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.630
But I actually found
that there were

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:57.294
maggots that showed up in the
completely sealed bologna.

00:27:57.294 --> 00:27:58.585
And it grossed me out entirely.

00:27:58.585 --> 00:28:00.650
Because you like, they must
have been there from the start.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.514
That's terrifying.

00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:03.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's-- Yeah.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.350
The things that like
start and they--

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.592
with meat and like things
that the animal has--

00:28:07.592 --> 00:28:08.300
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.640
AUDIENCE: Go through the entire
process and they survive.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.894
But the story that
I love that you just

00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:15.220
told me about was you
going into your dorm

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.550
and seeing that broccoli
and being like, why did this

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.050
happen?

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.460
And what does it smell so bad?

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.345
And you can make your whole
five minute piece about that.

00:28:22.345 --> 00:28:22.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.428
PROFESSOR: Do you
know what I mean?

00:28:24.428 --> 00:28:28.300
Like just that little anecdote
of you looking in your fridge

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.530
and seeing this nasty
broccoli and being

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.040
like, why does this happen?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.400
That's your story.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.185
You know?

00:28:35.185 --> 00:28:35.660
AUDIENCE: And I thought--

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.580
PROFESSOR: And then all
this comes from that.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.010
AUDIENCE: It's just
like a very big topic.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.510
Because I made my
video and I looked

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.860
and I don't really go
that far into anything.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.485
And it's five minutes already.

00:28:45.485 --> 00:28:45.985
You know?

00:28:45.985 --> 00:28:46.350
And I've--

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.433
PROFESSOR: But if you were
to really narrowly look

00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:51.390
at what's going on
what that broccoli,

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.700
that's actually a really
great five minute piece.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.620
AUDIENCE: Because like, I
mean, I looked on YouTube.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.580
They have this time-lapse
of things decaying.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.770
But there's nothing ever
explains why, or how,

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.750
or what does it.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.504
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:02.504 --> 00:29:04.170
AUDIENCE: Like,
basically the only thing

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.169
that there is on the
internet in like video form

00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:07.350
is watching things.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.475
But there's no explanation.

00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:11.660
PROFESSOR: Of like why does
it become so darn smelly?

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.421
Right?

00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:14.670
AUDIENCE: You know, I can
go and read academic papers.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.410
But academic papers
are academic papers.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:16.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.003
But also the question-- I
mean, if you think about this,

00:29:19.003 --> 00:29:21.710
if your center becomes
instead of food decomposition,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.220
but broccoli.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:23.930
The broccoli.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.480
Right?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.902
Looking at that broccoli.

00:29:25.902 --> 00:29:27.360
So many questions
come out of that.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.010
Like when is it
not OK to eat it?

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.850
It looks nasty.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.380
But is it still safe to eat it?

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.260
I'm like what's
happening in there?

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.322
And how long can I expect
my broccoli to last?

00:29:37.322 --> 00:29:39.030
There's this cool
people you might end up

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.640
wanting to talk to you.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.130
That I went to an innovation
conference last year

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.065
the-- I'll have to
look up the name.

00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:51.200
These people made this device to
be able to tell you when you're

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.885
food is rotting in your fridge.

00:29:52.885 --> 00:29:54.510
And it's an innovation
that's happening

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.885
on campus that
you could actually

00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:57.550
go talk to those people.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.490
That they've actually
really, really

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.430
thought deeply about food waste.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.540
And created a device that
attach to your fridge

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.170
to tell you like bananas
are going bad in three days.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.160
You know?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.500
And they are people on campus.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.000
So I have to think
about their name,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.625
but there's this
really cool lab that's

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:15.164
actually really exploring this
topic that you could talk to.

00:30:15.164 --> 00:30:16.580
AUDIENCE: And then
I actually just

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.231
had a random idea
that was completely

00:30:18.231 --> 00:30:20.036
unrelated to everything
I had before.

00:30:20.036 --> 00:30:22.286
Which is the concept of a
world without decomposition,

00:30:22.286 --> 00:30:23.535
and what that would look like.

00:30:23.535 --> 00:30:25.300
PROFESSOR: Why do things die?

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.360
Or sort of--

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.527
AUDIENCE: A world in which
things did not decompose.

00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:30.151
PROFESSOR: What would
that looked like?

00:30:30.151 --> 00:30:30.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.230
PROFESSOR: Which better
gets to the question,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.980
why do things die?

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.604
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:34.450
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.075
AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean things would die

00:30:36.075 --> 00:30:37.620
but then they would
just sit there.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.328
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:30:38.328 --> 00:30:39.960
Why do things decompose?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.890
AUDIENCE: And if they had
to be broken down by other

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.722
means than just
bacteria and fungi.

00:30:44.722 --> 00:30:46.180
PROFESSOR: The
decomposition cycle.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.680
Right?

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.750
AUDIENCE: Without a need for
carbon and nitrogen cycles.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.940
PROFESSOR: That's much
conceptually harder

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.280
than a concrete broccoli.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.160
But you can allude to
this in the exploration

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.045
of that broccoli.

00:30:59.045 --> 00:31:00.045
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:00.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.800
PROFESSOR: By looking at one
thing really, really deeply,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.780
you actually allow yourself the
ability to abstract from it.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.470
That-- think for a few
minutes about that broccoli.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.940
A little more.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.500
Cool

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.790
How are you doing?

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.414
AUDIENCE: After
talking to [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:17.414 --> 00:31:19.410
I realized probably
my initial idea

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:27.144
is I want to go into
talking about how

00:31:27.144 --> 00:31:28.392
we go from [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:34.380
PROFESSOR: Time?

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.378
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:35.378 --> 00:31:36.376
I will think of that.

00:31:36.376 --> 00:31:40.867
And then another topic, closely
related topic [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:45.358
The one I submitted was the
pre-conceptual time traveling.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.630
PROFESSOR: Is time
travel even possible?

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.100
Is that the question?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.330
AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.829
Not really.

00:31:50.829 --> 00:31:54.220
More along the lines of
problems with time traveling.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.658
Like for example, there's
the grandfather paradox.

00:31:56.658 --> 00:32:00.081
And then the idea and theory
of the multiverse universe.

00:32:00.081 --> 00:32:04.000
And multiverse
theory [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.820
PROFESSOR: But I mean,
even like the idea

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.480
of like is time travel possible
is a really cool concept.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.180
AUDIENCE: But it's really broad.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.680
Right?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.142
AUDIENCE: That's why I decided
not to delve into time travel,

00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:16.850
if it's possible.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.720
Rather looking at
what happened--

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.280
why concepts for then.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.310
I think maybe it's--

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.085
PROFESSOR: I think
you're still too broad.

00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:24.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.495
PROFESSOR: What-- to tell me
more about what you actually

00:32:26.495 --> 00:32:27.955
do in your studies.

00:32:27.955 --> 00:32:29.330
AUDIENCE: That's
what you think--

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.100
PROFESSOR: But
what about-- like,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.891
there's got to be
something in there that's

00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:35.802
really exciting to you
that you could explore.

00:32:35.802 --> 00:32:36.760
AUDIENCE: I mean, yeah.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.257
But I really doubt
kids would even

00:32:41.257 --> 00:32:47.110
really want to see how a
computer does information.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.631
Because mostly I do AI.

00:32:48.631 --> 00:32:51.692
So, it's lot-- It's to do
a lot with like filtering

00:32:51.692 --> 00:32:55.225
of information and deciding
what we do with our information.

00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:58.950
PROFESSOR: But I mean, this
came up with a different group.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.649
Which is when type-- filtering
information's actually

00:33:01.649 --> 00:33:02.440
really interesting.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.330
Like when I Google
something, how

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.270
does my computer
know what to send me?

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.370
That's actually a really
interesting question.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.870
Right?

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.822
If I'm using Google
Shopper, how does it know--

00:33:13.822 --> 00:33:15.030
AUDIENCE: Identify what you--

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:15.970
PROFESSOR: You know?

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.282
And explaining
that like a system.

00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:22.103
That's actually interesting.

00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:24.436
AUDIENCE: Bringing that layman
terms can be challenging.

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.720
PROFESSOR: But important.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.710
Right?

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.270
AUDIENCE: That
would be quite hard.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.395
PROFESSOR: I mean, is it
possible to pick something

00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:35.160
that you do that's conceptually
hard but to really flesh it

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.080
out to challenge yourself
to think about how

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.780
to describe that or show that.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.140
Like the train concept.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.240
A little bit hard.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.310
But I kind of got it.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.269
Right?

00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:47.685
Is there something that you
could-- something in your work

00:33:47.685 --> 00:33:49.185
that you're passionate
about and you

00:33:49.185 --> 00:33:52.730
know a lot about that
you think is actually

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.710
really useful for the
public to know, as well.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.110
AUDIENCE: That's really
hard to think about.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.186
I honestly don't
think anything's

00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:04.500
that relevant to the public.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.490
PROFESSOR: What do you want
to do with your degree?

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.989
AUDIENCE: Probably
robotics, itself.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:09.572
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:34:09.572 --> 00:34:10.960
Robots are really cool topics.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.198
So what about--
what about robots?

00:34:14.198 --> 00:34:16.300
AUDIENCE: They
contain information.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.929
Probably how they input--
how they take input

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.820
and how they decide what to do.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.300
PROFESSOR: Great this
is an awesome topic.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.319
Can you think of one
very specific question

00:34:25.319 --> 00:34:27.300
that you could
answer, ask a robot,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.040
and how it would be able to
figure out the answer it?

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.540
Yes or no?

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.524
Have you ever design a simple
robot or a simple machine?

00:34:35.524 --> 00:34:37.420
AUDIENCE: Really rudimentary.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.909
PROFESSOR: Or like is there
any way of very simply showing

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.789
how a machine makes a decision?

00:34:50.303 --> 00:34:51.719
I'm trying-- you
know what I mean?

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.094
What I'm trying
to push you to do

00:34:53.094 --> 00:34:55.250
is think about it robotics
were exciting to you,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.295
is there one teeny--

00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:58.530
AUDIENCE: The concept behind
them are quite abstract.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.430
That's the thing.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.600
They're really like
mathematically behaving.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.850
That's why I'm thinking of it.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.603
I'm not sure how really
it can be brought across.

00:35:08.603 --> 00:35:12.054
Or whether is should be
brought across in that space.

00:35:12.054 --> 00:35:15.330
So I was actually exploring
something maybe a bit more.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.330
Maybe more on like a pain.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.582
I was a medic back
in the military.

00:35:22.582 --> 00:35:24.760
So dealt with a lot.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.913
Like every day we
see people coming in

00:35:26.913 --> 00:35:28.296
and looking for pain killers.

00:35:28.296 --> 00:35:32.432
So maybe a bit more like for
people to understand better.

00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:34.515
PROFESSOR: Like do I take
and Advil or an aspirin?

00:35:34.515 --> 00:35:35.730
Like do I take a--

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.522
AUDIENCE: They're
roughly the same thing.

00:35:36.522 --> 00:35:37.021
Yeah.

00:35:37.021 --> 00:35:37.910
Something like that.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.229
What is the difference in
two kinds of medication?

00:35:40.229 --> 00:35:42.020
And why do we take one
more than the other?

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.936
But we just assume more
useful than the other.

00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:45.370
I don't think so.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.355
It's more like--
it's like doctor, MD.

00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:48.855
You know?

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:49.355
OK.

00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.320
A bit more explanatory
around there.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.790
So I was thinking of
something like that.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.445
PROFESSOR: But I'd hate to use
to not talk about robots when

00:35:57.445 --> 00:35:59.070
that's what you're
studying, and that's

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.126
what you're passionate about,
just because it's hard.

00:36:03.126 --> 00:36:05.450
AUDIENCE: I don't think
it's because its hard.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.360
I mean, if it were to be an
instructional video for someone

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.740
at my level, maybe
it's not un-doable.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.570
PROFESSOR: But is there
anything within robots

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.891
that you think is a cool idea.

00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:17.390
Simple.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.330
A simple, simple,
simple something.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.690
So not everything about
how a robot works.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:27.714
But even how to get-- just
something very simple.

00:36:27.714 --> 00:36:29.130
I don't know your
world old enough

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.730
to be able to help you think
about what is that thing.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.690
But I challenge you to
think for a few minutes

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:39.760
really deeply about
what within the robots

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.580
is a simple enough concept?

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.760
Do you have an idea?

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.850
AUDIENCE: I actually--
just listening in

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.110
and I know something I
think is really cool.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.118
PROFESSOR: What?

00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:49.460
AUDIENCE: I very basic
on-- but this might still

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.412
be too complex.

00:36:50.412 --> 00:36:53.101
But probability based maps.

00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:54.934
AUDIENCE: Probability-based
maps as in based

00:36:54.934 --> 00:36:58.190
on the probability of
what-- something happening

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.610
that you predict what that is?

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.062
AUDIENCE: Like
when the robot has

00:37:02.062 --> 00:37:05.934
to construct a map of
an area it doesn't know.

00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:06.902
AUDIENCE: Oh, mapping.

00:37:06.902 --> 00:37:08.354
Yuck.

00:37:08.354 --> 00:37:09.806
Not my favorite project.

00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:10.774
Done before.

00:37:10.774 --> 00:37:12.649
Yeah.

00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:14.440
PROFESSOR: But if you
can think-- maybe you

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.030
brainstorm for a
second about robots

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.267
to see if you can get narrow
enough that it's a concept.

00:37:22.267 --> 00:37:24.600
PROFESSOR: I mean, I think
that there's a seedling here.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.272
Right?

00:37:25.272 --> 00:37:29.850
But like what is the
relate-ability and the drama

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.906
that's hooking people in?

00:37:30.906 --> 00:37:31.406
Right?

00:37:31.406 --> 00:37:33.194
Because I personally
think that it's

00:37:33.194 --> 00:37:36.042
fascinating that we live in
the 21st century with all

00:37:36.042 --> 00:37:37.270
these super computers.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.261
Yet this seemingly
basic problem of you

00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:42.892
have constraints x, y, z.

00:37:42.892 --> 00:37:45.390
You can only work
four hours in the day.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.650
You need to make chairs and
you need to make tables.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.100
What's the optimal number of
chairs and tables to make?

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.210
Like, that seems like a question
that we would be able to solve.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.250
And the fact that we
theoretically actually can't is

00:37:59.250 --> 00:37:59.750
interesting.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.551
Except there's not enough
at stake in that example.

00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:03.051
Right?

00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:05.973
Like people will say,
oh, we lose a couple

00:38:05.973 --> 00:38:07.260
cents on making chairs.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.210
Like, that's no big deal.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.790
But if you say something like,
because integer programs can't

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.790
be solved right
now, this is what's

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:20.180
preventing us from knowing--
like this is the reason, or one

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.312
of the reasons why
companies can only

00:38:23.312 --> 00:38:28.510
achieve like certain profit
margins, for instance.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.315
What would happen if we
can solve integer programs?

00:38:31.315 --> 00:38:35.540
Like what would happen
to humanity, I guess?

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.908
You know?

00:38:36.908 --> 00:38:37.702
AUDIENCE: Hm.

00:38:37.702 --> 00:38:38.660
PROFESSOR: Do you know?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.402
I mean, I don't know.

00:38:40.402 --> 00:38:43.755
AUDIENCE: It's just
means that-- when

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:45.756
they say you can't
solve a problem,

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:49.632
just saying that you
can't solve is easier

00:38:49.632 --> 00:38:53.790
than the-- you
actually can solve it.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.870
By the way to solve
it is to just go

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.900
through every single
point on the graph

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.400
PROFESSOR: So it's
very inefficient.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.650
AUDIENCE: It's just complete--

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.503
PROFESSOR: So like it limits
us to the types of problems

00:39:03.503 --> 00:39:04.044
we can solve.

00:39:04.044 --> 00:39:05.466
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:05.466 --> 00:39:07.840
AUDIENCE: You can solve it
for like very small variables.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.930
Like in this case,
it's two variables.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.834
So you can solve it.

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:10.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.550
But you can't solve until
you proof the problems.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.285
AUDIENCE: The more
variables than-- actually I

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:15.410
was mentioning this before.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:19.175
I think it's called
it n problem.

00:39:19.175 --> 00:39:19.800
AUDIENCE: What?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.860
You know how you were saying as
long as the number of variables

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.225
increased, the number of times
you must try exponentially

00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:30.000
that you can't really
solve the problem.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.773
AUDIENCE: There's a
concept called NPI.

00:39:32.773 --> 00:39:34.220
Or NP.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.895
So it's about
categorizing a problem.

00:39:36.895 --> 00:39:39.320
How difficult a problem is.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.497
And if it's harder
than this problem--

00:39:41.497 --> 00:39:42.830
PROFESSOR: I think that's very--

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:47.522
AUDIENCE: Like problem in the
world can be made into a type

00:39:47.522 --> 00:39:49.447
of problem called a--
I'm forgetting like--

00:39:49.447 --> 00:39:50.822
PROFESSOR: You
should write this.

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:53.456
I think like maybe this
might be specific enough.

00:39:53.456 --> 00:39:54.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.120
This sounds really-- because--

00:39:56.120 --> 00:41:48.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.310
PROFESSOR: You don't have
to baby anything down

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.130
for the audience.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:56.400
You know what I mean?

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.627
Like you don't have to talk
to them like they're ten.

00:43:58.627 --> 00:44:00.960
AUDIENCE: Because that helps
encourage the conversations

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.850
afterward, too.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.650
Because like when I watch
a video about something

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.640
that I'm unfamiliar with,
if I want to learn more

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.980
I'll go out and search the
words that I don't know.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.580
Like as you with
the sixth graders,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.360
maybe they kept
asking questions.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.050
If they're curious
about something

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.680
they'll keep wanting
to know about things.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.889
And so-- and they're
are a lot more intel--

00:44:22.889 --> 00:44:24.680
you think sixth grade
was way too long ago.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.320
But they were very like
they're actually intelligent.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.430
They're actually curious.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:33.220
So you don't want
to take out things

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.800
that you're saying
just because you

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.970
think it's too
intelligent for them,

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.710
or it's too far
above their level.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.160
Because if you
transition well into it,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.970
if you script it properly, and
do the proper build up-- here's

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.380
your introduction.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.910
Now these are the details
I'm going to talk about.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.350
Then they'll remember
some of those details,

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.079
and look up the things that
they still want to know.

00:44:55.079 --> 00:44:57.120
AUDIENCE: Is it OK if we
just use the vocabulary,

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.549
but instead of the-- because to
say what a problem can become

00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:02.590
two separate [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.144
Like a lot of--

00:45:04.144 --> 00:45:04.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:08.640
So for tonight's
assignment, we're

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.540
going to have you
guys just write

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.360
a rough draft of a script.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.630
And at this point,
I think it's OK

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:18.690
if you want to err on the side
of having too much jargon.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.390
That's OK.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.093
Because George and I are going
to workshop all the scripts

00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:21.910
with you tomorrow.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.880
And we'll--

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.270
It's always a fine balance.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.651
Because you don't want to
sit and define everything.

00:45:26.651 --> 00:45:27.150
Right?

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.441
Like, it's OK to
challenge your audience.

00:45:29.441 --> 00:45:33.120
You don't want to alienate
them by talking in a language

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.630
that they don't understand.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:35.440
Right?

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.910
So it's a balance between that.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:40.390
I think for tonight, we want
you just like get something

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.500
on paper.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.910
And so don't get too
stressed about that.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.290
Really focus on what
the overarching story's

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:47.990
going to be.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.573
AUDIENCE: This is
day two of the class

00:45:49.573 --> 00:45:53.155
and scripts take like a long
time to write and refine and--

00:45:53.155 --> 00:45:54.530
PROFESSOR: So
we're not expecting

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.488
perfection or anything.

00:45:57.502 --> 00:45:59.960
AUDIENCE: I'm just concerned
about like something like this

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.610
because there's no
like visual elements

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.760
like what you were saying.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.516
PROFESSOR: So do you want me to
show you the computer-- Or have

00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:05.850
you see the computer?

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:06.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.280
I've seen-- You're
talking about the one

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.980
where he puts like
these pin balls.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.476
PROFESSOR: With the balls.

00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:08.976
Yeah.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.580
I don't know any videos
on top of my head.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.110
But what you might
want to try doing

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.570
is just looking on
YouTube for maybe

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.356
like VSauce of
Veritasium videos that

00:46:24.356 --> 00:46:26.410
were about computer
engineering and see

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.090
what they used visually.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:32.440
Sometimes it's just their
persona like on screen.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.312
VSauce does that
a lot because he

00:46:34.312 --> 00:46:36.310
talks a lot about
psychological concepts

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.090
that are sort of
hard to visualize.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.410
And it's just him
on screen talking.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.750
He's just visually
engaging that way.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:45.250
I do agree.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.130
This is going to be
hard to-- it's going

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.370
to be hard to visualize.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.290
But maybe this is a place
where animations could help.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:59.730
And I always think animation
should be used sparingly.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.560
People have a tendency
to rely on animation

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.380
because think it's like
cheaper, or easier to make.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.749
And when Josh come in,
maybe he and I and you

00:47:08.749 --> 00:47:11.290
can talk a little bit more about
how you would implement that

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.430
exactly.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:17.914
But having a person with just
an animated overlay like you

00:47:17.914 --> 00:47:19.580
saw at the beginning
of that video, that

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.770
can be a really simple
solution to a way

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:27.180
to engage people visually.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.915
But I think the idea
is-- personally,

00:47:28.915 --> 00:47:31.834
I think the idea is
very fascinating.

00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:37.780
The notion that we live in
a world where we think we've

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.150
achieved so much
technological prowess.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:46.500
But a problem that seems so
basic like that understanding

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.370
how to solve four,
five, six things

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.350
is actually incredibly
challenging.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.770
And this is why.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.175
This is the thing that we can
conceptualize in our minds

00:47:57.175 --> 00:47:58.127
as human.

00:47:58.127 --> 00:47:59.960
But when you try to get
a computer to do it,

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.240
like it's actually impossible.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.870
It's impossible.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.340
I went to this talk
awhile back given

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:15.560
by one of the guys who runs the
Humanoid Robots Group at MIT.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.130
And he was saying
how it's so hard

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:20.754
to program a humanoid
robot, a bi-pedal robot

00:48:20.754 --> 00:48:22.720
to walk like a human behaves.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.940
And it's because
we walk every day.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.560
Right?

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.430
And we don't think
anything of it.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.600
But to model the
movement of your knee

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.820
bending and putting
your foot down,

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.190
it's actually possible
to mathematically model

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.736
with a precision of reality.

00:48:40.736 --> 00:48:42.611
And I don't remember
the exact math about it.

00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.360
But I remember hearing
this notion that

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.260
like there's no way in math
for us to model something

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.080
that we do in reality every day.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.920
Right?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.510
So even if we create like the
world's biggest super computer,

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.810
a robot is never going come
close to what the human body

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.060
can achieve in their sleep.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:02.560
You know?

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.540
And I thought that was
such an interesting concept

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.150
that humans are still
like so complex,

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.885
even with all the advances
we've made in robotics.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.510
And that was a
theme that we tried

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:22.350
hit in one of our
episodes, actually.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.230
Does that help a little bit?

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.120
I don't know.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.335
Maybe you just have
more questions.

00:49:28.335 --> 00:49:31.209
So at the end of
the whole treatise,

00:49:31.209 --> 00:49:35.520
we each will come with
a video and post it

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.970
PROFESSOR: Mhm.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.520
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.950
It'll be great.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.704
AUDIENCE: Can I just picture--

00:49:41.704 --> 00:49:43.045
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:47.710
AUDIENCE: So I mean, I
have one of an algorithm.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.503
And like the
simplest algorithm I

00:49:49.503 --> 00:49:52.230
can think of this is one search.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.841
So I was just thinking
like wal-- You know, wal--

00:49:54.841 --> 00:49:55.840
or whatever you call it.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.730
Where is Waldo?

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.980
PROFESSOR: Oh, Where is Waldo?

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:02.605 --> 00:50:06.680
So like just-- it would
probably be like just some guy

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.930
just hiding in the building.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.660
And then he'll be like, what's
the best way to find Waldo?

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.970
Then we'll just
be running around.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:13.470
Row

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.236
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:15.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
like-- so first wave,

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.090
open every door
in the university

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.180
and you just keep
going that way.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:18.888
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:18.888 --> 00:50:21.510
AUDIENCE: Then there's another
way where you keep going up.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.881
Yeah but then I start to
realize that the energy might

00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:26.130
break down somewhere half way.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:32.330
Because the algorithm
on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:35.140
was a binary search which
is just like, you cut half.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.960
And then you see whether,
is Waldo on the right side

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.894
or the left side?

00:50:38.894 --> 00:50:40.060
And then you cut half again.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.032
And less, and less.

00:50:41.032 --> 00:50:43.950
PROFESSOR: I think
that's very interesting.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:49.332
What is the final application
of search algorithms?

00:50:49.332 --> 00:50:50.040
AUDIENCE: Google.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.430
PROFESSOR: Like Google?

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:51.055
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:51.055 --> 00:50:52.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.845
I think as long as you relate
it back to the big picture

00:50:55.845 --> 00:50:58.069
of like why that's
such an awesome thing.

00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:59.610
Because what you
don't want happening

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:01.400
is people to think
like, OK, cool.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.155
I get that.

00:51:02.155 --> 00:51:03.030
It's a binary search.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.404
He split things
in half and half.

00:51:04.404 --> 00:51:05.490
So what?

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:06.456
Like why should I care?

00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:06.942
Right?

00:51:06.942 --> 00:51:07.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:09.055
PROFESSOR: You should
care because it's

00:51:09.055 --> 00:51:13.915
like what drives the most
used website in the world.

00:51:13.915 --> 00:51:15.920
And I think relating
it back to that--

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.350
like that's what we tried to
do with the switches video.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.720
Is like, OK I get
that the billiard ball

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.070
hit with the switch on or off.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.866
But we tied it back
at the very end

00:51:25.866 --> 00:51:29.845
to say like this
toy has 20 switches

00:51:29.845 --> 00:51:32.565
but most computer have
like billions of switches.

00:51:32.565 --> 00:51:34.930
And that's what makes
a semi-conductor.

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:38.400
And that's what makes every
modern electronic possible.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.860
As long as you relate back to
the big picture, to the thing

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.800
that people relate to, the
thing that people use every day.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.523
I think that can be powerful.

00:51:48.523 --> 00:51:49.064
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.455
PROFESSOR: I mean, I also-- I
like this path in GPS thing.

00:51:54.455 --> 00:51:58.360
Like how exactly
does a GPS work?

00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.950
How do you find your way?

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.520
You know?

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.250
Knowing what-- knowing
your location in GPS?

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.665
I know but I was-- like
mapping a path, that's

00:52:07.665 --> 00:52:08.830
a different problem.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:09.600
PROFESSOR: OK

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:09.985
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:09.985 --> 00:52:10.484
GPS--

00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:13.390
PROFESSOR: It's like how
does Google Maps know?

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.504
PROFESSOR: We are
about out of time.

00:52:17.504 --> 00:52:19.295
Maybe we should get
everyone back together.

00:52:19.295 --> 00:52:20.128
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:52:20.128 --> 00:52:20.720
Sorry.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.000
Thank you, Danny.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.858
PROFESSOR: I don't
have too much to say.

00:52:23.858 --> 00:52:27.280
Except for just the
daily assignment.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.060
So another daily blog.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.217
Thank you all for posting your
stuff on Tumblr yesterday.

00:52:32.217 --> 00:52:34.800
Keep in mind that you don't have
to do a text post like I did.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.555
I just did that as an example.

00:52:36.555 --> 00:52:38.980
But if you guys want
to do a video blog.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.250
If you want to just vlog
on your laptop webcam,

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.720
that's totally fine.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.680
But if you end up
taking pictures

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.130
of any of the lectures,
or taking videos

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.070
during the lecture, you're
free to post those, too.

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.891
And just post them
with a hashtag day

00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:55.024
two and your Kerberos ID.

00:52:55.024 --> 00:52:56.470
All the stuff that is on Tumblr.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:59.362
I'd also do the day two thing.

00:52:59.362 --> 00:53:03.540
And then a quick 200
or 300 rough script

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.300
based on some of the
stuff we talked about now.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:11.550
Don't worry about being
too jargony in this.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:15.810
This is really about pulling
the overarching story.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.852
We're going to work out
the details of what's

00:53:17.852 --> 00:53:18.852
the best wording to use.

00:53:18.852 --> 00:53:21.212
We're going to work out
some of the minutiae a bit

00:53:21.212 --> 00:53:23.572
tomorrow during our
scripting workshop.

00:53:23.572 --> 00:53:27.866
For tonight, think about
what's the point of the video,

00:53:27.866 --> 00:53:30.860
and what the overarching
story of the video is.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.555
Those are really
the things I want

00:53:32.555 --> 00:53:34.852
you to think about tonight.

00:53:34.852 --> 00:53:36.534
If you get so
stuck, and you just

00:53:36.534 --> 00:53:39.498
can't think of
something to write,

00:53:39.498 --> 00:53:42.956
write down some facts like
I was showing earlier.

00:53:42.956 --> 00:53:44.332
Just come to class
with something

00:53:44.332 --> 00:53:45.622
that we can work with tomorrow.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.896
Because tomorrow's going to
be a really informal day.

00:53:47.896 --> 00:53:49.872
[INAUDIBLE] and I are
just going to workshop

00:53:49.872 --> 00:53:53.824
and then table read some of
this stuff that we've written.

00:53:53.824 --> 00:53:56.436
And figure out how to implement
the theoretical things

00:53:56.436 --> 00:53:58.186
that we were talking
about in the last two

00:53:58.186 --> 00:54:00.740
days in a more practical sense.

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.963
So does anyone
have any questions

00:54:02.963 --> 00:54:06.168
about those assignments?

00:54:06.168 --> 00:54:06.668
Yes.

00:54:06.668 --> 00:54:08.995
AUDIENCE: Can you also bring
back the canvas tomorrow?

00:54:08.995 --> 00:54:09.578
PROFESSOR: No.

00:54:09.578 --> 00:54:11.245
Tomorrow will just workshopping.

00:54:11.245 --> 00:54:14.154
You will need them back
at least on Friday.

00:54:14.154 --> 00:54:16.110
I'll send you guys an
email the night before

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.010
and the day we meet
in the final class.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.550
PROFESSOR: When I-- just as
something to think about.

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:24.570
When I walked around and led to
some of you guys more deeply,

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.510
I feel like a lot
of you are sort

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.690
of struggling with this
same concept of broad

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:31.270
versus detailed.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:38.420
And my two cents on it is that
by asking a broad question

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:42.560
but going very narrowly
in with one example,

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.250
you actually end up being
able to bring people back

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.200
up to that broader framework.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.880
So if you pick
something-- like we

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.470
talked about food composition.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.640
And we started
exploring further.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.870
Maybe talking about why
a piece of broccoli rots.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.960
And when is it too rotten for
me to eat that I get sick?

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.340
Is actually the
perfect focus for him

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.480
to ask all these other questions
about food composition.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.560
And that by focusing really
narrowly on that broccoli,

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.640
we actually get to ask
a lot more questions.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.290
Right?

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.440
Like with shipbuilding.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.650
Why does something
really sink or float?

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:18.970
But that question
diving really narrowly

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.800
into one scenario
of one ship sinking.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.380
And why does it do this?

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:27.030
It allows us to be able to
ask some broader questions.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.570
Why-- the braces.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.240
The opposite.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.740
Right?

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.970
I want to talk about braces
and what they do to your teeth.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.720
But all right, let's
think about if that's

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.990
a specific example, what's
the question that we're

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.990
trying to think through?

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:38.980
And I feel all into a
kind of in that place

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.110
right now where you're trying
to figure out what specific

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:46.530
story do I tell in order to get
these bigger, bigger concepts?

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.120
The narrower you are
in that microcosm,

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.550
the easier it is
to extrapolate out.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:56.240
Because it lets you really
dive deeply into that topic.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.670
So if you have a really,
really broad topic still,

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:01.100
see if you can get
it really narrow.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.330
And then from that it allows
you to get broad again.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.380
If that makes sense.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.970
PROFESSOR: And that's
why I personally

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:08.890
like going with the
whole just trying

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:11.950
to list out as many facts as
I can with this snot thing.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:15.120
Because it was just sort
of, snot is awesome.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.780
OK.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.990
Like, you know,
why is it awesome?

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.530
What does that even mean?

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.540
And so I'm listing out
all these specific things

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.030
that people study about it.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:27.680
And that helped me delve
into the tangible examples

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.480
that I gave.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.490
That allowed me, at
the end, to go back

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:34.030
out to the story of
this material that

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:37.679
protects you every day,
and is amazing and awesome.

00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:39.970
PROFESSOR: And I know we're
just about-- we're actually

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.110
over time, so I apologize.

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:43.440
But I realize that
some of you may not

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.110
know how to implement
Elizabeth's task of asking you

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:47.900
to actually write your script.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.040
And that may be an
overwhelming task.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.540
Is that feeling
like that right now?

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.040
Like sitting down and actually
putting something on paper,

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.290
you don't know where to start?

00:56:56.290 --> 00:57:01.430
Or do you feel like you know to
at least dump something down?

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:05.660
Sort of like you know,
Paul, colon, says this.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.170
Picture of something in here.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:08.469
Like just jot it down.

00:57:08.469 --> 00:57:09.510
Don't worry about format.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.998
Don't worry about any of that.

00:57:10.998 --> 00:57:12.870
PROFESSOR: We're going to go
over all the details tomorrow.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:13.754
We just need an idea.

00:57:13.754 --> 00:57:14.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.460
Just dump-- so when
she says script,

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.510
that word may be
intimidating right now,

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.760
because a script can
look certain ways

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.710
in different genres.

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:25.200
Like a film script looks
very different from a theater

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.830
script, versus this
kind of transcript.

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:30.060
Don't worry about anything
other than getting

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.320
some ideas on paper.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.292
And we'll deal with all
of the other stuff later.

00:57:35.292 --> 00:57:36.254
If that makes sense.

00:57:38.317 --> 00:57:40.150
PROFESSOR: And I'll
stick around afterwards,

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.960
if anyone wants to
talk specifically.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.160
Yeah?

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.101
And just upload all
that stuff to Tumblr.

00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:46.600
PROFESSOR: And we're
both available.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.150
And we're all
available via email.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.965
So if any of you are
struggling tonight,

00:57:50.965 --> 00:57:53.520
and you need bounce an
idea off of one of us,

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.170
don't hesitate to do that.

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.060
I do not check email
usually until after 8:00 PM

00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.260
when my son goes to bed.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.410
But I will respond.

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.790
So if you have a
question or anything,

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:04.470
don't hesitate to
bounce ideas off.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.970
And I do really get back to you
guys, as does-- do all of us.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.270
So that's all for today.

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.470
You guys can pack up and leave.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.930
But really just get ideas
down more than anything.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:19.345
We will help you with
everything else tomorrow.

00:58:19.345 --> 00:58:22.140
PROFESSOR: Even if drawing
is the way that helps you.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.835
Just get something down.

00:58:23.835 --> 00:58:25.210
PROFESSOR: But do
get words down.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.870
We need to have like some words.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.146
That would be great.

00:58:28.146 --> 00:58:31.264
AUDIENCE: Is the script
supposed to go on a tablet, or?

00:58:31.264 --> 00:58:31.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.300
Yeah.

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.500
PROFESSOR: Good work, guys.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.050
PROFESSOR: All right.
