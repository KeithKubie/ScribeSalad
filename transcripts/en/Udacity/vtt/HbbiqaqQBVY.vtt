00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.660
So let's take a look at this
line with negative slope and

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.380
see how we can calculate its value.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.150
First, I'm going to find two points that
the line seems to really go through.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.700
Not here, the line just passes close but
doesn't go through it, same with here.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.418
It goes through this point.

00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:18.308
And it looks like that point
has coordinates (-3, 2).

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:20.550
I could also use the point (0,
0) but I don't really want to.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's use a different one.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.360
Nope, nope, this one, and
it looks like that has coordinates 3,-2.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.761
Now when I think of how the line
changes between these points.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:38.491
Well, vertically, when calculating
the rise, it changes by, well, -4.

00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.928
It goes down four, and the run, well,
it's still going to the right, so

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:43.823
I'm going to call that
a positive number.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:45.825
And it looks like it's six.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:50.791
So if I were to calculate the slope,
I would get rise

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.653
-4 over run 6 and
that simplifies to -2/3.

00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:56.840
Now, time for you to practice.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.100
So can you tell me what's
the slope of this line?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.350
Enter your answer in these boxes,
rise over run.
