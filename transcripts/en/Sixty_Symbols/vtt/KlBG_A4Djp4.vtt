00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
i'm going to talk about where the

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
chemical elements come from if you want

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.529
something close to a symbol i'm going to

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.180
talk about the r-process and the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.560
s-process we're gonna talk about chemical

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.150
elements which means i need to venture

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.010
alarmingly close to chemistry and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.000
actually talk a little bit about the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.740
periodic table so first let me show you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.780
an astronomers periodic table which is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.560
this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.029
there are only three things in the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.170
universe as far as astronomers are

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.869
concerned there's hydrogen helium and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.789
everything else which we tend to call metals.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.939
and the fraction of each we tend to call

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.859
x y&amp;z i'm going to show you this because

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.810
it really annoys chemists but actually

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.759
to a large extent it's sort of helpful

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.350
because actually was one of the things

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.120
that astronomers broadly know is that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.040
hydrogen and helium were mainly made in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.750
the big bang and everything else was

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.399
more or less made in stars. you do it by

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.899
mass is about three-quarters hydrogen

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.300
one-quarter helium and a tiny bit of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.010
everything else, so a few percent of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.180
everything else.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.829
so these are not to scale in that sense.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.629
All right, but it turns out astronomers

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.860
do  actually know a bit more about

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.239
chemical elements and where they come

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.800
from that and in fact it's a very nice

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.629
graphic that be a little while ago that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.730
tries to summarize it. it's caused quite a lot

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.260
of discussion and debate in the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.180
astronomical community but at least  for a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.769
first approximation it kind of tells you

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.119
what's going on. and it's sort of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.740
reflects the story that I've just told

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.720
you that hydrogen and helium were made

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.220
in the big bang and pretty much

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.200
everything else was made in stars. now it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.520
turns out course that that's not true

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.810
when you start looking in detail at

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.220
things. so for example when you start

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.540
looking at all the very heavy elements,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.880
which have very short lifetimes. the only way we can

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.170
actually make that is by making them

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.390
ourselves. So anything that's made in stars has long

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.920
since decayed away so the very heavy

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.600
elements are actually human-made rather

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.280
than starmade and actually it turns out

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.540
when you look at the light into things

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.829
things are a little more complicated as

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.150
well because you've got things like

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.710
lithium and beryllium: you've got little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.450
'c's next to them here. they're actually

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.310
made through a process called cosmic ray

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.320
spallation. cosmic rays are these very high-energy

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.509
particles moving through space and when

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.920
a very high-energy particle-- it could be

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.810
an atomic nucleus-- wacks into another

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.119
particle --could be another atomic nucleus,

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.560
you can actually have fission

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.630
occurring. that the atomic nuclei can fall

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.979
apart or something which was initially a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.210
heavier element can actually be

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.799
splattered into these little bits we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.509
believe the main way of lithium and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.100
beryllium and boron get made is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.750
through that spallation process. so they

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.399
weren't actually made in stars --well at

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.899
least something heavy was probably made

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.640
in a star, but then he got smashed to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.799
pieces from cosmic ray interactions. the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.349
broad story is that hydrogen and helium made

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.940
in the Big Bang, then you have stars,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.770
stars in their center fuse lighter

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.180
elements into heavier elements because

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.350
that's how their powered. They're fusion

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.300
powered. and so you can make heavier

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.680
elements. one of the main ways you make

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.030
heavy elements in the core of a star

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.650
when you've got hydrogen turning into

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.360
helium and helium turning into carbon and so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.130
on. but that kind of gives out at iron

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.590
because once you get to iron, then making

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.360
heavier things by smashing iron nuclei

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.830
together-- it turns out that absorbs

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.840
energy rather than giving energy out. so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.550
you stop getting energy out of the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.900
process when you get to iron. and of course if

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.550
you're trying to power a star, you need to

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.830
get energy out. so stars give up once

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.780
they get to iron. and so again the simple

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.850
law in in astronomy is hydrogen and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.650
helium came in the Big Bang ,everything

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.270
up to iron was made in the centers of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.160
stars, and then everything heavier than

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.750
iron only gets made it super novae

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.880
because when a star explodes then you

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.350
have lots of energy around you can have

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.670
these very inefficient processes. you're

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.200
not trying to power star anymore so

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.370
actually you can smack things together

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.500
and create the heavier elements like

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.450
gold and all the heavier things that are

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.150
around-- get made in super novae. and if you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.820
look at this plot that's kind of true in

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.960
that if you just look at it

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.640
so we've got the green and the yellow are

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.290
stuff that's made in stars and you can

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.610
see all the lighter elements as we go

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.280
down the periodic table tend to be green in

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.310
nature till we get to about iron and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.810
then they sort of start turning more to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.489
this pinky orange color which is super

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.230
novae, and so you can see the more

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.600
massive elements tend to get made in in

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.400
supernovae. but interesting this is not

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.110
entirely true it's not like everything

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.459
stopped at iron and then suddenly

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.140
everything is made in supernovae. and in

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.430
particular if you look at these guys

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.440
here, i'm gonna have to struggle with my

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.060
command of the periodic table and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.650
chemistry in general. that barium

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.100
lanthanum and cerium you can see they're

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.480
actually made in stars but they're way

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.070
heavier than iron right. Iron's somewhere

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.900
way up here and these are what down

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.070
towards the bottom of the periodic table

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.050
and so the question is how on earth you

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.670
end up with heavy elements which clearly

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.890
aren't made in super novae but are

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.330
actually all are made in stars

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.010
somewhere along the line. and that's where

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.000
we get to this thing called the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.920
r-process in the  s-process. it's

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.330
actually quite hard to make a heavy

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.130
element because you have to take-- so if

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.150
you're gonna make a heavy element

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.380
through fusion you got to take two

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.120
fairly heavy nuclei and smack them

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.340
together and get them to stick. and heavy

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.440
nuclei have quite large charges

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.610
associated with them so you know

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.620
hydrogen only had one--

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.600
you know, one proton but by the time you get

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.130
to these heavier elements they have to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.359
have lots of protons. they have lots of

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.280
positive charge, lots of positive charge so

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.419
actually they repel each other very

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.400
effectively. so it's very hard to make

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.199
heavy elements just by smacking nuclei

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.790
together. turns out there's an easier way

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.860
to make heavier elements which is that

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.449
if you've got a neutron, the neutral

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.790
particle, then you kind of make that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.560
stick to a nucleas. so you basically

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.600
smack it into a nucleus, it'll stick and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.220
that then add to the weight of the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.750
nucleus. now you haven't actually changed

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.729
the chemical at that point because --so

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.470
chemicals that the chemical properties

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.520
of something depend on how many protons there

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.050
are on it, not how many neutrons are

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.340
on it. So adding a neutron to it just

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.050
changes the isotope of the chemical. it

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.090
doesn't actually change the chemical. but

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.669
neutrons can then decay through a

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.990
process called beta decay and the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.760
neutron basically turns into a proton

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.169
and kicks out an electron and a neutrino

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.389
in the process. so you sneak the proton

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.070
in there by the backdoor? Exactly.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.660
Without having to overcome these Coulomb

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.340
repulsions I've  managed to sneak a

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.930
an extra particle in which then

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.430
magically turns into a proton so i've

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.500
changed the element that way so it turns

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.760
out that's actually the main way. you

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.169
make these heavy elements just by adding

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.210
neutrons. and in a supernova there's

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.889
loads of neutrons around huge neutron

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.000
flux. There's a lot of everything around

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.889
a  supernaova; it's a complete mess.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.150
and so you can have a nucleus and you

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.979
can just basically bombard whole load of

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.110
neutrons into it and then it'll end up a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.880
very heavy isotope of whatever it

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.139
started with but then those neutrons

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.169
will go: bing-bing-bing-bing and will beta decay down into

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.520
protons so you can end up creating

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.010
heavier elements that way. and that works

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.450
great you can actually you know it

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.130
decays once and that moves at one place

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.389
at the periodic table because you added

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.889
a proton effectively and then it decays

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.150
again and so you can kind of walk your

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.919
way up the periodic table that way.

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.229
the problem is that sooner or later in

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.000
that process you reach a stable isotope,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.710
one which will just stay there forever.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.720
so it will decay for a while and then

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.970
it'll stick and that means that anything

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.710
kind of further upstream from that

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.660
nucleus you can't make anymore because

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.400
it you've got stuck at that point where

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.620
it's actually it's ...

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.729
everything's decayed as far as its going

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.169
to; nothing else is going to happen to it

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.820
after that so what I've just described

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.560
as a thing called the r-process, or

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.910
standing for rapid because you added a

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.680
whole bunch of neutrons very rapidly. now

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.539
there are other chemicals that that

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.250
exists in the universe that that are

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.990
kind of blocked by this process that

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.220
they wouldn't actually form from this

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.960
process. and the only way you can make

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.490
those is through this thing called the

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.370
s-process which is a slow process. which is

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.409
that you add a neutron, you wait for

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:29.090
it to decay,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.340
it turns into a proton (it changes it) and

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.780
then you add another neutron, and you

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.340
wait for decay and it turns into the

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.139
next element up. and that way you you

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.460
don't have this kind of blocking effect

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.410
because you can always just had another

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.940
neutron and then it will decay and so on

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.500
so through that process you can get to a

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.900
whole other set of elements through this

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.430
thing called the s- process that don't get

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.560
made through the r-process, but you can...

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.150
there other decay chains that will

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.040
get you to these s-process elements. but

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.110
in a supernova everything happened very

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.460
quickly because you got this massive

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.980
neutron flux and then it's all over in,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.940
you know, hours.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.880
[Brady] so you only get one go to add a neu--

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.480
[Merrifield] Exactly and these decays if

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.160
you do this is s-process, you know you

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.180
added --you add a neutron sometimes these

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.889
decays can take weeks months years

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.040
thousands of years and so actually

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.500
you're never gonna-- that s-process is

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.820
never going to work in a supernova

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.260
because you've added one, and by the time

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.690
it's decayed to the next thing along, the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.130
whole supernova's over. and so you're not

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.900
going to add any more neutrons. and so

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.860
things which you've made through this

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.220
s-process can't be made in supernovae. so

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:25.610
we have to look somewhere else where

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.260
there is this process where you can have

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.510
neutrons things but over a much longer

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.470
period of time

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.000
tens years hundred years thousands of

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.669
years rather than all in one go.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.500
and it turns out that in the late stages

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.930
of some stars' lives, they actually

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.340
produce quite a lot of free neutrons.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.870
some of the late-stage burning things

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.250
that when you're burning carbon into

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.630
heavier elements and we need to do you

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.830
actually get liberated quite a few

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.660
neutrons along the way. and so there are

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.280
free neutrons over the hundreds of

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.289
thousands of years that the the star is

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:52.639
going through this phase of its lifetime.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.610
kind of ... bimbling around within the

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.990
star which means that you can actually

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.060
then, over time, add neutrons with these

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.650
s-process. these elements here that i was

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.180
talking about before: barium, lanthanum,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.610
cerium, are only made through this  s-process.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.320
and that means that the only way they

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.930
can possibly be made is that was

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.870
probably from a previous generations of

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.030
stars. there was a fairly heavy element

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.550
in the in the star, like iron or

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.010
something like that, which then had an--

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.560
late in the lifetime of the star, had

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.240
these this sort of free Neutron flux

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.669
bumping into it over tens of thousands,

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.050
hundreds of thousands of years, which

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.729
would through this s-process turn it into

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:29.780
one of these heavier elements like

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.099
barium. is quite interesting that that

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.060
whenever you get some Barium, you know

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.260
you know pretty much how that

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.440
has to have formed. then it's actually quite

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.030
a long story. [This is a rod of barium

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.620
we've got in here.] that must have been a

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.150
first generation of stars that went

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.980
supernovae, threw out lots of heavy

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.170
elements, that that will produce through

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.030
this r-process. but that wouldn't have

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.590
made the barium. then some of those heavy

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.050
elements were then incorporated into a

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.030
later generation of stars, relating the

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.250
lifetime of that particular star. there

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.290
was a strong one-- Neutron flux within the

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.370
star which would then through this

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.530
s-process get it up to these these heavy

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.120
elements like barium, and lanthanum .

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.100
[Brady] Quite a journey some of those atoms have been on

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.930
It really is and I you know it's kind of

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.400
astounding that just by sort of

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.110
understanding the nuclear physics and

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.730
how these various chemical elements get

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.320
made you can actually trace... you know

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.340
when you've got one of these elements,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.660
you can actually look at it and say well

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.000
I know how this must be formed. and it's

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.170
quite --as you say it's a kind of

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.640
long, involved story and some of these

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.140
elements.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.060
you should be able to file a

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.320
little bit of the barium onto this foil

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.500
ok I can see little bits coming off actually

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.730
they're very very small
