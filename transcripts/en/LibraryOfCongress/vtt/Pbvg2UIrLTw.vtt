00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Szalai:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:08.610
I'm Jennifer Szalai and I'm
the nonfiction book critic

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.300
at the New York Times.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.420
The Times is proud to
have partnered this year

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.640
with the Library of Congress
for the National Book Festival.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.660
And we'd like to thank
everyone for coming

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.740
out on this Labor Day weekend

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.090
for an event that's not only a
celebration, but also, I think,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.440
an opportunity to
think about the role

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.590
of books in our culture.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.050
At a time when the news cycle
has gotten faster and faster

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.880
with a seemingly endless
supply of hot takes,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.000
reading books can enrich
not only our lives,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.390
but also our understanding of
the lives of others as well

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.660
as the world in which we live.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500
To that end, it is
my great pleasure

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.510
to introduce Jon Meacham.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.820
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.910
So before Jon comes up to
the stage, I should say many

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.090
of you know Jon already through
his presidential biographies.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.060
He's written books about George
H.W. Bush, Thomas Jefferson

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.870
as well as FDR and FDR's
special relationship

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.880
with Winston Churchill.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.030
In addition to all of these,
Jon has also written, of course,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.450
a Pulitzer Prize winning
biography of Andrew Jackson,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.400
a complicated figure
to say the least

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.220
who consider himself
an embodiment

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.550
of the people's will even
though his definition

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.130
of the people was
ruthlessly exclusionary.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.900
Jon's 2018 book about Jackson,
"American Lion" doesn't flinch

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.930
from recounting Jackson's
full record.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.680
And like Jon's other books,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.890
it showcases Jon's
background as a journalist too.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410
Jon was a long time staffer

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.170
at Newsweek eventually
becoming its editor.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.600
In fact, the trajectory
of his career shows

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.810
that fast paced journalism

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
and gradual deliberate
history aren't

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.900
as disconnected as
they might seem.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.770
History after all is not only
a thing of the past, it is--

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.780
it also has great and
often startling relevance

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.270
for our present laying
the foundation

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.500
for how we got to
where we are now.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.150
While Jon's books are erudite
and carefully researched,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.110
reflecting undoubtedly
a lot of time spent

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.450
in the historical archives,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.830
he has the experience journalist
gifts for accessibility.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.410
And even though I wouldn't
say his books are short,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.980
he clearly makes a point of
keeping his storytelling sharp.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.780
More recently, as a
contributing writer

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.770
to the New York Times
book review,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.240
he's been writing a column
called "The Long View"

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.890
in which he looks back at books
to speak to our current moment.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.720
He often finds angles
that are surprising.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.980
For instance, a year ago,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.220
after Hillary Clinton
published her best selling book,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.270
"What Happened", Jon
examined other memoirs

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.780
by one time presidential
candidates

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.980
that weren't triumphant
stories about winning elections

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.470
but were instead more candid
reflections about losing them.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.010
His newest book, "The Soul
of America" might seem

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.330
like a departure for him in the
sense that it's not a biography

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.640
that closely follows
the life and times

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.910
of a particular president,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.870
rather it's a sweeping
consideration

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.370
of American history over
the past 200 some years.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.100
But then it makes sense in a way
that someone like Jon who writes

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.090
about the complicated
souls of individuals,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.050
chronicling their
achievements as well

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.380
as their failures would now take

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.210
on the complicated
soul of the country.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.980
"The Soul of America"
is an argument

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.120
for hope and fraught times.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.320
And as he makes clear, hope is
not the same as complacency.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.390
But you don't have
to take it from me.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.510
Please join me in
welcoming Jon Meacham.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:19.030
[ Applause ]

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.330
&gt;&gt; Jon Meacham: Thank you.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.110
When Jennifer was talking,
I was reminded of his--

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.990
sort of running through the
various dead white men I've

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.290
written about.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.960
And when I was finishing
Jefferson,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.100
I came the kitchen one
day and my six-year-old

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.360
at that time said,
how's that book

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.100
about George Jefferson going?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.420
And I said, you know, Sherman
Hemsley is an important figure,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.200
but I'm not sure we
need a full biography.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.500
Thank you all.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.470
I love being at the
National Book Festival.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.780
And I'm going to tell
you a story that I told

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.690
when I had the honor of
speaking at Mrs. Bush's funeral,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.410
a few months ago,
because this is the scene

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.810
of really what St.
Augustine had in mind

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.010
when he talked about humility.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.470
Ten years ago, I was here to
talk about Andrew Jackson,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.120
and I was on my way, I was
on the mall then outdoors.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.010
And I was on my way to
give a talk like this.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.780
And a woman ran up to me,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.090
which doesn't happen
enough, or ever, actually.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.100
And she said, oh
my god, it's you.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.350
And I said, well, yes, you know.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.930
Existentially speaking,
that's hard to argue with.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.090
You got to love a room
on Labor Day weekend

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.860
where you can use
existential as an adverb.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.510
Way to go, way to go.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.390
[ Applause ]

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.990
And she said, I just-- I
admire your work so much,

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.040
it's meant so much to
me and to my family.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.960
We wait right here, I want
you to sign your new book.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.260
And I said, yes, ma'am.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.140
And I stood there thinking this
is exactly the way the world is

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.440
supposed to work.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.230
Women are supposed
to run up to you.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.800
They're supposed to admire you.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.100
This is it.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.640
Perfect. Hand to god,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.970
she brought back John
Grisham's latest--

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.990
oh, so, totally true story.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.640
So I signed it, right?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.190
And so whenever I hear
something nice said about me

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.750
like what Jennifer said,
I've realized that somewhere

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.180
in America, there's a
woman with a forged copy

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.690
of the "Runaway Jury".

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.070
But the story does not end.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.650
So that was a Saturday
like today.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.850
And so, I left the Book
Festival, I got on a plane,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.480
I was writing my
biography at that time

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.020
of George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.800
And I flew up to Maine
to see the Bush's.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.850
And we were sitting-- for some
reason it's just the three of us

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.950
at lunch that Sunday, which
was almost unheard of because,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.250
you know, George Bush's view

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.640
of life was it was one
long reunion mixer.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.700
You know, usually
the Oak Ridge Boys

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.500
and the Pope would
be there, you know?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.070
And he would be more interested
in the Oak Ridge Boys.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.990
And I told the story.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.250
And Mrs. Bush looks across
the table and I'm kind

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.040
of expecting some motherly
reassurance, you know.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.760
She said, well, how do you think
poor John Grisham would feel,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.420
you know?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.000
He's a very handsome man.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.940
So, it was not a good weekend
for me, but I'm thrilled

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.360
to be here and we'll
try it one more time.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.310
Thank you first, very quickly.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.030
Thank you all truly
for being here.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.710
You are citizens of the
Republic of Letters.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.520
And if the last three years
has taught us anything,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.880
it's that the Republic of
Letters has a hell of a lot

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.510
to teach the American
Republic, so thank you.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.370
[ Applause ]

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.860
So I am asked all the
time because of what I do

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.980
for a living, has it
ever been like this?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.090
And one of the quick answers
people like to say is, well,

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.760
isn't he like Jackson?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.750
I'm going to try to
play the Voldemort game,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.050
let's see if we can do this.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.650
You know, is he like Jackson?

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.640
And I knew Andrew Jackson.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.860
Yeah, he was a friend of mine.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.220
Not really.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:27.820
So, it-- so quick story, so in
2017, the incumbent is coming

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.260
down to Nashville, Tennessee
where I lived to lay a wreath

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.760
at Jackson's tomb,
Jackson's 250th birthday.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.460
We had paint ball duels in town.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.770
It was great and we loved it.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.170
And so, I was thinking, you
know, I should do something.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.040
And because whenever presidents
talk about their predecessors,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.520
it's really interesting to keep
track because presidents see

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.170
as they wish to be seen.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.230
So whenever you hear a president
talk about someone put that in

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.990
that psychological
test, you know,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.140
when Jack Kennedy said this is
the greatest gathering of talent

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.850
since Thomas Jefferson dined
alone the Nobel Prize dinner,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.150
what he was really kind

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.950
of saying is isn't it very
Jeffersonian of me to think

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.380
to invite all of
you here, you know?

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.820
So FDR saw the New
Deal as a struggle

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.290
between the Jacksonian
Democrats against the tyrants

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.720
of Wall Street like
the bank war.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.240
It's a fun game to play.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.050
But anyway, so President
Trump is--

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.850
had to slip it, had to do it,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.790
it's key to the story,
I promise.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.820
So he's coming down and so I'm
sitting at home, all right,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.120
I should do something.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.460
So I wrote an open
letter to the president

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.480
for the local newspaper
and basically saying,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.960
if you're going to
embrace Andrew Jackson,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.190
don't just embrace
the crazy parts.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.650
And there are plenty of crazy
parts to embrace, right?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.260
Jackson once said that his
only two regrets in public life

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.590
or that he had not hung Henry
Clay the Speaker of the House

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.170
and shot John C. Calhoun,
his own vice president.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.150
We know as of today that the
next person who thought that way

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.490
about their running mate
was in fact John McCain.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.290
So--

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.380
[ Applause ]

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.540
-- I cleared that with
Senator McCain years ago.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.340
I've been telling that
for years, don't worry.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.740
So if you're going to
embrace Jackson, I wrote,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.410
embrace for all his
sins and weaknesses.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.240
He did believe that we
were one great family.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.320
We would fight under the
same roof, but we needed

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.070
to remain a continental nation.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.100
Jackson also was a
great negotiator,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.740
he understood his weaknesses,
he made his vices into virtues,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.680
more formidable figure.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.180
By the time he became
president, he'd been a lawyer,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.900
a prosecutor, a judge, the first
congressman from Tennessee,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.200
twice a senator, a general,
had won the popular vote

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.660
but lost the electoral college
and lost it in the house

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.960
and had run for president.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.260
He respected the rule of law.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.350
He respected the established
constitutional order.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.850
So, I wrote this
as an open letter.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.650
And it had no effect,
whatever, of course.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.060
And the next day I'm walking
into lunch, true story.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.430
And my phone rings and
it was George H.W. Bush,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.730
my most recent subject.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.670
He'd spent a lot of time in
the hospital that winter.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.910
And so his staff was
giving him stuff to read

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.210
and they'd given him this piece.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.760
And he called me and
said, how you doing?

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.910
I said, I'm-- The key to doing
George H.W. Bush, by the way,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.860
as Dana Carvey once said
is Mr. Rogers is trying

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.160
to be John Wayne.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.460
How you doing?

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.760
I said, I'm fine Mr. President.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.060
How do you doing?

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.770
I'm fine. He said, I read your
letter to Jackson, I thought,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.440
oh, the old boys
losing it, right?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.580
I mean he's 93, he's
been in the hospital,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.200
he thinks I'm writing
letters to dead people.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.500
I should do something.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.800
So I said, thank you, sir.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.350
I'm glad you're doing better.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.130
You know, actually it was a
letter to Trump about Jackson.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.140
Without missing a beat,
the old man said, yeah,

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.510
but Jackson will
pay more attention.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:03.920
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.220
So he's fine.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.440
Mark him off your worry list.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.090
So analogies are perilous,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.350
but I want to talk today
really in two parts.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:24.170
One is how I do think
this moment represents a

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.070
manifestation, a
vivid manifestation,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.780
and in some ways an extreme one
of perennial American forces.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:40.560
The past is not cultural Zoloft,
right, it's not a bedtime story,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.830
but it's also absolutely
essential to create a sense

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.920
of perspective and proportion

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.660
because if we don't know what's
come before and know it truly,

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.960
know it not as we have come
to remember it but know it

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.770
as it happened to the people

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.770
who were living the
challenges of their time.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.950
If we don't have
that, we do two things

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.590
that I think are worth avoiding.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.620
One is we do a disservice
to the people

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.960
who built the nation
we want to protect.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.110
If we act as though progress
was somehow inevitable,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.020
tell that to John Lewis,
tell that to Rosa Parks,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.890
tell that to Martin Luther
King, tell that to Alice Parks

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.490
or Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
or Susan B. Anthony,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.170
or Frederick Douglass,
or Harriet Tubman,

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.790
or Sojourner Truth, tell them

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.900
that this was all
going to work out.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.300
So we need to remember
history to honor those

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.290
who gave the ultimate price

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.540
so that we would have
something worth defending.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:46.430
The other is that if we act as
though history is myth that is

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.900
that everything worked
out in a land far,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.410
far away in a galaxy
far, far away,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.680
then we foreclose the
possibility of learning from it

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.150
because it feels
remote and mythic,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.430
but they were just like us.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.290
I write history and biography
not because the past was perfect

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:11.390
or more reassuring but because
it was so woefully imperfect and

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.510
yet they got through it.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.740
They made progress.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.630
And if with all their
imperfections and sins

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.940
and shortcomings and appetite
and ambition and greed

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.990
and selfishness and racism and
sexism, if for all of that,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.810
they created a more perfect
union, then surely to God,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.850
all of us driven and riven

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.000
by those same forces
can do the same.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.560
To learn from the past is
to embrace its complexity,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.470
not airbrush it,
not simplify it.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.120
It has not always
been about good

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.130
versus evil, it is sometimes.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.590
Sometimes the moral stake
is absolutely clear.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.740
But that's the exception
not the rule.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.660
A nation is defined best,
I think, when we think

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.450
of it in Augustinian terms.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.330
He wrote in the City of God
that "A nation is a multitude

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.940
of rational beings united by the
common objects of their love."

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.110
I'm going to say that again.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.990
"A multitude of rational
beings united

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.210
by the common objects
of their love."

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.700
So it's a great question.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.350
What do we love in common?

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.690
And standing here on the
anniversary of Hitler's invasion

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.610
of Poland on the day we
buried a great American Hero,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.330
on a day when just over a
third of the country approves

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.870
of what the president of
the United States is doing,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.740
on a day when the great
post-war achievement

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:50.040
of the American Century, the
building of social mobility

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.570
and a middle class is
under grave assault.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.840
On that day, this day, we
don't love enough in common.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.640
And this isn't a sermon and it's
not a homily, it's just a fact.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.130
I just saw a fascinating
statistic the other day.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.850
When Dwight Eisenhower
was president,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.960
he had an approval rating
among Democrats of 49%.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.180
Guess what President Obama's
was among Republicans, 14.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:29.260
So this is a divided
and tribal time.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.320
What I'm going to talk to
you about is not in lieu

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.710
of addressing the problems
of the era it's done

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.790
with a clear utilitarian
hope that if we understand

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.910
that the moments in
the past were difficult

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.340
and required enormous effort
and courage and sacrifice

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.160
to overcome and to create
a sustainable vision

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:02.110
and a sustainable reality, then
we can do it too not by relaxing

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.040
as Jennifer said, hope
is not complacency.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.940
My message is not we've come
through it before, so relax,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.030
it's that we've come through
it before so let's figure

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.690
out how the hell we
did it and do it again.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:20.200
And it requires witness
and resistance and protest

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.520
and in affirmative assent, an
affirmative step into the arena

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.970
to engage what Justice
Holmes called the passion

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.160
and action of our times.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.250
Theodore Roosevelt said
that the first duty

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.440
of an American citizen is
to engage in the arena.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.460
This is no time to let other
people fight your battles

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.760
because they're all our battles.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.490
So I want to talk about a
few moments that I think felt

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.550
like this and then
talk toward the end

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.980
about the characteristics that
I think are necessary both

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.840
for leaders and followers.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.160
Because let's remember, a
republic is only as good

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.110
as the sum of its parts,
the moral disposition,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.780
our dispositions of heart
and mind, individually,

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.350
have a discernible
and definitive effect

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.990
on the collective life of
a country without doubt.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.650
This is an ancient idea,
it begins with Aristotle,

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.830
it runs through Machiavelli,

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.820
Harry Truman said it I think
best in more or less our time,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.660
which is in the end, Americans
get the government they deserve.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.070
And let's be honest, politicians
are far more often mirrors

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:39.510
of who we are than they are
molders, so remember that.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.420
We dislike and we
resist political leaders

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.690
who spend their time pointing
fingers at groups instead

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.090
of pointing ahead for all of us.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:54.510
At the same time though we
have to examine ourselves

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:59.070
and force the kind of character,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.930
the kind of disposition
into the arena.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:07.760
And it's never easy
and it's never forever,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.730
but it's the way American
history has been built.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:17.290
So where have we been
like this before?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.130
My own sense-- and
again, I'm a southerner,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.470
I grew up on Missionary Ridge,
a battlefield in Tennessee is

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.870
where Arthur McArthur
won his Medal of Honor

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.080
when he was 17 years old.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.790
I went to the University of the
South in Sewanee, Tennessee.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.720
There may be one or two
of you who don't know it.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:43.600
So to frame it culturally, it's
Downton Abbey meets deliverance.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.890
So that gives you some sense.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.350
So I'm very much with Faulkner

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.920
and that the past is never
dead, it isn't even past.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.890
It's actually the only
thing Faulkner ever said

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.190
that I understand.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.120
Thank you.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.070
I just-- and peoples
say, oh, I love Faulkner.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.370
No, you don't.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.730
You think you're supposed to say
that over your latte, you know?

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.080
It's like reading Joyce.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.910
OK. Beyond Dubliners who
here understands Joyce?

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.930
Show of hands.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.050
An honest group.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.150
So, the Civil War as Shelby
Foote put it is the crossroads

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.450
of our being.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:34.510
It is the great cauldron, the
great crucible of who we are.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:41.150
The story of the war in many
ways for our purposes begins not

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.810
at Sumter but at Appomattox.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.730
Robert Penn Warren once
said that the story

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:52.820
of the Confederacy ultimately
begins its immortality began not

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.830
when Fort Sumter was fired upon

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.700
but when Lee handed
his sword to Grant.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.000
Because the emergence of the
lost cause mythology continues

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.630
to shape us to this day.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:09.070
The term itself was
coined in 1866, so barely 9

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.850
or 10 months after Appomattox.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.750
It was coined by a journalist

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.920
from Richmond named
Edward Alfred Pollard.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.540
And tell me if any of
this sounds familiar.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.870
He argued that because the war
itself was lost and the war

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.120
over slavery had been lost, that
the south should not reengage

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.790
in a force of arms, but it
should reengage in a battle

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.900
of ideas where the enemy was
declared to be the forces

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.180
of centralization
centered in Washington.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:45.150
I've seen this on certain
cable news channels.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:51.800
It was an animating
narrative that urged those

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.040
who harbored a deep
belief in white supremacy

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.730
to give them hope to
continue to fight.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.930
That is an unmistakable in
my view verdict rendered

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.230
on the historical record.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.530
It's not ideological.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.420
I should say I'm not a
partisan, I voted for Democrats,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:19.670
I voted for Republicans, I plan
to continue, but I do believe

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.820
that if we don't call them as we
see them, then we're not living

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.320
up to the best of the American
tradition and we're not living

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.210
up to the promise
and possibilities

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.120
of the life of the mind.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.870
And so, if you always try
to see a little bit of truth

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.450
on both sides, you're
probably not seeing the truth,

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.290
is my own view of this.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.540
And so, the lost cause takes off
Andrew Johnson is a disaster.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.460
I say that as a Tennessean.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.980
He is impeached.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:23:00.140
Wrong-- right thing to do, wrong
cause as a warning in that.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.470
Stay tuned.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:09.180
Coming soon to a cable
network near you.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:15.990
And he basically
argued in a state paper

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.950
in what the historian Eric
Foner recalls the most racist

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.470
statement ever written
by an American president

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.150
that black Americans
were congenitally

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.620
and genetically incapable
of self-government.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.550
And so therefore he
did everything he could

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.990
to stop the forces
of reconstruction.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.850
He vetoed the Civil Rights Bill,

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.540
he vetoed the Reconstruction
Bills,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.810
he vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau
Bills, he opposed the 14th

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.290
and 15th Amendments
to the Constitution.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.040
He was doing everything he could

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.750
as Edward Alfred Pollard
had articulated to carry

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.300
on the battle by other means.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.310
The Klan is founded in late
1865, it terrorizes the South.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:01.040
General Grant or President Grant
does the right thing early on,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.950
breaks the first Klan.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:10.280
But then a curtain descends in
1877 when Rutherford B. Hayes

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.600
and Samuel Tilden ran against
each other for president.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.470
We never talked about.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.340
The election of 1876, it's
one of the most important

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.270
in American history, because
as a part of the price

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:28.420
of that victory, the Republican
Rutherford B. Hayes agreed

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.320
to withdraw federal troops from
Florida, Alabama and Louisiana,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.640
thereby effectively ending
reconstruction in order

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.810
to secure the presidency in
an incredibly close race.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.310
That was, of course, was
decided as ever in Florida.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.360
I don't know what
it is down there.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.340
Maybe it's the humidity,
I don't know.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:53.720
But that inaugurated 90
years of a function--

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.140
of functional apartheid
in my native region.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.790
It would take Lyndon
Johnson in the 1960s

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.610
to undo the work of that period.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.990
And so when people say, you know
what, it's never been worse,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.290
there'll be some tweet.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.970
There'll probably be one
in the next few minutes,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.430
keep an eye out, you know.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.730
It's-- God, this is awful.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.330
It could never be any worse.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.780
Well, you know, not a lot

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.280
of African-Americans
say that to me.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.450
I-- Sometimes when women say
that to me, I say, you know,

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.130
women haven't voted in this
country for a 100 years yet.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.850
It's been 98.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.950
Marriage equality has
only been possible

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.910
in the United States
for three years.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.290
Things do change.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:49.560
They change too slowly,
but perspective proportion,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.040
we have to judge the present
to some extent and some degree

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.340
by what's come before.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:03.950
I think that the soul of
the country is an amalgam.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.460
In Hebrew and in Greek,
soul means breath or life.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.830
I dislike it when people say,
oh, some party that I disagree

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.520
with has captured the
soul of the country.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.570
It's not quite right in my view.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.290
In my view, the American soul
has proven itself capable

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.800
of accommodating the Ku Klux
Klan and Martin Luther King.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.810
And every era is
defined by the degree

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:36.850
to which our better angels went
out over our worst instincts.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.070
It's true again and
again and again.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.550
We are the sum of our parts.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.210
And I don't know about
you all, but if I listen

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.140
to my better angels,
51% of the time,

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.350
that's a hell of a good day.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.990
My wife will tell you, it's--
I'd not often achieved,

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.450
but we can't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.510
And so the soul of the
country is tested from period

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.150
to period, age to age.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.930
The soul of the country
did the right thing heading

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.230
into Appomattox.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.170
Our better angels won.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.120
Emancipation was ratified.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.700
Slavery was abolished.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.950
But what did we do?

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.250
Reaction immediately sets in.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.110
Segregation prevails.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.200
We still deal with the racial
injustices that grow out of

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.590
that almost unimaginable, almost
unimaginable American drama.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:40.090
We stand on land, I live on
land that belonged more properly

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.470
to the Cherokee Nation.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.190
The twin original
sins of American life,

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.620
our Native American removal

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.080
and African-American
slavery without doubt.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.150
[ Applause ]

00:27:52.150 --> 00:28:00.750
And so-- And so, our goal
has to be to make it right.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.040
And how do we do that?

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.670
Seems to me we do that by

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:13.820
for all his faults expanding
more generously as best we can.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.890
The implications of what Thomas
Jefferson meant when he wrote

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.360
that all men were created equal.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.240
The generations that we honor,
the generations that we wish

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.890
to emulate are not those
who shrunk the definition,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.950
it's those who expanded it.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:40.250
The nation was fixated
this morning on the funeral

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:46.360
of a man whose political
life was largely about hope.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.820
It was largely about opening
our arms not folding them

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.320
across our chest.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.670
The most important
sentence ever written

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.780
in the English language was
that we are all created equal.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.410
I am very careful when I
say that because when you--

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.920
when I mentioned the
English language like that,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.220
I always remember
there's a story

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.190
about a school board
candidate in Texas who was

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.500
against teaching
Spanish and so on.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.010
The campaign trail, he said,
if English was good enough

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.510
for our Lord Jesus Christ,
it's good enough for Texas.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:23.540
[ Laughter ]

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.100
As a Tennessean, we always
say thank God for Texas.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:34.180
I want-- so here's a
total parenthetical.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.370
I have a list of two
stupid things I've said

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.590
to sitting governor, so I'll
give them to you quickly.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.720
One was when George W. Bush was
first running for president,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.300
I went down to Austin to--

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.410
was part of a journalistic
delegation.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.120
And I said, you know, governor--
because of the Mexican War,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.980
I said, you know, if it
weren't for my people,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.030
you all would still
be part of Spain.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.510
He went, he-he, that's
funny asshole.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.400
[ Laughter ]

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.700
Eight years of audits.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:11.590
The other, the other was
when I was out talking

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.030
about Thomas Jefferson
five, six years ago.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.710
I got a call from Chris
Christie is before he became

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.010
Patty Hearst.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.250
And Christie's good
company, right, he's funny.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.000
So he said, I want to talk
to you about Jefferson.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.140
So-- And so, I went out to
lunch, so we went to lunch

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.440
in Trenton and we're
sitting there.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.770
And he said, you know, I'm
really more of a Hamiltonian,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.560
which usually means you're
an investment banker.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.950
That's what that means.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.570
I said, that's great, governor,
I really wasn't thinking.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.970
I said, yeah, but at least my
guy didn't get shot in Jersey.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.450
And the damnedest thing
happened, I couldn't get back

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:52.390
into the city, all the bridges--
OK, back to the soul of America.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.160
How do we expand the definition
that Jefferson laid out?

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.770
That's the mark of progress
in terms of the American soul.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.070
Civil War?

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.520
Yes. Reconstruction?

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.930
No. Cut to the 1920s, 1915,
Birth of a Nation is released,

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:19.130
virulently racist movie revives
the Ku Klux Klan's the Saturday

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.270
after Thanksgiving in 1915
at Stone Mountain Georgia,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.450
the second Ku Klux Klan
is founded in an attempt

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.370
to recover the great
white empire of the south.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:34.010
But it wasn't just the south,
it became a national phenomenon.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.200
And see if any of
this sounds familiar.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.640
Why did the Ku Klux Klan get
three to five million members

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.110
from 1915 to 1926 or so?

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.620
How was it that there were six
governors, maybe 17 senators

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.970
and maybe 75 congressmen

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.610
who were members of
the Ku Klux Klan?

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.990
How was it that there
were a 103 ballots

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.940
at the 1924 Democratic National
Convention driven by the fact

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.270
that there were 347 Klan
delegates who would not vote

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.270
for Al Smith an Irish-Catholic?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.300
How was it the 50,000 Klansmen
marched down Pennsylvania Avenue

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.730
in this-- in the summer of 1925?

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.990
Fear of immigration,
anxiety about crime,

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.750
anxiety about a shifting
economy from a largely agrarian

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.800
and understandably industrial
one to a more complicated one,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.630
the introduction of a
national culture as opposed

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.840
to a local one with the spread
of radio starting in 1921.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.610
Think about it, if
you were a householder

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.280
and what we would now
think of as a red state,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.070
you totally control the
media, the information,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:55.060
the experiences your
family had until about 1922.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.950
And then you bought this box

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.030
to have the world
come into your home.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.500
And suddenly people you didn't
know and didn't know anything

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.000
about were programming
things in New York

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.950
and some place called Hollywood.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.760
It was disorienting.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.440
And a reaction to that
disorientation was fear.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.530
And fear is what drives
eras like our own.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:29.660
Aristotle said that fear is the
anxiety produced by the loss

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:34.780
of what we love, the
loss of what we love.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.150
And what happened from 1915

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.600
to 1925 is largely
what's happening today.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.260
There is a fear among an
extraordinary number of people

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:50.110
who look a lot like me and
who come from states like mine

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:55.330
that the demography of
the country is changing,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.940
the economy of the country
is leaving them behind

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.480
and they don't want to live
in Barack Obama's America,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.220
they want to live
in Donald Trump's.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.490
And let me tell you something
from the bottom of my heart.

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:10.990
Twenty years from
now, we will be living

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:14.510
in Barack Obama's
America not Donald Trump.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:24.980
[ Applause ]

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.980
And it's OK for people
like me to say that.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.880
And I think that's
kind of my job.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.410
I think that's kind of the way
I'm in the arena, but it's going

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.460
to require a heck of
a lot more than that.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.020
It's going to require the
institutions of democracy

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.600
to do what they did
in the 1920s.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.760
So how did that break,
how did that fever break?

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.570
1925 or so, three to
five million members,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.800
Supreme Court justices,
congressmen,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.750
governors of Oregon,
Indiana, Colorado, Texas.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.790
The governor of Georgia lost an
election when he wasn't a member

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.810
of the Klan, joins
the Klan, runs, wins,

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.130
gives a speech saying he wants
to build a wall of steel as high

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.610
as heaven to keep
immigrants out.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.250
As Mark Twain once said,
history may not repeat itself,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:18.380
but it does rhyme.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.490
So what happened?

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.420
The press did its job.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.050
Joseph Pulitzer's newspapers

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.960
in New York ran expose
after expose.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.330
And here's a sentence you
don't hear much Harding

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.540
and Coolidge did
the right thing.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.840
I do love Coolidge though.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.540
My favorite story is, you know,
the woman who came up to him

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.020
at the White House and said,
I have a bet with my husband,

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.610
I can make you say three words.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.220
And he said, you lose.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.110
I just love that guy.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.540
They spoke out somewhat subtly

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.090
but they took a stand
against the Klan.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.550
The Supreme Court

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.000
in two critical decisions
ruled against the Klan.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.030
One was an Oregon case that had
a Klan dominated legislature

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:03.200
in Oregon, had passed a
law saying that every child

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.740
of school age had to go

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.690
to a public school could
not go to a private school.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.890
What do you think
that was about?

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.320
The nuns. They were going
to break the Catholic Church

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.680
because the Catholic
Church was German and Irish.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.920
It was it was seen
as a foreign entity.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.410
Supreme Court threw it out.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.400
Case out in New York.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.520
The-- Because there
were so much violence,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.170
the New York legislature passed
a law saying that the Klan had

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.140
to publish lists of its members.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.280
The Klan countersued saying that
they were like the Kiwanis Club,

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.120
they shouldn't have to do that.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.790
Supreme Court threw it out
saying, no, if you're going

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.840
to act in political ways
and terroristic ways--

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.980
they use that word
terroristic ways,

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.500
you've got to publish the names.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.610
It wanes. And thank
God for all thousand--

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.060
for all kinds of reasons
it did, but it takes us

00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.110
to our next moment
which is 1932, '33.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:04.370
Franklin Roosevelt said
in the summer of 1932

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.000
that the two most dangerous
men in America were Huey Long

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.310
and Douglas MacArthur because
Huey Long could lead a pompous

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:14.760
revolt from the left and Douglas
MacArthur from the right.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.960
March 4th, 1933 when he
gave his inaugural address,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.460
the line we all remember from
the East front of the Capitol is

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.360
that "the only thing we have
to fear is fear itself."

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.230
The line that got the
biggest applause and kind

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.040
of a bloodthirsty cheer
according to Eleanor Roosevelt

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.000
who wrote about it that night
was when FDR said they served--

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.930
the circumstances of
the present crisis are

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:43.800
such that I may require
wartime like executive powers.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.670
And they roared and it
chilled her, she said,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.770
because she realized
they were ready

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.030
as the Europeans had
proven themselves ready

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.970
for a strongman or a dictator.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.900
It terrified her.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.150
That night, FDR's having a
drink before he goes to bed

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.160
and Rexford Tugwell, a
brain trust her comes to him

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.320
and says-- rather pretentiously
actually, Mr. President,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.290
if you succeed in
saving capitalism,

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.340
you will go down as our greatest
president, but if you fail,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.470
you'll go down as our worst.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.500
And FDR looked at him
and said, Rex, if I fail,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.970
I'll go down as our last.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.370
So don't tell me we
haven't been here before.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.690
The 1930s were a decade
where we did not know

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:36.410
if democracy would succeed
against dictatorship.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.960
Churchill saw it, Churchill saw
Roosevelt as a hero early on,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.980
wrote a piece in the early '30s.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.280
They didn't know each other,

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.420
but he said that FDR
represented a bright light

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:51.070
between the baleful
flames of Soviet Bolshevism

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.330
and the lurid flames, I love
Churchill, the lurid flames

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.100
of Nordic self-assertion.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.300
Only Winston Churchill could
write the phrase lurid flames

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.770
of Nordic self-assertion.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:12.590
FDR was the hope, but he was the
hope because he had a country

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.110
that responded to him.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.950
He couldn't do it by himself.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.310
He appealed to those
better angels.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:23.520
He understood that we
were stronger together.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:30.140
He understood that America
required an elevation.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.480
And that if in fact
we were going to live

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.300
to fight another day, if
democracy was going to live

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.580
to fight another day, it would
require a breadth of vision

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:48.020
and an understanding that
the country was bigger

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.640
than any single interest group.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.940
And that's not to lionize--

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.900
that's not to overly
lionize Franklin Roosevelt,

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.040
but imagine what it was
like to be 39 years old

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.130
to be the most popular
Democrat in the country,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.820
he'd run for vice
president in 1920.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.320
And to wake up on an
August morning in 1921

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.010
with the most famous name
in American politics nothing

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.380
but a future ahead and
not be able to walk.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.270
Churchill, again,
said not one man

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.480
in a thousand could have
ever left his house again,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.590
not one man in a million could
have run for office and not one

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.720
in 10 millions could have
risen to the pinnacle

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.780
in the hurly-burly of
the great republic.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.050
I am absolutely convinced
that the Greeks were right

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.460
when they said the character
is destiny and I'm convinced

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.090
that Democratic capitalism
survived the 1930s

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.790
and that socialism or communism

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.790
or some god-awful
connect the mix of the two

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.420
from either Father Coughlin and
his anti-semitism or Huey Long

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.880
and his populism, I am convinced
that Franklin Roosevelt

00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:02.050
and Eleanor Roosevelt's America
won because he knew what it was

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:07.070
like to be knocked down
and yet to come back.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.200
The New York Times wrote
on the day he died,

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.460
published on April 13th,
1945, that men will thank God

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.200
on their knees a
hundred years from now

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.500
that Franklin Roosevelt was

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.080
in the White House
when the crisis came.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:31.130
But he always knew that he was
an instrument of all of us.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:35.510
He also knew that he shouldn't
be in our faces all the time.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.190
[ Laughter ]

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:43.120
I must say, you know, whenever I
talk about Roosevelt, you know,

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.770
really through really--
certainly through Obama,

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.430
I feel as though much

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.510
of the current moment
does disprove Darwin.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.340
[ Laughter and Laughter ]

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.070
But if-- I stole that
line from Henry Adams.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.290
But it's-- if you're going to
steal, steal from Henry Adams.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.590
Write that down.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:10.830
It was-- he wrote it,
the letter in 1935.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.360
Someone had said, oh you need
to get on TV, you need to get

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.570
on radio more, you
have to talk more,

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.870
you have to be more present.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:19.640
And he wrote that there is
something in the human psyche

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.100
that will not stand
the highest note

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.220
in the scale being played
at a constant level.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.870
If you can fit that
into a 140 characters,

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.830
tweet that out for me.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.630
He understood how to
husband his capital,

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.930
how to lead in a democracy.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.120
And it was incredibly
frustrating, Mrs. Roosevelt,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.520
it was really-- was the
conscience of the White House,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.820
one of the greatest women

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.020
who ever drew breath grace
people ever drew breath,

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:55.170
represented our better angels
in every sphere of life.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.270
And also I think endured
what I must think--

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:01.920
what I think of as whenever
I'm in domestic trouble,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.370
which is often, I will say
well at least I never--

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:11.800
FDR didn't tell Mrs. Roosevelt
that Winston Churchill and 35

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.920
of his aides were coming to stay
in the White House for a week

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.750
and stay for Christmas until
Christmas Eve afternoon.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.000
It's amazing she didn't
just kill him right there.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.300
The other amazing thing

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.520
that we're all not all speaking
German is FDR drank these odd

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.890
martinis that were
three quarters for muth,

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.440
one quarter gen, it's amazing
we won hissing growling.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.270
Churchill hated them and
he would pour them out

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.570
and he actually killed a
plant during one summit

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.410
because he kept pouring about.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.890
And believe me for Winston
Churchill to pour how to drink,

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:49.170
it was bad, it must
have been horrible.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.190
He wasn't perfect,
Franklin Roosevelt,

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.460
because what's the
greatest-- if you ask anybody,

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.350
what's the greatest
American moment?

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.450
People will say, well,
World War II right up there.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.750
He's-- That's absolutely right.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:08.200
But, but, but, remember
that soul the clan and King

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.790
so here we are projecting
power to defeat tyranny

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.140
around the world and
what's the reality at home,

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.610
a segregated America,
a segregated military,

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.790
Franklin Roosevelt signing
Executive Order 9066

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.750
and turning the
American-Japanese Americans

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.060
simply because he thought they
might be a security threat no

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.910
evidence of it.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.670
A couple of steps forward
step back, you know,

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.740
what George Eliot called dim
lights and tangled circumstance.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.910
That's our story, but
pushing on, pushing on.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:51.390
Last example is Joe McCarthy.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.170
I don't know if this
will at all resonate.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.870
I'll wait.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:05.160
It's, you know, it's right,
so Rudy Giuliani as Roy Cohn.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.270
It's kind of funny, you know?

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.050
I mean, this doesn't--
sometimes you didn't have

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.810
to work at this stuff.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.290
So, Joe McCarthy,
backbencher, Wisconsin,

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.060
not a particularly
interesting senator.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.320
He's looking for a
national issue in 1950.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.230
There were communists in
the government in the '40s,

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.050
but Harry Truman got
rid of most of them.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:33.040
In a loyalty program, the
Civil Liberties folks hated

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.460
but still got rid of them.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.550
McCarthy comes along, he's
soul-- Cohn later wrote--

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.430
his lawyer later wrote that he
bought anti-communism the way

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.120
other people might buy a car.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.750
It was an issue, it
was something to ride.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.080
Lincoln's birthday, Wheeling
West Virginia, he says,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.560
he has in his pocket a 205
communists, the number wandered

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.900
down to 57, he never
really found any.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.780
Reign of terror of four years.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:02.430
Now, think about that, four
years from Lincoln's birthday,

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:08.770
1950, February until late 1954.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:16.510
Parenthetically, as well, June
17th, 1972 to August 9th, 1974,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.180
people want these things
to move more quickly,

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.630
but that's not the way
history actually unfolds.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.190
For almost 48 months,

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.200
Joe McCarthy terrorized the
United States of America.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.050
And he did it through the
manipulation of the media

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.110
through an appeal to
broad popular fear

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.430
at a time of transition.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:44.290
He did it kind of promising
to make America unpinch again.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:48.280
He understood the means of
communication of his time.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.330
The afternoon papers
used to close at noon,

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.680
so McCarthy would call
press conferences at 11:30

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.210
in the morning and say
I am seeking a communist

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.140
in Des Moines, headlines
all around the country.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.390
Senator seeks red in Des Moines.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.020
He did it 11:30 so they
couldn't have time--

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.320
they didn't have time to check.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.740
Then he waited till 11:30 p.m.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.670
because the morning
papers closed at midnight.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.760
And he said, the read
in Des Moines is eluding

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.790
but I'm redoubling my efforts,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.490
flashes across America,
redoubles efforts.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.410
Radio helped him.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:22.650
When he took to the stump
in Wheeling, in 1950,

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.820
there were 3.1 million
televisions

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.870
in American households.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.780
When he was censured in 1954,

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:34.050
there were 30.6,
immense sea-change.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.670
And the good news about that, if
you believe that the truth will

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:43.590
out and that leaders who are not
appealing to our better angels

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.060
but are in fact dealing in
hope traffic, I mean traffic

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.890
in fear is exposure killed him.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.420
People watched him long enough

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.980
to think this is not
who we want to be.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.150
But let me tell you who you
definitely want to have been.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.590
And I thought about her
all morning and you want

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:06.520
to be Margaret Chase Smith, the
Republican senator from Maine

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.950
who within a month of the speech

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.440
in Wheeling gave a speech called
the declaration of conscience

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.290
in which she laid out the
exact case against McCarthy.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.440
I urge you to go read it.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.610
There was no further
intellectual or moral movement

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.770
by 1954 when the
censure vote happened

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.670
from what Senator
Smith laid out.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.470
McCarthy dismissed-- and
she only got six senators

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.830
to sign it with her.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:38.120
McCarthy dismissed them as "Snow
White and the Six Dwarves".

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:44.260
But here we are in
2018 talking about her.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.680
We're not talking about the
senators who took a dive

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.330
or who wanted to wait to
see the next poll or wanted

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.760
to wait it out a little bit.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.150
We're talking about the one who
stood and said this is wrong.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.890
And that's what we need more of.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:06.440
And whenever I talked to
folks who actually have power,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:12.150
one of the things I try to say
is what do you want us to think

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:14.670
when we look at your
oil portrait?

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.460
And it works because they
can't imagine a world

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.410
where we're not gazing
adoringly at their oil portrait.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.050
So it's kind of a passive
aggressive thing, it works.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.190
And I was thinking
all morning, you know,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.710
I was sitting outside
the cathedral

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.000
and all those senators
sitting there

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.100
and what do they
think people are going

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.410
to be saying about them?

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.940
You're afraid of a guy
with a Twitter finger

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.620
and a 36% approval rating?

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.510
Yeah. Anyway--

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.850
[ Applause ]

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:57.170
So, you want to be
Margaret Chase Smith,

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.070
you want to be Margaret
Chase Smith, and you want

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.530
to urge people not to agree--

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.930
we don't have to agree all
the time, we never have

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.000
from loyalists versus
patriots to isolationist

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.690
versus interventionists to
globalist versus protectionism,

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.390
we're always going to fight.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.010
The country was built to fight.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.430
The country was built to have
guardrails so that we would

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:23.160
at least stay basically
on the road.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.620
But here are a couple of
three characteristics given

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.390
to you fast that I think
we need and I think

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:35.400
that presidents need, and public
officials need in order to win

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.390
that battle within the soul.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.300
The first is curiosity.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.600
Absolutely essential.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.380
The greatest eras, the
greatest presidents are ones

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.080
who are intellectually curious.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.970
Thomas Jefferson was able to
write that sentence not simply

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.980
because he was a rising
young politician of Virginia

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.930
in the third week of June
1776, but because he was

00:50:54.930 --> 00:51:00.100
in a broad conversation with
the European enlightenment,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.400
the Scottish moral
enlightenment,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.910
the Scientific Revolution,
the Protestant Reformations,

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.480
the introduction of Gutenberg,
an entire reorientation

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:14.450
of the world from being seen
as being run by kings, popes,

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:19.720
prelates, prince's, people who
either by an accident of birth

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:25.020
or an incident of election were
given power over all of us,

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.290
a vertical understanding.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.470
And what was happening with the
American Revolution is it was

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.480
becoming more horizontal,
that we were all born

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.010
with that capacity to
determine our own destinies

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.130
and that it wouldn't
simply lie in the hands

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.190
of a pope or of a prince.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:48.560
Jefferson was able to set that
in motion incomplete as it was

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.370
because he was voraciously
curious about what was going

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.800
on in the rest of the world.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:52:00.460
And I think that this-- the
baseline of citizenship always

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.910
but particularly
today is realizing

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:09.210
that the American Revolution
was the political manifestation

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:14.380
of the idea that reason has
to have a chance in the arena

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.700
against passion that
we've been given a brain,

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.970
we've been given the capacity
to weigh different arguments

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.900
and come to a reasoned
conclusion.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:30.500
And if we don't reflect and
use reason and if we fall prey

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.930
to reflexive partisanship,
then we're not being true

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.590
to the reality of
the revolution.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.740
Partisanship is fine.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.180
Partisanship is the air
we breathe, is the price

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.440
of free government,
but we have to,

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.980
we have to make it
reflective not reflexive,

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.400
so curiosity is one.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.700
The second is humility.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.220
We've got to figure out
how to admit mistakes.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.470
We wouldn't be here if Jack
Kennedy hadn't been able

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.110
to admit a mistake
from the Bay of Pigs

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.200
to the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.730
Remember after the Bay of
Pigs in April of '61, he said,

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.030
how could I have been so stupid?

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:13.110
In a parliamentary system,
I would have resigned.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.230
He calls the last men on earth
before him he wished to appear

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:19.490
in need of tutelage, and
that was Dwight Eisenhower,

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:20.890
ask him to come to Camp David.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.750
Eisenhower says, you have
to have everybody in a room,

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.790
you have to weigh the pros and
cons, you can't run these things

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.570
out of your back pocket.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:31.980
Cut to October 1962,
casualty estimates

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.810
of a possible hemispheric
exchange of nuclear weapons

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.160
in the Cuban Missile
Crisis range between 70

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.910
and a 100 million Americans.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:43.180
They could have gotten to
this city in 20 minutes.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.750
Many of the people in this
room would not have been here.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:49.260
The whole structure of
life might have ended

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.570
if Kennedy had not had
the humility to admit

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.940
that he made a mistake
and he needed to learn.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.480
One of the many tragedies
of Dallas is

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.790
that Jack Kennedy is one
of the few presidents,

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.630
Lincoln's another, who were
self-evidently learning

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:04.070
as they held that office.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:06.270
It's so hard to learn
at that level.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.010
It just-- it-- the
pressures are such.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:14.990
But they were able to do it and
we are better off because of it.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.520
The last is empathy.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.160
And I want to leave
you with this.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:24.490
If I don't care about
you and if you don't

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:28.270
at least nominally
care about me,

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:32.330
democracy doesn't really work
because why should you pay taxes

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.080
to help me and vice-versa

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.200
if we don't have a
sense of sociability?

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.040
But Gordon Wood, the great
historian, I know has been here,

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.020
called sociability,
neighborliness,

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.200
if we don't understand that
we're in this together,

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.150
what Dr. King called a
mutual garment of destiny.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.450
That requires empathy.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.910
I don't have to love
you to death.

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:58.850
We don't have to spend
a lot of time talking.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.770
But we have to be-- we have

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.150
to have a fundamental
empathy with each other.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.050
And I think the most empathetic
man who ever held the presidency

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:11.300
of the United States is
George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:15.370
And I want to read you
quickly a letter that is--

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:18.270
it's from another
planet basically.

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.280
But, this is the kind of
person who was elected

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.960
to the presidency 30
years ago this year.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.210
This is a letter that
President Bush wrote

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.700
to his mother in the late 1950s.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.760
After the loss of the Bush's
daughter Robin to leukemia

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:40.210
in the-- in 1953, they
had the four boys, Doro,

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.110
their last child had
not yet been born,

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.360
she would be born in '59.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:50.480
And this is the voice of
a son writing his mother

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.910
about the loss of
his own daughter.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:56.900
And I share it with you
not least because it is

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.940
of its unique in the
literature of the presidency,

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.980
but I often think that if
I could be 5% of the man

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.860
who wrote this letter,
I'd be ahead of the game.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:13.590
So this is the voice
of George H.W. Bush.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.750
"There is about our
house a need,

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.590
the running pulsating
restlessness

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.860
of the boys needs a counterpart.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.330
We need some starch
Chris frocks to go

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.830
with all our torn neat
blue jeans and helmets.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:32.480
We need some soft blond hair
to offset those crew cuts.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.390
We need a dollhouse to
stand firm against our forts

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:38.650
and rackets and thousand
baseball cards.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.970
We need a legitimate
Christmas angel,

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.790
one who doesn't have
cuffs beneath the dress.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.490
We need someone who's
afraid of frogs.

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.140
We need someone to cry
when I get mad not argue.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.480
We need a little
one who can kiss

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.190
without leaving egg
or Jam or gum.

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:00.980
We need a girl.

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:04.270
We had one once, she'd
fight and cry and play

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.440
and make her way just like
all the rest, but there was

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.630
about her a certain
softness, she was patient.

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.050
Her hugs were just a
little less wiggly.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.190
She'd stand beside our bed
until I felt her there,

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.770
silently and comfortable.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.940
She'd put those precious
fragrant locks

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.210
against my chest
and fall asleep.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:29.340
Her peace made me feel
strong and so very important,

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:35.340
my daddy had a caress,
a certain ownership mode

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:41.560
that I loved even more than the
'hi dad' that means so much.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:47.060
But she is still with us, we
need her and yet we have her.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.300
We can't touch her and
yet we can feel her."

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:54.190
In the course of writing the
book about the president,

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.790
I asked him to read that
letter aloud to me and we were

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:01.030
in his office in Houston,
and long before he finished,

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:05.100
he broke down an extraordinary
level of physical sobbing.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.600
So much so that his chief
of staff came in the office

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.700
and looked and saw what we
were doing and said, why did--

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.080
she asked me, she said, why
did you want President Bush

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.940
to read that?

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.950
And I said, well, if you want
to know someone's heart--

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:22.580
and before I could finish, the
president jumped in and said,

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.240
you have to know what breaks it.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:32.010
That's the best part
of the soul of America.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.810
Thank you.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:59:14.300
[ Applause ]

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:17.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You
could have kept clapping.

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.840
I just wanted to say,
thank you Jon Meacham.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:25.290
You were the perfect person
to close the main stage today.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:26.900
You are what we needed.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.960
And I want to also
bring up another person,

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.510
Mr. David Rubenstein, who is--

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:43.480
[ Applause ]

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:48.810
-- the person who brings
this festival to us,

00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:51.630
who is the major sponsor
who believes in literacy

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.990
and learning and
the power of words.

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.380
Thank you both.

00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.510
We appreciate you so much.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:05.210
[ Applause ]

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:11.020
And I feel like we should just
keep clapping and standing.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.000
I want to thank all of you
for your patience today.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.890
I know there were long lines
for the signings and everything,

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:20.500
but we can't thank you
enough for making this one

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.800
of the premier events.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:30.010
And I have just news in that the
next date for next year will be

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:33.640
on Saturday, August 31st,
Labor Day weekend again.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.210
We just got the confirmation, so
thank you all and keep reading.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:40.210
