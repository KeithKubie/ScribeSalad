00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.290
[? Sermon ?] just
gave you some rules.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.706
But if there are
rules, then there

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:05.379
are exceptions to those rules.

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.029
As you're very well
aware of, we're

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.599
allowed to include stylesheets,
images, videos, IFrames,

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.730
and even scripts
from other origins

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.880
as well as send form
data to other origins.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.320
The end user won't
be able to tell

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.629
that one image is
loaded from our server

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:22.059
while another is
loaded from Instagram.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.729
However, for web developers,
there is a difference.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.859
You can't interact
with an image tag that

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.140
is showing a cross origin
image in the same way you

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.899
could with an image
from the same origin.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.449
For example, you can't inspect
the pixels of the image

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.429
from inside the Canvas element.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.340
The same goes for a script tag
that includes a cross origin

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.810
script resource.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.510
The contents will either
just silently appear empty.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:45.489
Or in case of more
modern APIs, it

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.320
will explicitly throw an error.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.520
For the same origins script tag,
I have access to its contents

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.400
but I can't access the other
origin scripts contents.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.909
It's important to keep in mind
that the user's browser is

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.029
the one who enforces
the same origin policy.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.340
It's not the server but
the client that will not

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.106
let you send off requests.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.689
We'll see why this is important
as we look into getting around

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.429
same origin policy
restrictions in the next video.
