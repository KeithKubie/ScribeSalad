&gt;&gt;As part of the Davos Debates, I've been
asked as the UN International

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.649
Development Section of the United Kingdom
why we attach such importance

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.430
to education and what kind of benefits education
brings beyond

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.259
education itself.
All of the evidence that we've studied from

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.020
countries right around the
world indicates, for example, if you educate

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.550
a young girl, she will
marry later; she'll get pregnant later.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.730
She'll be more likely to be employed in the
formal sector rather than

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.359
the informal sector of the economy.
She will have better health because she'll

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.770
be better aware and better
able to take care of herself.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.200
That's why we believe there are huge benefits
beyond simply education.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.000
And that's why we're making record levels
of investments to support in

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.489
countries their education systems.
We know what to do.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.489
We know which trained teachers to build schools,
to provide classrooms.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.149
That's why when we helped abolish user fees
in countries like Kenya,

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.820
Uganda and [INAUDIBLE] literally hundreds
of thousands of poor children

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.600
turned up to school on Monday morning.
Best way to work is changing lives, but also

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.740
I believe it can change
the future of those countries.
