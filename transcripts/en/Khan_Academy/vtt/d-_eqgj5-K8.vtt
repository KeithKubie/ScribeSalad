00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.240
Let's say I have
something moving

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.990
with a constant velocity
of five meters per second.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.050
And we're just assuming
it's moving to the right,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.800
just to give us a direction,
because this is a vector

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.970
quantity, so it's moving in
that direction right over there.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.140
And let me plot its
velocity against time.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.624
So this is my velocity.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.040
So I'm actually
going to only plot

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.720
the magnitude of the
velocity, and you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.220
can specify that like this.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.520
So this is the magnitude
of the velocity.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.810
And then on this axis
I'm going to plot time.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.020
So we have a constant velocity
of five meters per second.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.720
So its magnitude is
five meters per second.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.240
And it's constant.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.220
It's not changing.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.470
As the seconds tick away the
velocity does not change.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.570
So it's just moving
five meters per second.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.240
Now, my question to you
is how far does this thing

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.220
travel after five seconds?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.730
So after five seconds-- so
this is one second, two second,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.140
three seconds, four seconds,
five seconds, right over here.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.325
So how far did this thing
travel after five seconds?

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.950
Well, we could think
about it two ways.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:28.780
One, we know that velocity
is equal to displacement over

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.700
change in time.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.770
And displacement is
just change in position

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.470
over change in time.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.000
Or another way to
think about it--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.720
If you multiply
both sides by change

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.050
in time-- you get velocity
times change in time,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.960
is equal to displacement.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.462
So what was of the
displacement over here?

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:51.920
Well, I know what
the velocity is--

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.200
it's five meters per second.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.680
That's the velocity,
let me color-code this.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.550
That is the velocity.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.310
And we know what the change in
time is, it is five seconds.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.520
And so you get the seconds
cancel out the seconds,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.270
you get five times five-- 25
meters-- is equal to 25 meters.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.860
And that's pretty
straightforward.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.485
But the slightly more
interesting thing

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:19.000
is that's exactly the area under
this rectangle right over here.

00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:25.600
What I'm going to show
you in this video,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.970
that is in general,
if you plot velocity,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.320
the magnitude of velocity.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.170
So you could say
speed to versus time.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.840
Or let me just stay
with the magnitude

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.910
of the velocity versus time.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.300
The area under
that curve is going

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.430
to be the distance traveled,
because, or the displacement.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.740
Because displacement is
just the velocity times

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.370
the change in time.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.935
So if you just take out a
rectangle right over there.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.560
So let me draw a
slightly different one

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.424
where the velocity is changing.

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:54.590
So let me draw a situation
where you have a constant

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.276
acceleration .

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.670
The acceleration
over here is going

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.850
to be one meter per
second, per second.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.410
So one meter per
second, squared.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.150
And let me draw the
same type of graph,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.750
although this is going to
look a little different now.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.060
So this is my velocity axis.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.610
I'll give myself a
little bit more space.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.010
So this is my velocity axis.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.690
I'm just going to draw the
magnitude of the velocity,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.730
and this right over
here is my time axis.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.440
So this is time.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.960
And let me mark
some stuff off here.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.300
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.087
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:38.670
And the magnitude
of velocity is going

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.700
to be measured in
meters per second.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.210
And the time is going to
be measured in seconds.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.470
So my initial
velocity, or I could

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.700
say the magnitude of
my initial velocity--

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.640
so just my initial
speed, you could say,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.056
this is just a
fancy way of saying

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.040
my initial speed is zero.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.360
So my initial speed is zero.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.980
So after one second
what's going to happen?

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.090
After one second I'm going
one meter per second faster.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.720
So now I'm going one
meter per second.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.190
After two seconds,
whats happened?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.459
Well now I'm going another meter
per second faster than that.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.472
After another second--
if I go forward in time,

00:04:21.472 --> 00:04:23.180
if change in time is
one second, then I'm

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.410
going a second faster than that.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.530
And if you remember the idea of
the slope from your algebra one

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.660
class, that's exactly
what the acceleration

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.260
is in this diagram
right over here.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.170
The acceleration, we
know that acceleration

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:46.060
is equal to change in
velocity over change in time.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.370
Over here change in time
is along the x-axis.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.140
So this right over here
is a change in time.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.070
And this right over here
is a change in velocity.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.550
When we plot velocity or
the magnitude of velocity

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.740
relative to time, the slope of
that line is the acceleration.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.070
And since we're assuming the
acceleration is constant,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.560
we have a constant slope.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.900
So we have just a line here.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.860
We don't have a curve.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.330
Now what I want to do is
think about a situation.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.420
Let's say that we accelerate it
one meter per second squared.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.120
And we do it for--
so the change in time

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.720
is going to be five seconds.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.880
And my question to you is
how far have we traveled?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.760
Which is a slightly more
interesting question

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.410
than what we've
been asking so far.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.440
So we start off with an
initial velocity of zero.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.580
And then for five
seconds we accelerate

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.010
it one meter per second squared.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.190
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.460
So this is where we go.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.390
This is where we are.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.550
So after five seconds,
we know our velocity.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.140
Our velocity is now
five meters per second.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.090
But how far have we traveled?

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.930
So we could think about
it a little bit visually.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.729
We could say, look, we could try
to draw rectangles over here.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.520
Maybe right over here,
we have the velocity

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.800
of one meter per second.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.910
So if I say one meter per
second times the second,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.040
that'll give me a
little bit of distance.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.000
And then the next one I have
a little bit more of distance,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.020
calculated the same way.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.811
I could keep drawing
these rectangles here,

00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:19.310
but then you're like, wait,
those rectangles are missing,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.110
because I wasn't for
the whole second,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.910
I wasn't only going
one meter per second.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.870
I kept accelerating.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.220
So I actually, I should maybe
split up the rectangles.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.180
I could split up the
rectangles even more.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.839
So maybe I go every half second.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.005
So on this half-second I
was going at this velocity.

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:36.110
And I go that velocity
for a half-second.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.230
Velocity times the time would
give me the displacement.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.090
And I do it for the
next half second.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.970
Same exact idea here.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.340
Gives me the displacement.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.240
So on and so forth.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.360
But I think what you see as
you're getting-- is the more

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.900
accurate-- the smaller
the rectangles,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.530
you try to make here, the closer
you're going to get to the area

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.570
under this curve.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.560
And just like the
situation here.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.150
This area under
the curve is going

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.325
to be the distance traveled.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.050
And lucky for us, this is
just going to be a triangle,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.500
and we know how to figure
out the area for triangle.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.300
So the area of a triangle
is equal to one half

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.690
times base times height.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.660
Which hopefully
makes sense to you,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.650
because if you just
multiply base times height,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.400
you get the area for
the entire rectangle,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.750
and the triangle is
exactly half of that.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.550
So the distance traveled
in this situation,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.120
or I should say
the displacement,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.580
just because we want to make
sure we're focused on vectors.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.297
The displacement
here is going to be--

00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:43.380
or I should say the magnitude
of the displacement,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.770
maybe, which is the same
thing as the distance,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.060
is going to be one
half times the base,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:56.750
which is five seconds,
times the height,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.080
which is five meters per second.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.740
Times five meters.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.520
Let me do that in another color.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.494
Five meters per second.

00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:09.160
The seconds cancel
out with the seconds.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.950
And we're left with one half
times five times five meters.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:19.056
So it's one half times 25,
which is equal to 12.5 meters.

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:21.180
And so there's an interesting
thing here, well one,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.805
there's a couple of
interesting things.

00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:25.280
Hopefully you'll realize that
if you're plotting velocity

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.532
versus time, the
area under the curve,

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.240
given a certain amount
of time, tells you

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.049
how far you have traveled.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.840
The other interesting thing
is that the slope of the curve

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.559
tells you your acceleration.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.890
What's the slope over here?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.182
Well, It's completely flat.

00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:41.140
And that's because the
velocity isn't changing.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.500
So in this situation, we
have a constant acceleration.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.550
The magnitude of that
acceleration is exactly zero.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.460
Our velocity is not changing.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.790
Here we have an acceleration of
one meter per second squared,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.370
and that's why the slope of this
line right over here is one.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.474
The other interesting
thing, is, if even

00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:00.890
if you have constant
acceleration,

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.515
you could still figure
out the distance

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:04.972
by just taking the area
under the curve like this.

00:09:04.972 --> 00:09:06.430
We were able to
figure out there we

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.220
were able to get 12.5 meters.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.582
The last thing I want to
introduce you to-- actually,

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:13.040
let me just do it
until next video,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.750
and I'll introduce you to
the idea of average velocity.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.810
Now that we feel
comfortable with the idea,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.940
that the distance
you traveled is

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.672
the area under the
velocity versus time curve.
