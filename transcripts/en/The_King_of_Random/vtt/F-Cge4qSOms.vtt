&gt;&gt; In today's video,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.500
we're going to show you
how to make a food dehydrator.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.160
It can be used to make
a number of tasty snacks,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.600
and it's built from a cardboard box,
a light bulb, and a small fan.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.600

[Music]

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.700
[Music]

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.119
To start off with the build
of this food dehydrator,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.620
we're going to want a cardboard box,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.269
some aluminum foil,
and some strong tape.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.939
If you have some of this metal tape,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.020
that will work the best.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.240
But if you don't have any of this,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.920
other strong tape
like duct tape will work as well.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.860
There's no specific size or shape
of cardboard box that you need,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980
but I have this one because
it fits really well with the racks

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.600
that we'll fit inside of it.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.699
This box used to hold reams of paper,
and if you don't have one lying around,

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.370
I went to a store that sells paper,
and they sold this box to me for a dollar.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.840
This is a 250 watt heat lamp bulb,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.480
and this is an old
cooling fan from a computer.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.500
If you don't have one,
you can buy a heat bulb

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.140
at most hardware stores
for about 10 bucks.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.880
Sometimes they have
a red color to them,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.780
but they'll work just
the same as this one.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.800
Here's the basic idea of
how our food dehydrator will work.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.280
Both of these will be inside our box,
which would be lined with foil.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.030
The heat from the lamp will be
circulated by the air from the fan,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.119
and that will swirl slowly around 
the food that we're dehydrating,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.980
drying it out.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.920
The first step will be to use
our aluminum foil and our tape

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.640
to line the inside of the box
and the inside of the lid with the foil,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.080
shiny side out.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:57.320
[Music]

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.920
There we go.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.940
The inside of our box in our lid
is now completely lined with foil.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.660
And you can see how shiny
and reflective it is in there.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.060
That's really going
to help the heat bounce around

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600
and not get absorbed by
the cardboard of the box.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.680
Now it's time to move on
to adding the fan and the heat lamp.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.140
This fan came out of an old computer,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.510
and runs on 12 volt DC current.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.940
To power this 12 volt DC fan,
I went to the local thrift shop,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.800
and just bought a used power supply.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.840
This power supply has
an output of 12 volts DC current.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200
So it should run our fan just perfectly.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.460
Before we permanently
solder anything together,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.900
let's just do a quick test
to see if our power supply is working.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.480
I've got it plugged in right now.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.320
I think this will only work
one direction with the wires.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.880
Well, it's working that direction.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.360
Definitely getting a breeze off of that.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.500
So now we can solder those together
to make the connection permanent.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:03.760
[Music]

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.780
Our fan is wired and ready to go.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.550
So now we need to install it in the box.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.200
And we're actually going
to keep the box oriented like this.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.580
Our lid isn't going to work as a lid,
but instead is going to work as a door.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.840
So we want our fan installed
into the side of the box.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.620
And since this is going to be the bottom,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.560
we'll put the fan right here.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.950
I've got it elevated up
from the edge just a little bit

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.900
to avoid the overlapping
piece of cardboard here.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500
It doesn't really matter
exactly where you put it,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.480
as long as it's on about
the bottom half of the box.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.440
[Music]

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.600
With the hole cut to the fan,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.670
it may be a good idea
to take a little bit more tape

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.160
and tape down these edges.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.380
If you've cut the hole to the right size,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.980
the fan should fit nicely into place.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.790
Now that we've got the fan installed,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.750
we want to install the heat lamp
on the other side of the box.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.750
To power the heat lamp,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.000
I have this chord that's
just a chord on one side

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.660
and a light bulb socket on the other.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.190
And this would work
if we didn't want an on or off switch,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.100
or the ability to choose
how much power came out of this bulb.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.410
But I want both of those things.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.280
I want to be able to turn off the light,
and I want to be able to turn it down.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.060
So here I have
a rotating dimmer switch.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.740
We're going to install this
into the middle of the power cord.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.100
These two wires are
the positive and negative lines,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.860
and we'll have one of the wires
running through our power cord,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.219
connect into one side and out the other.

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.810
I've cut the power cord to the light bulb

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.530
and exposed the ends of the two wires

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.020
so we can now solder them
in line with the light switch.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.220
We'll solder the
two black wires back together,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.040
and then we'll take
the white wire and have that split,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.300
so it connects to the red wire
on one side of light switch

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.200
and the black wire on the other.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:49.580
[Music]

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.320
Looks like it's working to me.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.280
Now, before I solder anything in place,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.340
we do need to run this wire
through the other wall of this box.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.319
Otherwise, we would have to have
a really big hole for the light bulb

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.240
to fit in and out.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.640
So let's cut a hole just large enough

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.680
for this cord to fit
through the wall of the box.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:25.400
[Music]

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
Beautiful.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.200
Heat lamp is now on a dimmable circuit.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.760
And we can turn it off.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.840
There's a very good chance
that we could use the heat lamp

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.120
in our box just like this,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.700
and nothing would
ever be a problem with it.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.060
But just to be sure we don't
have too much heat passing

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.420
from the bulb through
the foil into the cardboard,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.000
let's use a little bit
of a hanger to build a stand

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.430
that will hold our
bulb up off of the foils,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.620
just a little bit.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.480
[Music]

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.720
This sort of double m shape
does a good job of holding the bulb

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.370
off of the bottom of the box,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.000
which should allow
circulation all around it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.520
and prevent any overheating.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.320
The dehydrator is coming along nicely.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.060
And at this point,
what it needs is somewhere to put

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.800
the food that's being dehydrated.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.540
These cooling racks I got at Walmart
for about $3.50 each were great.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.060
These racks are one of
the reasons I got this size of box.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.800
They fit really nicely in with just
a little bit of extra space to spare.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.620
And there's enough
clearance above the light bulb

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.140
that we can easily fit two racks in here,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.440
one on top of the other.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.160
To be able to hold
the racks right where we need

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.820
and still be able to take them in and out

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.659
of our dehydrator whenever we want,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.620
let's use a couple of dowels
running across our whole dehydrator.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:47.780
[Music]

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.590
I'll put one rack about this high,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.440
and the other one,
maybe an inch and half below that.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:14.340
[Music]

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.440
As you can see, these racks do extend
slightly beyond the front of this box.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.879
But we don't have
to put this lid on all the way.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.909
It overlaps with the main body of the box,

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.240
3 inches normally,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.080
and we just don't need it to do that.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.320
As long as it's covering the openings,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.740
it's going to work just fine.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.460
To help the lid stay in place
approximately where we want it,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.520
let's use a little bit of tape
as a sort of hinge on one side of the box.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.940
[Music]

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.660
Our dehydrator is just about ready to use.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.300
There's just a couple more
small improvements we can make.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.520
First off, we want that fan
to actually be circulating the air,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.820
and not just be spinning in dead space.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.480
So let's cut several small
holes into the top of our box.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.380
This will help the
air come in one side,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.050
travel up past the food,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.059
carrying away any excess moisture,

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:02.980
and out the top.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.319
[Music]

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.860
The dehydrator would
work great just as it is,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.740
but to contain our switch
and to keep it from flopping around,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.440
and just lying wherever on the table,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.180
let's grab a scrap of cardboard
and build a box that it can sit on

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.180
to hold all of the excess cord,

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.680
And so we just have a nice place

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.640
where we always know
the switch is going to be.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.320
[Music]

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.820
At this point,
our dehydrator box is complete.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.010
The whole thing is lined with foil.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.720
We have a fan,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.320
we have a light that's on a dimmer switch,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.290
and all we need to do is
pick our food and put it in.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.030
With the front of the box closed,
I can feel the air coming up

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.720
out of the holes
we've cut into the top.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.800
And once we turn on the light,
the air inside will start heating up.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.040
To make our dehydrator look just
a little bit less like a cardboard box,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.520
we're going to hit it
with a layer of paint.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:09:03.520
[Music]

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.280
Obviously, this level of decoration
is not necessary to make it work.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.630
It will dehydrate your food
just fine without any changes to it,

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.660
even if it just looks
like a cardboard box.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.200
Really quick,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.500
let's take a look at
some of the things

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.260
that we can make with
our Dehydro-tron 5000.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.630
I've got three different things here
that I've dehydrated at home

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.100
and it worked really well.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.460
I have some pineapple
which I covered in sugar

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.100
before putting in the dehydrator.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.720
Some apple slices,
which I just sliced in pieces.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.140
Put on the rack
and then left it overnight.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.540
And I have some beef jerky.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.940
There are tons of good recipes
for making beef jerky at home

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.360
using a dehydrator.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.640
It's fast, it's easier,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.960
and it's way cheaper
than buying it at the store.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.120

Wishing there was

Go check it out.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.740
The box in the bottom
will show you what

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.500
YouTube thinks
you should be watching next.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.380
This bomb in the center will
subscribe to our channel

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.300
so you never have to miss another video.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.320
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.160
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.980
Talk to you then.
