Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, well, I think we should start the story on June 25th, 1969. Well, first you should say who you are. I'm Susie Lichtenberg. I'm Janet. I'm Rod. This is more perfect. Okay. So why, uh, why June 20? When was it? June 25th, 1969, uh, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren is retiring. Earl Warren of the Warren Court. Is that a big court? Yeah, that's really, no, come on human re, I think if you think of legendary Supreme Court justices, he's probably in, I don't know, the top five. So he was one of the Mount Olympians. He's a big deal. All right, so he's retiring. So he's retiring. He's been on the court for 16 years and he's in an interview and he's asked,

Speaker 2:          00:39          what'd you list Mr Chief Justice as the supreme court's most important decision in your 16 years here? And he says something that is kind of astounding. I think the reapportionment not only of state legislatures, but for sure

Speaker 1:          00:52          before you hear the answer. Yeah. I think that you need to know that he could have said all kinds of cases. He was the chief justice during, I don't know, Miranda, either of his rights to remain silent. That's, you have the right to remain silent.

Speaker 3:          01:09          Clarence Earl Gideon petition

Speaker 1:          01:10          or Gideon versus Wainwright.

Speaker 3:          01:12          It is the beauty of the space,

Speaker 1:          01:14          which is you have the right to an attorney that seems big or has no place in our democracy. Brown vs board of Education. Okay. I know that one. I know desegregating the schools of state. It could be bigger than that. He doesn't say any of those. What does he say? He says this little case called [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:34          the baker versus Carr case. Baker versus Carr. Huh. I think that uh, that that case is perhaps the most important case that we've had since I've been on the court.

Speaker 1:          01:47          He thought that case, whatever it is, is more important than the case that desegregated the schools. He did. Wow. So what the hell is it exactly? No, really what is it? It's this case that was so dramatic and so traumatic that it apparently broke two justices. There was an instance in which my brother found my father going upstairs to get a shotgun. Wow. More perfect.

Speaker 3:          02:14          The auto, all the chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. All Da da.

Speaker 4:          02:24          Yeah. But before the [inaudible] the draw in Aaron [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          02:55          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:57          Okay. So this is more of perfect a mini series about the supreme

Speaker 6:          03:00          court. Just to frame the story we're about to hear for a second. As we were putting the show together, um, we hosted a panel discussion and a couple of us were on stage and a woman in the audience asked the following question. Yes. Could you, um, address what I see is the increasing politicization of the court, the apotheosis of which I guess was, uh, you know, voting or electing Bush to be our president. Has the court always been this way? Is this just my perception that it's becoming more politicized? So this turns out to be really interesting question. Uh, it turns out, I didn't know this until Susie started looking into it, that there was a moment

Speaker 1:          03:42          when the Pandora's box just got ripped open. So I think to understand that moment in this story, you have to get to know three characters. And these aren't necessarily the three most important justices of all time. Okay. Because at that time you had Chief Justice Earl Warren [inaudible] and William Brennan on the court. And these were kind of giants of the Supreme Court. Gotcha. But for this story, these three guys are key. One of them is on the right. One of them is on the left and one of them is just stuck right in the middle, tragically in the middle. So on the conservative side.

Speaker 3:          04:13          So Ryan, what difference does it make when it in the constitution or in any other expression or action by the state?

Speaker 1:          04:19          You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter. So Justice Frankfurter was one of the most great is really his name was really framed further. Yes. One of the most influential justices of all time. I, that's Tara Grove. She teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School. Um, he was a very influential scholar at Harvard law school before he became a justice, was a close advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Um, he was extremely smart, towering figure. But as a person just as just justice frankfurter, he wasn't necessarily the nicest person. I heard that from everyone I talk to. I always call him a Bantam Rooster. Uh, he was a difficult crusty figure. He was short, a little bit of a pouch on him. It was one of the most condescending egotistical of justices. He was a tough customer when a, when a clerk would come to the u s supreme court chambers to deliver a message, and the person at the door tried to hand justice frankfurter the paper, Frankfurt or would inevitably let it drop to the ground. So the person had to bend down and pick it up to hand it to him again. Dude, that's a Wainer man. And by the way, the voices you heard besides terra grove are professors. Mike Seidman, Georgetown University Law Center, because Sam is that girl from NYU law school. Craig Smith, California, University of Pennsylvania and x Supreme Court clerk. Alan Cohen, column K La Chan. Okay. So Frankfurter is on one side of the aisle and his nemesis is a gentleman on the other side of the island,

Speaker 6:          05:51          a liberal named William O. Douglas here is Justice

Speaker 7:          05:58          Douglas now and the Supreme Court chambers. He said yes,

Speaker 1:          06:02          this is a recording from a 1957 interview with Justice Douglas. It looks very well as the faceless 10 rugged, his eyes sparkle Douglas was this mountain climbing environmentalist big on civil liberties.

Speaker 7:          06:14          I think that the coming generation is more aware of the importance of civil liberties and perhaps like generation low

Speaker 1:          06:21          and like Justice Frankfurter Douglas was a prick to everybody around him. Everybody hated him. All those same adjectives, condescending, egotistical, abrasive, applied. Here's how the New York Times described him.

Speaker 2:          06:36          Oh, habitual. A womanizer, a heavy drinker, and uncaring parents. Douglas was married four times cheating on each of his first three wives with her eventual successor. Do you believe in kissing your bride, sir? Oh, sure. Do you mind,

Speaker 1:          06:49          this is footage from his last marriage to his wife Kathleen. He was 67 she was 22

Speaker 2:          06:55          Oh yes.

Speaker 1:          06:57          So yes, yes. That is. That is William Douglas. So you have these two guys, Frankfurt or the Bantam Rooster. Douglas the prick. And as you can imagine, they hated each other. They just despised each other. So Frankfurter had this habit of monologuing and while he would go on and on, Douglas would just pull out a book right in front of him and just start reading. You know, he was just open and his disdain for Frankfurter. I actually found a series of interviews that were done with Douglas in the early sixties, where he basically calls frankfurter names.

Speaker 5:          07:28          No, see evil, utterly dishonest. Intellectually. He was very great, devious. He spent his time going up and down the holes, putting the poisons in everybody's sprawl.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Wow. Why did they hate each other so much? Well, according to Mike Seidman,

Speaker 8:          07:47          some of that comes from maybe their difference in background. Frank footer was a Jewish immigrant from Austria. A Douglas was a westerner,

Speaker 1:          07:59          but according to him, the core of their hatred actually was ideological,

Speaker 8:          08:03          had reflected, um, a really important split over how powerful the court should be. Though for frank footer, courts just ought not to intervene.

Speaker 1:          08:14          He believed that in many matters should be left up to the political process and the courts should stay out of those issues.

Speaker 8:          08:21          It's Douglas. Um, he thought just the opposite. He thought that courts want to intervene to protect, for example, minority groups, free speech rights, things of that sort.

Speaker 1:          08:33          So you had this personal feud going. You had this ideological war that was brewing in the court and into the middle of all this

Speaker 2:          08:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:44          Lux, Charles, whatever you might call them, the swing vote. Okay. This is Alan Colton. I was a supreme court clerk. Justice Whitaker from 1957 to 1958 Whitaker grew up in a small town in Kansas called Troy. The activist is a flashy, this is his granddaughter kicked you tend to kind of a one room school house. Verby a little red school house. Worked on the farm, but he, he, he determined that was not the life for him. Kate says when he was around 16 he became obsessed with the idea of becoming a lawyer and she says he would actually practice law to the animals. Can you imagine, you know, pushing the plow along in the fields and then lecturing and arguing cases to the cows or to the horses or whatever. Did you really hear that he was lecturing dude? Yes. Oh and on the side he was, he would hunt, he would hunt a squirrels, possum, raccoons, dunks, and he'd sell the pelts for a few dollars and he amassed I think $700 with that money you put himself through law school.

Speaker 1:          09:51          My understanding is that he simultaneously went to law school and high school what, which is just mind boggling, but yeah, apparently he went to the head of the law school in Kansas City and he's like, I don't have a high school diploma, but you need to let me in. The Dean just saw how ambitious he was and he was impressed and he's like, all right, you're in. I love this guy. He's like, Mr bootstraps. Totally any how to make a long story short, sone became a top lawyer and Alan Cohen says that's because he would do better than all of his opponents. He would outwork them out, prepare them, great attention to detail, great presence before a jury and then he becomes a judge. First, a federal district judge and then an appeals court judge. Then in February of 1957 he gets the call.

Speaker 9:          10:34          Carla was in the evening and they asked if he could be in Washington. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:37          and the next morning, and this is Kentwood a group, Charles Whitaker's son. He should certainly, but my best blue shoot deals at the cleaners tonight. What did he wear? I, as a matter of fact, my mother or someone else got the cleaners to open up at night

Speaker 3:          10:54          in the first stern must be allegation tending to show that the corporation's right dog exercise of free will let them destroy.

Speaker 1:          11:04          This is one of the first times that Whitaker spoke on the bench and he interjects with a question for the attorney and he is the Midwestern plate.

Speaker 3:          11:11          Yes. I guess the, you've had so many interruptions but I have a question or two. I wonder if I might have the privilege of asking sir. I think

Speaker 1:          11:20          the thing that's crazy to me is that he walked into the highest court in the land and he didn't even go to college. I think it's important to understand that he had no formal education really. In other words, he never took history or political science or social science, but he loved the law. My father was not an ideal law.

Speaker 9:          11:41          He expected the court to be an arena in which there were lively arguments on legal issues and that's what he enjoyed. What he, what's really good at

Speaker 1:          11:54          what he loved as Kent Whittaker puts it. His Dad was kind of the walking embodiment of that thing that chief justice John Roberts said back in 2005 during his confirmation hearing your chairman, I come before the committee with no agenda. He was sort of a blank slate. It's my job to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat. My father was not interested in advancing a cause or a fury, but frankly that seems how a justice should be. That you are approaching it without a political agenda and you're deciding it.

Speaker 9:          12:26          In theory. That's exactly right, but in practice, so many of their cases, there is no wall to turn to to decide those cases.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Ken says that his dad quickly discovered that law, the Supreme Court is never clean. Cut cases make it there. Precisely because the law isn't clear. Many of their cases are just without precedent, and it's in those cases,

Speaker 9:          12:52          at least you have must have. Your ideology is a as a starting point,

Speaker 1:          13:00          and the fact that he didn't have an ideology that left him vulnerable, he was definitely getting lobbied from both sides, Frankfurt or on one side, Douglas on the other. You were the new kid on the block and was being pulled by each one. He didn't like the way the judges bullied for votes within his first three months. He found himself in the middle of a death penalty case.

Speaker 2:          13:22          She was found in her bedroom by firemen taken outside and soon thereafter pronounced that

Speaker 1:          13:28          a guy had been tried for arson and murder and Douglas and the liberals wanted to intervene to help them. They felt like he'd been treated unfairly by the lower courts, but frankfurter in the Conservatives thought that the supreme court should be cautious. They should honor precedent. Now, according to Justice Douglas, justice Whittaker was undecided all the time. Douglas would tell him one thing, oh, well, yeah, that seems right. And then just as frank herder would say something else and you say, oh gosh, that sounds right. I think there was some thought that he might side with the guy who talked with him last, you know, he ends up being so undecided on this death penalty case that he forces the court to delay the vote until the next term and there were a series of cases like [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          14:08          this Halbert ill tro,

Speaker 1:          14:10          where the law would be fuzzy ideologies would harden and Whitaker. He would be right in the middle of the physical depictions of him in that first year from people who saw him, described somebody who was restless, terribly unhappy. I had lost a lot of weight. Nervous was agitated most of the time. It was a lot of stress on him.

Speaker 2:          14:36          I mean, I took, this was just quicker that in normal course on the California procedure, the medical, yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:40          Great. Perfect. Over the next few years, he bounces back. He finds his feet. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:44          You say that the judgment on probation, his

Speaker 9:          14:48          production increased substantially in

Speaker 10:         14:52          his third year, his fourth year and part of his fifth year. He wrote as many opinions as any other judge. He wrote as many dissenting opinions as any other judge. He was one of the nine. He was fully implied and he wrote some very important opinions during that period of time and along came a baker versus Carr and it broke them.

Speaker 4:          15:22          [inaudible] it's coming up.

Speaker 6:          16:52          see ya. Hey, this is more perfect. I'm jet apple. I'm Rod. Let's get back to our story from Susie Lichtenberg about the case that broke two justices.

Speaker 2:          17:05          [inaudible] number 180 Trey Charles w your banker at out, but tell him a balance versus Joe C car and Allen [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          17:14          Okay, so it's April 19th, 1961

Speaker 14:         17:18          does chief justice man please the court,

Speaker 6:          17:20          the supreme court is hearing Baker versus Carr.

Speaker 14:         17:23          Yes, it is an individual voting rights case run by 11 qualified voters in the state of Tennessee.

Speaker 6:          17:34          Now on the surface, Baker versus Carr was about districts and how people are counted in this country. And this is one of the most basic ways that political power gets assigned in America. Yeah. Like you know, as populations grow in size, that growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people

Speaker 15:         17:50          that are representing them. But at that time

Speaker 16:         17:52          in Tennessee, Tennessee hadn't changed its legislative district.

Speaker 14:         17:57          The last reapportion months, one in 19 and one

Speaker 16:         17:59          since 1901, which was 60 years earlier. Well, this created big problems for urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years people had moved to the cities in droves and rural areas were getting smaller, but the Tennessee state legislature had refused to update its count. Right. And it was still giving more representation to those rural areas

Speaker 15:         18:22          in Tennessee. Um, the figure was 23 to one, NYU law professor Sam is that girl. For people that don't understand that, how does it actually dilute your vote? Well, I mean, this is very simple. You have one district that has, uh, one person in it and you have another district that has 23 people in it. The district that has one person gives all the power to that one person, the district that has 23 people, uh, spreads it out over all 23. Wait, what?

Speaker 16:         18:52          All right, think of it this way. At that time, a person in the city in Tennessee had one 23rd as much of a voice in the legislature as a person living in the countryside. And heres sort of the insidious underbelly of that, it just so happened that the people living in the countryside are mostly white and a large percentage of the people living in the city were black.

Speaker 15:         19:13          Underlying all of the reapportionment litigation, at least in the south, was white supremacy.

Speaker 16:         19:20          That's Doug Smith

Speaker 15:         19:21          historian and the author of on Democracy's doorstep. This was deeply tied to white supremacy and the maintenance of Jim Crow. It was a method of making sure that rural white legislatures continue to control the power structure.

Speaker 16:         19:33          So you had this situation, he says were a small minority was choking the majority,

Speaker 15:         19:37          choking the the cities and the growing suburban areas from any source, any sorts of funds.

Speaker 16:         19:42          The cities couldn't get the money they needed for roads, education, social services. So the question at the supreme court was, and they would actually tackle this in two separate hearings, what should they do about this,

Speaker 14:         19:54          Aaron, you have your back

Speaker 16:         19:58          and here's where you get to the ideological smackdown liberals on the court, like Douglas basically agreed with the plaintiff when they are,

Speaker 14:         20:05          I say there's nothing in the congregational United States of America that are nothing in the constitution of Tennessee. That state government must remain an agricultural commodity and there's nothing good either one of those constitution that said it takes 20 city residents to equal one farm.

Speaker 16:         20:23          Liberals were like, yeah, this is clearly an injustice. People in the cities are getting screwed.

Speaker 14:         20:28          Their voting rights have been alluded and debates to the point of nullification.

Speaker 16:         20:33          Well, the conservatives are like, yes, people are

Speaker 15:         20:35          getting hurt, but we're not going to do anything about it. We can't. Frankfurter

Speaker 14:         20:40          may affect the does a rotten rejoice in doesn't mean a call today.

Speaker 15:         20:44          Most specifically said we cannot get involved at as bad. This is, there was not an issue that the court should get involved in. Why now?

Speaker 14:         20:51          I do have to think of the road that I'm going on. What kind of role you're inviting me.

Speaker 16:         20:56          He was like, think of where this will lead.

Speaker 14:         20:58          Considering the fact that this is unique and if the situate isn't a unique Tennessee situation.

Speaker 16:         21:04          If we end up doing this in Tennessee, pretty soon we'll be intervening in California, South Carolina. Pretty soon we'll be rewriting the entire U s legislative map.

Speaker 14:         21:13          Have to think of a lot of states, and this is just fantasy for me. This is the United States, not Tennessee.

Speaker 16:         21:20          Yeah, so basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in politics and he really believed that the courts should never ever get involved in politics. This is a, this is an idea that goes way back to something called the [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         21:34          political question doctrine. Political question doctrine. Political question. Doctrine says no federal court can decide this issue at all. The courts simply had no business getting into what were considered to be fundamentally political questions and what could be more fundamentally political than the makeup of a legislature. It's a philosophy rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not be substituting their will for the will of the people's elected representatives.

Speaker 16:         22:05          Frederick felt like even if you have a terrible political situation, if the justice has stepped in and overruled the legislature, that would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would be fundamentally undemocratic. He viewed, he viewed the political question doctrine is a crucial limitation on the federal judicial power and he wasn't alone. The courts had followed this guideline for about 150 years and even with the current case in Tennessee,

Speaker 15:         22:29          the federal court that first heard the case recognized the situation and actually referred to it as an [inaudible].

Speaker 14:         22:35          The evil is a serious one, but should be corrected without further delay in quote.

Speaker 15:         22:40          All right. You said that this is a, this is a political question. Malapportionment is a political question and only the political branches can handle this, right?

Speaker 14:         22:48          Of course they have no power to do anything about protecting and enforcing the voting rights of these plaintiffs.

Speaker 16:         22:57          So

Speaker 14:         22:58          Belize the myth, man, that's cool.

Speaker 16:         22:59          When the lawyer for Tennessee got up there,

Speaker 14:         23:01          I am not here defending the legislature.

Speaker 16:         23:04          He didn't try to defend how Tennessee was counting or not counting. It's people. He basically said, yeah, what we're doing is bad, but it's nobody's job but ours to fix.

Speaker 14:         23:14          Is it worth for the legislature of Tennessee not to reapportion or is it worse? Well, the Federal District Gourds, finally the age old doc separating,

Speaker 16:         23:31          he basically said, if you step in, you're going to screw up the balance of power in America. The power in America comes from we, the people, not the courts. So this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected representatives. Wait a second. If the whole problem

Speaker 1:          23:46          is that you don't have a voice in the legislature, then how can you suddenly just have a voice in the legislature? I mean, the only way to change it would be if the legislature itself were to give up power and why would they do that? Because of course, once elected officials are in power, they have a vested interest in keeping their districts exactly as they are because those were the districts that elected them. And fundamentally, electoral representatives knew that if they redrew the lines, that they would be, um, voting themselves out of political power that Ski Charles Professor Duke Law School. So they had an incentive not to do anything about this. So for the liberals on the court, they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be fixed and nobody was going to fix it if they didn't fix it. But for Frankfurter, he's like, if you fix this one, you're gonna have to fix it. That one and that one and that one and that one. And where's it going to stop? If you do this, there is no way out.

Speaker 17:         24:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:42          the court's going to get stuck in what he called [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         24:45          political thicken. Ah, the political thicken of the court must not enter the political thicket. That sounds like frankfurter. He must've written those words. And the imagery at the thicket is that, uh, you know, the deer very proudly with his new horns goes into the thicket, gets entangled and can never get out. Frank for years, claim was once the courts are in, there will be nothing beyond it and someday the courts will be forced to declare winners and losers of very high profile elections.

Speaker 17:         25:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:21          okay. So after the oral arguments are over in Baker vs Carr, that justice is headed to conference. That's a meeting with just the nine and when they went into the conference, basically the court would divided right down the middle and Charles Whittaker, he was a potential swing vote. Whitaker was deeply torn

Speaker 17:         25:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:40          he'd been leaning Frankfurter's way, but

Speaker 3:          25:43          if there is a clear constitutional right that's being violated

Speaker 15:         25:48          during those first, that first argument, he asked a number of questions that suggested a great deal of sympathy with the plaintiff.

Speaker 3:          25:54          Sam Is there not power and duty in the court to enforce that constitutional rights?

Speaker 15:         26:04          There was a lot of thought that he might actually come down on the side of, of the plaintiffs in that case. And I think that's where frankfurter really, really began to to rip into him

Speaker 1:          26:12          Justice Frankfurter right after the first oral argument during the conference, even 90 minutes speech, so talked for 90 plus straight minutes, darting around the room, pulling books off the shelves, holding books off the shelf, reading from prior cases, just sticky collating wildly to make his point and the whole time looking directly at Whitaker. There was one account that I heard where frankfurter went on for four hours, four hours really lecturing Whitaker really, really belittling him. This guy, yes it was. It was horribly intimidating.

Speaker 16:         26:51          At one point, one of the justices on the liberal side, Justice Hugo black, he took Whitaker aside.

Speaker 12:         26:57          Black was trying to make him feel better and black said to Charles, weird occurred. Just remember, we're all boys grown tall. We're not the gods who sit on high and dispense justice, but it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role,

Speaker 16:         27:15          particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything.

Speaker 1:          27:19          This started to weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind.

Speaker 17:         27:25          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          27:25          He was disturbed by the, by having the way to the supreme court on his shoulders.

Speaker 17:         27:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          27:31          according to his family, Kate and Ken, my mother tells me that he at that time was under a lot of stress and spoke as though he were dictating, spoke his punctuation. Hello Judith Comma, it's very nice to meet you, period. Clearly thinking about everything that he might say being recorded. I remember his stating that it felt like all the words that he uttered were being jeweled in stone as a result of which he said you don't talk much.

Speaker 17:         28:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         28:12          so after they heard the case the first time [inaudible] couldn't make up his mind. And actually incidentally there was another justice

Speaker 1:          28:19          justice Stewart who was the other swing vote in the case who also couldn't make up his mind.

Speaker 18:         28:26          Okay.

Speaker 16:         28:26          The court decided to hear the case again in the fall just because they needed more time

Speaker 1:          28:33          and over the summer, interesting. Halfway to Chris said he remained deeply divided that he'd actually written memos on both sides of the issue. Doug Smith says, Whittaker wrote both an opinion for

Speaker 16:         28:43          intervening and bigger versus car and a descent against intervening and bigger versus car at the same time.

Speaker 1:          28:51          Meanwhile, as he's doing this, justice frankfurters circulates a 60 page memo explaining how this was a political question that should not be decided by the courts.

Speaker 12:         29:02          Scott, you know a fire in his belly. He's not gonna let this one

Speaker 3:          29:06          number six, Charles Deputy Baker, that was tell him

Speaker 16:         29:11          Monday, October 9th, 1961 it's 10:00 AM and the court is back again.

Speaker 3:          29:16          Does that change justice and please,

Speaker 16:         29:18          hello, you're arguing the case against the Tennessee legislature begins,

Speaker 3:          29:21          Tennessee voters seek federal court protection.

Speaker 16:         29:25          Frankfurter sits quietly for about five minutes listening

Speaker 3:          29:29          without the light, and then you don't mean to him because if you start to go wrong, you start to look the same time I add no right for the fifth time, I did not miss the justice right ratio. You gave a minute. My child's again, termination of the state. I wasn't trying to deal with that. The problem doesn't include any state. It's different when you and much more, well, it's passed on it by denying or right under it. If that isn't passing on it. I don't know. Why does pappy, of course not. Mr. Justice Frankfurter

Speaker 19:         30:00          Frankfurter hammers the attorney's with questions during the course of oral arguments. He speaks approximately 170 times 170 170. Damn Charles Whittaker.

Speaker 3:          30:11          You have some system for the allocation of its legislate doors to districts or county

Speaker 19:         30:18          17 times.

Speaker 3:          30:19          Well, uh, essentially

Speaker 19:         30:22          after nearly four hours of oral arguments,

Speaker 3:          30:24          the race has now

Speaker 10:         30:27          the justice is recess and go into conference. Frankfurter needed desperately. He had a good Winokur and he would kept after him like a dog after a bone trying to persuade them and that harassing he got, I have to make a point here. It was a nightmare and I saw the nightmare.

Speaker 12:         30:54          How so? Describe it to me. Well, he was

Speaker 17:         30:58          okay.

Speaker 12:         31:01          A nervous wreck and like a cat on a hot tin roof. I found out, I don't know if he told me or his wife told me he was on tranquilizers to try to overcome what he thought was just work related stress. Well, clearly something was taking hold of him who had trouble concentrating. Highly fraught. I would characterize his eventual breakdown as something of a slow descent

Speaker 17:         31:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         31:29          by the early spring after the court had returned from its winter recess, a Whitaker was absent from the court.

Speaker 12:         31:41          You mean like he just didn't, he like didn't show for work one day apparently. So it's clerks didn't know where he was. Um, the other justices didn't know his whereabouts. He just disappeared really in the middle of what's going to become one of the, you know, monumental decisions of the 20th century. He disappears. He had to escape. Where did he go? Well, he went to really what would be a cabin in the woods in the middle of Wisconsin and he, he called up one of his former law associates in Kansas City to come up and join him.

Speaker 19:         32:20          And according to Craig Smith, he in this guy whose name was Sam ob, they would just sit there on the bank of the lake in silence.

Speaker 17:         32:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         32:44          they would sit for hours on end, not talking to each other, just waiting for the justice to speak.

Speaker 20:         33:05          No cause for pride and what has happened. And so, you know, we have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment. But I imagine

Speaker 19:         33:15          he was just sitting there and he was thinking about these two realities that could unfold. Like on the one hand, if the court stepped into politics, they could protect him.

Speaker 17:         33:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          33:36          but on the other hand, it's gonna precedent with this set. It's a sad deal. Mr President, when we weekend, would it make the court too powerful? Marsha Richard, shiny versus Albert Gore, in which case your Bush protect the people as received president of the United States 200 and images. Mine went back and forth, back and forth. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         33:56          Well, and when Whitaker decided that he really had to get back to work, then this protege would say to him, no, just relax dude. Just take it easy. And, um, get yourself together before you decide to go back.

Speaker 19:         34:17          After three weeks, justice Whitaker returns to DC

Speaker 9:          34:20          back to Washington, uh, for a few days.

Speaker 19:         34:24          That's Ken Tigan, his son. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          34:26          well, you found my father to be really in Extremis, uh, a debate and, and I think a borderline suicidal.

Speaker 19:         34:36          When you said he was suicidal, what do you mean

Speaker 9:          34:40          there? There was an instance in which my brother found my father going upstairs to get a shotgun.

Speaker 17:         34:51          Yeah.

Speaker 19:         34:56          A few days later, Charles Woodpecker checks himself into a hospital.

Speaker 12:         35:00          There is some evidence that it was really justice Douglas who convinced Whitaker to go to the hospital.

Speaker 5:          35:07          I do recall that. I have a nervous breakdown.

Speaker 6:          35:13          That's justice William Douglas again.

Speaker 17:         35:17          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          35:18          He was at Walter Reed Hospital and I've been up to see him that she had been up to see him.

Speaker 17:         35:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          35:28          he wasn't very current physical condition. Very worried and depressed. Yes. I thought he should do. I told him I didn't think that he was being in a position to decide what he should do until they get well.

Speaker 21:         35:50          A few weeks later, March 29 1962 the presidential press conference from the new State Department Auditorium, Washington d c several announcements to make. It is with extreme regret that I announced the retirement of associate justice of the Supreme Court, Charles Evans, Whitaker effective April 1st justice Whitaker. I remember the Supreme Court for nearly five years and of the federal judiciary. Vanilli eight years is retiring at the written direction of his position or reasons of disability. I know that the bench and the bar of the entire nation join me in commending Mr. Justice Whitaker for his devoted service to his country during a critical period in it's history. Next, I want to take this opportunity to stress again the importance of the tax bill now before the House of Representatives.

Speaker 1:          36:47          Wow. Just being made and whatever happened with the case with they can record. Well, Whitaker didn't vote on bigger versus car, so you could say that this case that essentially broke him, his vote didn't count. Wow. Not around the time that he was in the hospital, there was sort of this liberal coup at the court where Frankfurter lost a couple of other votes. So in the end, the decision actually wasn't very close at all. What was it? It was six to ah, Frankie. Yeah. And Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole kind of cluster that we've been fighting over of how states and Tennessee count their voters, that this is something the courts can and should look at. So in other words, they decided to lower their Ahrens and go into the thicket. Oh, Yay. They did. No. Yay. Um, and just one or two final questions. Um, what happened to Justice Frankfurter?

Speaker 13:         37:35          Well, the, the thing that I find perhaps most extraordinary is it less than two weeks after the decision in Baker vs Carr came down, Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme Court and Frankfurter Secretary found him sprawled on the floor of his office from a stroke. He suffered a massive stroke and then never returned to service. And while he was in the hospitals, solicitor general, Archibald Cox visited Frankfurter. And Frankfurter. He, he was in a wheelchair and could barely speak, but he apparently conveyed to Archibald Cox that the decision maker versus car had essentially caused his stroke. He felt so passionately that the court should stay out of the case that he physically physically deteriorated after the court had gone the other way. [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         38:47          after Baker versus Carr, President Kennedy essentially had two Supreme Court vacancies to fill now Whitaker seat. He filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate Frankfurter's vacancy. That second vacancy.

Speaker 12:         38:59          It's that vacancy that will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg. That is the fifth vote that the four liberals would are regarded as the four liberals. That becomes the fifth vote that they need really to create what has come to be regarded as the Warren court revolution.

Speaker 22:         39:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          39:27          this is when the supreme court basically became an agent for social change. That revolution that begins with the 1962 term. That's the revolution that is going to change this dark tower that at one man, one vote, the way we withdraw our political boundaries. Then the prosecutor withheld and fashion the way we think of criminal justice [inaudible] small black armband, the way we treat first amendment, religious education, religious and obscenity issues. That's the war in court that people remember. And that's the court that came into existence with Felix Frankfurter left.

Speaker 16:         40:09          And so just thinking about that question that that woman asked all the way at the beginning of the story. Yes. Could you, um, address what I see is the increasing politicization of the court, the apotheosis of which I guess was, uh, you know, voting or electing Bush to be our president. You can kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker vs Carr all the way to December 9th, 2000

Speaker 15:         40:38          block here on the east. The polls in six new states have just closed. And the lead story at this hour is the state of Florida is too close to call. I think fields from, for to with us said C. And what we found was, and that's what I told you, that's what would happen, is that eventually you will, you will be deciding a partisan question, which presidential candidate essentially received the most votes for those who felt themselves on the losing side of pushy core. This was just this Frankfurter's revenge.

Speaker 12:         41:16          This was the moment that a Baker v Carr had opened up. And when I teach this to students, uh, and particularly in the decade after Bush v Gore, when, uh, the, the, the center sent to Ben Sentiments about this were still quite,

Speaker 15:         41:34          I would say to them, well, is this was frankfurter, right? And I remember a student, uh, in the mid two thousands who said, uh, in class, I never thought I would say this, but because I hated the outcome and Bush Free Gore, I was so angry when the court interceded. But if push Sri Gores the price we have to pay for the courts, making the overall political system work somewhat more tolerably properly. It's a price I'm willing to pay.

Speaker 3:          42:05          Oh,

Speaker 1:          42:09          before we totally sign off what happened to Douglas, we sort of lost track of him. So after Baker versus Carr was decided, he went on to be a supreme court justice for 13 more years. And to this day, he actually holds the record for being the longest serving justice of all time, 36 years. And Frankfurter. So Baker vs Carr was the last case that he ever heard, and he died a few years afterwards and, and, and Charles would accrue. Did he ever recover? Well, after Whitaker retired from the court, he moved back to Kansas City with his family.
