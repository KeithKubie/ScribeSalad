00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.540
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.060
Teenage Mutant Fuckin' Ninja Turtles.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.680
This is the shit!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.940
When we were growing up, Ninja Turtles were everywhere:

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.620
Comic books, TV shows, breakfast cereals...

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.640
They even had a pie named after 'em!

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.580
It tasted like splooge, but we didn't care.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.880
As long as it had the Ninja Turtles on it, we were happy.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.680
So when we heard they were actually making a live-action movie based on this phenomenon,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.140
we proudly pissed our pants with joy.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.800
We shit ourselves with excitement.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.600
We vomited up vast amounts of excrement,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.820
shit on it, rolled around in it, put it back in our mouths,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.420
and proceeded to vomit it up again in roaring anticipation!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.600
...

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.140
...Okay, maybe only I did that,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.920
but still, bottom line, we were hyped as hell!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.440
These movies kicked ass back then, and I'm sure they're gonna kick ass now.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.580
Which is to say, I haven't actually seen these movies in years.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.660
But that's why, as a special treat, I'm gonna sit down and review the movies WITH you...

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240
...as you're watching it with me.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.800
So, grab your vintage Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle box of cookies and enjoy the show!

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.960
*gag*

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.600
...Just watch the movie.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.140
Alright, New York. So far, so good.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.760
Actually, I like this opening, because it doesn't even look like a Ninja Turtles movie.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.040
This could be the opening to Shaft. Watch:

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.920
("Shaft" theme)
♪Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?♪

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.860
♪Shaft!♪

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.920
You see?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.720
April O'Neil, Channel 3 Eyewitness New—

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.140
NC:
Whoa, whoa,
whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoaWHOA.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.020
WHO is that?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.160
April O'Neil—

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.580
No, no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.220
Listen, lady, I'm sure you're a fine actress and everything, but, uh...

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.280
You're not April O'Neil.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.000
No, no, this hot honey you see here is April O'Neil.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.980
Yellow jumpsuit, nice legs... damn, she's fine!

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.860
So come on, where's the real April O'Neil?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.800
Come on, cough her up!

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.980
Charles:
Just what is going on out there, April?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.580
Okay, alright, no, no, it's cool, it's cool, you know, no prob.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.940
I mean, at least we still get to see her in the yellow jumpsuit, right?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.280
NC:
OH, COME ON!

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.780
That's not a jumpsuit! That's a RAINCOAT!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.140
There IS a difference! There is a difference!

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.380
Look, you watching? I'll show you the difference.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.480
Here, watch close:

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.400
Jumpsuit,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.960
raincoat.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.640
Jumpsuit,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.260
raincoat!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.840
Jumpsuit, raincoat, jumpsuit, raincoat, jumpsuit, rain—

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.040
THEY LOOK NOTHING ALIKE!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
All I gotta say is, the Turtles had better be a hell of a lot better...

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.860
Leonardo:
Awesome!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.520
Michelangelo:
Hahah, righteous!

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.680
Excuse me one moment:

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.260
OH MY GOD, LOOK AT THOSE COSTUMES! Those are INCREDIBLE!

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640
That is EXACTLY what radioactive ninjutsu reptiles in their late teens would look like!

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.980
I mean, they're unbelievable! I mean, they're phenomenal!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.120
I mean, OH MY GO—

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.260
I apologize for that.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.060
But even you had to admit, those costumes are pretty incredible.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.100
The guy who put these all together was Jim Henson, the Muppet guy,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.560
and do you know how much those puppeteers had to squat

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.480
in order to get their hands up those asses?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.120
It's not even worth thinking about!

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.120
If this movie was done today, chances are they'd probably turn them all

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.860
into computer-generated images.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.760
Huh—bullshit!

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.340
They set out to rescue April from the evil Foot Clan, who want to destroy her

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.680
because she's giving evil pajama-wearing psychopaths a bad name.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.740
*smack*

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.120
NC:
Oh no, you di'in't!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.260
Alright, April's gonna kick some ass!

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.300
*clatter*

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.320
*sheesh*

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.800
NC:
As you probably guessed, the Turtles save April and take her back to their home in the sewers.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.420
There, she meets the Ninja Turtles' mentor, a giant rat named Splinter.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.120
And I have to admit, saying this all out loud is making me realize

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.880
just how friggin' weird this movie is.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.880
Raphael:
Where do they come up with this stuff?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.880
So Splinter explains to April the origin of where they came from.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.360
You see, years ago, Splinter was just an ordinary pet rat in Japan.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.560
After his master is murdered, Splinter somehow makes it to New York,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.660
and comes across a canister of ooze and four baby turtles.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.060
Within a day, both the turtles and Splinter grow in size and even begin to form words.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.740
Baby Turtle:
Pizza... pizza!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.140
It could happen!

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.360
Splinter decides to name them after the famous Renaissance painters,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.740
because giant, mutated turtles seem to scream of the Renaissance period.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.340
It made sense back then!

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.920
Wondering how much acid she dropped, April decides to help them defeat the Foot

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.380
and bring order to the city.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.740
And either way, they're helped by a vigilante known as Casey Jones,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.720
who's pretty cool, despite the fact that he looks like Jason's homosexual Canadian brother.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.500
Casey:
Oooh!

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.840
Now the leader of the Foot Clan is an evil kitchen utensil known as The Shredder,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.520
which everyone says is a giant Darth Vader ripoff, but I don't see the resemblance.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.860
Shredder:
I am your father!

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.640
Okay, it's a ripoff!

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.220
But you gotta give this guy credit, he has a diabolical scheme to...

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.420
...actually, what was the plan again?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.500
Shredder:
Punish these... Turtles.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.660
*snickers*

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.440
I'm sorry, uh... I don't care how menacing or powerful you are, uh...

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.840
There's no way you can make "punishing turtles" sound threatening.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.660
I'm sorry, it's just not humanly possible. BUT...

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.600
You see, he's using kids and teenagers to fight his battles.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.800
If you went up to a hitman and said you wanted them to hunt down some turtles,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.620
they'd probably laugh in your face.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.680
However, if you get a bunch of stupid kids, stone them off their asses,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.080
get dressed up in shiny metal, recruit them to be ninjas,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.340
and THEN ask them to hunt down some turtles?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.400
Duuude, sign me up!

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.700
Michelangelo:
Awesome!

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.460
My only problem with this plan is the costumes they're assigned.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.480
I mean, I know they're supposed to be ninjas and everything,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.440
but those costumes are so tight, I don't even think they can TALK.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.400
*mumbling orders to each other*

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.480
Hur-dur-dur-dur-dur?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.340
*CLANG*
AAHH!

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.460
One of the things I love about this movie is the Turtles' disguises,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.460
which is pretty much just a trench coat and a fedora hat.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.700
How can nobody recognize them in that?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.680
I mean, how stupid do people have to be to NOT recognize a big turtle in a trench coat?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.460
Cabbie:
Looked like sort of a big toytle... in a trench coat.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.600
NC:
The movie comes to a thrilling climax at the top of a tall building,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.500
where The Shredder challenges our heroes to a man-on-turtle brawl.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.720
And of course, being the Ninja Turtles...

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.520
...they get their green asses handed to them.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.380
Michelangelo *panting*:
What point did we lose control here?

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.320
NC:
But all that changes when Splinter comes into the picture.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.380
It's sensei vs. sensei, giant rat vs. giant cheese grater,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.100
the battle of all battles begins! Here it goes...

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.100
*yelling*

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.980
This is gonna be good!

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.320
Here it comes!

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.500
*clang*

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.820
BULLSHIT!!

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.320
What kind of a battle was THAT?!

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.440
He sticks out his foot like a cartoon character, and he TRIPS?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.280
What a rip-off!

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.120
*whatevs*

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.660
NC: All I gotta say is, the next film had better be a lot better...

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.720
And what exactly IS the secret of the ooze?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.500
It was made... in a LABORATORY!

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.560
And... that's about it. There's not really any surprises on top of that.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.660
Kind of a big letdown.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.960
But the Turtles are back, and this time around, they're...

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.540
...well, more kid-friendly, I guess.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.980
After all the parents complained about the violence and swearing in the first film—

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.400
you know, everything that made it GOOD—

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.080
—the second film tones down the action and the bad language.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
So instead of using their weapons to fight people,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.820
they use stuff like cold food, belts, and yo-yos.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.180
You know, stuff you find lying around the house, so now all your kids will know

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.500
how to turn ordinary household appliances into blunt bad-ass weapons.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.200
Thank you, parents of America!

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.280
Splinter:
Idiots.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.440
NC:
And as for the bad language...

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.160
I don't know, I don't remember too much swearing in the first film...

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.440
Michelangelo:
Ninja kick the damn rabbit!

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.100
Damn!

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.920
Damn.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.180
DAAAMMN!

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.540
Okay, okay, so every kid was swearing like a bastard after they saw this movie.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.040
But granted, it's a LOT better than their original cut:

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960
(VO from "Boyz n the Hood")
Fuck that, man! Them niggas around the corner tripped out, man!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.340
Where my—fuck that, man! Where my strap? FUCK that sh—

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.780
Never let Spike Lee direct a children's movie.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.320
Michelangelo:
Can you believe this guy?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.380
So the story centers around the return of the sinister Shredder.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.560
After doing a short ripoff of Tim Burton's Batman,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.840
he gets back into action by plotting his revenge against those pop-culture spewing reptiles.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.120
Michelangelo:
Bummer! *coughs*

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.720
NC:
He steals a canister of ooze from that guy in "Titanic", and decides to make his own evil mutants.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.020
Within seconds, two innocent, harmless animals are transformed into

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.800
the sinister duo of Bebop and Rocksteady!

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.580
Shredder:
Tokka! Rahzar!

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.500
NC:
Yeah, like I said, Bebop and Rocksteady.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.320
*confused grunts*

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.620
NC:
Now the one scene everyone remembers is the fight scene that takes place

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.020
in the whitest of all rap clubs, led by the whitest of all rappers.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.740
You guessed it: Vanilla Ice.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.900
Turtles *groaning*:
Oh, no!

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.720
Gee, it looks like they're pretty freaked out about all those monsters breaking into their club!

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.940
But wait a minute...

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.980
I think the Ice is feelin' somethin'.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I think he's conjuring up a rap!

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.800
A sort of... ninja rap, if you will!

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.940
Vanilla Ice:
♪Yo, it's the green machine—♪

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.600
HE IS!

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.420
Look at that! A totally unrehearsed, yet somehow totally choreographed rap scene

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.480
entirely made up on the fly!

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.260
What. Talent.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.920
I gotta tell you, this guy is goin' places!

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.500
Like the unemployment line!

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.100
So the film climaxes as The Shredder drinks what's left of the mutated ooze

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.140
and turns into a mutant himself.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.840
Jesus Christ, look at that! THAT is a badass villain!

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.520
Donatello:
It's a Super Shredder!

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.780
Alright, this is gonna make up for the shitty climax in the last movie.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.640
Four mutant turtles vs. one giant mutant Shredder?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.820
This is gonna be good!

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.260
*death groan*

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.620
*rage intensifies*

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.800
WHAT THE FUCK?!?

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.580
Are you telling me that a regular Shredder can survive a seven-story fall and a dump truck crushing him,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.220
and yet a SUPER Shredder can't survive a bunch of wood falling on him?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.060
Bullshit, bullshit, BULLSHIT!

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.520
*sigh*

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.140
You know, I'm starting to realize that, uh...

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.060
these movies aren't quite the masterpieces I remember them to be.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.240
NC:
I mean, they're weird as hell, they don't make any sense,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.880
and they keep pissing me off with their anticlimaxes!

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.020
But, I shouldn't give up hope.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.760
After all, there is still one last movie left:

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.220
And seeing how now, they've had two movies to experiment with

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.420
and find out what works and what doesn't,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.040
I think we can safely assume that THIS is gonna be the best of the bunch.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.240
So, sit back and let's enjoy "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III".

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.540
*sobbing*
Oh my God, it's so terrible! IT'S SO TERRIBLE!

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.760
*looniness ensues*

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.780
BLURBITYBLURBITYBLURBITYBLAH!

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.220
*wailing*

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.360
This is the worst thing that no one should ever have to see!

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.940
It—it's afwul! It—it's terrible!

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.020
It's—it's—

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.720
It's so bad, I am forced to make up a word to describe how bad it is.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.420
This movie is... is...

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420
HORRIBUFUCKUS!

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.900
It's the most horribufuckus movie I've ever seen in my entire life!

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.320
*sigh*

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.560
Okay, like I said, these movies aren't the masterpieces we remember them to be.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.700
But it's best not to look at them as movies, but more as...

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.300
...a homework assignment.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.960
Make a movie about four mutated turtles in their late teens,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.920
who are named after Renaissance painters, led around by a giant rat,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.520
know ninjutsu, eat pizza, dress up like flashers,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.640
fight a guy who's named after a cheese grater...

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.340
...and make it plausible.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.560
And you know what? With the exception of the last movie,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.080
I'd probably give this project an A...

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.960
...minus, but still an A.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.340
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.540
*TMNT theme plays*
