00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.220
 Hi Internet !. 

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.520
 We need to talk about locks. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.920
 Physical and digital. 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.320
 In the physical world, locks are not as good as you think. 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.700
 The lock on your door stops the worries, not the thieves. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.140
 As two minutes of research will reveal to you. 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.060
 Spend more, get more. But all this will fail with time and the right tools. 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.180
 Kun physical locks are bad in the lock - 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.320
 - Generally does not matter in normal life - 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.100
 - Because thieves are tied to the material world. 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.880
 The thief must walk around the neighborhood - 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.320
 - Spend time to choose a goal - 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.360
 - This makes a house look safe, cutting most of the way to be safe. 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.540
 Every target house can attack - 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.300
 - Once, it comes with the risk that the thief actually holds the material. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.140
 But the digital is different. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.060
 Physical restrictions no longer exist. 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.100
 On the Internet, Loves a Digital Lock Protect you not only from the neighborhood thief - 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.820
 - but of all thieves everywhere. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 Because on the Internet there is nothing like distance. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 Internet thieves do not penetrate locks personally. 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 They build a "thief" experimenting with millions of combinations - 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.660
 - Just to see what will open. 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.540
 A block away from you on the street, or a complete state on the other side of the world - 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
 - The whole thing like. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.980
 Indeed, the other side of the world is better. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.860
 Someone in the East - Whatever - Steals Your Identity - 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.220
 - Has the probability of zero percent convergence to hold. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.900
 This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics - 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.420
 - Digital locks can be unbreakable. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.560
 This is encryption. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 Digital lock, without password, can not be opened. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 Thieves' programs will explore all possible possibilities - 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.720
 - But a secure password will take - 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.600
 - Longer than the heat of the universe to fade. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 No password - no login 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.680
 No matter how clever your mother is. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.500
 Your private files remain private. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.300
 This is probably the greatest social benefit that mathematics has given to people. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.080
 But it's easy to imagine a digital lock that does not open up as bad news. 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.260
 The maximum calamity! 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.820
 Time bomb, location and code disabled are locked in dead man's phone. 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.980
 However, if the information were on a piece of paper - 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.660
 - In a court room, no problem. 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.120
 In the physical world, if you can not penetrate the lock - 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.660
 - If the wall is breached. 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.280
 The community agrees, under this scenario, it is reasonable for the police to intervene - 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 - No matter what it takes. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.920
 Note: This does not mean that the closure of the material world is only materially weak - 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.700
 - but also legally weak. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.360
 It is possible to live in a world with special laws - 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.660
 - Prevent police from breaking through all locks - 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.460
 - Whatever the reason, we would not do because this would be an idiot. 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.600
 Hmmm. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.100
 Here the gears start in the heads of governments by work. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.920
 If digital locks are physically impervious - 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.760
 - Maybe it can make legally weak. 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.980
 To require the digital locks to be built with a key hole that the police have its key. 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.900
 Very protective - 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.800
 - Very confidential - 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.660
 - For emergencies only - 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.720
 - With care. 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.080
 This legal vulnerability to prevent citizens from owning digital locks is ideal - 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.040
 - To require companies to manufacture key-hole devices - 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.180
 - is the idea of ​​many governments interested in it. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 Governments note that a memo allows police to enter your home and look at your papers - 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.460
 - likes to let the police look at your phone. 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.200
 If your home is fortified, but the need is urgent, the police come with a bang. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.740
 But there is no proof to open a closed phone - 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.040
 - To comply with the note. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.420
 Not useful in any way. 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.120
 This is a problem. 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.060
 Once again, we all ideally want police to penetrate digital locks sometimes - 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 - But at our current level on the tech tree, the fact that there are digital locks that can not be opened is something that exists. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.460
 This is because they are made of mathematics, something a skilled programmer can build at home - 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.540
 - Trying to prevent digital locks for everyone very close to trying to block an idea. 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.400
 good luck- 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.600
 - Try this. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.860
 But even if it is possible to prevent the perfect digital locks in a state successfully - 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.260
 - Remember, on the Internet there is nothing like distance. 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.640
 Even if your government is an exogenous bureaucracy like the landlord that can not be corrupted - 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.380
 - There are demons elsewhere. 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.100
 Unbreakable Digital Capability is the foundation on which computing and the Internet are built. 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.840
 Exchange, purchase, blogging, video blogging, play, Twitter, fight, meet - 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.240
 - All this is possible thanks to a non-breakable digital lock. 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.140
 They have found since the computers filled the rooms - 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.160
 - But with computers in our absence now - 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.920
 - We rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives. 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.240
 Content of our minds. 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.320
 Intentional "weakness", even with the best intentions - 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.780
 - Makes everyone at risk. 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.500
 The nature of the hole is cracked to crack. 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.240
 And the nature of the Internet that brings demons to the door. 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.360
 Whatever we wish - 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.460
 - There is no way to build a digital lock that only angels can open and demons do not. 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.120
 Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant of mathematics or is less angelic than what appears on it.
