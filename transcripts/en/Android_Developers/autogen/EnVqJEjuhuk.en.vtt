out so much and so I would sort of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
out so much and so I would sort of
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.259
out so much and so I would sort of
instantly assume that was the best one

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269
instantly assume that was the best one
 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.080

you see on Google Play when you go this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
you see on Google Play when you go this
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.770

graphic exists so keep that in mind when
 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.040
graphic exists so keep that in mind when
you're creating a graphic

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050

a couple other things to keep in mind
 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.730
a couple other things to keep in mind
are that the graphic does get scaled

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740
are that the graphic does get scaled
 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.649
are that the graphic does get scaled
down for different devices so on a very

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659
down for different devices so on a very
 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.570

that's you know thousand pixels wide may

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530
that's you know thousand pixels wide may
 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.559
that's you know thousand pixels wide may
end up only being an inch across so you

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569
end up only being an inch across so you
 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.749
end up only being an inch across so you
do need to make sure that your graphic

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759
do need to make sure that your graphic
 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.969
do need to make sure that your graphic
is not only large but legible at

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979
is not only large but legible at

second step so we've got a P ok now we

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:01.420
second step so we've got a P ok now we
 

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.420
second step so we've got a P ok now we
need to add a timer for that particular

pause got some kind of nice little
 

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.250
pause got some kind of nice little
animations in there for pausing and

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260
animations in there for pausing and
 

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.210
animations in there for pausing and
resuming we have it here in the

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:49.220
resuming we have it here in the
 

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.930
resuming we have it here in the
notifications and in fact a rich

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940
notifications and in fact a rich
 

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.079

basically all there is to it so it's a
 

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.189
basically all there is to it so it's a
fairly simple app for specific purpose

00:09:58.189 --> 00:09:58.199
fairly simple app for specific purpose

and I know that Thea developer of this
this is pretty new I know he is putting

this is pretty new I know he is putting
 

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:02.720
this is pretty new I know he is putting
this together hopefully in time so that

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:02.730
this together hopefully in time so that
 

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.829
this together hopefully in time so that
we will be able to review it for the

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839
we will be able to review it for the
 

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.050
we will be able to review it for the
show so uh but you know a

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.060
show so uh but you know a
 

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.699

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640
can't get started straightaway you have
 

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.850
can't get started straightaway you have

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860
to do text entry text entry time entry
 

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.560
to do text entry text entry time entry
before you can get started yeah and

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:21.570
before you can get started yeah and
 

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.170
before you can get started yeah and
we've seen this a lot in focus groups

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180
we've seen this a lot in focus groups
 

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.689
we've seen this a lot in focus groups
that we've done with consumers is that

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:26.699
that we've done with consumers is that
 

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:28.850
that we've done with consumers is that
they will very frequently only give an

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860
they will very frequently only give an
 

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.759
they will very frequently only give an
app 30 seconds or so before they decide

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:31.769
app 30 seconds or so before they decide
 

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:35.030
app 30 seconds or so before they decide
to get rid of it and you definitely need

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
to get rid of it and you definitely need
 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.130
to get rid of it and you definitely need
to grab them yeah in the first few

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140
to grab them yeah in the first few
 

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.949
to grab them yeah in the first few
seconds we get a little jaded about

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959
seconds we get a little jaded about
 

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.230
seconds we get a little jaded about
things like tutorials and stuff like

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240
things like tutorials and stuff like
 

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.490
things like tutorials and stuff like
that but I think that if the consumer is

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500
that but I think that if the consumer is
 

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.250

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:50.550
getting them into something interesting
 

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.720
getting them into something interesting
immediately is paramount yeah the only

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:53.730
immediately is paramount yeah the only
 

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.970
immediately is paramount yeah the only
other thing that I'd suggest is honestly

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980
other thing that I'd suggest is honestly

it occupies the same mental space as the
 

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:06.290
it occupies the same mental space as the
list items I what do you think I was

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300
list items I what do you think I was
 

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.300
list items I what do you think I was
gonna say it maybe shows the other mark

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.310
gonna say it maybe shows the other mark
 

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.950

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820
I'm sort of the mental cognition here
 

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.730
I'm sort of the mental cognition here
it's like action bar and then add and

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740
it's like action bar and then add and
 

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.710
it's like action bar and then add and
then content and it struck me as a

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720
then content and it struck me as a
 

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.300
then content and it struck me as a
little bit odd as well so yeah I'd

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:17.310
little bit odd as well so yeah I'd
 

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.920
little bit odd as well so yeah I'd
considered might consider shifting that

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:18.930

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:20.610
I think the ad is more visible that way
 

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.740
I think the ad is more visible that way

I think you're gonna get more clicks
 

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.180
I think you're gonna get more clicks
that way but I think a lot of them are

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.190
that way but I think a lot of them are
 

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.519
that way but I think a lot of them are
going to be accidental and you know be

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:25.529
going to be accidental and you know be
 

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:27.140
going to be accidental and you know be
careful about that as well I love the

fairness here it's a little bit tricky

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220
fairness here it's a little bit tricky
 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.650
fairness here it's a little bit tricky
because if you put it towards the bottom

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660
because if you put it towards the bottom
 

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.480
because if you put it towards the bottom
you could be trying to hit navigation

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.490
you could be trying to hit navigation
 

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.310
you could be trying to hit navigation
and accidentally hit the the end if you

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320
and accidentally hit the the end if you
 

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.450
and accidentally hit the the end if you
put it at the top you've got the same

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:41.460
put it at the top you've got the same
 

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.579
put it at the top you've got the same
problem in the action bar so there's not

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:43.589
problem in the action bar so there's not
 

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.410
problem in the action bar so there's not
really an obvious answer but this I

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420
really an obvious answer but this I
 

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.019
really an obvious answer but this I
think just from a usability perspective

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:47.029
think just from a usability perspective
 

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:49.340
think just from a usability perspective
seems like it's going to be too too easy

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.350
seems like it's going to be too too easy
 

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.610
seems like it's going to be too too easy
to hit the bottom by mistake absolutely

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:51.620
to hit the bottom by mistake absolutely
 

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.740
to hit the bottom by mistake absolutely

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.610
and clean we'll get into some of those
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.860
and clean we'll get into some of those
specifics about it later but that's

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:57.870
specifics about it later but that's
 

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.960
specifics about it later but that's
that's the functionality nice and simple

00:11:59.960 --> 00:11:59.970
that's the functionality nice and simple
 

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.000
that's the functionality nice and simple
yeah they framed it nicely which I love

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.010
yeah they framed it nicely which I love
 

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.980
yeah they framed it nicely which I love
that exactly it's a standard action bar

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:03.990
that exactly it's a standard action bar
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.540
that exactly it's a standard action bar
but with definitely a color scheme

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:05.550
but with definitely a color scheme
 

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.600
but with definitely a color scheme

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.610
that's on the consistent tonight yeah so
 

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.130
that's on the consistent tonight yeah so
yeah I think the only other thing that I

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140
yeah I think the only other thing that I
 

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.840
yeah I think the only other thing that I
would say is I think that this should

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:11.850
would say is I think that this should
 

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.550
would say is I think that this should
probably be centered or something like

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560
probably be centered or something like
 

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.170
probably be centered or something like

this is an app where when I first looked
 

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.680
this is an app where when I first looked
at it on Google Play I wasn't expecting

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:45.690
at it on Google Play I wasn't expecting
 

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.200

Lambada fonts you've got this
 

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.220
Lambada fonts you've got this
ridiculously fast moving thousands

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.230
ridiculously fast moving thousands
 

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.490

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240
it's got more thenö that is nice yeah I
 

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.639

like the faders I'm pretty nice right I

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:37.649
like the faders I'm pretty nice right I
 

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:39.170
like the faders I'm pretty nice right I
mean I mean there's a few things I'm

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180
mean I mean there's a few things I'm
 

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.449
mean I mean there's a few things I'm
really excited to see what Roman has to

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459
really excited to see what Roman has to
 

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:43.699
really excited to see what Roman has to
say about this next week because to me

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:43.709
say about this next week because to me
 

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.259
say about this next week because to me
it seems like they've done everything

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:45.269
it seems like they've done everything
 

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:47.300
it seems like they've done everything
right and yet something is slightly off

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.310
right and yet something is slightly off
 

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.869
right and yet something is slightly off
and I think what that means is it needs

00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:50.879
and I think what that means is it needs
 

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:53.480
and I think what that means is it needs
a designer to just go and kind of lay it

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:53.490
a designer to just go and kind of lay it
 

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.220
a designer to just go and kind of lay it
out and put the finishing touches on it

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.230
out and put the finishing touches on it
 

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.439
out and put the finishing touches on it
I just think this is a recent redesign

00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:57.449
I just think this is a recent redesign
 

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:00.379
I just think this is a recent redesign
from these guys I think released just

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:00.389
from these guys I think released just
 

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:02.240
from these guys I think released just
yesterday or in fact early this morning

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.250
yesterday or in fact early this morning
 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.800
yesterday or in fact early this morning
specifically so we could check out the

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:03.810
specifically so we could check out the
 

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.210
specifically so we could check out the
new stuff and so I think it's a first

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220
new stuff and so I think it's a first
 

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.579
new stuff and so I think it's a first
pass on a new design yeah looking pretty

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:07.589
pass on a new design yeah looking pretty
 

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:10.040
pass on a new design yeah looking pretty
good but yeah this it feels like there

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.050
good but yeah this it feels like there
 

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.439
good but yeah this it feels like there
may be little things that can be done so

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:12.449
may be little things that can be done so
 

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:15.139
may be little things that can be done so
we're gonna pause the pause the start

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:15.149
we're gonna pause the pause the start
 

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:16.670
we're gonna pause the pause the start
the stopwatch and we can go to a

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680
the stopwatch and we can go to a
 

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.369
the stopwatch and we can go to a
countdown timer and you say so I clicked

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:19.379
countdown timer and you say so I clicked
 

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:20.900
countdown timer and you say so I clicked
that the same as I did the stopwatch and

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.910
that the same as I did the stopwatch and
 

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.369
that the same as I did the stopwatch and
it tells me that you need to add a

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:22.379
it tells me that you need to add a
 

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:24.410
it tells me that you need to add a
counter in order to guarantee no does

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420
counter in order to guarantee no does
 

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.960
counter in order to guarantee no does
that were the toast I would kind of

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:26.970
that were the toast I would kind of
 

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.150
that were the toast I would kind of
prefer that if I do this rather than

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160
prefer that if I do this rather than
 

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.559
prefer that if I do this rather than
tell me that it just does the equivalent

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:30.569
tell me that it just does the equivalent
 

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:33.079
tell me that it just does the equivalent
of loading up that button right well it

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:33.089
of loading up that button right well it
 

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:35.090
of loading up that button right well it
seems like I can see why you have it

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100
seems like I can see why you have it
 

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.269
seems like I can see why you have it
here as well that's reasonable well you

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279
here as well that's reasonable well you
 

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:39.710
here as well that's reasonable well you
know but it really reminds me of that

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720
know but it really reminds me of that
 

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.509
know but it really reminds me of that
that do you remember the part in the

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519
that do you remember the part in the
 

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.369
that do you remember the part in the
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy when

00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:43.379
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy when
 

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:45.139

Arthur and forwarder and the the

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:45.149
Arthur and forwarder and the the
 

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:48.740
Arthur and forwarder and the the
spaceship and somebody pushes a button

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:48.750
spaceship and somebody pushes a button
 

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.139
spaceship and somebody pushes a button
and he's like what that do I says how it

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:51.149
and he's like what that do I says how it
 

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:53.929
and he's like what that do I says how it
a little light that you can't popped up

00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:53.939
a little light that you can't popped up
 

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:54.980
a little light that you can't popped up
that said please do not press this

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:54.990
that said please do not press this
 

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.470
that said please do not press this
button again

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480
button again
 

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.750
button again
that's what I feel like when you do that

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:58.760
that's what I feel like when you do that
 

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.720
that's what I feel like when you do that
it's like oh you interacted with my UI

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:00.730
it's like oh you interacted with my UI
 

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.360
it's like oh you interacted with my UI
but not the way I expected yeah don't be

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.370
but not the way I expected yeah don't be
 

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.830
but not the way I expected yeah don't be
doing that I think that I think it's a

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:08.840
doing that I think that I think it's a
 

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.390
doing that I think that I think it's a
little more courteous to just assume

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:10.400
little more courteous to just assume
 

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.460
little more courteous to just assume
what your users want it exactly that

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:12.470
what your users want it exactly that
 

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.810
what your users want it exactly that
makes sense you've got the ad counter

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:13.820
makes sense you've got the ad counter
 

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.430
makes sense you've got the ad counter
button here and fair enough have that

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440
button here and fair enough have that
 

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.000
button here and fair enough have that
too but let's do both so okay again here

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.010
too but let's do both so okay again here
 

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.680
too but let's do both so okay again here
the button style here is a little bit

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:20.690
the button style here is a little bit
 

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.300
the button style here is a little bit
odd again it's this you know it's a very

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.310
odd again it's this you know it's a very
 

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.620
odd again it's this you know it's a very
attractive looking at and then you've

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:23.630
attractive looking at and then you've
 

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.810
attractive looking at and then you've
got kind of an orphaned button sitting

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:25.820
got kind of an orphaned button sitting
 

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.060
got kind of an orphaned button sitting
by itself sort of floating in the middle

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.070
by itself sort of floating in the middle
 

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.800
by itself sort of floating in the middle
so I'd consider maybe moving that around

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:29.810
so I'd consider maybe moving that around
 

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.360
so I'd consider maybe moving that around
but I only back to the design guys to

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.370
but I only back to the design guys to
 

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.340
but I only back to the design guys to
say they've got an opinion we've got the

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.350
say they've got an opinion we've got the
 

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.810
say they've got an opinion we've got the
strata standard spinners here which you

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:34.820
strata standard spinners here which you
 

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.660
strata standard spinners here which you
can actually see it's a pretty intuitive

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:37.670
can actually see it's a pretty intuitive
 

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.400
can actually see it's a pretty intuitive
way of changing the times so maybe

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:39.410
way of changing the times so maybe
 

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.070
way of changing the times so maybe
that's a tip for the yoga guys there is

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.080
that's a tip for the yoga guys there is
 

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.990
that's a tip for the yoga guys there is
you know this actually isn't a bad way

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000
you know this actually isn't a bad way
 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.850
you know this actually isn't a bad way
of doing it no it's pretty alright it's

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:45.860
of doing it no it's pretty alright it's
 

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.240
of doing it no it's pretty alright it's
a I think that the way the yoga guys did

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.250
a I think that the way the yoga guys did
 

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.580
a I think that the way the yoga guys did
it makes sense but it's just not as

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:51.590
it makes sense but it's just not as
 

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.680
it makes sense but it's just not as
intuitive exactly so you can see here

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:53.690
intuitive exactly so you can see here
 

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.150
intuitive exactly so you can see here
it's added a timer again I would

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160
it's added a timer again I would
 

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.310
it's added a timer again I would
probably be tempted to automatically so

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.320
probably be tempted to automatically so
 

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.930
probably be tempted to automatically so
now to set the timer I need to click

00:15:58.930 --> 00:15:58.940
now to set the timer I need to click
 

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.910
now to set the timer I need to click
here which then assigns it to here and

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920
here which then assigns it to here and
 

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.590
here which then assigns it to here and
then I click it again to get started now

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600
then I click it again to get started now
 

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.140
then I click it again to get started now
keep on adding a timer I think it

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.150
keep on adding a timer I think it
 

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.940
keep on adding a timer I think it
probably makes sense to talk about it

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:06.950
probably makes sense to talk about it
 

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.410
probably makes sense to talk about it
what is select that select oh yeah will

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.420
what is select that select oh yeah will
 

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.390
what is select that select oh yeah will
you I don't know well mate unless

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:10.400
you I don't know well mate unless
 

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.950
you I don't know well mate unless
personally if there's a timer going

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:11.960
personally if there's a timer going
 

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.260
personally if there's a timer going
maybe you don't want to do that sure so

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:14.270
maybe you don't want to do that sure so
 

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.850
maybe you don't want to do that sure so
if there's any timer in action that's a

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:15.860
if there's any timer in action that's a
 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.540
if there's any timer in action that's a
different story

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:16.550
different story
 

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.130
different story
what happens if we add multiple counters

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.140
what happens if we add multiple counters
 

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.200
what happens if we add multiple counters
into the look

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.210
 

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.360
so the we've got a new kind of down here

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.370
so the we've got a new kind of down here
 

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.940
so the we've got a new kind of down here
the old one continues I assumed that if

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:26.950
the old one continues I assumed that if
 

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.880
the old one continues I assumed that if
we uh yeah so once you click a new timer

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:29.890
we uh yeah so once you click a new timer
 

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.710
we uh yeah so once you click a new timer
it resets I don't know if it wants a

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720
it resets I don't know if it wants a
 

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.420
it resets I don't know if it wants a
warning there or not probably not I

and I note here that I can't actually

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:02.779
and I note here that I can't actually
 

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:05.830
and I note here that I can't actually
change it from here I need see its

it's Jo that'll yeah into the overflow

00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:09.739
it's Jo that'll yeah into the overflow
 

00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:12.129
it's Jo that'll yeah into the overflow
menu okay that's interesting

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:12.139
menu okay that's interesting
 

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:14.200
menu okay that's interesting
that is interesting that's probably a

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.210
that is interesting that's probably a
 

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.060
that is interesting that's probably a
reasonable way of doing things have it

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.070
reasonable way of doing things have it
 

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.190
reasonable way of doing things have it
in the action bar if there's room I

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200
in the action bar if there's room I
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.840
in the action bar if there's room I
would say though that this theme looks a

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:19.850
would say though that this theme looks a
 

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.489
would say though that this theme looks a
little less polished than the dark theme

00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:21.499
little less polished than the dark theme
 

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:24.220
little less polished than the dark theme
I think a lot of people prefer the light

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.230
I think a lot of people prefer the light
 

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.810
I think a lot of people prefer the light
theme I think you probably want to tweak

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:25.820
theme I think you probably want to tweak
 

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.369
theme I think you probably want to tweak
your colors particularly down here and

00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:27.379
your colors particularly down here and
 

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:28.810
your colors particularly down here and
the lap timings a little bit it looks

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:28.820
the lap timings a little bit it looks
 

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.519
the lap timings a little bit it looks
like they just haven't gotten around to

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:30.529
like they just haven't gotten around to
 

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:32.259
like they just haven't gotten around to
that yeah exactly and knowing that this

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:32.269
that yeah exactly and knowing that this
 

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:34.359
that yeah exactly and knowing that this
is a relatively recent release and say

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:34.369
is a relatively recent release and say
 

00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:34.960
is a relatively recent release and say
that's fair enough

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:34.970
that's fair enough
 

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.369
that's fair enough
okay so this one do a little bit of

00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:36.379
okay so this one do a little bit of
 

00:18:36.379 --> 00:18:38.049
okay so this one do a little bit of
everything it looks pretty nice it's not

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:38.059
everything it looks pretty nice it's not
 

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:40.239
everything it looks pretty nice it's not
bad it's not bad at all let's have a

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:40.249
bad it's not bad at all let's have a
 

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:42.249
bad it's not bad at all let's have a
look we're gonna move on to impetus

00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:42.259
look we're gonna move on to impetus
 

00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:45.159
look we're gonna move on to impetus
interval timer next so this one does

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:45.169
interval timer next so this one does
 

00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:46.960
interval timer next so this one does
have a feature graphic but it's a

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:46.970
have a feature graphic but it's a
 

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.789
have a feature graphic but it's a
terrible feature graphic it's not good

00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799
terrible feature graphic it's not good
 

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:51.009
terrible feature graphic it's not good
it has a huge amount of text all over

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:51.019
it has a huge amount of text all over
 

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:51.970
it has a huge amount of text all over
the place

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:51.980
the place
 

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.619
the place
I should point out that our green screen

00:18:53.619 --> 00:18:53.629
I should point out that our green screen
 

00:18:53.629 --> 00:18:56.950
I should point out that our green screen
is what is making the that's true like

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960
is what is making the that's true like
 

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:05.080
is what is making the that's true like
the middle part there see yeah nice

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.090
the middle part there see yeah nice
 

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.549
the middle part there see yeah nice
so now though it would be a much better

00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559
so now though it would be a much better
 

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:09.489
so now though it would be a much better
feature graphic no yeah so in fact that

00:19:09.489 --> 00:19:09.499
feature graphic no yeah so in fact that
 

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:12.700
feature graphic no yeah so in fact that
part is us at least but but in any case

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:12.710
part is us at least but but in any case
 

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.840
part is us at least but but in any case
you can see here that it's a feature

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:13.850
you can see here that it's a feature
 

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.369
you can see here that it's a feature
graphic full of text and one of the big

00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:15.379
graphic full of text and one of the big
 

00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:17.710
graphic full of text and one of the big
places that this is going to get used is

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720
places that this is going to get used is
 

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.799
places that this is going to get used is
when it's shrunk down a full feature and

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:20.809
when it's shrunk down a full feature and
 

00:19:20.809 --> 00:19:22.599
when it's shrunk down a full feature and
none of that's going to be visible and

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:22.609
none of that's going to be visible and
 

00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:24.009
none of that's going to be visible and
even still this is more what you would

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:24.019
even still this is more what you would
 

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:25.810
even still this is more what you would
expect from the screenshots rather than

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:25.820
expect from the screenshots rather than
 

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.509
expect from the screenshots rather than
from a feature yeah in fact you should

00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:28.519
from a feature yeah in fact you should
 

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:29.950
from a feature yeah in fact you should
never put screenshots in a feature

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960
never put screenshots in a feature
 

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.950
never put screenshots in a feature
graphic we will never feature something

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960
graphic we will never feature something
 

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.269
graphic we will never feature something
that just has a screenshot in the

00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:34.279
that just has a screenshot in the
 

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:38.979
that just has a screenshot in the
feature graphic and in fact in this goes

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:38.989
feature graphic and in fact in this goes
 

00:19:38.989 --> 00:19:40.570
feature graphic and in fact in this goes
for a lot of things like I've seen games

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:40.580
for a lot of things like I've seen games
 

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.039
for a lot of things like I've seen games
with screenshots in the feature graphic

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:42.049
with screenshots in the feature graphic
 

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:45.120
with screenshots in the feature graphic
and that's no good

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.130
and that's no good
 

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.830
and that's no good
which you really have to ask yourself is

this up and this one's a little
 

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:35.190
this up and this one's a little
confusing it's not obvious to me

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200
confusing it's not obvious to me

confusing it's not obvious to me
straight away what's going on there's a

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:36.609
straight away what's going on there's a
 

00:21:36.609 --> 00:21:38.519
straight away what's going on there's a
lot of text on screen well apparently

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:38.529

you're finished well indeed so let's
 

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:45.119
you're finished well indeed so let's
move on that's not fair so that's kind

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:45.129
move on that's not fair so that's kind
 

00:21:45.129 --> 00:21:46.199
move on that's not fair so that's kind
of the biggest challenge here is that

00:21:46.199 --> 00:21:46.209
of the biggest challenge here is that
 

00:21:46.209 --> 00:21:47.940

00:23:04.169 --> 00:23:04.179
doing you're right it's it's you do a
 

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:05.669
doing you're right it's it's you do a
little rest you do a little more than

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679
little rest you do a little more than
 

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:07.860
little rest you do a little more than
rest you do more than rest yeah okay so

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:07.870
rest you do more than rest yeah okay so
 

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.159
rest you do more than rest yeah okay so
it's this I've heard of this is a way to

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:11.169
it's this I've heard of this is a way to
 

00:23:11.169 --> 00:23:13.200
it's this I've heard of this is a way to
to build up your endurance training for

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.210
to build up your endurance training for
 

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.730
to build up your endurance training for
running I guess so I've never done it

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:14.740
running I guess so I've never done it
 

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.249
running I guess so I've never done it
with time I've always done it with reps

00:23:17.249 --> 00:23:17.259
with time I've always done it with reps
 

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:19.560
with time I've always done it with reps
mmm but that's because I have no

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:19.570
mmm but that's because I have no
 

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.269
mmm but that's because I have no
endurance nor need for any endurance

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279
endurance nor need for any endurance
 

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:24.840

really no just raw strength raw strength

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:24.850
really no just raw strength raw strength
 

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.629
really no just raw strength raw strength
that's all about um so you can see we've

00:23:27.629 --> 00:23:27.639
that's all about um so you can see we've
 

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.580
that's all about um so you can see we've
got these alarms and these they just

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:29.590
got these alarms and these they just
 

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.049
got these alarms and these they just
kind of fall off the edge of the screen

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:31.059
kind of fall off the edge of the screen
 

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:33.600
kind of fall off the edge of the screen
here you can see if that's my yeah isn't

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:33.610
here you can see if that's my yeah isn't
 

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.669
here you can see if that's my yeah isn't
great yeah and this whole dialogue is a

00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679
great yeah and this whole dialogue is a
 

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:37.440
great yeah and this whole dialogue is a
little odd like how do I dismiss it is

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:37.450
little odd like how do I dismiss it is
 

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.749
little odd like how do I dismiss it is
it right at all hooked into the no in

00:23:42.749 --> 00:23:42.759
it right at all hooked into the no in
 

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:44.999

fact check that out I'm I'm just

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:45.009
fact check that out I'm I'm just
 

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:50.580
fact check that out I'm I'm just
pressing the volume keys okay yeah if we

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:50.590
pressing the volume keys okay yeah if we
 

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.799
pressing the volume keys okay yeah if we
bring this that's certainly not in a no

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:52.809
bring this that's certainly not in a no
 

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:57.480
bring this that's certainly not in a no
that's just very strange yeah so I'm I'm

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:57.490
that's just very strange yeah so I'm I'm
 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.100
that's just very strange yeah so I'm I'm
at a loss to explain what they've done

00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.110
at a loss to explain what they've done

everything customs being done there and

00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:00.519
everything customs being done there and
 

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:03.149
everything customs being done there and
it's not something that's right let's

00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159
it's not something that's right let's
 

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:04.680
it's not something that's right let's
see so we can so this is how we create

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:04.690
see so we can so this is how we create
 

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.360
see so we can so this is how we create
new presets so you know I was clicking

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:06.370
new presets so you know I was clicking
 

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.509
new presets so you know I was clicking
here we can use the existing presets

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:08.519
here we can use the existing presets
 

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:10.680

you're in the middle of exercise yeah
 

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:19.619
you're in the middle of exercise yeah
things and then you can do all of your

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:19.629
things and then you can do all of your
 

00:24:19.629 --> 00:24:22.740

new C presets save preset again seems

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:22.750
new C presets save preset again seems
 

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.060
new C presets save preset again seems
like if you created a new one you

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.070
like if you created a new one you
 

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.560
like if you created a new one you
already should have been able to save it

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:25.570
already should have been able to save it
 

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.539
already should have been able to save it
well that's true actually seeing a Save

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:27.549
well that's true actually seeing a Save
 

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:30.749
well that's true actually seeing a Save
button in general is sort of a bad smell

00:24:30.749 --> 00:24:30.759
button in general is sort of a bad smell
 

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:34.230

to me in UI design now the it used to be

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240
to me in UI design now the it used to be
 

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.090
to me in UI design now the it used to be
important because you're saving to you

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:36.100

reason to have a save function is that

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:44.740
reason to have a save function is that
 

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.039

so you can give whatever it is you're

when you don't need a name or if you can
 

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:54.810
when you don't need a name or if you can
give it a default name you should just

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:54.820
give it a default name you should just
 

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.639

to all right so then I guess I have to

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000
to all right so then I guess I have to
 

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.210
to all right so then I guess I have to
save yeah so the workflow around this is

kind of the other key here so they've

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:43.060
kind of the other key here so they've
 

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.420
kind of the other key here so they've
kind of got a custom standard which is

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:45.430
kind of got a custom standard which is
 

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.060
kind of got a custom standard which is
too bad because this is how Android used

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.070
too bad because this is how Android used
 

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.220
too bad because this is how Android used
to work and it wasn't very easy to use

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:50.230
to work and it wasn't very easy to use
 

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.500
to work and it wasn't very easy to use
and now we've gone to the the spinner

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:52.510
and now we've gone to the the spinner

see this sort of thing still popping up
 

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.290
see this sort of thing still popping up
and this is this is a real risk that you

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.300
and this is this is a real risk that you
 

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.420

you can see the timer actually works
nicely it goes in a reverse direction to

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760
because it sort of seems like a natural
 

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.070
because it sort of seems like a natural
well the problem with I think one of the

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.080
well the problem with I think one of the
 

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.870
well the problem with I think one of the
problems that you have I guess you could

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880
problems that you have I guess you could
 

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.760
problems that you have I guess you could
use it to start other things because you

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:41.770
use it to start other things because you
 

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:42.870
use it to start other things because you
just don't want to have the widget which

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880
just don't want to have the widget which
 

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.640
just don't want to have the widget which
is getting updated as a time okay

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
is getting updated as a time okay
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.920
is getting updated as a time okay
because that you know you really want to

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:46.930
because that you know you really want to
 

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.170
because that you know you really want to
be updating your widgets every twenty

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.180
be updating your widgets every twenty
 

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.330
be updating your widgets every twenty
minutes something like that I see but as

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:51.340
minutes something like that I see but as
 

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.430
minutes something like that I see but as
a quick way to start it and then have it

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440
a quick way to start it and then have it
 

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.900
a quick way to start it and then have it
with the newer notifications would

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:54.910
with the newer notifications would
 

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.290
with the newer notifications would
actually be pretty neat yeah so yeah

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:58.300
actually be pretty neat yeah so yeah
 

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.180
actually be pretty neat yeah so yeah
that's a good point so this is you know

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:00.190
that's a good point so this is you know
 

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.589
that's a good point so this is you know
one of the reasons you didn't put

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599
one of the reasons you didn't put
 

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.230
one of the reasons you didn't put
widgets on is because updating widgets

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240
widgets on is because updating widgets
 

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.030
widgets on is because updating widgets
are expensive you don't want to have

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040
are expensive you don't want to have
 

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.830
are expensive you don't want to have
that just going on all the time exactly

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:07.840
that just going on all the time exactly
 

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.050
that just going on all the time exactly
so having the ability to just have a set

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:10.060
so having the ability to just have a set
 

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.609
so having the ability to just have a set
timer on my home screen I'll be able to

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:11.619
timer on my home screen I'll be able to
 

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:14.460
timer on my home screen I'll be able to
kick off the stopwatch as a timer and

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.470
kick off the stopwatch as a timer and
 

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.990
kick off the stopwatch as a timer and
then it you know automatically starts

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000
then it you know automatically starts
 

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.940
then it you know automatically starts
displaying things here you know ultimate

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:17.950
displaying things here you know ultimate
 

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.080
displaying things here you know ultimate
stopwatch does tell us when it's

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:19.090
stopwatch does tell us when it's
 

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.540
stopwatch does tell us when it's
complete just not and once I'm gone

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:21.550
complete just not and once I'm gone
 

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.780
complete just not and once I'm gone
rising yeah I think the what I loved was

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:24.790
rising yeah I think the what I loved was
 

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.490
rising yeah I think the what I loved was
that the one that actually counted down

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:26.500
that the one that actually counted down
 

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.810
that the one that actually counted down
although the one thing that I would have

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:27.820
although the one thing that I would have
 

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.780
although the one thing that I would have
done differently but tell me if this is

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:30.790
done differently but tell me if this is
 

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.390
done differently but tell me if this is
possible because I'm not too familiar

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400
possible because I'm not too familiar
 

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.359
possible because I'm not too familiar
with the notification code um would it

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:36.369
with the notification code um would it
 

00:37:36.369 --> 00:37:37.920
with the notification code um would it
be possible to actually animate that a

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:37.930
be possible to actually animate that a
 

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.900
be possible to actually animate that a
little more because if you've got a long

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:39.910
little more because if you've got a long
 

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:43.079
little more because if you've got a long
time err it's just gonna crawl forward

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:43.089
time err it's just gonna crawl forward
 

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:45.589
time err it's just gonna crawl forward
right and I've noticed that what

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599
right and I've noticed that what
 

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.820
right and I've noticed that what
basically all of the operating systems

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:47.830
basically all of the operating systems
 

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.670
basically all of the operating systems
we work with have moved towards is this

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680
we work with have moved towards is this
 

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.589
we work with have moved towards is this
paradigm where if your progress bar

00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599
paradigm where if your progress bar
 

00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:54.599
paradigm where if your progress bar
isn't making much progress at least

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:54.609
isn't making much progress at least
 

00:37:54.609 --> 00:37:56.849
isn't making much progress at least
it'll be animating you know like I think

00:37:56.849 --> 00:37:56.859
it'll be animating you know like I think
 

00:37:56.859 --> 00:37:58.800
it'll be animating you know like I think
Mac does a barber pole effect and

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:58.810
Mac does a barber pole effect and
 

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.900
Mac does a barber pole effect and
Windows kind of has a shimmer and I

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:00.910
Windows kind of has a shimmer and I
 

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.520

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:02.530
don't know what UNIX tear Linux does
 

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.349
don't know what UNIX tear Linux does
because I am NOT geeky enough but yeah I

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359
because I am NOT geeky enough but yeah I
 

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.170

think you have enough time in shell

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180
think you have enough time in shell
 

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.250
think you have enough time in shell
exactly and you'll notice I don't have a

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:11.260
exactly and you'll notice I don't have a
 

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.320
exactly and you'll notice I don't have a
beard which means I may or may not be

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.330
beard which means I may or may not be
 

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.329
beard which means I may or may not be
able to program stream if you can code

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:15.339
able to program stream if you can code
 

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:19.320
able to program stream if you can code
there's no reason to shave here's here's

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:19.330
there's no reason to shave here's here's

a thing though if you're um if your

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:22.810
a thing though if you're um if your

progress bar is not going fast having

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:24.970
progress bar is not going fast having
 

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.670
progress bar is not going fast having
some animation at least lets the user

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680
some animation at least lets the user
 

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.000
some animation at least lets the user
know that something is happening and I

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
know that something is happening and I
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.400
know that something is happening and I
was wondering well could we put in like

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:32.410
was wondering well could we put in like
 

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.839
was wondering well could we put in like
you know a little shimmer or something

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:33.849
you know a little shimmer or something
 

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:35.520
you know a little shimmer or something
and I think you probably could I mean as

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:35.530
and I think you probably could I mean as
 

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.019
and I think you probably could I mean as
they've got the the outer edge

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:37.029
they've got the the outer edge
 

00:38:37.029 --> 00:38:38.519
they've got the the outer edge
I'm having something in the middle just

00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:38.529
I'm having something in the middle just
 

00:38:38.529 --> 00:38:40.199
I'm having something in the middle just
happening to show that it's that it's

00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:40.209
happening to show that it's that it's
 

00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:41.579
happening to show that it's that it's
ongoing I think would be an interesting

00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:41.589
ongoing I think would be an interesting
 

00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:43.949
ongoing I think would be an interesting
effect I am I don't know that there is I

00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:43.959
effect I am I don't know that there is I
 

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:45.419
effect I am I don't know that there is I
don't know what overhead is associated

00:38:45.419 --> 00:38:45.429
don't know what overhead is associated
 

00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:47.579
don't know what overhead is associated
with updating it okay you know you think

00:38:47.579 --> 00:38:47.589
with updating it okay you know you think
 

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:49.259
with updating it okay you know you think
about it can't be that bad because we do

00:38:49.259 --> 00:38:49.269
about it can't be that bad because we do
 

00:38:49.269 --> 00:38:50.789
about it can't be that bad because we do
that in the download manager that's true

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:50.799
that in the download manager that's true
 

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:52.979
that in the download manager that's true
we have a little you know I think it's

00:38:52.979 --> 00:38:52.989
we have a little you know I think it's
 

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:56.249
we have a little you know I think it's
actually just an animated image so you

00:38:56.249 --> 00:38:56.259
actually just an animated image so you
 

00:38:56.259 --> 00:38:57.479
actually just an animated image so you
know what I would do is an animated

00:38:57.479 --> 00:38:57.489
know what I would do is an animated
 

00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:00.179
know what I would do is an animated
image and then just overlay that arc on

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:00.189
image and then just overlay that arc on
 

00:39:00.189 --> 00:39:01.890
image and then just overlay that arc on
top of it that could what yeah

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:01.900
top of it that could what yeah
 

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.969
top of it that could what yeah
absolutely

00:39:02.969 --> 00:39:02.979
absolutely
 

00:39:02.979 --> 00:39:05.189
absolutely
okay cool that looks like a really quick

00:39:05.189 --> 00:39:05.199
okay cool that looks like a really quick
 

00:39:05.199 --> 00:39:06.719
okay cool that looks like a really quick
look through if I only got a couple of

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:06.729
look through if I only got a couple of
 

00:39:06.729 --> 00:39:08.219
look through if I only got a couple of
minutes literally so we were going to

00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:08.229
minutes literally so we were going to
 

00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:09.719
minutes literally so we were going to
spend a little bit more time contrasting

00:39:09.719 --> 00:39:09.729
spend a little bit more time contrasting
 

00:39:09.729 --> 00:39:11.759
spend a little bit more time contrasting
and comparing but again you know in

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:11.769
and comparing but again you know in
 

00:39:11.769 --> 00:39:13.589
and comparing but again you know in
terms of the design guide I think really

00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599
terms of the design guide I think really
 

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:16.620
terms of the design guide I think really
the the hybrid stopwatch is is kind of

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:16.630
the the hybrid stopwatch is is kind of
 

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.269
the the hybrid stopwatch is is kind of
one of the most interesting deviations

00:39:18.269 --> 00:39:18.279
one of the most interesting deviations
 

00:39:18.279 --> 00:39:19.919
one of the most interesting deviations
from the design guide which still look

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:19.929
from the design guide which still look
 

00:39:19.929 --> 00:39:20.789
from the design guide which still look
good

00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:20.799
good
 

00:39:20.799 --> 00:39:23.429
good
I do have been given a preview as to

00:39:23.429 --> 00:39:23.439
I do have been given a preview as to
 

00:39:23.439 --> 00:39:24.809
I do have been given a preview as to
what the other guys will be looking at

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:24.819
what the other guys will be looking at
 

00:39:24.819 --> 00:39:26.549
what the other guys will be looking at
on Tuesday during Android design in

00:39:26.549 --> 00:39:26.559
on Tuesday during Android design in
 

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:27.829
on Tuesday during Android design in
action I don't know that they have an

00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839
action I don't know that they have an
 

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:30.719
action I don't know that they have an
interesting take on this app so that's

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:30.729
interesting take on this app so that's
 

00:39:30.729 --> 00:39:32.909
interesting take on this app so that's
definitely something to tune in for and

00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:32.919
definitely something to tune in for and
 

00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:34.380
definitely something to tune in for and
the other one which i think is sort of

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:34.390
the other one which i think is sort of
 

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.890
the other one which i think is sort of
close to being there but not quite is

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:37.900
close to being there but not quite is
 

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.689
close to being there but not quite is
this which is a you know I think this is

00:39:39.689 --> 00:39:39.699
this which is a you know I think this is
 

00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:41.699
this which is a you know I think this is
a really nice effect looks really

00:39:41.699 --> 00:39:41.709
a really nice effect looks really
 

00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:43.829
a really nice effect looks really
consistent nice coloring nice theming

00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839
consistent nice coloring nice theming
 

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.659
consistent nice coloring nice theming
just I think needs a little bit of

00:39:45.659 --> 00:39:45.669
just I think needs a little bit of
 

00:39:45.669 --> 00:39:47.399
just I think needs a little bit of
tweaking to get it really spot-on so

00:39:47.399 --> 00:39:47.409
tweaking to get it really spot-on so
 

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:49.349
tweaking to get it really spot-on so
these kind of the two alternatives one

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359
these kind of the two alternatives one
 

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:50.939
these kind of the two alternatives one
more now wait a second yoga tiger

00:39:50.939 --> 00:39:50.949
more now wait a second yoga tiger
 

00:39:50.949 --> 00:39:52.859
more now wait a second yoga tiger
there is your katana that's true so yeah

00:39:52.859 --> 00:39:52.869
there is your katana that's true so yeah
 

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:55.529
there is your katana that's true so yeah
I would say yoga timer nailed it except

00:39:55.529 --> 00:39:55.539
I would say yoga timer nailed it except
 

00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:57.120
I would say yoga timer nailed it except
for the icon except for the icon yeah

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:57.130
for the icon except for the icon yeah
 

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.559
for the icon except for the icon yeah
that that's the thing about yoga timer

00:39:58.559 --> 00:39:58.569
that that's the thing about yoga timer
 

00:39:58.569 --> 00:39:59.969
that that's the thing about yoga timer
it's a great app they've they've done a

00:39:59.969 --> 00:39:59.979
it's a great app they've they've done a
 

00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:01.259
it's a great app they've they've done a
really good job of theming it they just

00:40:01.259 --> 00:40:01.269
really good job of theming it they just
 

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:03.089
really good job of theming it they just
aren't presenting it as well as they

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:03.099
aren't presenting it as well as they
 

00:40:03.099 --> 00:40:06.599
aren't presenting it as well as they
should be ahead of time so yeah

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:06.609
should be ahead of time so yeah
 

00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:08.669
should be ahead of time so yeah
other things multifunctional we talked

00:40:08.669 --> 00:40:08.679
other things multifunctional we talked
 

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:10.499
other things multifunctional we talked
about so again I think this is this is

00:40:10.499 --> 00:40:10.509
about so again I think this is this is
 

00:40:10.509 --> 00:40:13.409
about so again I think this is this is
where the time control really does win

00:40:13.409 --> 00:40:13.419
where the time control really does win
 

00:40:13.419 --> 00:40:15.390
where the time control really does win
hands down it does everything that you'd

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400
hands down it does everything that you'd
 

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.939
hands down it does everything that you'd
want to do consistent with time all that

00:40:17.939 --> 00:40:17.949
want to do consistent with time all that
 

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.739
want to do consistent with time all that
went out so that's kind of that's kind

00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:19.749
went out so that's kind of that's kind
 

00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:22.559
went out so that's kind of that's kind
of nice rich notifications we saw a

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:22.569
of nice rich notifications we saw a
 

00:40:22.569 --> 00:40:24.449
of nice rich notifications we saw a
couple of us was its iconic remember was

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:24.459
couple of us was its iconic remember was
 

00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:27.150
couple of us was its iconic remember was
it I think yeah this one had it

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160
it I think yeah this one had it
 

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.460
it I think yeah this one had it
no thoughts a bit I'll spleen lot maybe

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:29.470
no thoughts a bit I'll spleen lot maybe
 

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.110
no thoughts a bit I'll spleen lot maybe
it was just something count down yeah

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.120
it was just something count down yeah
 

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.370
it was just something count down yeah
there we go here we go yeah countdown

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:32.380
there we go here we go yeah countdown
 

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.680
there we go here we go yeah countdown
but no stop what would sure finally make

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:34.690
but no stop what would sure finally make
 

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.330
but no stop what would sure finally make
sense kind of that I'd like to have it

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:36.340
sense kind of that I'd like to have it
 

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.910
sense kind of that I'd like to have it
on stopwatch yeah so this is this is

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920
on stopwatch yeah so this is this is
 

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.040
on stopwatch yeah so this is this is
really nice and there was another app as

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.050
really nice and there was another app as
 

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.220
really nice and there was another app as
well which did which allowed me to which

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.230
well which did which allowed me to which
 

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.370
well which did which allowed me to which
had rich notifications which one it was

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380
had rich notifications which one it was
 

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.460
had rich notifications which one it was
the impetus perhaps no no it certainly

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:50.470
the impetus perhaps no no it certainly
 

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:56.280
the impetus perhaps no no it certainly
wasn't that well in any case hmm yeah I

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.290
wasn't that well in any case hmm yeah I
 

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.900
wasn't that well in any case hmm yeah I
think it was yoga timer I think was yeah

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:57.910
think it was yoga timer I think was yeah
 

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.250
think it was yoga timer I think was yeah
probably was yogurt sauna that's right

00:40:59.250 --> 00:40:59.260
probably was yogurt sauna that's right
 

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.990
probably was yogurt sauna that's right
it was your it look at you it says

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000
it was your it look at you it says
 

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.430
it was your it look at you it says
you're talking about here your timer

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440
you're talking about here your timer
 

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.550
you're talking about here your timer
it's it's a it's a good app I just don't

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560
it's it's a it's a good app I just don't
 

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.590
it's it's a it's a good app I just don't
do yoga that's my problem that's the

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:07.600
do yoga that's my problem that's the
 

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.100
do yoga that's my problem that's the
perfect yeah that's that's great you

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:11.110
perfect yeah that's that's great you
 

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.470
perfect yeah that's that's great you
having a notification is there for

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480
having a notification is there for
 

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.360
having a notification is there for
information and it's a call to action

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:15.370
information and it's a call to action
 

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.550
information and it's a call to action
exactly and if this combines that

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560
exactly and if this combines that
 

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.770
exactly and if this combines that
perfectly so they steal a trick from

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:19.780
perfectly so they steal a trick from
 

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.840
perfectly so they steal a trick from
from time control here and actually

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:21.850
from time control here and actually
 

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.640
from time control here and actually
included time countdown within the

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:23.650
included time countdown within the
 

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.560
included time countdown within the
notification itself you've pretty much

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:25.570
notification itself you've pretty much
 

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.170
notification itself you've pretty much
hit the perfect notification absolute

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:28.180
hit the perfect notification absolute
 

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.310
hit the perfect notification absolute
life is over that's yes I'm very true

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:32.320
life is over that's yes I'm very true
 

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.760
life is over that's yes I'm very true
uh-huh

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:32.770
uh-huh

anything like this any time in order to

anything like this any time in order to
 

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.820
anything like this any time in order to
have a foreground service that is a

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:38.830
have a foreground service that is a
 

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.650
have a foreground service that is a

the system at runtime when there is

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:43.600
the system at runtime when there is
 

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.690
the system at runtime when there is
memory pressure means that you have to

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:45.700
memory pressure means that you have to
 

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.000
memory pressure means that you have to
have a notification displayed so any of

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.010
have a notification displayed so any of
 

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.080
have a notification displayed so any of
these apps which don't have a

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:49.090
these apps which don't have a
 

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.840
these apps which don't have a
notification displayed and this is true

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:51.850
notification displayed and this is true
 

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.640
notification displayed and this is true
for most of them in stopwatch mode means

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:53.650
for most of them in stopwatch mode means
 

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.080
for most of them in stopwatch mode means
that they could theoretically get killed

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.090
that they could theoretically get killed
 

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.030
that they could theoretically get killed
by the system so that's something I

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040
by the system so that's something I
 

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.800
by the system so that's something I
wouldn't really want to have happen and

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:58.810
wouldn't really want to have happen and
 

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.550
wouldn't really want to have happen and
talking to keep in mind

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560
talking to keep in mind
 

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.590
talking to keep in mind
and keep it simple I guess that's the

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:04.600
and keep it simple I guess that's the
 

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.150
and keep it simple I guess that's the
the real trick the ones that I enjoyed

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160
the real trick the ones that I enjoyed
 

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.710
the real trick the ones that I enjoyed
the most and this is why I guess I keep

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720
the most and this is why I guess I keep
 

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.120
the most and this is why I guess I keep
forgetting about yoga timers because I

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.130
forgetting about yoga timers because I
 

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.650
forgetting about yoga timers because I
have to do so much work where I can use

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:10.660
have to do so much work where I can use
 

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.880
have to do so much work where I can use
you know that's true yeah you had to

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:11.890
you know that's true yeah you had to
 

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.070
you know that's true yeah you had to
there was a lot before you can just jump

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.080
there was a lot before you can just jump
 

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.470
there was a lot before you can just jump
in no you know they where if you

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480
in no you know they where if you
 

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.870
in no you know they where if you
contrast that with I think was impetus

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880
contrast that with I think was impetus
 

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.290
contrast that with I think was impetus
for instance just had some presets that

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:22.300
for instance just had some presets that
 

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.630
for instance just had some presets that
were there already they have a very very

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640
were there already they have a very very
 

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.330
were there already they have a very very
complex system but they had five or six

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:27.340
complex system but they had five or six
 

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.320
complex system but they had five or six
different things that you could just

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.330
different things that you could just
 

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.120
different things that you could just
choose from to get started

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:30.130
choose from to get started
 

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.220
choose from to get started
time control was just all that hybrid

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:32.230
time control was just all that hybrid
 

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:37.260
time control was just all that hybrid
stopwatch was just right there right

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:37.270
stopwatch was just right there right
 

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.300
stopwatch was just right there right
press the button and boom you stop and

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:39.310
press the button and boom you stop and
 

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:40.980
press the button and boom you stop and
you understand exactly how it works that

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:40.990
you understand exactly how it works that
 

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.840
you understand exactly how it works that
that's kind of the the ultimate and even

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:42.850
that's kind of the the ultimate and even
 

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.910
that's kind of the the ultimate and even
having liked on control which has quite

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920
having liked on control which has quite
 

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.140
having liked on control which has quite
a lot of functionality but it's all

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:46.150
a lot of functionality but it's all
 

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.250
a lot of functionality but it's all
pretty easy to find

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:47.260
pretty easy to find
 

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.040
pretty easy to find
yeah and then you know Rich's ultimate

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.050
yeah and then you know Rich's ultimate
 

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.440
yeah and then you know Rich's ultimate
stopwatch I would say is is a close

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:52.450
stopwatch I would say is is a close
 

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.360
stopwatch I would say is is a close
second behind hybrid stopwatch but for

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:54.370
second behind hybrid stopwatch but for
 

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.140
second behind hybrid stopwatch but for
me the addition of this sort of

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:57.150
me the addition of this sort of
 

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.500
me the addition of this sort of
photorealism added elements that didn't

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:01.510
photorealism added elements that didn't
 

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.460
