00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.880
I have a function here defined
as x squared minus 5x plus 6.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.600
And what I want
us to think about

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.060
is what other forms we can
write this function in if we,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.719
say, wanted to find the
0s of this function.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.260
If we wanted to figure out where
does this function intersect

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.370
the x-axis, what form
would we put this in?

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.110
And then another form
for maybe finding out

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.800
what's the minimum
value of this.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.780
We see that we have a positive
coefficient on the x squared

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.280
term.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.229
This is going to be an
upward-opening parabola.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.770
But what's the
minimum point of this?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.364
Or even better, what's the
vertex of this parabola

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:36.030
right over here?

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.190
So if the function looks
something like this,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.180
we could use one
form of the function

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.160
to figure out where does
it intersect the x-axis.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.277
So where does it
intersect the x-axis?

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:48.360
And maybe we can manipulate
it to get another form

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.985
to figure out what's
the minimum point.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.750
What's this point right
over here for this function?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.917
I don't even know if the
function looks like this.

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:56.500
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.450
and try to manipulate this
into those two different forms.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.590
So let's work on it.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590
So in order to find the
roots, the easiest thing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.020
I can think of doing
is trying to factor

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.770
this quadratic
expression which is

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.341
being used to define
this function.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:11.840
So we could think
about, well, let's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.170
think of two numbers whose
product is positive 6

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.240
and whose sum is negative 5.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.090
So since their
product is positive,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.977
we know that they
have the same sign.

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:29.560
And if they have the same sign
but we get to a negative value,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.280
that means they both
must be negative.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.800
So let's see-- negative 2
times negative 3 is positive 6.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.890
Negative 2 plus negative
3 is negative 5.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.847
So we could rewrite f of x.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:43.180
And so let me write it this way.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.440
We could write f of
x as being equal to x

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.580
minus 2 times x minus 3.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.160
Now, how does this help
us find the zeroes?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.295
Well, in what situations is
this right-hand expression,

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.861
is this expression on the right
hand going to be equal to 0?

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:02.860
Well, it's the product
of these two expressions.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.786
If either one of these is equal
to 0, 0 times anything is 0.

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:08.570
0 times anything else is 0.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.240
So this whole thing is going to
be 0 if x minus 2 is equal to 0

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.160
or x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.110
Add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.360
You get x is equal to
2 or x is equal to 3.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
So those are the two
zeroes for this function,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.240
I guess you could say.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.698
And we could already
think about it

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.300
a little bit in
terms of graphing it.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.180
So let's try to
graph this thing.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.020
So this is x equals 1.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.480
This is x equals 2.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.860
This is x equals 3
right over there.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.840
So that's our x-axis.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.890
That, you could say, is our
y is equal to f of x axis.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.960
And we're seeing that we
intersect both here and here.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.590
When x is equal to 2,
this f of x is equal to 0.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.742
When x is equal to 3,
f of x is equal to 0.

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.700
And you could substitute
either of these values

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.730
into the original expression.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.229
And you'll see it's
going to get you

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.390
to 0 because that is
the same thing as that.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.610
Now, what about the vertex?

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.840
What form could we write
this original thing

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.069
in order to pick out the vertex?

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.610
Well, we're already
a little familiar

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.735
with completing the square.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:27.520
And when you complete the
square with this expression,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.470
that seems to be a pretty good
way of thinking about what

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.530
the minimum value
of this function is.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.690
So let's just do
that right over here.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.280
So I'm just going to rewrite it.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.759
So we get f of x is equal
to x squared minus 5x.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.050
And I'm just going to throw
the plus 6 right over here.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.990
And I'm giving myself
some real estate

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.750
because what I need to do, what
I want to think about doing,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.504
is adding and subtracting
the same value.

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.170
So I'm going to add it here, and
I'm going to subtract it there.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.530
And I can do that because
then I've just added 0.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.100
I haven't changed the value
of this right-hand side.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.660
But I want to do that so that
this part that I've underlined

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.280
in this magenta color, so that
this part right over here,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.720
is a perfect square.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.160
And we've done
this multiple times

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.270
when we've completed the square.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.730
I encourage you to
watch those videos

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.490
if you need a little
bit of a review on it.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.050
But the general idea
is this is going

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.230
to be a perfect
square if we take

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.410
this coefficient
right over here.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.170
We take negative 5.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.220
We take 1/2 of that, which is
negative 5/2, and we square it.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.840
So we could write this
as plus negative--

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.090
what's negative 5/2 squared?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.740
So I could write this--
negative 5/2 squared.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.320
Well, if we square
a negative number,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.695
it's just going
to be a positive.

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:42.800
So it's going to be the
same thing as 5/2 squared.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.510
5 squared is 25.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.940
2 squared is 4.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.470
So this is going
to be plus 25/4.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.410
Now, once again, if we want
this equality to be true,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.830
we either have to add the
same thing to both sides.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.531
Or if we're just
operating on one side,

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.280
if we added it to that
side, we could just

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.820
subtract it from that side.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.950
And we haven't changed the
total value on that side.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.850
So we added 25/4, and
we subtracted 25/4.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.492
So what is this part
right over here?

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:14.200
What does this become,
the part that I've

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.117
underlined in magenta?

00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:17.116
Well, this is going to
be-- the whole reason why

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.950
we engineered it in
this way is so that this

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.140
could be x minus 5/2 squared.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.680
And I encourage
you to verify this.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.140
And we go into more
detail about why

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.209
taking 1/2 the coefficient here
and then squaring it, adding it

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:34.250
there and then subtracting
there, why that works.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.740
We do that in the completing
the square videos.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.369
But these two things,
you can verify

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:39.410
that they are equivalent.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.050
So that's that part.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.160
And now we just have to
simplify 6 minus 25/4.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.210
So 6 could be rewritten as 24/4.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:58.670
24/4 minus 25/4 is negative 1/4,
so minus 1/4, just like that.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.960
So we've rewritten
our original function

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.600
as f of x is equal to x
minus 5/2 squared minus 1/4.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.400
Now, why is this
form interesting?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.180
Well, one way to think
about it is this part

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.790
is always going to
be non-negative.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.401
The minimum value of this part
in magenta is going to be 0.

00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:21.900
Why?

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.700
Because we're
squaring this thing.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.310
If you're taking
something like this--

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.060
and we're just dealing
with real numbers--

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.000
and you're squaring
it, you're not

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.090
going to be able to
get a negative value.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.460
At the minimum value,
this is going to be 0.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.962
And then it obviously could
be positive values, as well.

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:40.170
So if we want to think about
when does this thing hit

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.010
its minimum value-- well,
it hits its minimum value

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.770
when you're squaring 0.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.240
And when are you squaring 0?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.510
Well, you're squaring 0 when
x minus 5/2 is equal to 0,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.660
or when x is equal
to 5/2 if you just

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.250
want to add 5/2 to both
sides of that equation.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.970
So this thing hits its minimum
value when x is equal to 5/2.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.710
And then what is y, or what is
f of x, when x is equal to 5/2?

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.920
f of 5/2-- and once again, you
could use any of those forms

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.190
to evaluate 5/2.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.310
But it's really
easy in this form.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.710
When x is equal to 5/2, this
term right over here becomes 0.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.350
0 squared, 0.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.070
You're just left
with negative 1/4.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.170
So another way to think
about it is our vertex

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:35.500
is at the point x equals
5/2, y equals negative 1/4.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.900
So x equals 5/2.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.970
That's the same
thing as 2 and 1/2.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.710
So x equals 5/2.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.500
And y is equal to negative 1/4.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.830
So if that is negative 1, 1/4
would be something like that.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.700
So that right over
there is the vertex.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.450
That is the point--
let me make it clear--

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.830
that's the point 5/2
comma negative 1/4.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.804
And what's cool is we've
just used this form

00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:01.720
to figure out the minimum
point, to figure out

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.550
the vertex in this case.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.350
And then we can use the
roots as two other points

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:14.570
to get a rough sketch of what
this parabola will actually

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.375
look like.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.875
So the interesting-- or I guess
the takeaway from this video

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:21.310
is just to realize that we can
rewrite this in different forms

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.000
depending on what we're
trying to understand

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.550
about this function.
