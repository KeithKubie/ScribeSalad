00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.800
If we put liquid nitrogen inside of a rubber balloon, will the balloon freeze and crack and spill liquid nitrogen everywhere, or will it expand and blow up?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm not really sure, so that's the purpose of this experiment today.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.760
I got this little thermos filled with liquid nitrogen, and it's so well insulated, it's not even getting cold on the outside. That's pretty cool.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.240
So, I think the best way to get the liquid nitrogen inside the balloon is to blow it up a little bit, turn it around and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.940
put it on top of this thermos, and then we'll turn the thermos upside down, and spill some liquid nitrogen down inside it.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.020
Alright, let's see what happens when I pour the liquid nitrogen in.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.800
There we go. Worked out pretty well so far.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.380
Whoops.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.840
Okay! Cool!

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.760
It's actually blowing itself up. It looks like its gonna blow up too, doesn't it? [kid says "Yeah!" in the background]

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.900
It's getting bigger! [kid says "Yeah."] [another kid says "Uh oh!"]

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.620
You can see just how big this is getting right now, and it's getting very tight. I think it's going to explode.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.920
[explosion of the ballon] Woo.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.720
[kid says "Oh."] There it goes.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.340
[replay of explosion]

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.140
Wow, look at all the little liquid nitrogen beads all over the ground.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.880
[kid saying "Little wittle nitrogen. These aren't getting bigger."]

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.200
This ones still bubbling, that one's kind of like-- wooh!

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.060
When I touch it, it just curls up. You can see all these little pieces of shrapnel. It just competently shredded that balloon.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.500
Okay, so honestly I didn't think that was going to work. I thought the balloon would get so cold the rubber would crack and all the liquid nitrogen would flow out.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.320
So, to see that, that balloon would actually blow up that big is very encouraging, so I've got a really cool idea with some of those 6 foot water balloons.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.500
Let's see if we can make those work. Oh yeah.
