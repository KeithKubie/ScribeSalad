00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Hi.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.650
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.410 position:56%
I'm Director for the Center for the
Book, and we welcome you here today.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.500
Thank you for joining
us for today's talk.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.290
We're very excited about
what we have to share today.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.100
I want to start by just
mentioning for some of you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.380
who may not have been with
us recently that the Center

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.750 position:56%
for the Book is part of the national
and international outreach unit

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.590
for the Library of Congress
where it's our mission

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.720
to share the treasures and
collections of the library

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.400
with the public and the
American people and the world.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.350
And today we get to do just that.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.520
This talk is -- the book
talks that we do for the books

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.100
and beyond series, which you're
a part of today are designed

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.140
to showcase work that has been
produced as a result of being part

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.470
of the research -- having done
the research here at the Library

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.380
of Congress, and we're very
excited about what we have to share

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.940
and that people are interested in
what we have and spend time with us

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.510
and in our rooms and in our
collections and on our shelves

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.360
and wherever else to
discover what we have.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.650
I'd like to mention that as
part of that discovery process,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.920
we really like to emphasize
that the Library of Congress has

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.230
as its mission to provide the
American people in the world

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.380
with a rich, diverse,
enduring source of knowledge.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.310
It's designed to stimulate
intellectual

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.250
and scholarly and artistic
creativity.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.920
That's our mission,
to share what we have.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.940
And in doing so, we also
like to remind people

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.020
that we are America's
first cultural institution.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.010 position:56%
So a lot of times people forget that
we have a lot more than just books.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.210
So we remind folks of that as well.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.600
Here at the Center for the Book,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.920
which includes the Young
Readers Center and Poetry

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.500
and Literature Center, we promote
books and reading, libraries

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.260
and literacy and literature
for the purpose of making sure

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.340
that people live in informed
and engaged societies.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.120
We believe that literacy
mateters a lot to democracy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.400
and we consider ourselves
defenders of democracy.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.530 position:56%
As part of our book promotion of
reading and literacy and literature,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
we do these talks, but we also have
a couple of other things that we do

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.930 position:56%
around the country including there's
a Center for the Book in every state

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.490
and some of the U.S. territories
and the District of Columbia.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.560 position:56%
And we're proud of that affiliation.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.890 position:56%
Each of those centers celebrate
their own state of regional heritage

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.690
and they're part of a
national network that's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.120
about promoting a variety of
literary and literacy matters.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.110
We're also at the Center for
the Book the administer --

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.290
administrator of the Library of
Congress Literacy Awards Program,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.050
which is a very special and
phenomenal part of the Library

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.720
of Congress that allows us to honor

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.070
and recognize literacy
organizations around the world.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.040
And we are currently in
an application process.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.310 position:56%
You can learn more about the program
and nominate a literacy organization

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.940
that you may be a part of.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.750
Visit read.gov/literacyawards
for more information about that.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.930
Now, let's turn to today's talk.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.800
A couple of housekeeping items
I should mention that we do

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.600
like to ask at this time.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.900
It's a small room.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.550
We're going to enjoy a
really great conversation

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.100
so if you can take a
moment to make sure

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.110
that your electronic
devices are turned to silent.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.760
That would be helpful for us.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.080 position:56%
We are recording today's event so if
you ask a question, you should know

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.970
that you'll become a
part of our webcast

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.590
and the webcasts are available
on our website at read.gov

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.040
and available there more than
250 talks of a variety of rich

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.630
and interesting people and topics.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.280
Today's author will be
available after the presentation

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.020
to sign her book in the lobby,
which is available for sale.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.540
We deeply encourage
you to obtain your copy

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.170
if you haven't already done so.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.110
And I also want to mention that
today's special event is sponsored

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.750
with the Library of
Congress publishing division.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.450
We enjoy a really great partnership
with Becky Clark and her team.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.770
And we're very proud to be
part of the group to honor

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.510
and celebrate books
that are published

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.520
by the Library of Congress.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.640
So today's author is
Sylvia Rogers Albro,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.090
a senior paper conservator
here at the Library of Congress

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.680
where she works on the technical
examination of works on paper

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.830
from the library's
collections of rare materials.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.580
She has spent time in Florence,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.260
Italy where she first learned
about our conservation.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.020
Sylvia first joined
the library staff

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.620
in 1984 as a paper conservator.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.860
She graduated magna cum laude
from the University of Santa Clara

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.370
with a Bachelor's degree
in fine arts and Italian.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.670
She received a Masters degree
in fine arts and a certificate

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.400
of advanced study in conservation

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.600
from the Cooperstown graduate
program and the conservation

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.050
of historic and artistic works at
the State University of New York.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.440
She was also the library's
first staff [inaudible] fellow.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.070
Congratulations on that.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.510
So please welcome Sylvia
Rogers Albro.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:29.150
[ Applause ]

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.360
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Rodgers Albro: Thank you,
Pam, for that kind introduction.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.210
And I'd like to make some other
thank you's while I'm up here.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.820
The publishing office for getting
this long time project finally

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.750
into paper, and that's Rebecca
Clark, the current head,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.660
Susan Rayburn, the editor who
worked with me taking a rough text

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.230
and making it into something that
was greatly, greatly improved

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.380
and Peggy Wagner who was the first

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.020
to help me get the contract
signed for the book.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.490
So I'd also like to thank my boss,
Elmer Yuseman and Holly Krueger

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.240
who have been very supportive of
this project over many, many years

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.290
and lastly, all of my colleagues
in conservation who have covered

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.100
for me all the times that I was
away working on this project

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.070
because the library's work goes on.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.370
It does not stop.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.690
And so I thank you for that.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.350
I also encourage you to find
your own passion and pursue it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.350
because I'll be the first one
to fill in while you're gone.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.000
So, as a conservator of works
of art and manuscripts on paper

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.220 position:56%
at the Library of Congress, its been
my privilege to work with papers

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.310
in the library's collections
that come from the far east,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.500
across the Indian subcontinent,
the middle east, North Africa,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.360
Europe and the new world
representing the path followed

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.900
by the craft of papermaking from
east to west which took place

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.050
over more than 1000 years.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.540 position:56%
The special qualities of early
handmade paper from Italy first came

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.620
to my attention in the early 90's
when an invitation to participate

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.430
in a new conservation school
established in [inaudible],

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.540
Italy in [inaudible] included a
field trip to the historical city

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.840
of [inaudible], and I
just want to mention

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.460
that the conservation
school was actually

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.920
in that old fort if
you can believe it.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.010
For 12 years, my husband Tom
Albro [inaudible] conservator

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.170
and I were very lucky to be invited
to teach as guest instructors

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.270
at the school for two
weeks in the spring.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.070
It was a wonderful period
of exchange between Italian

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.020
and European conservators and the
Library of Congress because many

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.420
of them came here to do
internships in our lab.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.730
It was really a very
stimulating experience.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.080
So, with this group, I went
on a number of field trips.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.490
And one of them included a visit to
the historical city of [inaudible].

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.420
And a visit there is quite a thrill

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.880
for a paper conservator given the
continuous role the city has played

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.180
in the production of paper

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.260
in various forms for
more than 750 years.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.850
And the city as you can see has
very much of a medieval flavor.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.660
This is the town hall with
the [inaudible] tower.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.570
It is in a seismic zone so a lot

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.480
of buildings have been
rebuilt over the years.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.120
They've suffered recently from
earthquakes that you may have heard

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.220
about in the newspaper including
some of the paper establishments,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.320
but they have successfully
rebult many times.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.300
Papermaking is still very much a
thriving industry in [inaudible].

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.540
The leading consortium, the
Cartiere Miliani Fabriano,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.500
is owned by the Fedrigoni
Group of [inaudible],

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.560
another famous papermaking
establishment.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.270
And they have a great many
mills and employees in the area

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.760
and they've been highly successful.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.370
Paper for the euro is produced
there and Fabriano experts

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.780 position:56%
in watermarking have lent their
expertise to the [inaudible] company

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.570
in the U.S. for our paper used
to produce the U.S. dollar.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.620
The mill complex and the museum
of paper in the watermark

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.640
in Fabriano both contain a rich
array of old papermaking equipment.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.330
So here we see a collection of
historic molds, over 300 in number,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.120
that date from the 18th
century to the present,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.490
and they're in the
process of digitizing these

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.220
and making very detailed
examinations of them.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.090
So some day they're going to
be helpful to us in our work.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.670
One of the molds is
one that I selected

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.430
for actually the cover of my book.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.250
It's not a particularly old
mold, but it's made in the style

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.350
of a 14th century mold
with lots of watermark.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:16.190
And here is a restored piece of
an old stamping set that is part

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:21.580
of the collection of the paper
mill, and an old crest used

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:28.850
for papermaking that dates
back I think to the 1400's.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.480
So handpapermaking is still
practiced in Fabriano,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.450
both at the museum of paper
and watermark and at the mill,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.670
and here is a master paper
maker, Robert Rafenati,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.470
showing us how it's done.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.610
So he's got the mold with
the [inaudible] on the top.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:51.020
He's dipped it into the vad and is
lifting it out, draining the water.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.370
He's shaking it slightly

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.070
to distribute the fiber
evenly across the mold.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.100
He takes off the [inaudible] and
then the sheet is [inaudible]

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.380
on a curved set of felts.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.280
Since we're going to
be talking about paper,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.370
I just thought I would
review that for those of you

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.930
who have never seen hand
papermaking being done.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.140
Public and private
libraries and archives

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.720
in the area are remarkable
repositories

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.370
of consecutive local records
on paper dating from the 1200's

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.600
such as here in the city archive.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.390
Two important collections

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:36.620
of chronological paper samples
spanning 500 years and assembled

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.950
by the brothers, Aurelio
and Algusto Zonghi

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.300
in the 19th century are carefully
preserved in the city of Fabriano

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.630
and provide a catalog of
papers produced there.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:54.350
Now, this is a collection of 300
sheets which is in the museum.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.790
And when I was a [inaudible]
fellow, I spent two

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.900
or three weeks looking very, very
carefully at these paper samples,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.510 position:56%
and it was a great privilege and one

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.790
of my great memories
of this project.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.170
But recently, a larger collection
that belongs to the brother

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:17.270
of Aurelio, Algusto Zonghe, whicih
was in private hands for many,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.110
many years was purchased by
the foundation of the mill,

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.810
and they are looking at how
they're going to make that useful

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.710
to scholars and to the public,
and it's going to be digitized

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.400
at some point, and I've
been asked to participate

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.600
in that project which
is a great honor.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.180
But that will add a great deal

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.380
of paper samples to
scholars references.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.500
I've returned often to
Fabriano since those early 90's

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.790
to explore the history
of the city and its craft

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.090
and to examine its
wealth of material.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.570 position:56%
The book that I just published with
the library and with Oak Knoll Press

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.440
that I should acknowledge too
gives a background of history

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.160
of the industry and focuses
on the identification

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.840
of special collection items in
the Library of Congress made

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.430
with Fabriano paper including
manuscripts, printed books,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.770
maps and artist [inaudible]
like the 16th century engraving

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.080
by Marco Dente in the Prints
and Photographs Division

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.020
with its attendant,
Fabriano watermark

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.020
of a crossbow with [inaudible].

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.380
Fabriano located in
a mountain valley

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.280
in the [inaudible] region
has ancient Roman roots,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.340
and according to legend was
named after [inaudible],

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.850
a nobleman and property owner.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.840
But it's interesting
to note the similarity

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.600
of the cities named the Latin word

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.280
for craftsman, which
was [inaudible].

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.730
Archeological remains
point to the presence

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.720
of accomplished iron workers
as far back as Roman times

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.910
and a carved stone
relief of a blacksmith

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.270
on the guild hall wall
memoralizes the city's motto

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:03.620
in labor [inaudible]
meaning in work find comfort.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:08.310
This motto is translated into
watermark in the 15th century.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.400
During the middle ages, a
number of factors came together

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.700
which encouraged the craft of
papermaking to flourish here.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.260
A medieval industrial
revolution of sorts took place

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.430
in North Central Italy which among
other inventions the Roman water

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.450
wheel was adapted for
agricultural and craft practices.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.980
Shaping the destiny of
this mountain region

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.620
with its abundant natural spings

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.850
and streamlining agricultural
production, providing opportunities

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.880
for artisans to develop
other skills.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.430
The water wheel was
eventually harnessed for use

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.440
in papermaking as shown
here in this.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.670
By the way, all the books
that I'm showing you are all

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.040
from the collections of the Library

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.550
of Congress unless I
specially say it isn't.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:02.540
But here we see a water wheel
connected to a series of canals

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:09.930
and water systems here in
the parts of the water wheel.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.010
This is from an 18th century book.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.100
But the water wheels first appear
much earlier in this part of Italy.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.960
A second important development
was the spread and influence

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.610
of the Benedictine
Monastic order in the area.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.300
Aside from their literary
and spiritual focus,

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.920
monasteries were also
conduits for technical

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.620
and scientific information.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.640
Their philosophy or their rule

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.820
of [speaking foreign
language] meaning manual work

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.840
and prayer outlines the life of
work and [inaudible] combined

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.090
and had a marked influence
on the city's own motto.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:53.920
As the rule of St. Benedict
required a substantial commitment

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.600
to daily reading, Benedictines were
associated with books in libraries

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.050
since their beginnings
in the sixth century.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.400
So it's not surprising that they
were involved in the fabrication

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.110
of both parchment and paper for
manuscript and book preparation,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:17.440
and this is a library of one
of the still intact libraries

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.670
in the Monestery of Monte Fano
on the hilltop right outside

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.070
of Fabriano, which is open to
the public for consultation.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.040
Benedictine monasteries
began to fluorish

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.390
in the [inaudible] region
during the tenth century.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.410
Some of the earliest papers
produced in Fabriano are associated

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.530 position:56%
with the Benedictine Monastery of
St. Vittore delle Chiuse shown here.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.850 position:56%
Built in the 11th century and
located on the road between Fabriano

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.490
and the port city of
[inaudible] on the Adriatic.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:02.350
The architecture is said to have
marked middle eastern influences.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.090
One of the earliest watermarks
present in the Zonghe collection

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:11.830 position:56%
of papers from Fabriano has the form
of the Arabic symbol for infinity

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.640
and when visiting the
monastery first in 2009,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.550
I found the same symbol carved into
the wall of the monastery here.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.220
I should mention that the papers
of this monastery are now --

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.540
or many of the earliest ones are
in Princeton University Library.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.550
They entered that collection
in the early 20th century,

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.590
but the [inaudible] from Montefano
came and did a lot of translations

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.000
and has written about them.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.300
They're very interesting.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.980
So mills powered by water
wheels were built in this area

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.110
in the 13th century in St. Vittore
delle Chiuse, and names present

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.980
in early 14th century records of
this monastery appear as watermarks

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.500
in paper made at the same time.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.850
Other papers bear the
Benedictine orders familiar three

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.010
hills insignia.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.410
The citation of the term
[speaking foreign language]

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.180
which means rag paper mill
appears in surviving early records

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.330
of monasteries in Fabriano which
leased their mills to workers

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.110
and remained closely affiliated

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.280
with the craft throughout
the following centuries.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:37.390
So here we see the connection
between the early insignia.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.060
This is the scene from the Life
of St. Silvestro in the Monastery

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.420
of Montefano outside of Fabriano.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.670
And within the city walls are
still some remnants of early mills,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.560
and this street was called
[speaking foreign language]

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.530
and for the longest time, I
wasn't able to get a picture,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.770
a very good picture of this
building because there was

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.270 position:56%
so much construction and repair work

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.360
after the last earthquake
about 15 years ago.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.790
But the last time I went to
Fabriano finally it was all clear.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:17.590 position:56%
And these are examples of mills that
are illustrated here in this map

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.890
from geography [inaudible].

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.080
This wonderful atlas, a [inaudible]
atlas from the 17th century

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.790
that is cities of Italy and it has
wonderful illustration of Fabriano.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:32.510
And in the legend, there are over
17 monasteries that are listed

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.670
as being present still within
the city walls at that time.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.130
A factor critical to
Fabriano's future

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.620
in the craft industry was access
to both inland and sea routes

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.630 position:56%
in the Mediterranean world of trade.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.020
The town was connected
to the old Roman roads,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.030
the [speaking foreign language]
and ports on the Adriatic Sea

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.180 position:56%
which actively traded with the east.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.130
While monasteries were involved
in the construction of mills

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.940
and sometimes in the making of
paper, the product was bought

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.720
and sold by merchants
as outlined in some

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.660
of the earliest surviving
manuscripts

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.240
in the Fabriano city archive.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.220
And I find it interesting that
often the watermark of the paper

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.410
in these books is related to the
industry that it's talking about.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:29.440
So in this case, we have spinning
wheel in the guild record book

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.330
of the [inaudible] guild.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:37.760 position:56%
The success of trade and the
acquisition of wealth gave merchants

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.730
and artisans in the town of
central Italy greater leverage

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.110
in their society.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.000
And by the 13th century, Fabriano
city government had transformed

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.390 position:56%
from a futilep system ruled by noble
families to a republican commune

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.500
with elected officials
from 12 established guilds.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.830
And this is a re-renovated
façade of the cathedral,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.610
but it still has the insignia
of the most important guilds

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.240
on the façade represented there.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.870
The first recorded reference
to professional paper makers

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.120
in Fabriano is a notary's
register from 1282.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.600
So it's amazing that some
of these record books,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.640
they look a bit beat
up, but when you think

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.700
that they're 800 years
old, it's pretty impressive

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.940
that they're still around.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.350
Look of the color of
that paper on the front.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.960
That is just brilliant white still.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.630
So in this book, eight paper makers
are cited at work in the town.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.660
And inside this book, here is a
selection of some of the watermarks

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:48.530
that are present in the paper
in this book, and as it happens,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.780
like the [inaudible]
that I showed you before,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.830
these symbols are related
to early Arabic numbers

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.530
and also merchant shorthand script.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:06.690
So by 1320 paper makers
had their own guild.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.250
They began by operating as a
subsidiary of the wool guild,

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:16.290
but by 1320, they had a
representative on the own council.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.950
Before rag paper was made in
Fabriano, it was known in Italy

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.250
as [speaking foreign language]

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.760
and the word [speaking
foreign language] derives

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.420
from the Syrian city of [inaudible]
which you've probably been reading

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:37.300
about in the news recently, and it
used to be a city of great trade

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.480
where paper was brought from
all locations and sent out.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.860
And they were famous
for cotton cloth,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.860
and the word for cotton is
[speaking foreign language]

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.840
in antique Italian.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.880
And so [speaking foreign
language] was a literal translation

00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:03.200 position:56%
of cotton paper, although it wasn't
really made from cotton at the time.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.970
Carta bambagina was coated
with rice or wheat starch paste

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.710
and highly polished with
stone to receive the ink

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.170
from a [inaudible] pen of a scribe

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.360
or the loaded watercolor
brush of an artist.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.640
Important paper made using the
middle eastern technique can be

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.160
found in the 12th and
13th century archives

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.190 position:56%
of many Italian maritime cities such
as [inaudible], Venica and Pisa.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.340
And here's an example
that I uncovered

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.810
in the Siena city archives, which
has the features of carta bambagina

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.560
that was made also in
[inaudible], Spain.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.790
And I want to point out this type

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:44.310 position:56%
of watermark that's called a zig
zag watermark that is commonly found

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.180
in papers of this origin.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:53.010
But also known is that there are
some worm holes in this paper.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.210
This style of paper was
used and possibly even made

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.220
in Sicily and [inaudible].

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.560
Both areas with close ties to
the Arab world in the 1200's.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.760
However, it was not adopted
for official uses in Italy

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.620 position:56%
because of influential edicts issued
by the Roman emperor Frederick II

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.430
of Sicily who had been
convinced that paper sized

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.720 position:56%
with starch deteriorated too quickly
to use for permanent records.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.420
Not long after these
edicts were issued,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.660
Pope Nicholas IV imposed an embargo
on imports from Islamic countries,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.810
which prevented many foreign
goods from being brought

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.160
into the continental market.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.180
So parchment remained the
most popular writing support

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.480
for religious and legal
documents throughout Italy.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:49.880
The period of the papal embargo
coincides precisely with the time

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.150
that locally handmade paper began
to appear in earnest in Italy,

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.240 position:56%
quite probably first in [inaudible].

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.760
While there are a number of
theories about how knowledge

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.280
of the papermaking craft
arrived in Fabriano,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.400
I find the evidence most convincing

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.080 position:56%
that the technology was passed
along the Benedictine monastic chain

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.880
beginning in [inaudible] and
southern Italy and moving upwards

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.010
and one of the reasons I think
that is a recent discovery

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.400
that I made just the last
time I went to Italy.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.410
Unfortunately, this didn't
make it into the book.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.990
But I had always heard
of this monastery outside

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.460
of [inaudible] called [inaudible]

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.760
and how it was a very important
place for early technology built

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.790
on old Roman ruins and a hybrid
of all sorts of different styles

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.090
of construction and craft practice.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:47.980
And in that monastery library
is a manuscript dated 1250

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.090
which has both paper and I
don't know if you can see this,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:57.510
but it has the zig zag mark here
and also a second kind of paper

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.180
that was made with a fixed wire
mold, and they're both present

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:08.690
in the same manuscript that those
from these dates 1259 to '64.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.930
So it's write around
the time of the embargo.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.540
And the fact that both Arab
style papers which were made

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.440
on a flexible mold of this
period and the fixed wire molds

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.080
of the later European
papers are found

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.980
in the same manuscript
indicates that both

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.740 position:56%
of them were being used at the time.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.000
So I think that's the beginning.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:39.600
By the middle of the 13th century,
the merchant class and artisans

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.970
in the major cities
could read and write,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.750
and there was a steadily
growing need for writing material

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.090
for every day use throughout
the Italian peninsula.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.240 position:56%
Literacy had become a necessity
given the rapid economic development

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.760
of the 13th century, and here
we have an early paper made

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.060
in Fabriano.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.780
You can see how even the
casting of the sheet is

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.650
and once again the simple
watermark in the middle.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.760
And this paper is made
on a mold that does not

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.190
yet have the wooden
supports that were added

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.910
to papermaking molds later.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:17.670
So you don't see any shadows along
what we call the chain lines here.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.660 position:56%
But the condition of the paper is
still very good after all this time.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.780
the astonishing quantity of trade,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.970
church and government records
written on both paper and parchment

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.400
that survived from the 13th
century onwards in the archives

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.750
of even the smallest towns

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.130
in the Italian peninsula
today attest to this literacy.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.470 position:56%
Artisans in Fabriano had found a way

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.730
to imitate the carta bambagina
using three important technical

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.390 position:56%
innovations that made it more widely
successful in the Italian market.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.440
And they included the mechanization

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.650
of the [inaudible] preparation
process using water wheel powered

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.200
stampers as shown in this
illustration, a technology adapted

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.770
from the wool workers
fulling mill shown here.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.980
And still used in Fabriano
until really mid 20th century.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.390
This is a set of wooden stampers
that belonged to the paper mill

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:16.870
that are no longer in use but were
in use until not that long ago.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.500
The second introduction
that Fabriano brought

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.140
to the papermaking industry
was sizing the papers

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.270
with gelatin rather then starch.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.840
Gelatin, cheap gelatin,
was a byproduct

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.500
of the [inaudible] that
prepared parchment.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.980
And in fact, early Fabriano papers
were very thick and heavily sized,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.500
and it has the appearance
of parchment.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.480
This would have been more
suitable for the quill pen used

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.150 position:56%
by European scribes as opposed to
the read pen used in the Arab world.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.190
The third introduction that
Fabriano claims responsibility

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.730
for is the introduction of
watermarks to identify the paper

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.000
as locally made and not imported.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.830
The idea of marking one's
product was consistent

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.250
with other guild's practices
which required each member

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.680
to mark his product with an
individual symbol recorded

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.610
in an official guild book
such as this one in Fabriano

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:17.710
from the wool guild where symbols
display a marked similarity

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.320
to the watermarks in use at
the same time by paper makers.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.390
You probably can make
these connections here

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:31.370
in the three guilds.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:36.430 position:56%
The foremost authority on laws in
the city states in the 14th century,

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.510
the notary Bartolo di
Sassoferrato wrote in a [inaudible]

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.820 position:56%
in Fabriano there are many workshops

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.150
where they make a most
excellent paper

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.530
and each paper has its own
mark to identify its maker.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:55.400
And since he was writing in the
1300's and he only cites Fabriano

00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.110
in his reference to watermarks,
that's really the origin

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:04.740
of the association of the city
with the invention of watermarks.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.430 position:56%
So in addition to the fact that many
still exist there in their archives.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:14.310
For a brief time, watermarks
appeared as full names

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.320 position:56%
as I showed you before of the maker.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.190
But soon after, assumed the
imaginative shapes of tools,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.720
weapons, animals and
religious symbols much

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.440
like other insignia of the time.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.130
The presence of papers with
known fabriano watermarks

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.050
of the 14th century in archives in
many different locations in Europe

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:37.510
and the Mediterranean proves
its widespread use by that time.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.220
The paper was successful
because it was not only strong

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.500
but also handsome in appearance.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.030
And this had to do with the
careful selection of rags

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.470
for making the [inaudible].

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.290
This part of Italy was also
known for its cloth making.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.320
Paper was made of three different
qualities at the beginning,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.030
nd the names Bona, Fioretto
and Miglioramento came

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.680
from the different
categories of rags.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.830
Carta Grossa was the
name for wrapping paper.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:10.410
So these were the first
categories of papers made.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.960
Most of the rags used to make
early Italian paper came from worn

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.410
out garments, ship sails and
ropes or household linens.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:26.460
These are new and not rags, but
they're early examples of the kind

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:32.010 position:56%
of fabrics that this part of Italy,
Perugia in this case, is famous for.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.500
And these were made from
hemp and linen mixtures.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.600
[Inaudible] hemp was widely
grown in the Italian peninsula

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.520
up until the 1950's and
used for cloth making.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.220 position:56%
La Canapa [inaudible] variety of
hemp cultivated in calcium rich soil

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.670
like that in many parts of Italy
produced an inner plant fiber used

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.270
for making cloth which
was light in color

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.770
and subsequently a paper
that was creamy white.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:08.080
La Canapa's plant long fibers gave
the paper strength and flexibility,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.270
a desirable feature for
books and manuscripts.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.160
In addition to the
raw materials used,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.490
the mill water source
was extremely important

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.010
in determining the
quality of the paper.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.930
The natural spring water
in the [inaudible] area

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:27.380
of Italy has a high content of
alkaline earth, especially calcium.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.070
Water samples from the old mill
in springtime were collected

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.830
and analyzed and found to contain
large quantities of calcium

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.030
and very little iron,
copper or sulfur.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:42.800 position:56%
So -- and you can see here limestone
cliffs above where the monastery

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.440
of St. Vittore delle Chiuse
was which fed the water streams

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:56.030
that ran the water wheel that then
stamped the fiber, made the paper.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:00.860
Some analysis done by preservation
research and testing scientist,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:07.250
Lynn Brostoff of the Library
of Congress identified --

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.890
on [inaudible] with identified
Fabriano watermarks showed

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.550
remarkably high concentrations
of calcium in the paper.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.520
So the water that was used
for repeatedly washing cloths,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.810 position:56%
rags and [inaudible] was essentially
passing through marble chips

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.790
in the river bed and
resulted in the formation

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.840
of calcium carbonate interspersed

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.330
within the felted paper
fibers upon drying.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.830
The quantities of calcium --
I'm sure this is hard to read --

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:40.730
but they were really remarkable
and in the case of this book

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.780
that Lynn is analyzing here
which is a [inaudible] book

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.030
from the Rosenwald collection.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:52.590
There were 60 ratio of calcium to
iron in the paper could be as high

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.900 position:56%
as 62 to 1, which is extremely high.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.690
Or no, I guess there's
one with 72 to 1.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.200
So there is also some indication
from these high quantities

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.840
of calcium that lyme had been added

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.010
to the pulp during the
papermaking process.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.020
This is what the [inaudible]
book looks like in regular light.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.670 position:56%
I wanted to mention -- I should
have mentioned this at the beginning

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.850
that after this presentation,
Stephanie Stilo [assumed spelling],

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.380
the Rosenwald curator, has very
kindly agreed to put out some

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.140
of the books that I'm going to
talk about in the Rosenwald room

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.900
for those who have a chance to go

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:37.880
over to the Jefferson
building and look at them.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.220
The mills in Fabriano
where paper was made

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.670
and sized were located outside
the city along the river,

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.230
but the task of polishing,
folding and packaging it was given

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.360
to other specialists located in
workshops inside the city wall.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.840
This well known apothecary stone

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.850
from 14th century Bologna depicts
mold sizes of imperial, royal,

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.740
[inaudible] which became
the standard sizes used

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.040
in Italy and later in Europe.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.930
Perhaps it's not as well known
that the same terminology was found

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.280
in even earlier merchant
records from Fabriano.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.590
And many of these early
Italian terms are the foundation

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.480
of English technical terms
for papermaking as well.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.240
They don't always mean
exactly the same thing,

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.090
but here's some really common
foglio and folio, feltri, risma.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.580
So in the book that I published,
there is also a glossary

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.200
of Italian terms in
their translation.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.590
High quality paper was
mass produced in Fabriano

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.330
and merchants were connected to a
wide network of trading partners

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.130
within their region who
brought it to the attention

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.870
of an ever widening territory
including medieval fairs

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.540
and many cities of Europe.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.370
Paper made in the 15th
century was much improved

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.310
from its beginning product
and it's growing reputation

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.050
at the time was well deserved.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.970
Documents in archives of important
cities like Siena and Parma attest

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.860
to the fact that Fabriano paper was
"distinguished by its whiteness."

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.220
In the beginning, the cost of a
sheet of paper was 1/4 the cost

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.430
of a skin of parchment,
but by the 15th century,

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:33.530 position:56%
25 sheets of paper could be
purchased for the price of one skin.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.580
So just to summarize the reasons

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.060
for Fabriano's early success
in the paper industry.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.910
We've talked about
monastic connections,

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:46.510
abundant natural resources,
engineering, craftsmanship.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.780 position:56%
The elected representative
government which was very important,

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.770
literate population and the
established merchant networks.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.390
Commercial record books
beginning in the 14th century

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.950
from Fabriano lists quantities
of paper exported to a variety

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.340
of far away destinations.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.250
And I want to bring up --
just draw your attention

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.780
to the merchant's insignia which
is listed on the page of this book

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.320
in addition to the watermark
that you see because for all

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.400
of the transactions in these books,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.100
the symbol of the merchant
always accompanies them,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.510
the buyer and the seller.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.980
Often the type of paper is
listedin these record books

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.320
by size, quality and watermark.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.950 position:56%
Exports increase in the next century
and the names of paper makers

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.430
and merchants reappear
again and again

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:42.140
over time indicating
families remained active

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.150
in the profession for
many generations.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:49.870
So this Ambrogio de
Bonaventura was a descendent

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:54.870
of that original [inaudible]
name that was in one

00:37:54.870 --> 00:38:00.520
of the earliest papers that I
showed you, and so Bonaventura was

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.890
under [inaudible] and Ambrogio
was son of Benaventura,

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.320
and then Lodovico d'Ambrogio
shown in this painting

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.920
by Gentile de Fabriano is a paper
merchant and here you can see

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.310
that his symbol is included with
his portrait in this painting.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.070
Gentile de Fabriano
is the most famous

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.020
of the Fabriano School of Art.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.110
But another artist
of great interest,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.410
[inaudible] who has
a wonderful painting

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:34.520
in the national gallery here in
Washington, his records indicated

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:40.480
that seasonal workers in paper
also worked as apprentices

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.830
in the artist's workshop.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.920
So the same names of
people who worked

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.280
in the paper industry were
also associated sometimes

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.580
with artist's workshops.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.050
The widening availability
of good quality paper

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:00.070
in Italy encouraged the growth
of the printing industry,

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.110
enabling many individuals to read
and own books given that the cost

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.740
of a printed book to the
consumer was perhaps 1/5

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.740
that of a handwritten manuscript.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.380
It's estimated that more than 80
presses were operating in Italy

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.670
in the late 1400's and
that's the largest quantity

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.240
of any European country.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.570 position:56%
Of course, the demand for paper grew
exponentially with the introduction

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.170
of printing and despite repeated
guild prohibitions issued

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.840
in Fabriano against the
dissemination of trade secrets

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.710
to other locations, the technology
spread through the mobility

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.060
of craftsman who were recruited
to other cities who were centers

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:47.310
of printing such as Venice
and Florence and Naples

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.990
and northern cities as well.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.860
Nevertheless, in examining
books and prints of high value

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.400
and prestige made in the
first century of printing,

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.700
it's clear that paper from
Fabriano is still very much prized.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.390
Written records also confirm

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.270
that certain printers preferred
Fabriano paper for their works,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:10.440
especially prized was paper
made in large dimensions.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:16.710
And this is a wonderful book
about husbandry and agriculture

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.900
and it is open to a page
that's about all kinds

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.810
of different [inaudible] and
the book is just wonderful

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:28.330
because even though it's 1478,
the Italian is Florentine Italian

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:33.220
and the type is very, very legible
so you can read this and learn

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.750
about how -- their advice for the
best way of growing a [inaudible]

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:46.500 position:56%
or other yeah, and keep in mind this
watermark of the [inaudible] there.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:51.880
So there's a lot more history to be
covered, and I can't do 750 years

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.030
in one lunchtime lecture.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:59.590
So -- but I have to mention one
thing that I know Susan might --

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.520
Susan, my editor would be very
disappointed if I didn't mention,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.730
and that is that there were some
ups and downs in the industry

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:13.490
and a real downer was -- happened
in 1435 when a particular family

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:17.640
that was very influential, the
Chiavelli's who were very involved

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.180
in the wool industry and
also in the paper industry

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.480
and owned a lot of mills.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.740 position:56%
In fact, there are many waterks with
keys as their symbol, and Chiavelli,

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.880
the word is very close to
the word for keys in Italian.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.330
But apparently they became
too big for their britches

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.710
because there was a
conspiracy against them.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:42.990
And in this choir stall 14
conspirators hid in the cathedral

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.960
with weapons under their clothing
and in the middle of the mass,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:52.040 position:56%
they got up and attacked all of the
mail members of the Chiavelli family

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.260
who were the patrons
of the cathedral,

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.280
and that was the end of them.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.820
So in fact they had to get
permission from the pope

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.770
to let the poor women of
the Chiavelli family escape

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.960
and these kinds of things
were not unusual in that time.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.150
I mean, everyone knows about the
[inaudible] conspiracy in Florence

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:17.100
but even smaller towns like
Fabriano had their episodes.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.490
And this fire stall had to
be moved from the cathedral.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.340
It's in another cathedral now.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:31.270
But I just had to show
a picture of it.

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.660
And even though the book
is entitled Medieval

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.410
and Renaissance Papermaking,
I just wanted to mention

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.360
that I have a chapter
about the 18th century

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.950
because this very important figure,
Pietro Miliani, is responsible

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.770
for the regeneration
of the industry.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:53.790
After the Chiavelli massacre, there
were a lot of political rivalries

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.410
and there were definitely ups
and downs in the industry,

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:03.020
although it has been maintained
continuously from the 1200's.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:08.200 position:56%
But Pietro Miliani who was the paper
maker who made some of the papers

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:14.150 position:56%
for [inaudible] prints, for
example, was a very important figure

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:15.910
for the renovation of --

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:20.000
and resurgence of papermaking
from the 18th century forward.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.720
And his family continued
the tradition.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.500
They died out, but
now it's interesting

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.090
that the [inaudible] family
has taken over the mill

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:35.210
and it's thriving under that name.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:41.020
Another interesting thing about
Pietro Miliani is he is one

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:47.200
of the first paper makers to
introduce wove paper in Italy.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.340
Although their technology was
very advanced in the medieval

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.410
and renaissance period, they
kind of fell behind the Dutch

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:59.740
and the English in the 17th and
18th century with their innovations

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.830
and the English wove paper
which had very little texture

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.220
and was really preferred by
print makers and many artists,

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.800
remained elusive to Italian
paper makers for quite some time

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.320
until Pietro Miliano and people
of his generation were able

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.320
to develop the molds that
produced this kind of paper.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.510
And fortunately here at the
library, we have wonderful examples

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:27.230
of his paper in the
[inaudible] patterns and also

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.360
in the wove patterns that
he developed afterwards.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.030
So let's look at some other items
from the library's collections

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.750
that I was able to
find that were related

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.070
to Fabriano and his papermaking.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.710
The earliest ones are two
manuscripts interestingly enough.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.900
One is [inaudible]
and one is Arabic.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:57.540
And this is a copy of a
Responsa from the famous rabbi,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.680
Solomon ben Abraham
ibn Adret of Barcelona,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.360
and it contains a watermark of
an eagle which is the same as one

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:16.600 position:56%
that I found in the archives of
Fabriano from the same date as this.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:22.380
And in this case, this
is an Arabic manuscript.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:28.650
It's a pharmaceutical text and
it has this watermark here.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:32.610 position:56%
It's called a key, but it has an
interesting resemblance I think also

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.100
to a [inaudible] or
even a [inaudible].

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.400
So I don't know.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.730
Because some of the other
watermarks related that were done

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.390
at this time are related to
the content of the information

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.120 position:56%
of the book, it would be interesting

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.650
to see what other historians
think about that.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.290
But this is another book where half

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.840
of the paper was actually
European paper and half

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.860
of the paper was Arabic style.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.890
Here we're looking at an early
book of Dante that was printed

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:11.770 position:56%
in Florence in 1481 and it's an
early example of an illustrated book

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.100
and that's why there are
two copies in the library.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:20.780
One is in Rosenwald and one is in
I think the [inaudible] collection.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:32.280
And so you can see here that these
prints were included in the text.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.190
This was a very expensive
enterprise that was --

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.810
because this paper is actually
imperial size, it's very large

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:44.190
and it was a very deluxe edition
that was put together by a group

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.880
of humanists in Florence who
wanted to include a commentary

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.170
on Dante's divine comedy by one
of their famous philosphers.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:58.910
And it was an attempt to kind
of reclaim Dante as a man

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.180
of their city this
particular deluxe version.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.580
And it needed a lot of
money to pay for the paper

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.990
but also the many artists and
print makers who worked on it.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:16.600
And you can see once again we have
this paper with the [inaudible].

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.050 position:56%
So it would be much more interesting
to look at this book in person.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.910 position:56%
So I'll go through this quickly,
but obviously they have a little bit

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:29.140
of trouble printing the copper
plates in with the type set.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.590
The print -- the typographer
printed the text first

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:38.390
and left the blank pages where the
illustrations were supposed to go.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:41.340
And these illustrations
were made by [inaudible]

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:48.070
who was an early engraver working
in Florence, and they were inspired

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:52.500
by drawings that had been done by
[inaudible] and so here you can see

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.580
that he had trouble
with the registration

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.880
when he printed the
plate on the paper,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.320
and you can see the plate
mark from the back here

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.490
on this particular image.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.820
So later they decided that
maybe that wasn't going

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.250
to work out terribly well.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:11.920
Since they seem to
have a lot of time

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.420
because although the typographer
did his part doing the prints

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.440
and finding the drawings to
do the prints after seemed

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.960
to take much longer time.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.470
So in the case of the
following illustrations,

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.420
they printed them separately
on paper

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.990
and then pasted them into the book.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.450
And I'm just showing you
here a sample from one

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:39.250
of the Zonghi collection of the
larger collection that I looked

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.950
at that had a lot of
imperial size paper in it.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.230
And once again, I just draw your
attention to how white it is.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:49.700 position:56%
And someone at some point had
outlined the watermark in the paper.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:55.950
Not me. But here's the whole
sheet in transmitted light.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:57.650
You can see the size
of the watermark,

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:02.330
and that is the exact same
paper used in the production

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:07.230
of that Dante book that
was printed in Florence.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:14.230
So that was an exciting match.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:20.370
Atlases are also a great source of
Fabriano paper and that's partly

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.560
because they required large
sheets and sheets of good quality

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.650
and so this [inaudible]
watermark is a very popular one

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.280
for the oversized sheets that
were produced in Fabriano

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.890
and we have I think the largest
collection of [inaudible] atlases

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:40.820
in maybe the U.S., many of
which were printed in Italy

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.870
and some printed in Rome.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:49.020
And I think that using the
watermarks to date the making

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.040
of the maps would be very useful

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.430 position:56%
because sometimes the same paper
was used for many different editions

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:59.590
of these volumes, and it
certainly would be a good project.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:04.830
I found them often to
have Fabriano paper.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:11.050
This is a manuscript from
the manuscript division.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:16.420
It's called the Amoretti Codex
after the owner of the codex

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:22.090
who is a Roman priest, but it's
actually a copy of a letter written

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:30.730
by Amerigo Vespucci after his
voyages in the new world and it's

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:36.440 position:56%
on a paper that has the same hunting
horn watermark that we saw earlier.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:41.990
And this is a very important piece
because the original has been lost

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:45.940
and so we have a copy of this
that is a contemporary copy

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.490
and once again, the watermark
can help date the time,

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:54.140
at least it can tell you that
the item was not done before a

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.660
certain time.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:00.650
It can't necessarily tell you
how late it is, but anyway.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:03.240
Of course, some of the
earliest printed books

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.220
in italy were religious text
and this Bible that was printed

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.510
in Naples was also
on oversized paper.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:12.990
And it's about 450 pages.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:17.180
It's a [inaudible]
Bible,and many of the papers

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.260
in it are Fabriano including
this well known watermark.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:26.350
It's maybe a little bit hard to
see here but here is the same paper

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:31.040
that was present in
the Fabriano archives.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:38.070
That same shear patter, which
since there was a very active wool

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.920
industry and there was probably
a lot of shearing of sheep,

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.590
it was a symbol that comes
from the local industry.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:51.200
It was interesting to me that
this particular book was printed

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.750
in four different cities
at the same time in Naples,

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:57.220
Florence, Rome and Venice.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:02.890
This book that is by [inaudible]
on great men of ancient Rome

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:06.940 position:56%
and all four versions of the book --
they weren't printed the same year,

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.160
but they were printed within
15 years of each other,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.470 position:56%
and they were all on Fabriano paper.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:16.080
Different watermarks but
all from the same source.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.590
An important printer to
mention who is often associated

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:27.280
with Fabriano papers is the printer
Gershom Sancino who immigrated

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.730 position:56%
to Italy from Germany and settled in
the [inaudible] region for a while

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.900
and did quite a bit
of printing there both

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.960
in Hebrew [inaudible]
type and in Roman type.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.570
He's very celebrated there.

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.470
There's a street named after him
and in the archive, there's a list

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:51.580
of the receipts for the paper that
he purchased for Fabriano for many

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.480
of these volumes, and he's still
well known for the way that he laid

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.410 position:56%
out the page in this beautiful
pattern and here's the original text

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.250
and the commentary around
it, and I understand

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:08.460
that even contemporary
[inaudible] that are used

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.740 position:56%
in services have still retained some

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.520
of his same original
typography pattern.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.330
He was not always able to
use the finest quality paper

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:25.070
for his Hebrew text, but he did
as I say also print on commission.

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:28.070
He printed the statutes
of the city of [inaudible]

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:32.880
and he also printed this
cardinal's book and in this case,

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.330
he was able to use
the expensive paper.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:44.820
Many other objects in the
library were found that were made

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.150
on Fabriano paper including
a lot of fine prints here,

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.940
this [inaudible] print by Ugo
de Carpi along with a number

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:55.320
of other prints from the
Pembrook album [inaudible]

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.470
and this is another important
symbol associated with Fabriano.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:05.720
It's a ladder and there was the
Scala family who was very involved

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.300
in papermaking and [speaking
foreign language] means ladder

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.600
and also [speaking
foreign language].

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:14.900
In this case, we had [speaking
foreign language] and Scala family.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:20.460
They probably owned the mill
that used this watermark.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:27.240
And another very lovely
print by Domenico Beccafumi,

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.220
another chiaroscuro woodcut.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:34.090
He was an artist from Siena and
although Siena also made paper,

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:37.770
their industry was begun
by Fabriano craftsmen

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:45.370
and they still imported the
oversized fine quality paper

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:46.670
from Fabriano.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:50.400
I think artists also liked it
because it was quite substantial.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.430
And if you have to put
your print as in this case

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:57.570
through the press several times,
in this case at least twice,

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:02.580
you have to have a paper that's
strong enough to withstand that.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:10.910
Now for paper conservators who are
here, this is an important slide

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.670
for telling you how you can
identify Fabriano paper even

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.330
if you are not sure
about the watermark.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:21.560
Their mold style was
such that the watermark

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:31.280
after about 1350 was always
in between two chain lines

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.270
with a chain line in the middle

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.960
that was called the
supplemental chain line

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.260
or the [speaking foreign language].

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.560
But you can't really
see very well here,

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.300
but it didn't have a
wooden support behind it.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.490
In the case of this paper,
this paper was made with a mold

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.530
that had wooden supports
behind each chain line.

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.450
But you see where the watermark is,
it was actually a chain line there,

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.930
but there's no wooden
support behind it.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.090
And that's a clue that the
paper was made certainly

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.360
in the mold style of Fabriano.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.760
You have to find an exact match
of the watermark itself also

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.790
because papers were copied.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:13.310
But this is an important
feature to know.

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:18.680
The Zonghi collection that's in
the museum has been published,

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.020
but it was a contraband publication
where the tracings were stolen

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.530
out of Italy by the person
who had done them and sold

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.890
to a Dutch paper historian,
and they were published

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.380
by the Hilversom Society
in the 1950's,

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.910
but it's still a very,
very useful book.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:39.220
The unfortunate thing about this
book is that unlike [inaudible]

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.610
for those of you who
are paper historians,

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:45.740
it doesn't give you the exact
manuscript that each one

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.950
of these watermarks
is associated with.

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.160
So you just have to trust that
the date that they're giving you

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.050
in the book is the real one.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:57:02.660
But with the new acquisition of
the larger collection by the mill,

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.130
the registry book that is
associated with every single one

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.970
of these papers was also
part of the collection.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.150
So now there's going to be a lot
more information for historians

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:17.670 position:56%
to date papers by these
watermarks, and the digital versions

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.930
of them will give you more
information about the paper itself.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:25.890
So while this book is still useful,
just pay attention to what's coming

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:29.010
in the future because
it will be an addition.

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:34.030
So here's a watermark from
that second collection,

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:37.240
and some people have asked me okay,
well so you spent all this time

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:42.800
on medieval and renaissance
paper, what is your next chapter?

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.910
Are you going to stick
with Fabriano?

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:49.910
And one thing that really interests
me is 20th century papers made

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:56.920
in Fabriano and their use by
artists in America as well all

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.110
over the world, and this is a
wonderful drawing by Georg O'Keefe

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:06.540
in the Milwaukee Art Museum
that has a [inaudible] watermark

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.090
that you can see even
through the frame.

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:14.710
So I'd like to explore the use
of more modern Fabriano papers

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.850
by artists working today.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.650
So, thank you very much.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:26.650
[ Applause ]

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.300

of the Library of Congress.
