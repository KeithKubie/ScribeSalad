00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.820
- Hey, everyone, and I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.270
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.640
and just sitting down for a
really simple, quick lunch.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.340
Look's like a donut fried egg.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.440
Oh, the yolk, take a bite, get chilies,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.673
there's basil on here.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.980
Oh, wow.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.730
Yeah, that's delicious.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.830
But ever since I took a trip to Pakistan,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.700
which was really, it was
the trip of a lifetime,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.019
I have been wanting to
go back to Pakistan.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.330
(bottle hisses)

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.680
Welcome to Karachi!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.173
I'm very excited to be back,

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:30.670
and I wanna say huge thank you to Pepsi

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.040
for sponsoring this video.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.180
Today, actually in this video,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.080
we are going to go on

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.300
an ultimate Western Pakistani
continental street food tour!

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.340
We're starting in Karachi,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.630
we're gonna go to Islamabad,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.540
we're gonna go to Lahore,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.410
we're gonna eat burgers,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650
the chutneys are gonna flow,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.990
it's gonna be some amazing food

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.650
that I'm gonna share everything
with you in this video,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.867
and again, a huge thank you to
Pepsi for making this happen!

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.534
(excited music)

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.030
We just arrived to a place
called Nursery Burger.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.135
Oh, you could smell the
burger fumes in the air!

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:08.552
(music jams)

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.270
Their burger production at
Nursery Burger is so impressive!

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.673
Just watching so many
of the Pakistani dishes

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:21.890
three different types that you can order.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.330
You can order the beef chapli,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.570
which is like a hamburger,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.830
you can order the chicken chapli,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.130
which is like a chicken burger,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.340
and then you can order the vegetable,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.350
which is, looks like a potato patty.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.187
Those all go onto the hot plate,

00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:34.980
then on the other side of the hot plate,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.720
he takes a swipe of chutney,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210
puts that onto the bun,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.007
then he loads it up with
a mixture of onions,

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:41.810
and it looks like there's
some coriander in there

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.741
and maybe some slices of beetroot!

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:47.824
(restaurant chatter)

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:53.346
(groovy music)

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.507
He cuts it in half.

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.160
Immediately, that goes onto,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.639
like scooted off the
hot plate onto a plate

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.170
and then they squeeze on both a chutney

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.482
and then tomato sauce onto the
plate that you could dip in.

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:27.600
- We are so glad to have Mark back,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.383
feels like a dream, but always reality.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.227
- Reunited!

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:34.237
Joel is here.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:38.080
- Oh, so beyond excited, beyond
words, literally right now.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.480
- We're so, yeah, it's so
great to be back in Pakistan!

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.650
Again, the warm welcome,
we're starting with super,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.700
not just Nursery Burger,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.830
this is the Super Nursery Burger.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.773
I'm going for the beef chapli burger.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.240
Oh, the chutneys, there's
more chutney down there

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.610
in that handful of onions and coriander,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.780
and then I think that's even beetroot,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.930
and then the patty, you
can see how tender it is,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.600
the lettuce is on there, the tomato.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.680
Look at that cross section!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.800
- [All] Cheers!

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.963
Cheers!

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.088
- Oh, wow, the spices in the burger,

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:13.696
the chutney, you taste the
coriander seed in that meat.

00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:17.280
The burger is perfectly soft
and crunchy on the edges,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.160
the coriander seed, that
is the noticeable effect.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.230
But, we gotta dip it in that chutney,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.570
and when I mean dip, I
mean like a full swipe.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.403
- It's amazing.

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:28.964
Shata rules, man.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.380
- (appreciative grunting) The
chutney is a little bit spicy,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.715
you really taste the onions in it,

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.860
and mint, I think it's
mint in the chutney, right?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.290
Taste like, really
refreshing from the mint.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.552
Thank you!

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:43.135
(excited beat)

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.980
Oh, there's a chunk!

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.036
Oh, there's a chunk!

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:51.286
(laughter)

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.730
It is so good, it's
all about that chutney.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:01.692
Jean, how's the burger?

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:03.109
- It's very good.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.670
- The combination of
the chutney, the bread,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.203
the texture, the patty!

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.370
This is literally the type of place

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.820
you just want to sit for the
rest of the afternoon in,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.553
just order burger after
burger, because it's so good!

00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:20.489
It's so tasty, but we gotta
move on to the next place.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.989
(happy music)

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.950
Next place that we're
going is called Hanifia.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.560
It's an establishment in Karachi,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.710
and I'm not even totally
sure what it is, yet.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.110
We're gonna find out, but
it's called Hunter Beef.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.410
This place is typically more busy,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.230
and just packed at night.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.390
We're here in the middle of the day,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.390
but they said they could make it for us.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.833
- [Chef] The beef.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:51.666
- [Mark] This is Hunter Beef?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.499
- [Chef] This is Hunter Chicken.

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:53.332
- Hunter Chicken.

00:04:53.332 --> 00:04:54.165
He just sliced the bun,

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.717
and he's just toasting it in
a hot drawer down below there,

00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:02.090
but Hunter Beef, it's the
Pakistani version of corned beef.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.090
Buns are coming out.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.299
Just puts a good amount of
the Hunter Shredded Beef

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:18.240
onto the bun, and then
he added on a tomato,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.070
a slice of tomato, a slice of cucumber.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.900
The meat actually comes from the bowel,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.100
stomach section of the cow.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.847
Oh, it's kind of heavy!

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:28.733
Like, a half of a Hunter Beef.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.710
Let's see that cross-section.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.505
I think you lost your cucumber.

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:41.490
(laughs)

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.560
It's bacon-y, like the flavor of the meat

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.530
is not that pronounced, like corned beef,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.313
but not as salty, milder in taste.

00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:55.413
To me, it's not quite
as tasty as a burger.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.503
All right!

00:05:58.503 --> 00:05:59.642
(paper crunches)

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.642
(tuneful drum beat)

00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:08.601
(street chatter)

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.951
- Thanks.
- Thank you, nice to meet you!

00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:19.051
Very nice to meet you!

00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:22.924
- Pakistan!

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.211
- [All] Zindabad!

00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:25.044
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you so much!

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:25.877
- Thank you, thank you!

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:27.690
We just stopped by the
Muhammad Ali jinnah,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.140
which is the mausoleum.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.940
He is the founding father of Pakistan,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.440
and he's one of the most respected,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.871
one of the most revered persons
in the history of Pakistan.

00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:39.960
We took some selfies, we took some photos,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.070
that was a great experience.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.610
We're on our way now to eat the next.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.060
Ali, what are we eating next?

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.236
(laughs)

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:50.819
(excited beat)

00:06:53.524 --> 00:06:56.013
Naans, cloud naans, cloud nine of naans?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.802
Is this the Philly Cheese Steak?

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:01.221
- [Ali] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.593
- That's the one, so what they do is,

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:04.400
they take every kind of stuffing

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.810
and put that into the naan.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.223
Chocolate, cheese, potatoes, whatnot.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.320
- Not quite pizza, but like calzone style,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.360
so he has the base, he fills
it with the ingredients,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.490
it's gonna be the Philly Cheese Steak,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.140
and the other things that we got,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.300
loads it up with cheese!

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.386
Oh, here comes the first
ingredients, the Oreo one!

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:27.053
(chiming music)

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.750
Fully-loaded ingredients on top!

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.790
It's like, packed, stuffed,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.400
and then he puts on a top
layer of dough, of naan,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.540
and then that goes into the oven,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.893
and they have a full wood fire oven.

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:46.793
That smells so good!

00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:49.376
(excited beat)

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.600
I love how he just tosses
them into the oven,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.560
and then he works that.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.600
You can see the bubbling
up immediately, blistering.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.590
But I love how this
place is totally set up

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.170
like a pizza, a take-out
pizza joint, pizza place.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.813
The boxes are all ready to go.

00:08:12.787 --> 00:08:16.204
(crusty bread crunching)

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:20.563
- [Jean] Wow, that's nice.

00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:21.623
- That's the Philly Cheese Steak.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.980
All of the naans are ready.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.660
We got five different versions.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.040
This is the one that I
really wanted to try,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.260
which is the Philly Cheese Steak.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.070
We also got the sweet one,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.870
we got the chicken shawarma,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.390
we got the, I think this
is the fried chicken one.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.440
He cut most of the others,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.096
but I think the Philly Cheese Steak...

00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:40.310
(laughs) Oh, you could
pick up this whole thing

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.370
and just bite it! (laughs)

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.500
Okay, no, I will tear off.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.240
Oh, that beef in there, the cheese,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.500
oh, that does look wonderful.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.550
Every naan comes with
their own sauce as well,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.900
but I'll just try it first.

00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:03.057
Oh, wow!

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:05.230
O-la!

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.635
That's it, right? (laughs)

00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:09.090
- Aala! (laughs)
- Nice.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.030
- Aala!

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.890
It's like a tangy barbecue sauce.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.890
The cheese, that is Pakistani
Philly Cheese Steak naan,

00:09:18.006 --> 00:09:19.623
and that's awesomely good.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.850
Which one is that?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.450
- It smells awesome!

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.971
I love the green peppers and
the steak is quite tender.

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.885
(bottle hisses)

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:37.840
- (laughs) 'Cause I dropped it!

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.580
Yeah, I wanna try the
chicken shawarma next.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.093
The piece is absolutely stuffed
with chicken and cheese,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.390
and this one needs to be sauced.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.240
That does taste exactly like a shawarma.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.880
- Really good.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.932
- Cloud Naan has offered
a variety of naan.

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.015
- [Ali] Yes!
- [Mark] Yes!

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.818
(sizzling)

00:10:07.198 --> 00:10:08.750
(restaurant chatter)

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.820
- [Mark] Yeah, yeah, this is the story,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.880
the Mr. Burger story!

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.830
So we're at a burger franchise restaurant

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.970
that is very well known,
especially in Karachi,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.888
called Mr. Burger, and as the story,

00:10:18.888 --> 00:10:21.206
pretty much the story is that

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.820
the brothers went to America.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.335
They worked for a fast food franchise,

00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.966
and they wanted to bring
it to Pakistan, to Karachi,

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:32.630
but then they got turned down.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.463
- Exactly.

00:10:33.463 --> 00:10:34.650
- They got turned down,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.050
so eventually they had an idea, they said,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.203
we're gonna make our own
burger franchise in Pakistan,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.730
and that was back in 1980.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.380
Then, they opened up their own franchise,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.440
they opened up their own Mr. Burger,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.061
and we're about to taste this.

00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:52.440
So, it has a unique story in Pakistan,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.070
it's a very well-loved, very well-known

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.320
hamburger restaurant in Karachi.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.985
And is it only in Karachi,
or all over Pakistan now?

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:01.818
- Only in Karachi.

00:11:01.818 --> 00:11:02.860
- [Mark] Only in Karachi, okay.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.110
How many branches are there in Karachi?

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
- Ten, ten.

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:06.900
- Ten branches, ten branches, cool.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.260
I'm gonna order the Mr. Big.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.270
It's a double patty, double cheese,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.370
double onions, double everything.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.759
It looks pretty good.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.426
(easygoing jam)

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:25.790
The wind just blew off
my ketchup containers,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.640
okay, that's all right, though.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.377
Let's unwrap this.

00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:30.540
Oh ho ho, the cheese is oozing,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.190
oh, that does look like
an amazing burger, though.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.890
The cheese is oozing, the double patties,

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.090
I love how they put them
pickled, vinagered onions on it

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.050
as they just sizzle away on the hot plate,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.000
then some of that hot sauce,
some of their own hot sauce.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.420
- [Ali] And the mustard!

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.650
- And the mustard, yeah,
the mustard and ketchup

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.560
goes on as well on the bun.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.760
Oh yeah, that beef.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.440
Oh, another cool thing is that they use

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.550
100% pure Pakistani beef,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.553
so this is a a real
Pakistani fast food burger.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.440
(appreciative grunting)

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.730
Oh wow, that's pretty good, actually.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.173
The beef immediately stands out,

00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:09.290
like it's all about, you really taste

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.630
the quality of the beef

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.463
and the crumbliness of the beef.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:17.560
(appreciative grunting)

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.300
Yeah, the beef, the freshness of the beef.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.133
- [Ali] Yeah, exactly.

00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:21.210
- [Mark] Okay, who wants to try it next?

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.770
- Your first bite, I
saw it juice a little,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.013
and my saliva glands started working.

00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:33.128
(appreciative grunting)

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:36.020
- I want a bite, too. (laughs)

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.010
I want a bite, too.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.381
- [Mark] Feed the man!

00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:40.676
- Feed me, feed me.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.191
(laughter and appreciative groaning)

00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:43.920
- [Mark] You gotta try the Mr. Burger.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.753
You should try.

00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:47.073
- Hey, the fries are good.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.043
- This is really good!

00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:50.980
- Yeah!

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.120
- Haven't you tried that before?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.550
- Nope!

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.542
- Would you like to?

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.792
(laughter)

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.400
The final place that we are at tonight,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.100
and the final place that
we're gonna eat at in Karachi

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.910
before we move on to Islamabad,

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.540
is called Biryani of the Seas.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.570
And by the way, I just want to
point out the sin-styled hat.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.030
We ordered a seafood platter,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.100
I think it's gonna be served
kind of platter style,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.010
but there's fish, there's
crab, there's gonna be shrimp,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.210
and he is marinating
them in two different,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.190
one is spicy masala, one
is a more mild masala,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.608
but a green chili masala.

00:13:30.608 --> 00:13:32.858
(sizzling)

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.310
I think he brushed on some oil,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.137
and then that just, the smoke just lit up,

00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:43.980
and now he's fanning it out.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.200
That smells so good,
standing in a cloud of smoke,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.440
but they're really slow grilling it

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.140
so that it cooks, it doesn't burn,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.526
but cooks through it

00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:53.473
and that just has that smoky taste to it.

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.159
- Baryani, two fish.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.613
- What do you want to start with?

00:14:00.938 --> 00:14:02.820
(laughs)

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.767
Let's start with the fish, okay.

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:05.450
- [Joel] Oh, that's so soft, oh my god.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.863
- Yeah!
- Yeah! (laughs)

00:14:11.948 --> 00:14:12.919
(appreciative grunting)

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.610
That's masala, that's like liquid masala,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.483
that it is marinated in.

00:14:16.483 --> 00:14:18.453
You taste a little bit of
the dried chili in there.

00:14:18.453 --> 00:14:20.940
It's delicious, it's
wonderful, and so smoky.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.900
- Almost like roasted black pepper,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.910
it's really wonderful.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.760
- Again, with the shrimp, we
got two different marinades.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.860
The green and the red masala,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.760
and I think this should be a
tamarind dipping sauce, yeah?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.623
Immersion.

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:39.150
(appreciate groaning)

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.630
Oh, that's wonderful,
so springy in texture.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.970
And that red masala marinade,
for me, that's the winner.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.590
Because they have masala,
has just caked on,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.096
there from the grill,
it almost looks fried.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.231
(crunching)

00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:54.190
- Oh yes. (appreciative grunting)

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.696
Oh wow, that's awesome, like,

00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:58.380
it's kind of dried out, dehydrated,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.660
and then all that masala has just caked up

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.653
into the meat, onto the shell.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.020
They have really, really good masala here.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.610
It's been an amazing day in Karachi.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.460
We've met so many amazing people,

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.870
eaten some amazing, the
food has been delicious

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.090
on this western, Pakistani,
continental food tour.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.293
The buns, the burgers, the seafood!

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.303
See you in Islamabad!

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.335
(laughter)

00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:27.585
Oh, sorry, Ali!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.260
- Please take me to
Islamabad, it's my scene,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.463
you're gonna take me anyway, take me.

00:15:34.947 --> 00:15:36.980
- Welcome to Islamabad!

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.480
(happy music)

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.630
First place we're going to in Islamabad

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.050
is called Najeeb Spot,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.640
and they are very well-known

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.214
for their Afghani burger.

00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:01.797
(chill groove)

00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:07.040
- Beef sausage?
- [Mark] Beef sausage!

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.783
- Chicken!
- [Mark] Chicken Sausage!

00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:12.116
(car horns)

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.717
What is that?

00:16:16.717 --> 00:16:17.550
Masala?

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:23.500
- [Chef] Afghan chutney.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.583
- [Mark] Afghan chutney?
- [Chef] Yes.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.883
I'm adding ketchup.

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:37.730
- [Mark] Whoa.

00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:41.394
- [Chef] A bunch special chicken.

00:16:41.394 --> 00:16:42.300
- [Mark] He added on some masala,

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.780
he added on some Afghan chutney,

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.940
he added on some mayonnaise,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.760
he added on some sauces, some ketchup,

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.880
then you could get different versions,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.000
you can order different versions,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.010
the chicken, the beef,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.480
the, like, there's some
balogna-ish looking meat.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.920
Basically, everything is deep-fried

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.720
and then stuffed within that bread

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.500
with the french fries and rolled up.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.010
And from the outside, it's just
a mystery which one you get.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.340
Could be the chicken, could be the beef.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.490
- [Ali] You have to come to
my city to have this burger.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.783
You have to come to Islamabad.

00:17:10.783 --> 00:17:11.870
- Islamabad.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.580
- [Joel] I haven't seen
anything about these things.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.480
- The pride of Islamabad comes to food.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.350
- [Mark] Is there a
strategy to eating this?

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.490
It's one of those things where

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.420
I don't think you should
unwrap the whole thing,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.590
or you might lose things out the back end.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.150
Maybe just unwrap the top.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.983
- [Ali] Oh wow.

00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.010
- Oh, some extra Afghan chutney!

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.110
Oh, that looks good!

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.943
Oh, wow.

00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:33.965
- [Ali] It can explode any minute.

00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:35.430
- [Mark] It's like a half a
bottle of mayonnaise in here!

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.346
(laughter)

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:38.074
- Sometimes you hold it, it's
about to explode, I mean.

00:17:38.074 --> 00:17:40.120
- Cheers, guys, cheers.

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:45.945
(appreciative groaning)

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.200
- I got like an entire mouthful
of mayonnaise. (laughs)

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.670
Just a moundful of french fries,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.810
like condensed into bread.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.680
The chutneys, the masalas,
that's the unique thing about it,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.480
is the masala blended with the mayonnaise.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.313
Just dip it?

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.433
Just do the wipe, the wipe dip?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.500
This might be the ultimate fast food

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.500
you can possibly have in the world.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.603
Everything in one!

00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:26.486
(appreciative groaning and laughing)

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.630
Definitely, actually, the
sauce, that Afghan chutney,

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.302
that is the best thing about it.

00:18:31.302 --> 00:18:34.123
It's like vinager-y, it's really garlic-y.

00:18:34.123 --> 00:18:37.583
I'm just gonna pour. (laughs)

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.640
After eating half of this,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.090
I still don't know if I got the chicken

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.950
or the beef or the shishkebab,

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.210
and I don't think it really matters!

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.640
And that is the Afghani burger.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.950
It's not something I would
eat on a daily basis,

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.861
but definitely at two
A.M. when you're hungry

00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:55.550
and need something kinda
greasy, kinda oily.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.290
That is exactly what you
would want to be eating,

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.070
and also it's just fun
to see them make it,

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.150
that's just like all
the things deep-fried,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.109
wrapped up and mayonnaise-y.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:06.070
(fans whirr)

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.190
Ali was explaining to me that Islamabad

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.730
is known for their burgers,

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.750
so people from Islamabad, they love,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.431
throughout Pakistan,
from Karachi to Lahore,

00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:18.290
Islamabad is known for
being burger lovers.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.383
And so, we're at a place,
it's called Burger Fest.

00:19:20.383 --> 00:19:23.724
The smoke is pouring, I love their slogan:

00:19:23.724 --> 00:19:24.840
Let's Meat!

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.310
- [Ali] The Beef Binda.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.170
- [Mark] Which looks like,

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.760
I don't even know what
that center layer is,

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.822
but it just looks like cheese
is just squeezing out of it.

00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:34.742
(meat sizzles)

00:19:34.742 --> 00:19:39.242
(restaurant chatter and chill groove)

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.430
We got one of the chicken,
one of the beef burgers.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.810
For the beef, he grills the beef,

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.920
I like it, they use
hot, flaming charcoals.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.160
Yeah, that's just like a good,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.890
solid, hearty, beautiful looking burger.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.620
This one is the Beef Binda burger.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.310
That is a beautiful looking burger.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.260
I love the sesame seeds on top.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.093
Dude!

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.460
(excited chuckling)

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.210
Oh, that's beautiful!

00:20:13.615 --> 00:20:16.948
(appreciative groaning)

00:20:19.812 --> 00:20:21.362
Aala!

00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:23.625
- (mumbling) Aala!

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:25.060
- Oh wow, by the way,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.310
that's how you say oh wow in Urdu, right?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.000
That is a solidly good burger,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.499
the meat, the freshness of the meat,

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:33.690
and what's amazing,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.030
this does taste like a Pakistani burger

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.950
because you taste that masala seasoning.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.237
The beef is so crumbly.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.601
The cheese, you taste the chili powder.

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:46.030
You can taste the chili powder in there!

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.260
- Chili powder and awesome pepper,

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.557
awesome black pepper.

00:20:49.557 --> 00:20:52.420
- [Mark] Cumin, the cumin!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.473
A mayonnaise foul.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.200
- It's time for some burger swap.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200
- You wanna burger swap?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.033
- Yeah.

00:20:58.033 --> 00:20:59.080
- Okay, Ali's working on the chicken here.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.600
How's that chicken, Ali?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.590
- Chicken's pretty good.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:05.433
- The Islamabad swap, the
must-needed one. (laughs)

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.030
Wow, that chicken is so tender.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.893
And again, the smokiness
of the grill flavor.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.150
We stood around and ate that burger

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.890
and met so many people just
standing around in that area.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.190
One of the guys that we met,

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.660
he's like, oh yeah,
welcome to Burger-abad!

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.020
Islamabad is known for their burgers.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.007
That was a really good burger,

00:21:26.007 --> 00:21:29.200
and we've got one more
place to go in Islamabad.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.577
It's that time of the day.

00:21:30.577 --> 00:21:32.023
Ali is in the position.

00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:34.151
- Caught blue-handed!

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.274
- Caught blue-handed.

00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:36.107
- Caught blue-handed.

00:21:36.107 --> 00:21:38.650
- It's the time of the day
when we're all getting sleepy,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.040
it's been a long day, but we're coming

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.040
to one more restaurant,
we're gonna order their,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.910
we're gonna order some beef,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.550
and I know they're famous
here for the fries,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.010
which Ali said he comes to eat sometimes.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.100
Reach in with the mayo.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.477
- [Ali] If you want to
eat, eat Islamabad way.

00:21:53.477 --> 00:21:55.032
- [Mark] The proper Islamabad way?

00:21:55.032 --> 00:21:56.210
(laughs)

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.877
(chiming music)

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.490
There's that cheese.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.087
- I just wanna eat my own fries,
end of the world right now.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.770
- You guys really don't
know how to eat fries.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.600
Come on, you're in Islamabad, man,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.538
this is not how you eat fries.

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:18.797
- [Mark] So, Islamabad is known

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:20.439
for being very proper, right?

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:24.300
- Pakistan, this is how you eat fries.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.500
- [Mark] Next up for the crazy panini,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.270
and the crazy panini is one
of their specialties here.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.723
Looks like it's filled
with, is that chicken?

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.070
Yeah, that is pretty good.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.680
The melted cheese in there,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.820
the chicken almost has kind of
a chicken curry flavor to it,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.660
but that melty, oozy cheese
is what's holding it together.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.110
That's making it really good.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.310
And that wraps up this trip to Islamabad.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.663
Let's go to Lahore!

00:22:48.663 --> 00:22:51.330
(excited music)

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.935
Made it back to the
beautiful energy of Lahore!

00:22:58.935 --> 00:23:00.310
I love this city!

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.607
We are here to first eat Lahore Broast,

00:23:02.607 --> 00:23:05.690
and broast, I know it's chicken.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.940
Broast, to me, sounds
kind of like a combination

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.720
of broiled and roasted.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.890
I have no idea what it is.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:13.723
Oh yeah, step inside,

00:23:13.723 --> 00:23:16.160
and you could immediately
smell deep-friend-ness.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.240
It appears that a broast
is not broiled or roasted,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.340
but it's fried, and then
he put the lid down,

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.050
and it's like pressure cooked!

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.627
He stuck the lid down,
he cranked it tight.

00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:30.830
That's gonna simmer away in the oil.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.400
So that's like pressure deep fried.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.014
Is it rice?

00:23:34.014 --> 00:23:34.893
- [Cook] Steam, steam.

00:23:34.893 --> 00:23:37.250
- [Mark] Oh, steam, oh nice.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.438
- [Cook] Are you ready?

00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:39.271
- [Mark] Yes!

00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:40.870
So, how long did that
boil for, ten minutes?

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.784
Wow!

00:23:41.784 --> 00:23:44.284
(oil popping)

00:23:50.004 --> 00:23:52.900
They put the broast, they
broasted it, for ten minutes,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.990
and then he just popped that cover.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.430
You could hear the
pressure being released.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.460
Our broast is ready!

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.313
Broast is just a fun word to say!

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.470
They put a handful of fries right on top,

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.800
and then we also got the steamed version,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.530
another awesome thing that they serve

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.983
at this fast food restaurant
is a mutton joint.

00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:16.524
(skin crunching)

00:24:16.524 --> 00:24:18.710
Wow, that is incredibly crunchy, though!

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.140
Oh, oh that's hot!

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.924
- [Ali] Yeah, bite is good.

00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:23.750
- It's so crunchy, too, it's
so crunchy, it's so crispy!

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.517
My first time ever to broast!

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:29.570
(crunching)

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.820
(laughter)

00:24:32.754 --> 00:24:33.809
- I know you just burned your tongue.

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:34.999
- That's hot!

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:37.332
(crunching)

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.123
You have broast strategy?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.993
- Don't expect any reaction,

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.880
I'm having for the millionth time.

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:52.010
(laughter)

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.760
- [Mark] Oh, so you come her often!

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.437
- I've grown up here, eating these.

00:24:57.437 --> 00:24:58.767
- [Mark] I wanna broast with you.

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:01.532
(laughter)

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:05.449
(crunching and happy groaning)

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.810
- [Ali] The legit way to have the roast

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.227
is to have it with the chutney.

00:25:15.507 --> 00:25:16.480
(appreciative groaning)

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.880
- Oh yeah, with the chutney, though.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.960
Oh, that's what makes it unique!

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.290
So, a little bit sweet, but
you taste some spices in there,

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.340
and sour at the same time, it's tart.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.487
Is this the steamed broast, or the--

00:25:25.487 --> 00:25:27.366
- [Ali] It's the Degi Charghans.

00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:28.210
- [Mark] Dig in the degi...

00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:33.338
- [Ali] Degi Chargha, what
else you expect from chicken?

00:25:33.338 --> 00:25:35.062
- [Mark] That's Degi Chargha!

00:25:35.062 --> 00:25:36.660
(laughs)

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.953
That expert dip!

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.790
- I find it even better
than broast, by the way.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.087
No offense to broast.

00:25:46.296 --> 00:25:47.590
(appreciative grunting)

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.140
- Oh yeah, the steamed
is so much more flavor,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.180
it's just caked in spices!

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.140
You taste the cinnamon-y flavors of it.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.590
I prefer the steamed as well.

00:25:59.778 --> 00:26:00.611
(appreciative grunting)

00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:01.750
It's all come down to the joint.

00:26:03.868 --> 00:26:05.285
This looks like a big drumstick.

00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:07.011
- [Joel] It really does,
it looks exactly like a--

00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:08.767
wait, is this mutton, or is this...

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:09.600
- [Ali] It's like a turkey.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.813
- [Joel] It's like a turkey.

00:26:14.748 --> 00:26:16.270
(appreciative groaning)

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.090
- Oh, all the mutton taste.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.233
It's not like a joint,
though, it's the meat, too.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.573
And then you've got the
cartilage-y bits as well.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.790
Mutton joint is great!

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.373
(excited beat)

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.213
- Thank you!

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.962
- Thank you very much.

00:26:35.962 --> 00:26:37.800
Especially my favorite thing
here was the degi chargha!

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.060
That had some great
spice, some great chili,

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.600
that was wonderful!

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.713
Hello, how are you?

00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:46.692
- I've seen you so many times!

00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:49.359
(excited music)

00:26:55.168 --> 00:26:58.795
(sizzling and restaurant chatter)

00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:02.212
(clattering of spatulas)

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.420
We're here to eat something
called the Bun Plaster!

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.860
This is something I've never had before,

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.460
and it looks amazing,

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.170
but his street food cooking
skills are just remarkable!

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.820
He takes, I think that's butter at first,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.030
he scoops some butter onto the hot plate,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.617
and that just sizzles away,
then he throws down the egg,

00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:40.617
then he throws down, like he
does everything so fluidly,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.720
so quickly, he then cracks
an egg onto the hot plate,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.990
he throws down the buns,

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.310
and he just perfectly, yet artistically,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.680
tosses down the bun onto the egg,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.450
coating the egg, then he takes one of the,

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.210
I believe it's like a potato fritter,

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.190
he puts that onto the hot plate.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.760
He gives it a little smack

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.660
with his little hard metal spatula,

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.560
that just flattens it perfectly.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.960
He sticks that into the bun.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.584
Everything's so rhythmic,
everything's so fast,

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.993
with a rhythm, so artistic!

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.020
Yeah, this is beautiful to watch him

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.196
as he makes this Bun Plaster.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.900
That looks like another treat

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.679
that you wanna be eating
at two A.M. in the morning.

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:27.179
(sizzling and clattering)

00:28:35.372 --> 00:28:37.150
He has absolutely mastered the art

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.510
of flipping, sliding, and flattening

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.190
things on the hot griddle.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.759
Have you ever had a Bun Plaster before?

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:45.592
- I haven't had it before,

00:28:45.592 --> 00:28:47.440
but this plaster joint is right near

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.170
the National College of Arts,

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.170
so having this plaster
makes you more creative.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.740
- [Mark] And this entire Bun Plaster

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.380
is extremely creative!

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.840
He could so this with his eyes closed,

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.530
that's without a doubt!

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.610
He could Bun Plaster with his eyes closed!

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.860
- [Ali] How did it get it's name? (laugh)

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.992
- [Mark] We should ask him!

00:29:05.992 --> 00:29:09.409
- [Ali] (asking in Urdu)

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.630
So, there's actually like
a history behind this name.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.230
You see, the way you plaster a wall,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.200
so you take cement, and then
you put it on top of it,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.850
this is the way, for example,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.970
you have your bread and then
you plaster it with egg.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.310
- It really does have
to do with construction!

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.900
That's beautiful, and sitting
on the side of the street,

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.860
this is a beautiful location.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.963
I just love Lahore.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.793
The entire thing could be
a newly constructed wall!

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.910
Oh, that's hot!

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.190
It's all plastered together.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.410
Bun Plaster cheers?

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.243
- Cheers!

00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:50.060
(smooth groove)

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.730
- This is really good,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.252
and I'm amazed that they are serving it

00:29:53.252 --> 00:29:55.546
without chutney, chutney is so good.

00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:57.140
But, I don't know.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.200
- Oh, it's pretty awesome.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.960
I gotta give that a big thumbs up,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.237
it's delicious, actually,

00:30:01.237 --> 00:30:03.637
and it's all plastered
together with the cement!

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:08.610
It's really, awesomely good!

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.850
I thought it was a potato patty,

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.040
but it's actually a
lentil and chicken patty.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.322
That's why it tastes so good.

00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:19.080
(appreciative grunting)

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.950
I'm a big fan of the Bun Plaster.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:21.783
- That was really good, man,

00:30:21.783 --> 00:30:23.650
I mean, burger without a
chutney, yet it taste so good,

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.380
and I'm having on more, and I
think I'm gonna have two more.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.890
Maybe a third one, the
hunger pangs that I'm having.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.850
- [Mark] They love the
Bun Plaster so much,

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.553
they got seconds, second Bun Plasters!

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.060
I've gotta admit, that Bun
Plaster is one of my favorite

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.400
Western Continental Pakistani foods

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.280
that we've had so far on this tour.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.540
That's just absolutely delicious!

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.140
Simple, but just genius combination!

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.973
That was delicious.

00:30:52.973 --> 00:30:56.737
When you come to Lahore,
a Bun Plaster is a must.

00:30:56.737 --> 00:30:59.440
(street chatter)

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.550
Next up in Lahore, we are at a place,

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.280
it's called Yousaf Falooda Shop,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.510
and they're very well-known

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.710
for all sorts of milk-based desserts,

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.140
and even just fresh milk.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.207
You can come here and
drink a glass of milk,

00:31:10.207 --> 00:31:12.890
but we're gonna order a
couple of their desserts,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.480
and there's also another drink,

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.340
which is called Doodh Pepsi,

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.898
which is, doodh means
milk, Pepsi is Pepsi,

00:31:19.898 --> 00:31:23.430
so it's where you mix milk and Pepsi.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.490
I'm not totally sure they're ratio,

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.070
but actually, it's
common to drink at home,

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.800
and people drink it like
to settle their stomach,

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.670
it's just kinda maybe for fun,

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.980
I've never had it before,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.510
so we decided we're gonna
try some of their desserts,

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.530
and then we'll ask them,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.270
they don't actually
serve Doodh Pepsi here,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.720
it's typically drinked at home,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.610
but since they have
such good quality milk,

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.810
we're gonna ask them if they
can also mix that for us,

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:44.940
and we'll taste that along with

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.604
all the rest of the desserts as well.

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.545
Kheer?
- Kheer.

00:31:48.545 --> 00:31:49.378
- Kulfi Falooda.
- [Mark] Kulfi Falooda.

00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:52.520
- Rasmalai.
- [Mark] Rasmalai.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.353
And this one?

00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:55.890
- Pepsi Doodh, Pepsi milk.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.723
- [Mark] Pepsi milk.

00:31:56.723 --> 00:31:58.290
- Amazing collection of sweets.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.452
- This place is a legendary
place in Lahore, right?

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:01.285
It's been here.

00:32:01.285 --> 00:32:02.960
This one is the Kulfi...
- [Ali] Falooda.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.410
- [Mark] Kulfi Falooda, which is,

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.073
Kulfi is the ice cream, which
is plunked right into there.

00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:13.020
(appreciative grunting)

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.410
Oh, that's almost cheesy!

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.870
- Yeah.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.703
- Wow!

00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:19.000
Okay, here it is, my first
time to try a Doodh Pepsi.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.871
I think his ratio was
about three quarters milk,

00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:24.720
to a quarter Pepsi, that
was about right, right?

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.553
- [Ali] Yup.

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:33.960
- That's actually not bad! (laughs)

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.860
Because, like, it really
mellows out the Pepsi!

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.340
It's milky, and you just taste

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.593
a little bit of the carbonation!

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.550
Oh yeah, there's something in my ear.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.124
You can kind of feel like that
would be good at digestion,

00:32:48.124 --> 00:32:52.700
it kind of just goes down,
kinda feels like energizing,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.373
yeah, like, mellow.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.330
- I believe that's more than a drink.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.922
- That is not bad!

00:32:59.922 --> 00:33:02.209
(laughs)

00:33:02.209 --> 00:33:03.042
- You know what I believe,

00:33:03.042 --> 00:33:05.560
more than a drink, this
is a cultural diplomacy.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.920
East and west meeting in one drink.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.348
It's like a cocktail of cultures.

00:33:10.348 --> 00:33:12.550
Now it's come down to my most favorite,

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.693
the ultimate kheer.

00:33:19.826 --> 00:33:23.040
(appreciative groaning)

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.280
- Yeah, you are right.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.280
Oh yeah, it's not too sweet,
it's kind of like pudding.

00:33:29.534 --> 00:33:31.570
Like, it's the texture of pudding,

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.250
but with little more texture to it,

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.120
not quite as smooth, and then again,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.490
you taste the cardamom in there.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.710
Halfway between butter and yogurt.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.890
There is one more thing
that we're gonna do

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.819
to complete this entire
food tour and experience.

00:33:47.819 --> 00:33:50.600
Pepsi is throwing a huge event.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.760
We are headed there now,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.500
and that's going to complete this entire

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.997
Western Pakistani Continental food tour

00:33:56.997 --> 00:34:00.793
across three of the most
major cities in Pakistan!

00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:06.018
(chattering in Urdu)

00:34:08.794 --> 00:34:09.780
- So we have Mark Weins with us,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.777
what do you feel about Pakistan?

00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:13.573
- I think it's amazing that...

00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:16.447
(music swells)

00:34:16.447 --> 00:34:19.114
(party chatter)

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.200
- [Speaker] All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.130
he travels around the
world for the love of food,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.450
and yes ladies and gentlemen,

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.580
I'm talking about the
renowned food blogger,

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.890
Mark Weins in the house!

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.540
A big round of applause,
he's here, he came this far!

00:34:36.005 --> 00:34:37.437
- This is cotton candy and (mumbling).

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:40.310
- Cheers?

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.143
- Cheers!

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.922
- [Speaker] All right!

00:34:44.922 --> 00:34:47.339
(bass beats)

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.640
- Hey, everyone, it's Mark Wiens,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.539
and I just wrapped up a 16
day food and travel trip,

00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:54.870
more than a trip, it was an experience

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.380
and a journey through Pakistan!

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.220
- For the second time in Pakistan,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.550
please just tell us about your journey

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.990
and your association with Pepsi now.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.049
- Yeah, second trip to Pakistan

00:35:05.049 --> 00:35:08.540
and again, it's been an
amazing trip, more than a trip,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.640
we've met so many people along the way.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.473
- Right.

00:35:11.473 --> 00:35:14.370
- And this time, it
was such a warm welcome

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.030
that it was almost like coming home!

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.273

00:35:19.848 --> 00:35:22.667
(music thrums)

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:24.880
- You don't have to have only seafood,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.259
you could even have this kind of stuff,

00:35:27.259 --> 00:35:29.197
kind of mix it up a little bit.

00:35:29.197 --> 00:35:30.890

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.960
