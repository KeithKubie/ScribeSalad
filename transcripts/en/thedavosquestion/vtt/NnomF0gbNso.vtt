&gt;&gt;I'm here on YouTube to talk about the economy
and the environment. Because clearly they

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.890
don't have enough people on the Internet talking
about this issue. How we're here in Davos

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.510
at the economic forum and here's what's going
on-where will the money go? Will it go to

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.390
energy? Will it go to the environment or will
it go to pump up this economy? Now there's

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.279
a lot of smart people that say they can do
both. So we'll see that in wind-energy. We'll

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.069
see that in a smart group that they talking
about now a stimulus package in Washington.

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.090
We'll see it all around the world, but the
question is can you save these industries,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.550
can you save the car companies, can you save
consumers who are leaving their houses in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.010
droves? Can you save all of it at the same
time? I wish I had the answer but I know it's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.410
somewhere on YouTube.You guys go and look
for it. Thank you.
