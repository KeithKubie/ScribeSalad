00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.470
Greetings Professor Falken, Shall we play
a game?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.240
Machine learning, neural networks and deep
learning are all buzzwords in AI circles.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.349
But essentially they’re all referring to
the attempt to teach a computer to recognize

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.460
a dog in any photo, or translate a language
in real time, or… lots of other tasks

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.519
To do that, engineers present a computer with
a lot of data, and teach it by repetition;

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.239
similar to teaching an animal a trick... encourage
it when it does well, and discourage it when

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.239
it’s wrong.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.100
Eventually, the AI will get better at facial
recognition or predictive text, or… whatever!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.100
But the thing is, even if it can spot the
dog, the computer has to do the calculation

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
every time.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.230
It has to scan every pixel and check everything.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.162
It can’t anticipate what you ask, it can’t
realize that usually the dog is here or there

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:53.429
in the photo…

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.050
They don’t work that way.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.300
Until now.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.460
Engineers at ‘DeepMind’ -- Google’s
AI system -- wanted to give their computer

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.460
a memory.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.490
As in, the ability to remember the tasks it
had done before… and learn from its success

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.500
and failures on those tasks.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.470
They did this in… sort of a funny way.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.799
They taught the system to play Atari, and
published a paper on their findings.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.350
I love science.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.830
It makes sense!

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.910
Video games are about learning new skills
through repetition and failure.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.689
You have to build on what you learned!

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.869
As the game progresses, requirements usually
grow in complexity, and have to be combined

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:27.950
with other skills…

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.320
All that requires memory, and the understanding
of the tasks you’ve completed before.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.600
But AI still needs lots of repetition and
data to learn.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.670
So, they made the computer play each game
20 million times.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.210
Then, because they added the ability of the
machine to remember what it did before...

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.189
Deepmind could apply what it learned playing
Pong to playing Fishing Derby, or Kung-Fu

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.409
Master.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.670
AI is already good at playing other games,
like Go and Chess -- but it looks at the board,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.740
and then calculates the best options for each
move.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.180
Each time.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.300
Imagine if a computer could keep things in
mind when learning to solve a new problem,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.350
like realizing opponents trained by certain
teachers would always try some special move.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.840
Or more practically, realizing you always
take the same route home, every day.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.520
It gets a little freaky…

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.970
Do we want machines to be able to learn?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.130
To anticipate actions?

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.990
To be able to get set in their ways over time?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.830
Bae Stephen Hawking said artificial intelligence
will be ”either the best, or the worst thing,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.000
ever to happen to humanity.”

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.140
But as of now…

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.090
AI ain’t ready.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.520
It had to play those video games 20 million
times.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.580
Even the most hardcore Atari gamers never
approached that and they’ve mastered all

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.760
those games.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.590
Over time, AI learns and then it just… does
it, but unlike life it doesn’t have the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.770
ultimate motivator…

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.930
It wasn’t programmed to die if it fails
at gathering resources.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.260
It wasn’t programmed to reproduce…

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.250
It’s just a machine doing a simple, single
job.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.630
Even though now, AI might acquire memories,
we probably shouldn’t read too much into

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.630
it.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.510
Jerry Kaplan, a futurist and computer scientist
wrote in the MIT Technology Review…

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.380
“The robots may be coming, but they are
not coming for us—because there is no “they.”

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.940
Machines are not people, and there’s no
persuasive evidence that they are on a path

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940
toward sentience.”

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.650
Are you still freaked out by AI?

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.770
Cause you shouldn’t be.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.580
Watch this video right here to learn why and
also let us know in the comments what you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.590
think about all this stuff and come back for
more episodes.
