00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.360
- So John, when our nation was founded

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.230
there was media.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.190
It was essentially newspapers.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.780
How has the evolution of media affected

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.020
the evolution of political discourse?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.530
- At the beginning of our country

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.710
the editors of the rival newspapers,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.580
there was no middle of the road newspaper,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.620
you were either for one or the other,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.880
you were either a Federalist

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.880
or you were the Jeffersonian
Democratic Republicans,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.711
as they called themselves,

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.310
and the editors were at each
others throat so violently,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.580
they would sometimes get
in fights in the street

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.223
and knock each other down.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.720
And you had lawmakers who were supposed

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.470
to be men of virtue as
all men in those days

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.903
would be leaking documents.

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:44.210
Alexander Hamilton,
the Treasury Secretary,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.470
and Thomas Jefferson,
the Secretary of State,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.770
would leak documents to
their favorite papers

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.500
in order to attack the other.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.540
And eventually George
Washington had to come in

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.900
and say knock it off fellas,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.300
because this isn't good for the country.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420
So the bitterness carried out in the press

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.310
was with us from the founding.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.680
What changed over time is
that it became interestedly,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.480
newspaper particularly, to
appeal to a larger audience.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.520
That means you didn't want
just the left or the right.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.900
You wanted both.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.340
So that created a tradition,
along with a few other things,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.720
where there was an attempt
to give just the facts,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.900
a kind of middle of the road perspective.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.350
We are changing from that now,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.180
where the economics of covering the news

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.870
and the digital change
where you now can have

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.180
anybody speaking and
gaining access to the public

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.980
has created a situation where you have

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.500
a more partisan press now,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.100
and we're in the middle
of trying to figure out

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.280
where that's going next.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.770
- This is interesting
because a lot of people

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.050
when they talk about well,
not it's getting polarized

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.210
and partisan, the good ol'
days when you got the truth,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.950
the wisdom from Walter
Cronkite or whoever,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.390
but what you're really
talking about is maybe

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.500
what's going on now is a
little bit of a reversion

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.270
back to where we started.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.103
- That's right.

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:55.450
In terms of the partisanship of the press

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.290
it is a reversion towards
the early days of America,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.570
and in terms of the partisanship
of the individual members

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.580
of Congress or of the White House.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.120
What is a little bit different
is that the call to virtue,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.363
which would snap people
out of their partisanship,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.076
is still up for grabs.

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:19.110
The founders, when they
fought like cats and dogs

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530
during the early years
of the administrations,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.230
Thomas Jefferson was best
friends with John Adams,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.600
and essentially then
hired a newspaper writer

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.540
to undermine Adams when he was president.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.980
I mean, this was a very dirty pool.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.110
The argument they were making
was our country is new,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.680
and what is at stake is the very survival

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.150
of the American experiment.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.310
So they were fighting for real stakes.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.870
They weren't just trying
to primarily keep power.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.430
They were really trying
to make this flower bloom

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.020
that they had just planted.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.050
So now the question is
what role does virtue play

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.150
in the American experience
to pull people away

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.510
from their partisanship?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.610
To make them work together
for common interests?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.970
And what is that shared
area of common interest?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.660
What pulls them away from,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.040
what the founders knew,
people would behave like dogs

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.530
sometimes, but they thought
they could pull away

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.160
if they thought about the common interest.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.910
Well, is that pull still there?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.620
- So there's a lot of talk
these days about polarization

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.240
of the media or polarization
of politics in general.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.580
How much of it do you
think is due to things

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.910
like social media, or do
you think it was inevitable?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.730
- We've always had polarization
in American politics,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.290
but there was a dose of something else,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.950
which was a call to a
higher American ideal.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.950
And also voters would vote on
people based on their virtue,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.120
on their larger than life statesmanship,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.260
which was not partisan.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.780
So you had to keep a balance.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.290
If you were being highly partisan,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.910
you kinda did it in quiet.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.560
What's changed now with
social media and also

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.800
with the flood of money
in politics is that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.060
it has encouraged people to
be more and more partisan.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.820
The louder and hotter I
talk on a specific issue

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.420
the more money I'm gonna be able to raise,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.060
the more interest groups
are gonna like me,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.530
and the more clicks I'm gonna get

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.330
because I'm the one making
the most flamboyant noise.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.090
The problem is that means the arguments

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.330
are always containing flamboyant noise.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.600
And the people who want a calm
steady measured conversation,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.090
well, they're not getting
read on social media.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.900
They're not in charge
of the interest groups

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.140
that pay millions and millions of dollars.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.970
So the system encourages
people to stay apart,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.320
and that's one of the biggest challenges

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.960
Secretary of Defense, James Mattis,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.830
says it may be the greatest
threat to American democracy,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.730
that polarization.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.500
- Do you see a way of
this getting resolved?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.510
Or does it get worse?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.343
Does it get better?

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:37.730
- There have been periods
of American history

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.930
where we have been this split.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.750
Obviously the Civil War was
a period of great rending

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.410
in the American fabric.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.639
What changed it was an actual conflict.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.660
So that, God forbid,
would be one way to do it.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.610
Another would be if there
was a threat to America

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.650
from outside its borders
and people would feel

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.730
an acute sense of national
pride and patriotism.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.430
But other than that there doesn't appear

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.910
to be at the moment a quick fix for what

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.220
is a complicated problem
for why the two parties

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.240
have gotten into a inescapable fight

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.170
that they can't seem to
get themselves out of.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.610
- It's like we need a
shock to remind ourselves

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.300
how much commonality there is

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.900
so all of the polarizing
quibbling goes away,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.530
or at least gets covered up a little bit.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.880
- Big changes in American history

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.260
usually happen from a shock and it's what

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.010
breaks people out of their behavior,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.730
and also which tells a lot of the people

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.560
in the rest of the country
who don't participate

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.440
in presidential elections
and don't participate

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.810
in congressional elections,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.470
it reminds them that
something real is at stake.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.700
And there is a vast group of Americans

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.900
who really want solutions in the middle,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.900
who don't care about the
bickering and the ideology.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.140
But a lot of them don't
participate in politics.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.420
And so the kind of shock
that would make people

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.760
behave who are partisans
is also the kind of shock

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.770
that would draw in people
who are just apathetic

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.070
and not participating
in the political system.
