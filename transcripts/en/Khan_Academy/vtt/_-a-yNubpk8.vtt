00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:03.170
- [Voiceover] Now that we are
familiar with Euler's method,

00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:06.766
let's do an exercise that
tests our mathematical

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.817
understanding of it, or at
least the process of using it.

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:13.889
So, it says consider the
differential equation:

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.352
the derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.767
is equal to three x minus two y.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.963
Let y is equal to g of x be a solution

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:23.912
to the differential equation
with the initial condition

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:27.294
g of zero is equal to
k where k is constant.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.349
Euler's method starting at x equals zero

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.775
with the a step size of
one gives the approximation

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:35.293
that g of two is approximately 4.5.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:38.729
Find the value of k.

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.366
So once again, this is saying
hey, look, we're gonna start

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.454
with this initial condition
when x is equal to zero,

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:46.913
y is equal to k, we're
going to use Euler's method

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.469
with a step size of one.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.373
So, we're essentially going
to use, we're going to step

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:53.345
once from zero to one, and
then again from one to two.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.744
And then that approximation
is going to give us 4.5.

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:00.031
And so, given that we started
at k, we should be able

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:02.226
to figure out what k was to get us

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.929
to g of two being approximated as 4.5.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.367
So with that, I encourage
you to pause the video,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.884
and try to figure this out on your own.

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:15.889
I am assuming you have tried
to figure this out on your own.

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:17.747
Now we can do it together.

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:19.233
And I'll do the same thing that we did

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.206
in the first video on Euler's method.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.834
I'll make a little table here
so let me make a little table.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:28.106
I can draw a straighter line than that.

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:29.569
That's only marginally straighter,

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.287
but it will get the job done.

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:35.710
So let's make this column
x, I'm going to give myself

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.207
some space for y, I might do some

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:42.846
calculation here, y, and then dy/dx.

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.924
Now, we can start at
our initial condition.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:49.362
When x is equal to zero, y is equal to k.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.430
When x is equal to zero, y is equal to k.

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:56.980
And so, what's our derivative
going to be at that point?

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:58.697
Well, dy/dx is equal
to three x minus two y.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.579
So in this case, it's three
times zero minus two times k,

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:08.521
which is just equal to negative two k.

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.676
And so now we can increment one more step.

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:16.676
We have a step size of
one, so at each step

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:23.942
we're going to increment x by one,

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.159
and so we're now going to be at one.

00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:30.139
Now what's our new y going to be?

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.844
Well, if we increment
x by one, and our slope

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:36.768
is negative two k, that means
we're going to increment y

00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:40.082
by negative two k times
one, or just negative two k.

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:42.290
So, negative two k.

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:46.529
So k plus negative two k is negative k.

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.652
So, our approximation using
Euler's method gets us

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:53.691
the point one negative
k, and then what is going

00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:56.915
to be our slope starting at that point?

00:02:56.915 --> 00:03:01.153
So one negative k, our slope
is going to be three times

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:06.153
our x, which is one, minus
two times our y, which is

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:11.516
negative k now, and this is
equal to three plus two k.

00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:16.914
And now we'll do another step of one,

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:18.966
because that's our step size.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.149
Another, whoops, I'm going to get to two.

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.166
Now this is the one that
we care about right?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.945
Because we're trying to
approximate g of two.

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.528
So we have to say, what
does our approximation

00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:30.769
give us for y when x is equal to two?

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.650
And we're going to have
something expressed in k,

00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:33.760
but they're saying that's going to be 4.5,

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.407
and then we can use that to solve for k.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.366
So what's this going to be?

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:41.187
So if we increment by one in x,

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:46.187
we should increment our y by
one times three plus two k.

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:52.470
So we're going to increment
by three plus two k,

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.755
or negative k plus three plus two k

00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:58.806
is just going to be three plus k.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:03:59.975
And they're telling us that our

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:03.040
approximation gets that to be 4.5.

00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:07.299
So three plus k is equal to 4.5.

00:04:07.335 --> 00:04:09.657
So the k that we started
with must have been,

00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:12.130
if we just subtract three from both sides,

00:04:12.013 --> 00:04:14.741
this is a decimal here, it must have been

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:19.858
k must be equal to 1.5,
and you can verify that.

00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:21.892
If this initial condition right over here,

00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:26.893
if g of zero is equal to 1.5,
then you put 1.5 over here.

00:04:28.963 --> 00:04:33.809
Then over here you would
get 4.5, and we're done.
