00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.530
every now and then I get and I think you

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540
every now and then I get and I think you
 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.710
every now and then I get and I think you
know what difference will it make in a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720
know what difference will it make in a
 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.960
know what difference will it make in a
billion years right because in the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970
billion years right because in the
 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.850
billion years right because in the
universe of billion years is just an eye

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860
universe of billion years is just an eye
 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.029
universe of billion years is just an eye
flick right I mean this the we've had

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039
flick right I mean this the we've had
 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.400
flick right I mean this the we've had
for almost 14 billion years so far and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410
for almost 14 billion years so far and
 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.800
for almost 14 billion years so far and
we're only a fraction of the way through

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810
we're only a fraction of the way through
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.050
we're only a fraction of the way through
what we think is the normal life history

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
what we think is the normal life history
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.609
what we think is the normal life history
of the universe and we know it's going

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619
of the universe and we know it's going
 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.679
of the universe and we know it's going
to keep expanding at least for 150

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689
to keep expanding at least for 150
 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.429
to keep expanding at least for 150
billion years and so you know the the

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439
billion years and so you know the the
 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.460
billion years and so you know the the
Sun becomes a star and it dies away

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
Sun becomes a star and it dies away
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.650
Sun becomes a star and it dies away
right and that takes ten billion years

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660
right and that takes ten billion years
 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.389
right and that takes ten billion years
right that's only that's like that's

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399
right that's only that's like that's
 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.209
right that's only that's like that's
seven percent of the like you know it

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219
seven percent of the like you know it
 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.400
seven percent of the like you know it
changes your perspective right just to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410
changes your perspective right just to
 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.520
changes your perspective right just to
think that the light the time it takes

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530
think that the light the time it takes
 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.950
think that the light the time it takes
light that gets from Andromeda to here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960
light that gets from Andromeda to here
 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.950
light that gets from Andromeda to here
was the time from which about that

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960
was the time from which about that
 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.569
was the time from which about that
started out the time when humans started

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579
started out the time when humans started
 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.369
started out the time when humans started
to evolve right and so when you start

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379
to evolve right and so when you start
 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.479
to evolve right and so when you start
thinking about the light that came from

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489
thinking about the light that came from
 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.639
thinking about the light that came from
far away it tells it gives you a

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649
far away it tells it gives you a
 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.200
far away it tells it gives you a
different perspective on the history of

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210
different perspective on the history of
 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.630
different perspective on the history of
it and so how does it changed my

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640
it and so how does it changed my
 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.279
it and so how does it changed my
everyday life it changed my perspective

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289
everyday life it changed my perspective
 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.410
everyday life it changed my perspective
on the other hand I still like to get a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
on the other hand I still like to get a
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.980
on the other hand I still like to get a
good hot chocolate I think I have

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990
good hot chocolate I think I have
 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.899
good hot chocolate I think I have
similar reactions to George's when I

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909
similar reactions to George's when I
 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.789
similar reactions to George's when I
look at things physical things in the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799
look at things physical things in the
 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.609
look at things physical things in the
world I know their history I know where

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619
world I know their history I know where
 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.589
world I know their history I know where
the hydrogen and helium came from and

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:19.599
the hydrogen and helium came from and
 

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.959
the hydrogen and helium came from and
was not much of that around here but the

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969
was not much of that around here but the
 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.669
was not much of that around here but the
carbon and oxygen and nitrogen that I

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679
carbon and oxygen and nitrogen that I
 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.349
carbon and oxygen and nitrogen that I
that we made out of you know came from

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359
that we made out of you know came from
 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.080
that we made out of you know came from
stars that exploded and so when I see

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
stars that exploded and so when I see
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.510
stars that exploded and so when I see
nice woodwork or something I think to

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520
nice woodwork or something I think to
 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.219
nice woodwork or something I think to
myself and those carbon atoms were

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229
myself and those carbon atoms were
 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.679
myself and those carbon atoms were
someplace else in a giant cosmic

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689
someplace else in a giant cosmic
 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.230
someplace else in a giant cosmic
explosion of a star not so long ago and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
explosion of a star not so long ago and
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.469
explosion of a star not so long ago and
that also reminds me that our own star

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479
that also reminds me that our own star
 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.879
that also reminds me that our own star
is going to burn out itself in another

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889
is going to burn out itself in another
 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.129
is going to burn out itself in another
two billion or so and we might want to

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139
two billion or so and we might want to
 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.330
two billion or so and we might want to
find another place to live so those are

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340
find another place to live so those are
 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.279
find another place to live so those are
sort of matters of scientific and

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289
sort of matters of scientific and
 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.399
sort of matters of scientific and
personal perspective but principally it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409
personal perspective but principally it
 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.949
personal perspective but principally it
says life is long the universe is long

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959
says life is long the universe is long
 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.959
says life is long the universe is long
and we need to take long-term

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969
and we need to take long-term
 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.659
and we need to take long-term
perspectives to manage our lives here on

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:00.669
perspectives to manage our lives here on
 

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.479
perspectives to manage our lives here on
earth we're like the gardener's here on

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489
earth we're like the gardener's here on
 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.519
earth we're like the gardener's here on
the planet and we have to plan for a

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529
the planet and we have to plan for a
 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:09.539
the planet and we have to plan for a
long future yeah and it's a question you

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549
long future yeah and it's a question you
 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.000
long future yeah and it's a question you
you say if you understand how things

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
you say if you understand how things
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.080
you say if you understand how things
work does that make

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
work does that make
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.910
work does that make
like a rainbow or you know you have a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
like a rainbow or you know you have a
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.650
like a rainbow or you know you have a
little bit of oil in the ground and it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660
little bit of oil in the ground and it
 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.330
little bit of oil in the ground and it
rains and you get this nice color Sheen

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340
rains and you get this nice color Sheen
 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.369
rains and you get this nice color Sheen
does understanding that work take away

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379
does understanding that work take away
 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.160
does understanding that work take away
from the beauty or enhance it and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
from the beauty or enhance it and
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.360
from the beauty or enhance it and
generally I think it enhances it and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
generally I think it enhances it and
 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.690
generally I think it enhances it and
knowing that a tree which looks like

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
knowing that a tree which looks like
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.699
knowing that a tree which looks like
this wonderful mysterious thing hasn't

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709
this wonderful mysterious thing hasn't
 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.350
this wonderful mysterious thing hasn't
been there forever that it came you know

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
been there forever that it came you know
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.240
been there forever that it came you know
the planet has been fair that doesn't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
the planet has been fair that doesn't
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.320
the planet has been fair that doesn't
take away from the fact that when you

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
take away from the fact that when you
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.550
take away from the fact that when you
walk through the forest it's an

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
walk through the forest it's an
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.839
walk through the forest it's an
incredible experience that hiking is

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849
incredible experience that hiking is
 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.160
incredible experience that hiking is
just you feel it at home right yeah and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
just you feel it at home right yeah and
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.619
just you feel it at home right yeah and
I also feel that what are we looking at

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629
I also feel that what are we looking at
 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.650
I also feel that what are we looking at
is completely mysterious even though we

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
is completely mysterious even though we
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.900
is completely mysterious even though we
have the stories of science about how

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910
have the stories of science about how
 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.180
have the stories of science about how
this all happens the individual

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190
this all happens the individual
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.680
this all happens the individual
expression of everything is not

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
expression of everything is not
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.600
expression of everything is not
explainable you know the fact that we

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
explainable you know the fact that we
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.819
explainable you know the fact that we
look the way that we do well it's more

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829
look the way that we do well it's more
 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.670
look the way that we do well it's more
or less accidental the fact that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680
or less accidental the fact that
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.809
or less accidental the fact that
particular chance encounters have led to

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819
particular chance encounters have led to
 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.610
particular chance encounters have led to
our particular lives and the discoveries

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
our particular lives and the discoveries
 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.460
our particular lives and the discoveries
that we've made none of that's really

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
that we've made none of that's really
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199
that we've made none of that's really
explainable so his life is just as

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209
explainable so his life is just as
 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.670
explainable so his life is just as
mysterious now as it ever would have

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680
mysterious now as it ever would have
 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680
mysterious now as it ever would have
been

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690
 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.750
you
