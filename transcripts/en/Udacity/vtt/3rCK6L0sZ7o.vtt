00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's not enough to know that a string contains a token,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
just like it's not enough to know that a sentence contains a verb.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We need to know which one it is, and formally

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we refer to that as the value of the token.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
By default, the value of a token is the value of the string it matched.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can rebuild it, however. We have the technology.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's see how that plays out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here I've written a definition for a slightly more complicated token,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a number, one or more copies of the digit 0-9,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and now I would like you, our last, best hope for victory,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to help me understand it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If the input text is 1368,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what will the value of the token be?

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
