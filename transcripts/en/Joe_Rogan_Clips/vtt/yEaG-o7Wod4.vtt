00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.000
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.
You know,
venom page is

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.630
ridiculous and he's,
he's so long too.
And his,

3
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:16.100
his timing and movement is so unpredictable and he could sprint at you and you

4
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:18.560
don't even like all of a sudden bangs machine in the face.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.210
You saw that the knockout when he knocked out cyborg and caved his head in with

6
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.030
that knee dude cave the man's head.

7
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:28.970
And I've seen thousands of fights.

8
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.610
I've never saw a man get his head caved in ever.

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.730
A hard to look at his phone,
look at the,
hey,

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.590
look at us sculpt his,
his head is pushed in.

11
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.120
I mean that was six at the video above it.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.050
Does that show the actual knockout or no,
that's not it.
That is it.
Yeah.
I mean,

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.760
but look how he fights to hands down.
I mean,
that is crazy.

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.240
That guy is the CEO,
Rodney agony like that.

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.620
I remember his fight with,
uh,
was one of the best MMA fights ever.

16
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.620
The real muscular guy.
He's real muscular.
Cyborg.
Cyborg had a fight with this,

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.660
this another,
oh he's,
he's kind of on the down hill now,

18
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.210
but at one time he was like the Mike Tyson of intimate,

19
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.680
we built,
I know,
you know who I'm talking to.

20
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.670
Her 2000 Manhoef.
Yes.
Yeah.
I knew you knew.
Did you see Cyborg?

21
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.030
See that fight,
those payoffs.
Yeah.
Malvin some mother Fucker,
man.

22
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.380
Ooh.
And he's another one man came from that.
Uh,

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.590
he's,
he comes from,
um,
Mike's gym in Holland,

24
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.630
which is a famous kickboxing gym for savages.
Just do.
Yeah.

25
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.370
Just wore the young,
a young man.

26
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.610
What's up fucking yeah.
Yes.
Oh,
there it is.

27
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.030
And Melvin is built like a fucking,
he was another one.

28
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.070
Unbelievable power and speed when he was in his prime.
Yep.

29
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.290
But he's not the same anymore.
You run through so many wars.
Right.
But man,

30
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.920
that dude super bad.
And it was one of those gladiator jumps to,

31
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.840
here's a piece of my,
one of my essays.
But that showed you how tough Cyborg was.

32
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.150
Cause there was a war that was in cage warriors.
I think that was an end.

33
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.410
There was a war.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm in.

34
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:23.040
I've had the privilege watching so many great fighters fight.

35
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.860
It's interesting to watch all the different styles and all of that,

36
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.860
but the thing that they all have,
all the great ones have,

37
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.330
they have this unstoppable belief in themselves.
Even if they lose,
they just,

38
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.570
they learn,
they lose,
they learn,
they come back,
they get better.

39
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.400
One of my favorite interviews was Royce Gracie and man,
uh,

40
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.500
his mentality,
he says,
you know,

41
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:49.310
I make no plans for after the Franks.
Like,

42
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.440
fuck yeah,
I love these guys guys.
Fucking,
they're ready.
They'll die.

43
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.730
He's not seeing that hasty.

44
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.640
I see guys now talking about the after party and me over here say,

45
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.730
no,
no,
no.
I am prepared

46
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.290
<v 1>to die.
And why?</v>

47
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.760
<v 0>Hey,
oh yeah.
Made Shit Up.</v>

48
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.770
So because I was prepared to die on the weightlifting platform,

49
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.000
the doc says,
Hey,
if you go see tea,
you're able to drive,

50
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:24.360
could burst right there on stage who die in front of all those people.

51
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.360
<v 1>Good,
good.</v>

52
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.030
<v 0>That's the way I got it.
If you want to,
if you want real greatness,</v>

53
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.620
you have to be able to give it all away.

54
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.180
But to find somebody else did that crazy dude.
I was like,
I was the only one.

55
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.870
Did you see the middleweight championship fight between Calvin gas slum and

56
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.680
Israel at a Sanya a style bender?
Did you see that fight?
Yeah,
of course.

57
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
Right before the fifth round.
I mean,
it's a close fight and style.

58
00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:52.620
Bender came out and just destroyed in the fifth round,

59
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:55.670
but right before that he said,
I'm ready to die.
Yes.

60
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.150
Set it to see it.
He's looking at him.
He goes,
I'm ready to die.

61
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.010
I heard that.
May you know that?
Oh Man.
Oh yeah.

62
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.800
Oh yeah.
