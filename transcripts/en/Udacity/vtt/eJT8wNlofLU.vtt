00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:03.637
Assume this application is strongly memory bandwidth bound,

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:08.712
whereas memory bandwidth is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:16.353
If we run the same application on a different GPU with half as many SMs,

00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:20.630
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
