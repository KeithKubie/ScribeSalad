00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.390
For example, attacker can insert
data into the packet stream,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.410
to cause the IDS to miss
detecting the attack.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.530
For example, by including
a packet with bad checksum value,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.760
the end host may reject this packet,
and yet, the IDS may accept it.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.110
As a result,
the end host gets the attack, and

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.020
yet, the IDS misses detecting it.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.440
Here's an illustration
of the Insertion Attack.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800
For example,
the attacker sends these packets.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.020
Although out of order,
both of the IDS and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.860
the end host will assemble them
according to the sequence numbers.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.360
One of the packets, X,
has a bad checksum value.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.960
The IDS will accept it.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.790
Therefore, the IDS sees ATXTACK.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.040
On the other hand, the end host rejects
this packet with a bad checksum value.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.420
In other words, the end host gets
attacked by the traffic, yet,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.340
the IDS misses the attack.
