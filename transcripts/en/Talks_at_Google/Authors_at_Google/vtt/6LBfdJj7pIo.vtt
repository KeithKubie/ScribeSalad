[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.900
HEATHER YOUNG: Please give
a very, very warm Google

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.206
welcome to Madeleine.

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:11.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:12.622
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:18.478
Thank you.

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:22.700
So Heather, I want to
thank you for telling

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.240
everybody who I am because
not everybody always knows.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.640
Not long ago, I was
coming back from China

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.817
and Chicago was the
first port of entry.

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:32.900
And I was there getting
undressed for the security

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.400
people.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.849
And I put my stuff down
on the conveyor belt.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.390
And the lady behind
me said, so where

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.550
did you get all those
screwtop bottles?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.547
My bottles all leak.

00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:43.130
And I said, well,
The Container Store.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.440
And then I was going
through the magnetometer.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.970
And the TSA guard looks at me.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.415
And he says, "oh
my god, it's you."

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.195
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:52.280
"I'm from Bosnia.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.650
And we all love you in Bosnia.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.900
And if it weren't for you,
there wouldn't be a Bosnia.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.584
And you're welcome in Bosnia.

00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.750
And they said, can I have
my picture taken with you?

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.610
And I said, sure.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.200
So the line gets all screwed up.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.330
And I go back to get my stuff.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.950
And the lady of
the screwtop bottle

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.260
says, so what exactly
happened here?

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.750
And I said, well, I used to
be the Secretary of State.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.512
And she said, "of Bosnia?"

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:14.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.340
HEATHER YOUNG: Well, I've
also heard you talk about

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.680
that sometimes you're not
necessarily recognized

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.540
by millennials and that you have
a different name for your age

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.040
group.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.390
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I do.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
It's called a perennial.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.080
But one of the things
is this is a book tour.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.110
And we call it the
Antiques Roadshow.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.160
HEATHER YOUNG: Well
then, I fit right in.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.940
So the book--

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.630
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: By the
way, I have to correct you.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.260
HEATHER YOUNG: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.060
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: They've just
put me number one on "The New

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.600
York Times" Best Sellers, so--

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.058
HEATHER YOUNG: I
was about to say--

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:52.903
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.120
It debuted at number one.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Yes.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.170
HEATHER YOUNG: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.130
And so you say some may
view this book and its title

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.420
as alarmist--

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.447
good.

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:04.280
Why do you say that?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.113
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, because the reason

00:02:06.113 --> 00:02:08.210
I wrote it is because
I am concerned

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.639
about what I see in
the United States

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.750
but also internationally.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.140
And some of it is
my own background.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.490
Because I was born in
1937 before World War II.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.550
And I was born in
Czechoslovakia.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.090
And as a result of an agreement
between the British and French

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.730
with the Germans and
Italians over the heads

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.830
of the Czechoslovaks,
the Munich Agreement

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.410
was signed, which
was a watershed event

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.810
in the history of the
country where I was born.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.540
And basically, the country
was sold down the river.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.930
And the thing that had happened
was that a German minority had

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.710
been propagandized by
a man, Konrad Henlein,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.720
who was a disciple of Hitler's.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.190
And then the Nazis
marched in March, 1939.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.950
And my father had been
a Czechoslovak diplomat.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.310
And we fled to England.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.844
And then later,
when he went back

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.260
and we came to the
United States--

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.880
because the communists had
taken over Czechoslovakia.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.850
And I know of my own
personal family history what

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.580
the results of fascism are.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.940
And later, I found out that
26 members of my family

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.650
had died in the Holocaust.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.190
And so I thought that
it was worth examining

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.110
what fascism was.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.900
And the book is really
quite historical in terms

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.880
of looking at a lot of
the history of Mussolini

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.550
and Hitler, and then
currently the things

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.800
that I see that are going
on in Europe and here.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.980
HEATHER YOUNG: So I saw a study
that was cited in "The New York

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.040
Times" recently that highlighted
some really surprising gaps

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.940
in people's memory about
not only these times,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.260
but also about the Holocaust.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.180
And it mentioned that
something like 52% of Americans

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.510
wrongly think that Hitler
came to power through force,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.960
that nearly 66% of
millennials couldn't

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.150
say what Auschwitz was.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.000
Do you think that this will
make a difference in the memory

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.080
of the American people?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.496
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, hope so.

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:08.480
Because I think that--

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.980
you did mention I
was a professor.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.640
And I do believe that we
need to understand history.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.740
And so putting it
into that context--

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.500
by the way, the thing,
as I was doing research

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.710
for the book, that blew my mind
is that the countries that I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.330
was dealing with, beginning
with Italy and then Hitler,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.980
and then also what is going
on now in Poland and Hungary,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.830
and in Turkey, the
Philippines, Venezuela, Russia,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.300
is that, in fact, people--

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.860
except for Russia-- have always
been either elected or got

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.750
their power constitutionally.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.860
King Emanuel of Italy
gave it to Mussolini.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.644
And then also Von Henneberg
had asked Hitler to take over.

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.310
And otherwise, in
those other countries,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.910
the people were elected.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.930
Which is why I think that
one has to really think

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.280
about how this happens.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.220
Mussolini had a great
quote which I love to use,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.150
which is that "if you pluck a
chicken one feather at a time,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.980
people don't notice
the squawks."

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.860
And it's that kind
of a thing that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.380
is a warning very deliberately.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.100
Because I think that there are
various elements of fascism

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.750
that are evident.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.270
HEATHER YOUNG: So with the
slow plucking of the chicken,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.040
is that what people
talk about when

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.340
they say you shouldn't be
normalizing some things that

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.882
are going on?

00:05:31.882 --> 00:05:33.048
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Exactly.

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:35.450
And I do think it's that idea
that we'll all get over it,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.290
and normalizing.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.350
And so some of the
characteristics of fascism

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.750
are that--

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.260
and it's not easy to define.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.980
I say in the book that people
use the term fascist quite

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.950
loosely, kind of
accusing anybody

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.780
you disagree with as a fascist.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.810
Declan is a very nice
boy, but at some point

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.730
he might call you a fascist
if you don't lend him the car,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.230
you know.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.840
So I think that it's a term
that's kind of thrown around.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.140
And yet there are aspects
of it that we need to note.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.510
And one, for instance, is that
the leader identifies himself

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.930
with a large group
that he says he

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.970
represents to the exclusion of
the rights of the other group.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.580
So it's very much
an "us versus them."

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.730
And then the leader exacerbates
that division even more.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.100
Also, if the leader has decided
that democratic institutions

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.480
don't work--

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.210
and one of the things we're
seeing both in the United

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.000
States and in Poland, for
instance, and Hungary,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.440
is the demonization of
the judicial branch--

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.460
not just packing it, but in
terms of just deprecating

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.870
what they do.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.000
Or using media in a way
to propagandize people,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
not ever being able to have
any kind of a civil discourse

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.530
with anybody.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.560
And then really willing to--

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.810
I mean, the definition
of a fascist leader

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.220
is somebody who has this
identification with one group

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.750
and then ultimately is willing
to use any force at all

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.070
to get his way.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.970
And so it's kind of
a bully with an army.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.630
So those are the
characteristics.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.810
And I do think
that I'm concerned

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.720
about some of the feathers
that are being plucked here.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.510
HEATHER YOUNG: So when you refer
to democratic institutions,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.280
what does that mean for people
who may not have been here

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.030
their whole lives?

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.160
What is a democratic
institution?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.993
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: A
democratic institution

00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:38.810
is one that is created by a
constitution, for one thing.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.590
But then also exists,
if it's the elected

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.330
part of the government, on the
basis of citizens understanding

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.540
who are the people that
are running for office,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.420
and that they are
there to be removed

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.770
if they don't do the job.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.980
So it's very much an
interactive aspect

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.540
with the people of a country.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.200
And one of the things that
has concerned me an awful lot

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.340
is that--

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.280
this may sound overly
political theory--

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.980
that the social contract
has been broken.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.440
Because for
centuries, people have

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.280
been willing to give up some
individual rights in order

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.410
to be protected by the state.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.380
And what that does is create
some mutual obligation

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.900
so that the state
is supposed to make

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.390
some provision for highways,
and schools, and various things.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.860
But in return, the people are
supposed to be active citizens,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.760
and vote, and keep track
of who has been elected.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.299
So that is what democracy
is about-- the involvement

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.900
of the people in the
democratic institutions.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.860
HEATHER YOUNG: So when
you talk about fascism,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.890
how is it different from
other forms of government

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.600
like authoritarianism?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.550
Where's the line between those?

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.466
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well,
the interesting part

00:08:57.466 --> 00:09:00.200
is that for the most
part, authoritarianism is

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.510
something that comes top-down.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.180
To some extent, monarchies
are authoritarian,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.820
or the current
Saudi government is.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.310
What is interesting
about fascism

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.310
is this linkage of
bottom-up and top-down.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.690
Because it is
based on a disquiet

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.510
among a group of people.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.550
And there are people that
are unhappy over their lot

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.100
economically probably, or
some other ways that they're

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.970
being discriminated against.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.140
And then the fascist
leader will take advantage

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.190
of this bottom-up aspect
to then impose, top-down,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.000
a rule that ends up in
some form of violence,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.700
and the leader is
convinced that he's

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.100
above the law, and those other
aspects that I mentioned.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.910
And then there is
usually some form

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.310
of violence involved in it.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.790
But it's what makes it
different from authoritarian--

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.640
Every fascist is a dictator.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.399
Not every dictator is a fascist.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.940
HEATHER YOUNG: These
leaders, though,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.630
don't exist in a vacuum.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.780
And so when you think about
things like-- in the US,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.080
you could think about our
Congress as an example.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.970
Isn't there a
responsibility there

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.635
to help keep things in check?

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:16.010
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Very much so.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.870
And I think that's one of the
things we also have to look at.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.730
I have a series of
questions at the end

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.130
of the book which really are--

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.990
what kind of
leaders do you want?

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.230
What are you looking for?

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.990
Are you participating at all
in what needs to be done?

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.880
And so I do think what
is disappointing--

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.920
by the way, I think that
our form of government

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.580
is fascinating in so many ways,
in the checks and balances,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.230
and various aspects.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.270
I had worked on Capitol Hill
for Senator Muskie from Maine.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.790
I then went and worked
in the White House

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.320
doing congressional relations.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.990
And so I think
executive-legislative,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.270
the interaction of
those two branches,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.806
is incredibly interesting.

00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:58.180
And there are a
lot of people who

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.360
think we should have a
parliamentary system where

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.630
the party that wins
the parliament then

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.550
gets to name the
executive branch.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.250
We have a different system,
the presidential system.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.870
But the checks and
balances are important.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.970
And I have to say, I am
disappointed in the way

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.430
that this Congress
has been acting.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.860
Because we, in the
past, have occasionally

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.800
had what's known as a
do-nothing Congress.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.530
But this one seems to
be really gridlocked.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.310
And so then it gives more
credibility to those who say,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.780
well, nothing
works in Washington

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.340
so let's do something else.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.170
And so that is one of the
things that really worries me.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:44.950
And so we all know the saying,
"see something, say something."

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.650
I've decided to add
to it, "do something."

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.030
And on my to-do
list is to really

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.720
encourage people to be much
more involved politically,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.430
either to run for
office themselves

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.500
or be supportive
of those that they

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.600
agree with to run for office.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.610
Because Congress--
if they're not

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.800
doing the job they're
supposed to, they can leave.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.220
And I have been so moved by the
children that were marching.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.444
They originally started
with the Florida group.

00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:15.610
But there are a lot of them.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.000
And they want change.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.200
And so I think that
it's important to see

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.100
what they're doing.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.770
By the way, there isn't a
book or a speech given that

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.210
doesn't quote Robert Frost.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.920
So I will do that.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.550
He said, "the older I get,
the younger the teachers are."

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.350
And the bottom
line is they are--

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.480
the kids really are there.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.250
They want gun
sanity so that they

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.650
don't have to go to
school in flack jackets.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.710
And so I do think that
we need to be much more

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.360
active in terms of--

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.100
if the members of Congress
aren't doing anything,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.170
then there are other
people that will.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.660
HEATHER YOUNG: When people
think about becoming more active

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.650
in our democracy, a
lot of times you'll

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:01.800
see that people are
clicking on or signing

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.760
some petition or another.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.120
Are those really effective?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.630
Or when you tell
people that they

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.750
need to go do something,
what specifically should they

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.420
be doing?

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.630
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I do
think the following thing--

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.160
that petitions do work.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.600
I do think part of it, having
been a recipient of some,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.700
if they are letters that
all sound exactly the same,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.470
I think people think
they're motivated.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.720
But are they real?

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.420
But I do think it's
very important to let

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.350
your member of Congress
know what you want

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.350
and what you don't want.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.480
And there are so many
ways of doing it now.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.540
But I also do think
that one of the

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.140
"do something" is not only,
as I said, run for office,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.510
but also be supportive in a
number of different ways--

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.300
door knocking.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:54.670
But also what I find stunning
is that not everybody votes.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.360
And some people can't
even get registered.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.040
And you mentioned
that I was chairman

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.123
of the board of the National
Democratic Institute.

00:14:01.123 --> 00:14:04.100
I have gone abroad a lot
to monitor elections.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.240
And what has happened
is people there

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.940
stand in either the
hot sun or the rain

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.230
in order to be able to vote.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.940
They see it as a privilege.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.690
And we aren't doing that enough.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.530
And I think that there are
too many people who have

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.300
said "my vote doesn't count."

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.460
That is not true.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.120
My first vote for president was
for John Kennedy in Chicago.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.400
And it counted.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.460
And I do think that
just generally--

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.710
and it isn't just
the top, the federal.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.630
I think it's very
important for people

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.070
to support their mayors, city
councils, state governments,

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.820
and kind of see the depth
of American democratic

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.210
institutions, and get out
there and do something.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.880
Because I think then it
is our responsibility

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.081
if we've given up our
privilege of being citizens.

00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:52.830
HEATHER YOUNG: Why do
you think that we're

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.090
seeing this increase
in authoritarianism

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.142
in various places
around the world now?

00:14:59.142 --> 00:15:01.350
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well,
I think the following thing

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.630
that's happened-- and we're
living in an incredibly

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.670
complicated time.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.910
You all are part of
it in so many ways.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.030
I've kind of talked
about that there's

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.730
three eras since the
end of World War II.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.100
The first era was the Cold War.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.420
And the world was divided
into the red, and the red,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.380
white, and blue, and that we
were fighting the communists.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.110
And that somehow was
easier to understand.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.320
There was one enemy--
this communist ideology.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.620
Then what happened was after
the fall of the Berlin Wall,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.740
there was incredible excitement
about the possibility

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.290
of doing different
things and trying

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:42.390
to see how modern technology
worked and operated, in a way.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.790
That was the time of the
Clinton administration.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.790
And we kept thinking that life
could be really different.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.150
President Clinton kept building
bridges to the 21st century

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.810
and trying to figure out what
the system would be like.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.700
Then 9/11 happened.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.060
And I think that was
truly a watershed moment

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.680
for this country.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.580
And all of a sudden, we're in
that post-9/11 period which has

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.540
operated, to a great extent, on
the basis of the fear factor.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.250
We can't operate on fear factor.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.550
The United States has to
operate on the hope factor.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.016
But the thing that
has happened--

00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:19.440
there are a couple
of global trends

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.690
that have their downside.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.060
And the first one
is globalization.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.540
And globalization is
not a four-letter word.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.140
We all are great beneficiaries
of globalization,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.690
the possibility of
traveling and buying

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.910
things from different
countries and knowing people

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.190
from a variety of places.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.840
But it does have a downside.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.550
It's faceless.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.140
And so people feel that
they don't have an identity.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.430
And we all are entitled to
an identity, either ethnic,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.740
or linguistic, or religious.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.180
And that's fine.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.770
And I think patriotism is a
very good sense and feeling.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.250
What is bad is if my
identity hates your identity.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.170
And then that turns
into nationalism

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.069
and hyper-nationalism, which is
very dangerous, and is used by

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:13.260
demagogues to motivate
people who feel displaced.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.480
And one of the things
that has happened

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.900
is the other megatrend,
which is technology.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.569
And I think that
we all thought--

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.290
and you all clearly do--

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.810
that it's this magical new
concept that can really work.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.700
And it does bring
people together

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.220
in the most amazing way.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.720
I always like to talk about
the woman farmer in Kenya that

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.240
doesn't have to walk miles
anymore to pay her bills.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.410
She can just use her phone
and make that happen.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.430
But it also has a downside
because it has disaggregated

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.550
people's voices in many ways.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.280
And people live in their
own little echo chamber.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.720
And one of the examples
to use, for instance,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.470
is what happened in Egypt
during the Arab Spring.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:02.000
People were motivated by social
media to go to Tahrir Square.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.500
And they were very excited.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.490
And they didn't like
their government.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.350
But then-- and people are
surprised whenever I say this--

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.050
I think the election
was held too soon.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.330
The Muslim Brotherhood
was organized,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.160
and the people in
Tahrir Square were not.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.100
They had been listening
to their own--

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.330
whoever they wanted
to listen to.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.260
And so the Muslim
Brotherhood gets elected.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.250
And things are a mess in Egypt.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.800
And then what happens is--

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.490
I made up this mythical man
who lives outside of Cairo,

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.310
wants to come in to open
a stall in the souk.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.220
And he can't get by the
traffic because Tahrir Square

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.150
is a mess.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.790
And so he says
"screw it" in Arabic.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.060
And then he says, I want order.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.820
So then what happens is
General Sisi comes in

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.790
and they have order
with a capital O.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.560
So what has happened is
this disquiet in societies

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.150
then creates this disorder.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.120
The democratic institutions
are too slow to work.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.150
And then the authoritarian
who wants, in fact,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.330
to take advantage of all
of that and exacerbates it,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.910
and that's how you get to
authoritarian government.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.980
Because the democratic
institutions

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.640
are not operating fast enough.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.920
Now, I stole this line
from somebody out here

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.710
that I think describes
the situation perfectly.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.080
People are talking
to their governments

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.660
on 21st century technology.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.440
The governments listen to them
on 20th century technology,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.330
and provide 19th
century responses.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.620
So there is no faith
in the institutions.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.730
And that's what we're
involved in now.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.180
And what does need to be
done in this third era

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.780
is to understand the
magic of new technology,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.570
prepare people for
working in it and not

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.050
feeling that they are
useless, and then try

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.940
to sort out what
the institutions are

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.790
that go with it.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.760
So I think this is a massively
disarrayed period, but one

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.240
that offers huge opportunity
to the millennials

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.277
while the perennials
keep talking.

00:20:04.277 --> 00:20:06.860
HEATHER YOUNG: Well, you've got
the ear of a lot of the people

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.440
who are creating the
22nd century knowledge.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.324
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Absolutely, yep.

00:20:13.324 --> 00:20:14.990
HEATHER YOUNG: From
personal experience,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.890
I remember watching
the Berlin Wall fall.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.730
But for me, because
I hadn't lived

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.120
through its going up and
all that that entailed,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.160
that was a history
lesson for me.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.250
And I didn't have
a connection to it

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.580
the same way that my
parents or grandparents did.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:40.430
And talking to my son
the other day about 9/11,

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.780
it occurred to me that--

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.590
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
He didn't know?

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.756
HEATHER YOUNG: --he will
never feel that connection,

00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:46.940
that it will always be
a historic exercise.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:53.060
And so is there a way that we
can really help millennials

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.960
or whoever that may not
have lived through some

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.210
of these events really
get a deeper sense of them

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.780
and a connection to them
so that they're not just

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.824
an academic exercise?

00:21:03.824 --> 00:21:05.240
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, I really

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.650
do think that it is
important to know history.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.500
And you know, there's
always that thing--

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.840
if you don't know history,
you're bound to repeat it.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.670
And it's never quite the same.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.760
But I do think it's
important to explain history.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.200
And I think to an extent, it can
be explained in terms of people

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.480
that the younger people
might know or know

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.680
about their grandparents.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.260
I think it's very important
to personalize it.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.210
But in the end,
history is history.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.220
And one has to read
it and understand it,

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.280
but also not just
to know the facts

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.350
but to know the
implications of the facts.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.120
You had mentioned Auschwitz.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.687
All right, so it's a place.

00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:47.270
But you have to
understand that people

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.770
were sent there against their
will, and put in gas chambers,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.110
and killed.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.920
And that was as a result
of fascists that believed--

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.700
and this is the important
part about all of this--

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.310
there are economic
problems in every country.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.420
And it's bound to happen.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.390
And technology is miraculous,
there's no question.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.020
And there always has
been some new technology.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.210
But it does disrupt things.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.630
There's no question about that.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.190
And it does create divisions.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.740
And I think that unless one
deals with the divisions,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.600
then it's only
going to get worse.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.600
But the demagogue leader that
does work off of the bottom

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.370
takes a look at it
and first of all uses

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.120
nationalism-- this is our
people that are doing this.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.490
And nationalism can spur people
to good things and bad things.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.850
A fascist leader spurs
them in a bad direction.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.850
And then what happens is there
always has to be somebody

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.340
to blame for this.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.290
So there are the scapegoats.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.650
And by the fascists,
it was the Jews.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.870
And now it is the immigrants.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.700
And so if you look
at what's happening

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.070
in Hungary, for instance--

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.600
and history makes
a big difference.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.780
And Hungary is an
interesting place.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.940
By the way, this is
the 100th anniversary

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.670
of the end of World War
I. And the countries

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.580
in Central and Eastern
Europe came into existence

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.300
at that point.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.600
And they were based
on national identity.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.760
I was born in
Czechoslovakia, as I've said.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.820
And it turns out the first
president of Czechoslovakia

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.410
married an American.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.300
Her name was Charlotte Garrigue.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.930
And he, Tomas Garrigue
Masaryk, took her maiden name

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.310
as his middle name.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.670
So imagine-- this was a wedding
at the end of the 19th century.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.190
And the Czechoslovak
constitution

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.920
is based on the
American Constitution

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.660
with one difference--

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.120
it had equal rights
language in it in 1918.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.700
But the thing that
is interesting--

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.146
Hungary was the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:50.020
But all of a sudden,
there was this country--

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.980
Hungary.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.840
And then at the
end of World War I,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.240
there was a treaty,
the Treaty of Trianon,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.030
that actually Hungary,
having been an empire,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.320
became a smaller country.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.400
And I did a set
of surveys in '91.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.620
And we asked the country,
all across Europe-- people,

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.410
do you believe a
piece of your country

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.000
is in the neighboring country?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.070
And I'll never forget.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.720
80% of Hungarians thought
a piece of their country

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.410
was in another country.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.380
So they are dissatisfied.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.170
And Orban, the current
prime minister,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.910
is blaming the migrants.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.310
And he only wants Hungarians.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.160
He doesn't want anybody
that's not a Hungarian.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.170
And they are now the scapegoats.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.920
So part of the
fascist ideology here

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.160
is hyper-nationalism
and a scapegoat.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.520
That's what Auschwitz was about.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.170
HEATHER YOUNG: The
book covers a number

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.820
of historical and
present-day examples.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:51.000
A lot of those
examples ended in war.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.820
Please tell me you have
some good examples of where

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.871
they didn't have to go to
some kind of a World War II

00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:02.120
to come back from nationalism.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:07.180
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well
actually, one was Argentina.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.997
You know, "Don't Cry
For Me, Argentina."

00:25:09.997 --> 00:25:11.830
HEATHER YOUNG: I just
found some good music.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.580
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
But for the most part,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.510
unfortunately, they do end
in some kind of violence.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.020
Which is why what concerns
me is this whole business

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.150
about the fear factor.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.090
And I think that
compels us to think

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.640
we have to destroy something.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.490
Whereas I think that if there's
some rational discussion

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.570
with people, it's
possible not to.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.675
But unfortunately,
a lot of them do end

00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:37.030
in some kind of violence.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:42.950
And I think that is something
to be concerned about.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.740
HEATHER YOUNG: You
wrote your dissertation

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.220
on the role of information
in political change

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.190
and the importance
of the free press

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.970
not only to access information
but then to access trustworthy

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.380
information.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.440
I've noted a couple
of examples recently

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.280
where even members of
Congress have cited things

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.420
from satirical websites thinking
that they were genuine news

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.280
stories as they were having
discussions about legislation.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.790
What do you do to
get information?

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.565
And how do you know that you're
getting good information?

00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:21.190
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, it is
difficult. There's no question.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.440
And let me just
say, I have always

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.760
been interested in the
role of information

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.870
and political change.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:32.410
And my dissertation was about
the Czechoslovak press in 1968.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.770
What was interesting at
that point was the people

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:40.030
knew something and the official
press didn't print it ever.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.190
Because the people had
gotten their information

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.800
from Radio Free Europe
and Voice of America.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.010
But basically, they were
spreading that kind of news

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.880
among themselves.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.180
And it wasn't until
the newspapers

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.290
became uncensored and
were able to print it

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.490
that it was regarded as truth.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.830
There's also always
been some technology.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.920
So I wrote about
the Polish press

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.760
at a certain point, solidarity.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.410
The big invention at that
point was the microcassette.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.470
And what had happened was Lech
Walesa would go to a factory.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.850
And they would tape it.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.530
And then they'd send
the microcassette

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:18.520
to another factory and kind of
kept the whole thing moving.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.580
Then, to go back
to Tahrir Square,

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.160
the opposite of what had
happened in Czechoslovakia

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.560
happened in Tahrir Square.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.100
The people did
not have the truth

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.800
because they were listening to
their own little echo chamber.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.019
But the journalists actually
were writing the truth.

00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:38.560
And now they've all
been put in jail.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.260
But the bottom line
was it's whoever

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.510
can get at the facts
that make the difference.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.060
I think the issue
now is the following.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.100
And that is that--

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.860
first of all, I can be
accused of being a relativist.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.920
I think it is hard to
find the absolute truth.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.910
But the way I get
my information is I

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.010
read a number of
different newspapers,

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.300
just the way if
you're doing research

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.590
you actually have to look at
a number of different sources.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:12.190
And while the interpretation
may be slightly--

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.320
I read "The Washington
Post," "The New York Times,"

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.486
"The Wall Street Journal,"
and "The Financial Times"

00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:17.980
every day.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:24.040
And I'm able to
kind of combine it.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.990
Then I Google everything.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.180
But the bottom line
is that I do think

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.270
one has to do some
comparative aspect,

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.330
and then really try to figure
out what the source is.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.500
And that's where you
guys are also helpful.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.940
But I do think sourcing
takes more work.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:47.350
And I think that people do get
fooled by something, thinking

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.802
that it is the
truth, at which point

00:28:49.802 --> 00:28:51.010
you have to check everything.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.300
But the bottom line is I think
it is very important also

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.054
to read and listen to
things you disagree with.

00:28:58.054 --> 00:29:00.220
So you should all be very
glad you live here and not

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.230
in the other Washington.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.940
Because I drive there.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.810
And I listen to right-wing
radio as I drive.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.550
And I yell and scream a lot.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.120
And some day I'm going to hit
something or get arrested.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.160
But I do think
people need to listen

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.480
to things they disagree with.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.750
HEATHER YOUNG: I had
a negotiation teacher

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.140
once that said, you
really need to be

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.010
able to make the argument
for the other side.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.302
If you can't, then you don't
understand it well enough.

00:29:29.302 --> 00:29:31.634
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: And I
have to say, I teach a course.

00:29:31.634 --> 00:29:33.970
I say foreign policy is just
trying to get some country

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:34.803
to do what you want.

00:29:34.803 --> 00:29:36.520
That's all it is.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.530
And so what are
the tools you have?

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.830
So my course is called the
National Security Toolbox.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.850
I have my students
write short memos

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.780
because nobody in the
government reads 35-page papers.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.930
And besides, you can get
a 35-page paper on Google.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.690
And so the bottom line is I
make my students deliberately

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.490
do what you just said.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.350
They propose something.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.470
And I tell them they have to
do the argument against what

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.220
they have proposed and
also look at contingencies.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.750
By the way, our
current president

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.800
would flunk my course.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.849
HEATHER YOUNG: Where does social
media fit in your toolbox?

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.390
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Social media fits

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.510
more and more in terms
of, just generally,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.210
what the role of information is.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.800
Because you can't operate
without information.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.210
And I think the issue
here is that one

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.070
can make various plans.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.020
But unless you have
information, you'll go wrong.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.920
And that is the example
of the war in Iraq.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.870
The wrong information
was out there.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.860
And a lot of things
were based on it.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:51.160
And so I think that social
media plays a huge role.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.680
And I'm still trying to
sort this out-- the pros

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.190
and cons of social media.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.740
Because it has connected us
all in an incredible way.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.380
But it also has
created a whole new set

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.520
of issues in terms of what
the regulations are about it.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.430
We certainly are seeing that
now, how one has freedom

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.630
but at the same time,
there are some ways

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.440
where it's terrible if the
wrong thing all of a sudden

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.820
gets circulated.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:25.600
It has a lot of paradoxes in
it, which is the millennials

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.940
and the younger ones put
all of the information

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.380
about themselves on something.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.520
And then they wonder why people
know everything about them.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.890
And so there are all
kinds of aspects of it.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.580
But I do think
that it's obviously

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.690
the major aspect in
terms of connectivity

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:49.510
now, and an amazing force
both positive and negative.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.580
And so I think that
all of you have

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.409
a great responsibility with it.

00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:55.950
HEATHER YOUNG: You
remain the highest

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.140
sitting US government
official to have

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.630
met with a North Korean leader.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.770
Long before you
traveled there in 2000,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.500
there was a lot of preparation
work that went into that.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.610
I'd like to just
get your reaction

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:21.120
to some of the recent news in
terms of the recent trip that

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.550
was taken by the
Secretary of State

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:28.305
nominee and the plans for the
president to meet Kim Jong-un.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:42.020
With the changes that have taken
place at the State Department

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.720
and the changes in
funding, and everything

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.730
that's happened over the
last couple of years,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.540
are they in a good
place to be able to have

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.010
those kinds of meetings?

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.840
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, yes and no.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.990
First of all, let me say--

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.520
during the Clinton
administration,

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.270
we spent an inordinate amount
of time on North Korea.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.899
It started, frankly, at the
beginning of the administration

00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:07.190
when the North Koreans said
they were going to pull out

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.350
of the nonproliferation treaty.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.912
I was up at the UN at the time.

00:33:10.912 --> 00:33:12.620
And I won't go through
the whole history,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.510
but we spent a lot
of time on something

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.520
called The Agreed
Framework, which

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.110
was going to limit their nuclear
capabilities in exchange for us

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.480
selling them heavy fuel and
doing a lightwater reactor

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.130
probe.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.920
Anyway, it kept going
on in complications

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.670
so that President
Clinton in '98, '99

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.100
asked, by then, former
Secretary of Defense

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.340
Bill Perry to do a complete
review of our North Korean

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:37.880
policy.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.310
So that already was an
incredible amount of work.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.880
And he basically
went to North Korea

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.570
and told them this was
a fork in the road time,

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.620
that either they were
going to negotiate

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.960
about what they were doing or
we were prepared to use force.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.600
They chose negotiation.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.660
So then what happened
was that the number two

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.240
guy came to the United States.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.190
And we were in the
Oval Office when

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.130
he handed to President
Clinton an invitation for him

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.810
to go to North Korea.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.170
And so President Clinton wisely
said, yes, well, maybe I'll

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.699
come some time but this
has to be prepared.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.280
I'm sending the
Secretary of State.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.360
They were not
thrilled about that.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.050
But the bottom line is,
getting ready for the trip we

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.750
had already done an
incredible amount of work.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.780
And even with that, we didn't
have a lot of intelligence

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.510
on Kim Jong-il, the father.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:30.260
And so I talked to Kim Dae-jung,
the president of South Korea

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.699
who had met with him.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:32.800
And it was evident--

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.070
and our intelligence, by the
way said that Kim Jong-il

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.929
was crazy and a pervert.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.420
I found out he wasn't crazy.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.060
And so--

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.521
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:48.191
So I go there.

00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:49.690
And we didn't have
an embassy there.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.040
And we had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.030
So I'm sitting in
the guesthouse where

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.590
they had a camera and things
that to record your sound

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.370
and everything.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.160
I hadn't realized
that when you type,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.530
they can tell just by the
strokes what you're doing.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.220
So we sat there waiting
for some kind of whatever.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.510
And they said that I had to go
and see his embalmed father.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.570
So that's much more
complicated than meets the eye.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:20.590
Because if you bow too
low in front of his body,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.750
then the American press
will criticize you

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.310
for being obsequious.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.840
And if you don't bow low enough,
then it doesn't do the job.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.560
Anyway, I must have
had the right angle

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.020
because I then go back to
the guesthouse and they said,

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.150
now the Dear Leader
will see you.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.400
So we're at our press
conference which

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.440
was like something out of
the '50s with old cameras

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:39.940
and stuff.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.620
And I'm standing
next to this man

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.610
and I see we're the same height.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.280
And I know I had on high heels.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.530
So I looked over at
him, and so did he.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.400
And his hair was a
lot poofier than mine.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.250
But the bottom line is
we had very serious talks

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.110
about-- at that
stage-- missile limits.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.010
And then the election
of 2000 happened.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.340
And I briefed Colin Powell
on what we were doing.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.260
He was very interested in it.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.530
And then a headline appeared
in the Washington Post

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.780
saying "Powell to continue
Clinton policies on North

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.280
Korea."

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.610
And he was hauled into the
Oval and told, "no way."

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.010
So I hold no brief
for the North Koreans.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.670
But that was a very
unfortunate aspect of it.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.410
But I think the point that you
were talking about is that--

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.180
I'm glad they're
having a meeting.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.190
And the South
Koreans are clearly

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.750
playing an important role.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.290
I am concerned about
the preparation.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.900
I'm concerned that the State
Department has been hollowed

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.250
out and that the guy that
was their chief North Korean

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.500
specialist has left.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.310
I'm glad that Pompeo
went to North Korea.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:54.470
And I'm glad they're
having the meeting.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.070
I'm concerned that a
meeting such as that

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.770
requires a great
deal of discipline

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.230
and how this is going to work.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.540
There was an
interesting analysis

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:10.790
that I read last night
which says that if they have

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:14.600
a decent meeting, that
then an incredible amount

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.900
of diplomatic work is
going to have to be done.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.180
And I don't quite know
how it's going to work.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.900
By the way, the one thing that
we did know about the father--

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.460
and Dennis Rodman is all my
fault because what happened was

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.070
we knew that the father
liked basketball.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.980
So I took over a
basketball autographed

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.640
by Michael Jordan, which
is in their holy of holies.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.590
So maybe Dennis Rodman
will be part of this now.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.410
But they're going to be
very complicated talks.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.760
And just to add
another level to this,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.660
President Macron of
France is here today.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.060
I was watching the
arrival statement.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.970
And it's very clear,
he made clear,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.990
that the Iran agreement
and the North Korean talks

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.950
are linked together.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.790
And they are because
the North Koreans are

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.870
going to need some agreement.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.410
And if the president already
is prepared to tear up

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.750
the Iran agreement, why
would they go along with it?

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:15.000
So we'll see where
those two go together.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.080
And by the way, it's a perfect
example of something there.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.080
Everybody talks about
diplomacy as a chess game.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.310
It is not a chess game.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.740
Those are two people
sitting quietly,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.300
figuring out their moves.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.760
It's more like pool,
billiards, where

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.950
there's a bunch of balls
in the middle of the table,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.990
somebody comes up
with a cue stick

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.290
with the hope of getting a ball
into a pocket on the other side

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.570
and it hits a lot of
other balls along the way.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.270
It's very horizontal
and dynamic.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.000
And I think we're seeing
all that right now

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
in terms of how one
thing affects another.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.640
HEATHER YOUNG:
Beware of hustlers.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.223
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Definitely beware.

00:38:50.223 --> 00:38:50.800
Very good.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.052
I'm going to add that.

00:38:52.052 --> 00:38:53.438
HEATHER YOUNG: [LAUGHS]

00:38:55.122 --> 00:38:58.250
So one of your previous books
is called "Read My Pins."

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.580
And so while we wait for
people to come up to the mic--

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.997
we'll be opening up for
questions in just a moment--

00:39:03.997 --> 00:39:06.330
can you tell us a little bit
about how that got started?

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.160
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Yeah, I will.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.620
So I clearly like jewelry.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.430
So what happened was I got
to the UN in February of '93.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.220
And the Gulf War had just ended.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.920
And the cease-fire had been
translated into a series

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.930
of sanctions resolutions.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.020
And my job was to make sure
the sanctions stayed on.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.060
And so I said perfectly
horrible things

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.920
about Saddam Hussein every day.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.510
He deserved it because
he invaded Kuwait.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.590
So all of a sudden, there was
a poem in the papers in Baghdad

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.140
comparing me to many
things, but among them

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.850
an unparalleled serpent.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.380
So I had a snake pin.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.710
And I decided to wear it
whenever we talked about Iraq.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.590
And you've seen how
the ambassadors go out

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.410
after one of their meetings
and the press is out there.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:52.410
So all of a sudden, the cameras
zeros in and the reporter says,

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.170
why are you wearing
that snake pin?

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.510
And I said, because
Saddam Hussein compared me

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.207
to an unparalleled serpent.

00:39:58.207 --> 00:39:59.790
And then I thought,
well, this is fun.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.290
So I went out and I bought
a lot of costume jewelry

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.250
to reflect whatever we were
going to do on any given day.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.830
And so I wore flowers,
and butterflies,

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.140
and balloons on good days.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.230
And on bad days, I wore
carnivorous animals

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.820
and insects.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.070
And the other
ambassadors kind of

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.369
had begun to figure
out what was going on.

00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:22.910
And the first
President Bush had said

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.890
"read my lips-- no new taxes."

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.630
So I said, read my pins.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.050
And people really
got used to it.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.220
So one story, for instance--
when I was Secretary,

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.710
the Russians were bugging
the State Department.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.410
And it was in an office
right near my office.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.470
And we found the guy
listening outside.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:43.130
And we did what diplomats do
which is démarche Moscow--

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.046
"how could you
possibly do that?"

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:47.420
But the next time I met with
the Russian foreign minister

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.060
I wore a huge bug.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.110
And he knew exactly
what I was doing.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.700
So I see you've got on a pin.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.609
HEATHER YOUNG: I
do, it's a Phoenix.

00:40:56.609 --> 00:40:58.150
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
That's very good.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.050
And I have Mercury
the Messenger.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.620
So that's what's going on.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.120
AUDIENCE: Madam
Secretary, you've

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.071
been an inspiration to
both some of the most

00:41:07.071 --> 00:41:09.570
incredible people in my life
and some of the most important.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.140
And since they
can't be here today,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.040
I just want to say thank you
on behalf of them and myself.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.290
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.992
Thank you so much
for saying that.

00:41:16.992 --> 00:41:17.976
Thank you.

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:21.544 --> 00:41:23.960
AUDIENCE: Secretary Albright,
thanks for being here today.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.020
I actually was fellow in
your 2016 Albright Institute

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.370
at Wellesley College.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.610
I wanted to ask how your
most recent book will impact

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.962
the 2019 Institute
at Wellesley College

00:41:33.962 --> 00:41:35.420
and was wondering
if you could talk

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.760
a little bit about your
plans for how you're

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.220
going to continue that
relationship for how you're

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.840
mentoring some young millennials
from your alma mater.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.660
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: So
what class were you?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.740
AUDIENCE: Class of 2017.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.156
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
2017-- and I'm

00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:50.270
class of 1959, which means
I went to Wellesley sometime

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.300
between the invention of the
iPad and the discovery of fire.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.670
But let me tell people-- what
happened was I loved Wellesley.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.792
I had a great time there.

00:42:02.792 --> 00:42:03.500
AUDIENCE: Me too.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.300
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: And they
established this Institute

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.290
in my name.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.920
And what it does is train young
women in global leadership.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.410
And the basis of it
is multidisciplinary.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.010
So I was a poli sci major.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.310
And I did take history.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.210
And when I took economics,
that seemed out of my lane.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:24.630
Now we know that international
relations is a growth industry

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.830
and that it requires people
that have a basis in science,

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.310
and religion, and archeology.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.350
And so the Institute
at Wellesley-- we

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:38.420
choose somewhere between 40 and
50 Albright Fellows every year.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.340
We're about to celebrate
our 10th anniversary.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.030
And what we do is
these young women

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.180
are there between
semesters in groups

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.030
to present various programs.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.160
And they have to
learn about each other

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.970
and the different disciplines,
and present projects

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.860
and speak publicly.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.250
And I'm very excited about it.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.120
We now have a whole
cohort of Albright Fellows

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.290
around the world.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.800
And we're going to pursue this.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.590
And we're just looking at what
the next set of things-- we've

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.270
been doing sustainable
development

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.640
goals or various things that
have something in common.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.330
But I do think that--
the book, I'm hoping,

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.620
will be something that gets
people interested in what

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.100
creates the divisions
in the society and then

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.110
the institutions that
have to deal with them.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.140
And how many of them are
institutions that are national

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.880
and how many are international?

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.830
So I'm very glad you're here.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.460
That's what is
supposed to happen.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.960
So--

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.793
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:36.793 --> 00:43:38.370
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.060
AUDIENCE: So my question has
to do with the warning you

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:41.660
have for us.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.040
And the political
perspective that I

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.880
come from being
interested in civil rights

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.880
and being pro-choice,
and things like that.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.545
For me, the phrase "states'
rights" has always sort of been

00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:57.170
like a dirty phrase
because it's always

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.650
been associated with people
fighting against those things.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.870
But to what extent do
you think federalism

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.150
is a defense against fascism?

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.590
Do you think that
federalism will save us?

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.289
Will the states save us?

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:13.830
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think it's
a very interesting question.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.920
Because at the moment,
they are saving us.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.420
Because part of the
things that's happening--

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.440
first of all,
state legislatures,

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.710
despite the fact that many of
them are held by Republicans,

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.140
I do think that there
are various aspects that

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.710
are working.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.410
And the state judicial
systems I find

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.450
fascinating in terms
of what they've

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:37.640
done to change the ban
against immigrants coming in.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.530
And then also some of
the things in terms

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.450
of the investigations
that are going on that

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.010
are going to the states.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.485
And I think to a
great extent, it's

00:44:45.485 --> 00:44:47.360
interesting because we
always kind of thought

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.100
of states' rights
as backward-leaning.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.160
One of the problems with
fascism is the centralization

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.900
of everything, the
centralization of the power.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.890
Therefore, having some
dispersion through federalism

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:01.640
works.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.680
What I think is
interesting also,

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.960
if one looks at what's
happening in Europe--

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.180
they're never going to have
a United States of Europe

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.880
and some form of
federalism, for them.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.180
And that's what Macron has begun
to talk about more and more.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.020
I think, again, it
provides some local input

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.690
and allows there to be a
different identity, which

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.420
is not exactly our
problem in the US.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.060
But then also some way
of bringing it together

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:26.760
at the top.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.120
So I do think most of us have
to change our view about it.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.060
I know when states'
rights seemed

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.310
like a bunch of
Dixiecrats or something.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.240
And so I do think that it's
a very interesting example

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.190
of change in this.

00:45:40.365 --> 00:45:41.199
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:41.865
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:43.100
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.490
[INAUDIBLE] My question is about
the role of income inequality

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.390
and oligarchy in growth
of authoritarian regimes.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.520
I grew up in Russia.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.330
In 1990s, Russian
society went a long way

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.370
from appearance of
equality to one of the most

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.280
unequal societies in the world.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.980
And it created a lot of anger.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.640
And oligarchs
channeled that anger

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.800
into putting in the power
of the authoritarian leader.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.115
And from that perspective,
the authoritarian look

00:46:15.115 --> 00:46:18.035
of Vladimir Putin was
a feature, not a bug.

00:46:18.035 --> 00:46:20.570
Would you agree with
political groups

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:24.560
within the United States who
highlight income inequality

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.530
and growth of corporate
oligarchy power

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.189
as the biggest threat for
the United States democracy?

00:46:30.189 --> 00:46:31.730
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, let me just

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.600
say something about Russia.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.320
I used to be known
as a Soviet expert.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.950
And I look at my
library and I think--

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.600
archeology it's not.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.030
A lot of the things are germane
to what is going on now.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.380
And I do have to mention
this because I talked

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.630
about the survey I did in '91.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.680
We had questionnaires
and focus groups.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.320
And we did them in Russia.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.970
And I'll never
forget a focus group

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.300
that we had outside of Moscow
where this man stood up

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.130
and said, I'm so embarrassed.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.170
We used to be a
superpower and now we're

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.030
Bangladesh with missiles.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:12.200
And what has happened
is that Putin has really

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.350
identified himself with
that loss of identity,

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.020
and now has restored
Russia to its greatness.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:24.920
And I think that that's frankly
one of the things that then

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.790
allows him to run a country
where inequality is very bad

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.910
and the oligarchs have
taken over in many ways.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.370
The United States--
for the most part, I do

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:38.120
think that this economic
disparity is one

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.770
of the issues that's out there.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.190
And the thing that has
happened is, I think, Trump--

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.450
it's a little weird for me.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.620
Either he is a
billionaire or he isn't.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.990
But the bottom line is, he
has identified himself, quote,

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.490
"with this group
of people that are

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.310
economically disadvantaged."

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.800
He also has done
something, which

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.320
is to talk about making
America great again.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.300
I happen to think
America is great, that he

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.290
doesn't have to do that.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.190
But I do think that the
economic disparity is

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:11.780
something that is part
of the danger of having

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:16.290
a demagogic leader who
says, I will fix it,

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:18.320
and this "us versus them" part.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.947
So to that extent, I think
we are susceptible to that.

00:48:21.947 --> 00:48:22.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.130
AUDIENCE: So
historically, fascism

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.640
is usually associated with
the right-wing movements.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.770
But it seems that according
to your definition,

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:37.580
it can also be applied to
certain left-wing phenomenon.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.640
So what is your
assessment at present--

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.090
where is the danger
higher, left versus right?

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.700
And then with respect
to this difference,

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:50.409
how do you assess the US
versus the rest of the world?

00:48:50.409 --> 00:48:51.950
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
One of the things

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:55.400
is the leaders that
I have talked about,

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.490
even Orban, et cetera--

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.940
I am careful not to
say "he is a fascist."

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.730
The only real fascist
that's out there now

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.310
is in North Korea
where there is just

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.220
complete control
over everything.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.850
And so that would lead me to
say that the leftist one is

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.930
more dangerous.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.770
But I actually think that the
rightist one, at the moment,

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.690
is predominant.

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.170
Partially because
first of all, Orban

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.630
has made up this term
"illiberal democracy"

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.400
which is an oxymoron,
and trying to figure out

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.100
whether there are those--

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.170
particularly the
ones in Europe--

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.402
that have been against
leftists because they

00:49:39.402 --> 00:49:40.610
think they're all communists.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:45.390
And they do know what communism
did to their countries.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.410
And so because I see
that threat primarily

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.510
in Central and Eastern Europe--

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:53.690
and then also
Venezuela, for instance.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.440
But mostly from both
sides, but at the moment

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.840
I would say the right
is more dangerous.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.804
AUDIENCE: And in
the US [INAUDIBLE]??

00:50:05.804 --> 00:50:07.220
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
And In the US,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.260
I think at the moment
it's more from the right.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.790
And we can't keep
talking about it

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.450
in terms of the 2016 election.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.710
But basically
because it was kind

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:24.530
of a movement against the
left identity politics,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.930
or whatever people
were calling it.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.010
And I do think--

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.990
but I may be totally wrong on
this because I think it's both.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.070
And I think people have
been very surprised

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.580
that I included communists
and the left as fascists

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.160
because people usually
don't think of it that way.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.670
But they were opposed
to each other.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.030
But if you look at some
of the characteristics,

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.200
they're exactly the same.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.655
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:50:46.655 --> 00:50:48.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming,
Madam Secretary Albright.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.435
You mentioned checks
and balances earlier.

00:50:50.435 --> 00:50:51.785
I had a question about
checks and balances

00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:52.950
and our current president.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:54.712
I think one of the
things that annoys me

00:50:54.712 --> 00:50:56.420
about a lot of the
announcements of Trump

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.260
is that it kind of
pretends that there's

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.218
only one branch of
government where we actually

00:50:59.218 --> 00:51:00.080
have three branches.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.770
I know recently Trump lost an
immigration case in the Supreme

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.270
Court.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.395
And the deciding vote was
actually his own nominee,

00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:08.066
Justice Gorsuch.

00:51:08.066 --> 00:51:09.730
And then I'm sure
there's also times

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.270
where Paul Ryan [INAUDIBLE]
politely or not-so

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:14.390
politely told Trump "no"
behind closed doors.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.459
So in terms of
checks and balances,

00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:18.750
do you think it's working well?

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.322
Do you think it's working
not well in the government?

00:51:20.322 --> 00:51:22.345
What's the current state
of that in your opinion?

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:23.720
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT:
Well, I have,

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.810
again, not a
paradoxical situation.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.320
I've been talking about the
resiliency of democracy,

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.230
and at the same time about
the fragility of democracy.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.920
And we're kind of between
those two at the moment.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:42.050
I do think that the checks and
balances are working better

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.000
with the judicial
system, frankly.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.220
There's a case coming
up in the Supreme Court

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.760
now again on bans on immigrants.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.850
And I think that there
are some interesting parts

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.200
that the Supreme Court is doing.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.260
And I think earlier in my
answer on the states' rights,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.370
I do think that some of the
judicial aspects of state

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.370
courts are doing work.

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:08.880
I am concerned about what's
happening in Congress.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:15.520
Because I think that it is much
less into checks at the moment.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.940
And they really have
not done that much.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:25.510
One of the things that people
forget about democracy--

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:28.590
it's majority rule
and minority rights.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.960
And there's not enough
emphasis about how

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.690
the minority in Congress
is able to operate

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:34.890
given the various rules.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:39.700
So they look always as
if they are undermining,

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.970
that they're creating
the gridlock.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:47.340
And so I am sometimes
suspicious about the fact

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.960
that it really strengthens
Trump that there's gridlock.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.940
Because he can say they
aren't doing anything.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.760
And so the question is whether
the non-Trump Republicans

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.770
and the Democrats can
somehow figure out

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:06.150
to have more things that
make the checks really work.

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:11.340
But I think that basically, I
have faith in our institutions.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.160
And as I think I
said earlier, I don't

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.490
want to operate
on the fear factor

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:22.350
but on the hope factor, which
is why these elections in 2018

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.800
are so important and
why my to-do list is

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.410
for people that disagree--
the normalizing thing.

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.450
If they don't want to
see this normalized,

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.340
then we all have the power
to go out and change that.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:40.410
And I mean, you all live
in the state of California.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.590
I mean, in Washington,
next to California.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.430
But I mean, the western coast
is really incredibly strong.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.320
And. the state of
Washington has been

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.930
incredible on the
judicial stuff,

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.630
unbelievable in terms of the
strength of the judiciary.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.910
So the combination
of the West Coast,

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.970
you in California and Oregon,
make a big difference.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.730
The question is
whether you can push,

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.000
and that the rest of us in
the other parts of the country

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.840
can figure out how to
get a different Congress.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:15.210
And believe me, I
think there is going

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:18.300
to be an awful lot of action
from the other side in terms

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.390
of making these elections
more complicated.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.580
And the role of the
Russians in our elections--

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.700
I just was again
reading something.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.030
The fact that the
president-- because he is

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.850
so concerned as to whether
he was elected legitimately

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:40.080
or not-- will not do something
about what happened in 2016

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.420
means that we are
still open to problems

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.800
in terms of undermining
this 2018 election.

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.600
And what is going to happen?

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.400
There are machines
in the United States

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.610
that are paperless, the
electronic machines.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.290
And so I think
there's a lot of work

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.120
that needs to be done in that.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.284
So we need to have the
checks and balances work.

00:55:00.284 --> 00:55:01.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.991
and speaking to us today.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.650
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.510
So I have to say--

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.500
believe me, I know I'm in the
great state of Washington.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:22.070
Let me just say that I came
here for the first time,

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.790
as I said, to the
United States in 1948.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.180
My father was a professor
at the University of Denver.

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.600
And in the summer
of 1950, he came

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.680
to teach at the
University of Washington.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.700
So I was here in 1950.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.930
And it was fantastic.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.390
And I've come back
many times since.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:46.370
And my daughter, who was a
public defender when they moved

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:50.750
here from the other Washington
where she had been defending

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.270
rapists and robbers.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.610
And she called and said,
"mom"-- she was in Snohomish.

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.860
And she said,
"Mom, I'm defending

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.500
somebody who molested salmon."

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.060
But this is a fabulous state.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.362
And I'm delighted to be here.

00:56:07.362 --> 00:56:08.570
The salmon are feeling great.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.470
Thank you all very much.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.220
AUDIENCE: There are still
some books for sale.
