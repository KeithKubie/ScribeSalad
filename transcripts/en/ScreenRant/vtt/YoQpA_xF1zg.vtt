00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.960
At this point, it honestly seems like every
actor in the world has made his or her way

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.070
into a Marvel movie at one point or another.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.070
Between the X-Men franchise, the ever-expanding
MCU and independent Marvel hits like Deadpool,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.070
there is no shortage of roles available for
willing actors.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.411
For this video, we are taking a look at some
actors who were almost in Marvel movies, but

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:23.110
ultimately missed out.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.939
Here is our list of 10 Actors Who Were Close
To Being A Marvel Superhero.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.830

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.930
Emily Blunt – Black Widow
For years there have been rumors swirling

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.150
about Emily Blunt finally joining the Marvel
Cinematic Universe, but as of now – she

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.180
still hasn’t.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.899
The closest that the Edge Of Tomorrow actress
ever came was when they were casting the role

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.019
of Black Widow.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.149
Both Blunt and Marvel wanted her for the role
and plans were already in motion for her to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.460
debut as the character in Iron Man 2.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Unfortunately she was contractually obligated
to turn it down and instead work on the regrettable

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.080
movie, Gulliver’s Travels.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.220
Lucky for Marvel fans, Scarlett Johansson
is fantastic as Black Widow, but we’re sure

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.940
people still wonder what it would have been
like if Emily Blunt had kept it.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.860
Jake Gyllenhaal – Spiderman
The story of Jake Gyllenhaal almost becoming

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.661
Spiderman is definitely a weird one, as this
casting almost happened for Spiderman 2, when

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:29.360
Tobey Maguire had already played the titular
hero in the original movie.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.500
Gyllenhaal was seriously considered for the
role due to the fact that Maguire had actually

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
seriously injured his back while filming Seabiscuit.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.290
The studio was unsure that Maguire would be
able to reprise the role of Spidey, and Gyllenhaal

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.630
seemed to be their answer.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.160
In the end, Tobey Maguire and the filmmakers
were able to work out a plan and Jake Gyllenhaal

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.270
was let go.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.860
This re-casting would have definitely been
unique, but we are happy it didn’t happen.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.000
Liam Hemsworth – Thor
But wait, isn’t Liam the brother of Chris

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.710
Hemsworth, who actually plays Thor?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.850
That’s right, before Chris landed the role
of the Asgardian God it was actually his younger

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.420
brother Liam who was the front-runner to wield
the hammer.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.610
The even crazier thing is that the studio’s
second choice after Liam was none other than

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.030
Tom Hiddleston, who of course plays Loki in
the film.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.840
Somehow Chris was able to convince the studio
heads that he was the right Hemsworth for

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
the job.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.540
We think that his Thor-like blonde hair and
incredible physique definitely helped his

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.239
cause in beating out his brother for the part.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.719
Tom Cruise – Iron Man
Robert Downey Jr is absolutely iconic as Tony

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:42.349
Stark in the MCU, but it turns out that RDJ
wasn’t actually the first choice for the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.349
role.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.959
Years before the world ever got to see Iron
Man, the studio was actually targeting a different

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.349
leading man, Tom Cruise.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.430
In the mid 2000’s Cruise was a true superstar,
whereas Downey Jr was somewhat of a black

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.480
listed actor.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.370
The studio tried to secure Cruise for the
role, but the actor finally decided to pass

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.410
on the part.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.560
This is the definition of a blessing in disguise
as RDJ’s Iron Man has been the most important

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680
and iconic character in the entire MCU.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680
Russell Crowe – Wolverine
Russell Crowe has a pretty stack filmography

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680
with roles in movies ranging from Gladiator
to Les Miserables.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680
The actor has even played a part in DC’s
Man Of Steel as Jor-El, but one thing Crowe

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680
is yet to do is star in a Marvel movie.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
As it turns out, Crowe almost made his Marvel
movie debut back in 2000 as he was actually

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680
in talks to play Wolverine in the X-men movie
before the filmmakers decided to go with Hugh

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Jackman.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
Looking back it’s hard to imagine anyone
but Jackman in the iconic role and it’s

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
hard to know how Crowe would have done.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680
One thing is for sure, if he had taken on
the role of Wolverine, he would have had to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.680
whip his body into much better shape!

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680
Ronda Rousey – Captain Marvel
Ronda Rousey is one of the most famous MMA

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680
fighters of all time and with her incredible
physique and fighting ability she’s somewhat

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
of a real world superhero.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.719
Rousey doesn’t have an extensive acting
history, but she has made it known that she

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.810
would be interested in adding a Marvel role
to her filmography.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.400
When Marvel announced that they would be making
a Captain Marvel movie, Rousey was sure to

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.819
let it be known that she would be all in for
playing the titular character.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.579
Unfortunately for the fighter, Marvel has
announced that Brie Larson will be taking

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.680
on the role but that doesn’t mean that Rousey
can’t land a Marvel role some time in the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
future.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.189
John Boyega – Black Panther
Along with Daisy Ridley, John Boyega is right

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.739
at the helm of the new Star Wars trilogy and
with the success of 2015’s The Force Awakens,

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.489
Boyega truly became a worldwide star seemingly
over night.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.080
When Marvel announced that it would be making
a Black Panther movie, reports started surfacing

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.750
that Boyega would be joining the cast.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.620
Unfortunately, the actor shut down these rumors
but he did let people know that he actually

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.209
wanted to play the T’Challa before Marvel
decided to cast Chadwick Boseman.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:22.470
Boyega is a young and rising star so it wouldn’t
surprise us if he ended up in a Marvel movie

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.500
at some point.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.740
John Krasinski – Captain America
Other than Iron Man, Captain America is the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.990
biggest star in the MCU and Chris Evans has
been brilliant in the role for years.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.160
It’s hard to imagine someone else throwing
Cap’s shield but it turns out the funny

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.360
man John Krasinski actually nearly landed
the role.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.639
Marvel has keen on Krasinski and even had
him screen test with the suit on, but in the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.340
end they decided to take the casting in a
different direction.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.300
Krasinski has been a good sport about the
decision and has even joked about losing his

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
spot in the MCU to men with better bodies.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.250
These days, Krasinski is looking pretty ripped
to we wouldn’t be surprised to see him in

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:42.949
a super suit some time soon.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.479
Johnny Depp – Doctor Strange
Marvel’s 2016 magical superhero movie, Doctor

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.770
Strange, was a critical and box office hit
and Benedict Cumberbatch brought some serious

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.440
acting chops to the lead role.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.669
Cumberbatch looks like he is here to stay
but it is pretty common knowledge that he

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.289
was not Marvel’s first choice for the character.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.330
Studio heads were actually very keen on casting
Johnny Depp in the role in hopes that he would

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.340
bring his quirky character acting skills to
the MCU.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.110
On top of Depp, the studio heads were also
heavily considering Joaquin Phoenix for the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.270
titular role.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.810
In the end, both Depp and Phoenix turned down
the offer and Marvel was stuck offering the

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.139
role to Cumberbatch.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.449
Margot Robbie – Fantastic 4
In the summer of 2016, the whole world fell

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.880
in love with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn
in the DCEU movie, Suicide Squad.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.280
There is no denying that she is absolutely
perfect in the part, but some fans may not

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.009
know that she almost played a very different
superhero movie character.

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.060
When Marvel was planning to reboot Fantastic
Four, the filmmakers wanted Robbie for the

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.680
role of Sue Storm.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.410
After disliking the script, Margot Robbie
decided to pass on the role and hold out for

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.250
a comic book movie role that suited her better.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.789
She’s probably very happy with her decision
as Fantastic Four was an absolute nightmare

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:03.689
and although Suicide Squad was met with very
mixed reviews, her Harley Quinn was a hit!

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.830
So there you have it, there’s our list of
10 actors who were close to being a Marvel

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.830
superhero.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.939
