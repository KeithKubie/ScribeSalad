00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
The last part about human resources are qualified employees

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.890
and the culture you set for your company.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.400
Qualified employees are the difference between a good idea

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.710
that never went anywhere and a billion dollar firm.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.330
It gets a million times but it's very true.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.040
A employees in a B market will always win over B employees in an A market.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.450
Hopefully, your A employees in an A market and you'll be figuring out where

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.290
to put the bags of money, but you want to always hire people better than you,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.650
and if that's threatening to you as a founder or if that's threatening to any of your employees,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.070
the system kind of collapses from there.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.880
You want people who actually can see farther than you or have skills deeper than you,

00:00:40.880 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's the sign of a world-class founder.
