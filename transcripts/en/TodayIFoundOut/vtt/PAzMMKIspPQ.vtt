00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:16.430
The infamous McDonald’s “Hot Coffee”
legal battle is considered by many to be a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.250
premier example of a frivolous lawsuit.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.660
The general story is often told that a woman
named Stella Liebeck visited a McDonald’s

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.110
drive-thru and purchased a cup of coffee.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.010
She then drove away with the coffee sitting
between her legs while also removing the lid.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.290
That combination caused coffee to spill all
over her lap.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.130
The resulting burns allowed her to file suit
and win almost $3 million from McDonald’s.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.250
While that oft’ repeated version makes for
an entertaining story, it is a bit removed

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.130
from what really happened and why Liebeck
managed to win the case.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.559
Stella Liebeck was seventy-nine years old
in February of 1992 when she and her grandson

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.679
went through the drive-thru at a McDonald’s
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.800
The retired store clerk sat in the passenger
seat of her grandson’s car when she bought

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.530
a coffee, and he parked the car in the restaurant’s
parking lot so she could add sugar and cream

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.640
to her drink with the car stopped.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.810
Liebeck held the cup between her legs (the
Ford Probe she was in did not have cup holders)

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.159
while removing the lid, and the cup slipped.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.229
It spilled coffee later estimated to be between
180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit all over her

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.229
legs and groin.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.520
Her sweatpants absorbed the extremely hot
coffee and kept it against her skin, worsening

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.000
the injury.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.390
The result was third-degree burns over 6%
of her body and other burns on an additional

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.460
10%.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.979
She spent eight days in the hospital to treat
the burns to her genitals, legs, and butt.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.350
During that time, she lost 20% of her body
weight (bringing her down to 83 pounds) and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.970
she had to endure skin grafts and a procedure
where doctors remove dead tissue from a wound,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.970
known as debridement.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.390
The burns also left her with significant scars
and partially disabled for two years.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.119
When Liebeck first contacted McDonald’s
to let them know what had happened, she asked

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.899
for them to cover the cost of her medical
bills.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.030
She reportedly wanted around $11,000.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.119
McDonald’s felt that because they really
had nothing to do with how the coffee was

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.630
spilled, they shouldn’t be liable, but did
offer her a payment of $800.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.600
She refused their counteroffer and hired an
attorney.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.080
Texas attorney Reed Morgan agreed to take
on Liebeck’s case.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.230
This happened to be Morgan’s second time
facing off against McDonald’s over hot coffee.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.460
Years earlier, he represented woman from Houston
who also received third-degree burns from

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.790
McDonald’s coffee.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.290
That case was settled out of court with the
plaintiff receiving $27,500 in damages.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.040
These two cases were not the only ones McDonald’s
had to deal with concerning the scalding temperature

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040
of its coffee.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.170
Between 1982 and 1992, the fast food giant
received more than 700 reports of coffee burning

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.510
customers and paid over $500,000 to settle
coffee-related lawsuits.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.150
A number of the reported injuries bore a striking
resemblance to those suffered by Liebeck,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.270
including many instances of third-degree burns.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.940
Morgan offered to settle the case before it
went to trial for the sum of $300,000, but

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.320
McDonald’s legal team again refused.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.960
Both sides also attended mediation ahead of
the jury trial at the judge’s order, and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.270
the mediator recommended McDonald’s pay
Liebeck a settlement of $225,000.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.710
Again, McDonald’s refused.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.330
Why they were being so adamant in this case
and not many other similar ones that occurred

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.250
before isn’t clear.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.970
Some speculate McDonald’s was wanting to
settle the issue once and for all to avoid

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:57.050
having to continue to deal with these frivolous
hot coffee lawsuits, but picking a case where

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.090
a frail, elderly woman who was severely burned
perhaps wasn’t the smartest plan if that

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.510
was their motivation.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.960
Whatever the case, the trial went forward,
lasting seven days in August of 1994.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.450
McDonald’s legal team argued that Liebeck
failed to minimize the chance of injury by

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.530
holding the coffee between her thighs in the
first place and she should have removed her

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.280
sweatpants immediately upon spilling the coffee.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.949
They also stated that they’d have to lower
the temperature of the coffee to unpalatable

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.360
levels to completely eliminate the risk of
such spill burns.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.700
third degree burnsLiebeck’s crew fired back
that at 190 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.560
around which McDonald’s serves its coffee
at, it takes only about three seconds to produce

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.060
third-degree burns, and that lowering the
temperature to 160 degrees would be much safer,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.919
needing about 20 seconds to cause similar
third degree burns.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.509
(It should be noted that the latter estimates
presented by Liebeck’s team do not line

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:58.800
up with data from the American Burn Association,
see chart from them to the right.)

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.960
Testimony from a McDonald’s quality control
manager, Chris Appleton, when questioned by

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.800
Liebeck’s attorney, Reed Morgan, revealed
he knew, of course, that coffee served at

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.669
those temperatures was dangerous.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.389
“Q: [Y]ou know, as a matter of fact, that
coffee is a hazard, selling it at 180 to 190

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.900
degrees, don’t you?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.860
A: I have testified before, the fact that
this coffee can cause burns.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.029
Q: It is hazardous at this temperature?

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.549
A: At that high temperature the coffee is
a hazard.”

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:32.740
Appleton then stated customers could not safely
drink the coffee within the first few minutes

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.740
of receiving it without cooling measures.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.740
He was also on the receiving end of Morgan’s
questioning when the lawyer drove home the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.340
company’s neglect for safety when they refused
to change their procedures.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.530
“Q: … I’m curious because I’ve shown
you recordations here of some 700 people here

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.470
that have been burned [by McDonald’s coffee].

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.610
Obviously, to you 700 people burned is not
a significantly high enough number to turn

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.610
down the heat.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.860
Do you have in mind a number of how many people
would have to be burned for you to become

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.720
so concerned that you would insist that burn
specialists be consulted and something be

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.409
done to sell this coffee at a lower temperature?

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.219
A: No, I don’t have a number in mind.”

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.800
Appleton also stated that the company had
no intention of changing its coffee temperature

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.420
policies, despite what happened to Liebeck
and others before her, stating, “There are

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.449
more serious dangers in restaurants.”

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.710
Another witness for McDonald’s, engineer
P. Robert Knaff, noted that the number of

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.419
injuries was statistically insignificant when
measured against the annual sale of billions

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.729
of cups of coffee.

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.690
Though unequivocally true on all counts, being
seemingly nonchalant about injuries to customers

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.360
was really the heart of why McDonald’s lost
this otherwise frivolous lawsuit, at least

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.879
according to interviews with some of the jurors
after the fact.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:51.199
As juror Jerry Goens noted, before the case,
he thought it somewhat silly and that he “wasn’t

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.479
convinced as to why I needed to be there to
settle a coffee spill.”

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.580
Over the course of the trial, however, the
jurors’ opinions changed, not so much because

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.180
of what happened to Liebeck or the circumstances
of the specific case, but, as one of the jurors,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.830
Jack Elliot, noted, the seemingly “callous
disregard for the safety of the people”

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.210
that McDonald’s exhibited in the case.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.870
Another juror noted, “there was a person
behind every number and I don’t think the

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.809
corporation was attaching enough importance
to that.”

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:22.191
Presumably making such claims like that if
Liebeck wasn’t so old, this wouldn’t have

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:26.460
been as much of a problem (with her burns
likely being less severe if she had the skin

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.059
of a younger person, according to McDonald’s)
didn’t help the company out in this regard.

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:36.009
The jury spent little time deciding that McDonald’s
was liable for Liebeck’s injures.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:42.089
They initially awarded her $200,000 for her
injuries, but reduced that number to $160,000

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:46.900
after deciding Liebeck bore 20% of the responsibility
for the incident.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.080
Then they awarded her punitive damages, or
damages used to send a message to the party

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.930
responsible, in the amount of an additional
$2.7 million.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.369
The jurors came to the $2.7 million figure
after determining, by their estimate, McDonald’s

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:05.699
was selling approximately $1.35 million worth
of coffee each day, and the award should be

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:08.509
equivalent to two days of coffee sales for
the company.

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:13.099
However, Liebeck didn’t actually get anywhere
near that amount of money, at least as far

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:14.610
as public record goes.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.830
The judge in the case reduced the punitive
damages to $480,000, bringing the total judgement

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.659
down to $640,000.

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:26.249
Both sides appealed the decision, but their
appeals were never heard as they agreed to

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:31.500
an undisclosed settlement during mediation,
thought to have been under $600,000.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.250
The verdict and case actually kind of worked
out for McDonald’s.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.680
Public opinion over the matter almost wholly
sided with McDonald’s, a rare thing for

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.039
such “little guy vs. corporation” type
cases.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.750
And now the whole country, and beyond, was
discussing and defending McDonald’s and

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.600
noting the fact that McDonald’s was a place
you could get a cheap, piping hot, cup of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
coffee.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.860
So did anything change as a result of the
verdict?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860
Not really.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.900
One change that did happen was that McDonald’s
and other companies began putting large warning

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.800
labels on their hot beverages to warn consumers
that, well, they’re hot.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.720
They did not, however, seem to reduce the
temperature of their coffee, nor have other

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.839
coffee vendors, with the industry standard
still typically being to brew coffee at around

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:19.589
200 degrees Fahrenheit and sell it around
180 degrees Fahrenheit or so, give or take

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:20.589
ten degrees.

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:24.190
It turns out, customers actually prefer many
types of coffee hot…

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.790
As such, to avoid similar frivolous lawsuits
as much as possible, the solution has largely

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.110
been the development of better container designs
to minimize the risk of spilling the scalding

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:49.880
liquid in the first place.
