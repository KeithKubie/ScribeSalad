TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.575
for "The Developer Show,"
coming to you from the Firebase

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:05.010
Summit in Prague.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.780
Now all the sessions are
recorded and available online,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.110
but that's a ton of content
to sift through if you just

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.100
want the highlights.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.300
So here you are, the
Firebase Summit top five.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.000
First on the list is
deploying to Firebase Hosting

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.340
from Glitch and StackBlitz.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.800
These are two powerful
web-based IDEs.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.070
Now, the demo Rob gave
for this was really cool.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
He loaded up a project on Glitch
and added a firebase.json file.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.252
The Deploy to Firebase
button just appeared,

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:33.960
and he clicked it and
selected a project.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.780
And just like that, his Glitch
project was running in Prague.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.680
Now these integrations are
both based on the new Firebase

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.950
Management API, which
lets you create and manage

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.450
Firebase projects and apps.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.810
Second on our list is
enterprise-grade support

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.190
for helping large and complex
enterprises adopt Firebase.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.380
If you already use Firebase's
free support, don't worry,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.990
it's not going away.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.570
This actually adds
support for Firebase

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.180
to Google Cloud
Platform support.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.700
So if you already have a
paid GCP support package,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.260
Firebase is now included.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.820
They're ramping
up now with plans

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
to launch in beta by end of
year and general availability

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.020
early next year.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.210
OK, number three.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.310
Firebase Predictions
has graduated out

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.890
of beta and into general
availability, which

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.310
means it's fully stable and
available for production use.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.860
For those who don't remember,
Firebase Predictions

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.070
applies machine learning
to your analytics data

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.040
to create dynamic user
groups based on your users'

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.810
predicted behavior.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.080
So you can do things like
segment users based on churn

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.150
or likelihood to spend.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.940
Also announced today was
that predictions data,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.090
along with Firebase Cloud
Messaging and A/B testing data,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.720
can be exported to BigQuery
so you can run your own custom

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
analysis of your data and
join it with other data sets.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.750
Also graduating to
general availability

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
is number four on our list,
Firebase Test Lab for iOS.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.160
Now, Firebase Test Lab is
cloud-based app testing,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.610
and it's pretty awesome.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.550
You can test an
Android or iOS app

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.100
across a bunch of devices
and configurations,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.460
and then see logs, videos, and
screenshots in the Firebase

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.600
console.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.320
Derek mentioned today that
nearly 100,000 successful tests

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.720
have been run over the
last several months, which

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.780
along with a few other factors,
like support for iOS 12,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.720
is a great indication of
it being stable and ready

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.550
for production use.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.070
Last on our list, and
one of my favorites,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.220
is a new Face Contours API.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.560
It's part of ML Kit,
which means it's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.360
meant to be easy and accessible
for all mobile developers,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.350
whether or not we
have ML experience.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.530
The API is essentially a more
advanced version of the Face

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.620
Detection API, giving
you over 100 points

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.300
in and around the
face, which means

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.820
you can know where things
like the face contour are,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.190
the eyes, eyebrows, the mouth,
where all of them are located,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.830
which can be super
useful for apps

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.870
that want to have advanced
filters that center

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.780
around the person or
people in the photo.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.767
All right, that's it, our top
five at the Firebase Summit.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.850
Of course, there were a
lot of other announcements

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.690
and updates, so links to the
full keynote and session videos

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.260
are in the description below.

Deal?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.620

and I'll see you next time.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.632

and I'm going to see
you in the next take.
