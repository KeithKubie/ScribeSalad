RICH HYNDMAN: Hi there and
welcome to this week's Android

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.500
Developer Office Hours.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.950
One day late, but brought to
you from the usual place in

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.060
our studio in London.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.686
Today I'm Richard Hyndman, I'm
always Richard Hyndman, and

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.390
I'm joined by,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.060
STEPHAN LINZNER: Stephan
Linzner.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.950
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.530
RICH HYNDMAN: So the reason
that this is a day late is

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.890
because Chris is just
running a bit slow.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.960
That's fine.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.690
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.420
RICH HYNDMAN: As normal, we
won't be discussing roadmap

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.130
stuff that's not been
preannounced, but we will be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.280
talking about Android
development topics.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.040
Thank you to all the people
in the Hangout

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.150
that joined us today.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.950
That's quite a quick
introduction.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.500
CHRIS BANES: No one.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.360
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh no, there we
go, someone's joined us.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.520
We are now officially live.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520
We have a viewer.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.790
NICK BUTCHER: But as usual we
are prioritizing questions

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.770
asked in the moderator
beforehand.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.560
RICH HYNDMAN: There's Andrew
Kelly just to watch all these

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.370
questions come through.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910
Some of the things that have
happened this week, Mobile

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.140
World Congress was
on this week.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.450
Over in Barcelona.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.570
HTC announced the One.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.660
CHRIS BANES: Very nice
looking device it is.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.060
RICH HYNDMAN: It means the HTC
One X is now the X HTC One,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.700
and the HTC One is
the new HTC One?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.366
No, OK, that doesn't work.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.616
NICK BUTCHER: Pivot on.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.020
RICH HYNDMAN: But it
does look nice.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.310
Previously, I'd heard about
five-inch 1080p screens and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.120
thought maybe it was
a bit much, but a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.180
4.7 inch 1080p screen.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.850
I really trust HDC for their
screen quality as well, from

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.970
the One X and other devices.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.180
Their screens are
pretty awesome.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.650
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, their device
quality, the hardware

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.730
quality's always
been very good.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh my god,
someone's discovered metal as

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.430
well, haven't they?

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.660
It's an Android manufacturer
making a device out of metal.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.055
And so I'm quite excited to go
see the HTC One at some point.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.920
I haven't got my hands
on one yet.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.260
Anyone know the shipping date?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.760
STEPHAN LINZNER: No.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760
NICK BUTCHER: March sometime.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.690
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, it's soon.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.900
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm quite
looking forward to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.500
seeing one of those.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.750
That will be kind of cool.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.110
NICK BUTCHER: Add a whole load
of five-inch 1080p things.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.270
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.220
RICH HYNDMAN:Yeah, plenty of
five-inch 1080p things.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.510
Which I'm sure some screen
manufacturer's doing trade.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.720
You can trade in those.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.830
Google Play Services.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.610
We had an update to
that this week.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.080
Major update to Google
Play Services.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.260
Now we have your Google+
Sign-In.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.240
Anyone had a chance to
look through the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.425
Google+ Sign-In stuff?

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.025
No?

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.910
I've seen the Google Play
services demo from the +Team

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.735
that they're doing.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:15.960
It seems pretty simple.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.305
You can just request the
authentication details, and it

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.050
comes up with a nice white
dialog saying, this user would

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.830
like access to your whatever.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.140
NICK BUTCHER: You guys put it
on your website saying,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.340
install the app.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.840
Be like one click right
from your website.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.930
I think that's pretty--

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.180
RICH HYNDMAN: That is really
nice, that button that we have

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.820
in Play Store, the
install button.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.380
If they're logged in--

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.760
is it if they're logged
in to Google+?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.380
If they're logged
in to Chrome?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.990
Just Google+?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.010
NICK BUTCHER: If you've
got a session open.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.100
RICH HYNDMAN: If you've
got a session open.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.575
That install button will work on
your website, and you just

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.000
have to-- boom--

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.350
straight on to the
Android device.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.240
That is kind of cool.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.470
And I've seen a lot
of those around.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.506
NICK BUTCHER: The deep linking
is quite cool as well.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.958
So you can share links to
specific parts within the

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.105
application.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.080
Which is pretty cool.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.190
RICH HYNDMAN: And Maps
got updates as well.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.820
Maps v2 got some updates
as well.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.820
Maybe fixes--

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.450
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
bug fixes.--

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.560

those changes available via

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.810

now the Chrome Office Hours,

have to close it and

everything and make it open.

Andrew Case's [? evening? ?]

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.340
Unless anyone in the Hangout has
a question for us, we'll

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.590
dive straight into
that moderator.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.490
Four people got in.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.550
STEPHAN LINZNER: There was a
question on the uiautomator

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.680
where somebody is having
a part problem.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.040
When he calls the message says,
"horizontal list." On

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.870
4.1, actually I think this
should not happen, but please

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.860
provide us with more
information.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.490
Maybe your manifest,
maybe some code.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.519
We need more information
to come back at you.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.860
It looks like it should
work on 4.0 and 4.2.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Huh.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.634
Has anyone used uiautomator
yet?

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:25.076
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:25.960
It's on my to-do list.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.590
STEPHAN LINZNER: I've played
around with it a little bit.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.420
It's actually quite nice.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.370
But I think this should
really work on 4.1.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.040
I don't see why there should be
a restriction on 4.1 when

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.290
it's working on 4.2.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.170
Send us more information, and
we'll try to help you.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.130
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.030
raise a bug on b.android.com.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.290
RICH HYNDMAN: Tools.android.com?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.100
CHRIS BANES: I guess,
try that.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.130
And yeah, [INAUDIBLE] going
to help you on there.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.990
Sorry.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.410
So--

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.930
STEPHAN LINZNER: We have another
question regarding how

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.820
you can identify your users.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.010
There actually was a blog
post from Tim Bray

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.930
like one year ago.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.850
I think you're good off if
you're just going in there and

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.810
looking at what he suggests.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.765
Basically what he's saying
is to create a UUID.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.740
When you install the
application, just basically

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.670
create a UUID and maintain
this UUID.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.030
Of course, you will also see
that he will refer to using

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.150
things like you mentioned.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.070
Like secure Android ID, and the
calling gets a device ID,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.580
and other things, but those
have major drawbacks.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.750
But just look at the post, and I
think you will find the best

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.305
solution for your requirement.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.440
RICH HYNDMAN: If people wonder
why I keep looking down and

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.490
typing away again, we're
indexing this week's show

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.380
again, so I'm just putting
a little note

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.820
next to each question.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.530
So in the YouTube comments later
on, the YouTube video

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.730
makes more sense.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.840
People can flip through to the
most appropriate part.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.940
CHRIS BANES: So you got a
question from Kite Surfer, who

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.410
asks, how can I install
an image view

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.160
globally from his theme?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.580
His application theme.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.275
"My designer wants these margins
everywhere, how do I

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:25.950
do this easily?"

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.770
Well, there's no sort
of built-in,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.680
standard way to do this.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.850
Not like ListView which has
ListView style in it's--

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.020
the global theme.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.010
So you're going to have to do
it yourself, basically.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.795
So you can either create a style
and then reference that

00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:44.620
style in [? XML. ?]

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.625
A quick way I thought of doing
it was to create a custom

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:50.710
issue and then overload the
constructor to always pass in

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.960
your style.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.880
That's probably the quickest way
of doing it, but there's

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.580
no built-in framework way.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.190
RICH HYNDMAN: So if you wanted
one style of imagery across

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.744
your whole application, it makes
a lot of sense to have

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:04.750
you write apps.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.350
STEPHAN LINZNER: But there is no
definition in a theme, and

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.130
you cannot refer to [? repair ?]
in that field.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.480
So you have to do it like
Chris just suggested.

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:20.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Indeed.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.680
If you go all the way and then

RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

GIUSEPPE: Well, the first one
is that in my Eclipse IDE

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.600
disappeared from the Google
menu add native support.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.430
Anyone have experience
with that?

the last bit.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.440
GIUSEPPE: Using the
ADT of Android in

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.170
Eclipse, you have a menu.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.310
When you click right under your
projects, then you have

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:35.789
an Android menu, and then there
is add native support.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.409
From my menu this
has disappeared.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.360
I don't have it any more.

Well, I don't have a coding
machine site with me here

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.370
unfortunately.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.340
CHRIS BANES: I didn't even know
what the native support

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.750
option did.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.010

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.140
CHRIS BANES: I wonder if that
only happens if you've got the

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.880

in Eclipse?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.500
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, everything
is [INAUDIBLE]

everything works well.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.470
I have many applications with
the native support.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.240
But something needs a 21 update,
that Tor released last

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.550
week, then there is
this problem.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.590
Just asking if someone has the
same problem, if there is not,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.170
I will find it myself.

to Tor directly.

that same

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.190
issue just out of interest?

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.210
YOSSI: I just checked it.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.310

path for the Eclipse?

from the menu.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.270
Disappeared just for
a few projects.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:00.140
For example, in my left side I
have 20 projects 10 of them, I

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:08.220
have this menu, and other
10, there is none.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.720
Very strange.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:15.650
And I don't know why, starting
with this update, the

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:24.410
StrictMode starts to throw a
strange exception on SQL

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.210
Database open.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.410
Saying that the database is open
when this is not true.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.980
If you're out of the StrictMode,
and then you try

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.810
to close your cursor, then the
database, and then the

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.520
connection, you will see
that the StrictMode

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.280
will throw an exception.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.400
This didn't happen before.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.925
YOSSI: To the second issue,
you're using begin transaction

00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:54.480
and end transaction?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.280
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.206
YOSSI: On all the database
methods?

00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:00.520
GIUSEPPE: No.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.060
CHRIS BANES: The StrictMode
is in framework isn't it?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.670
So that would be to do with
your device [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.260
GIUSEPPE: Let me confirm again
that this happened only

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:15.040
starting the revision
21 of the ADT.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.310
On the 20, this didn't happen.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.890
RICH HYNDMAN: This shouldn't
be part of ADT where the

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.140
StrictMode is.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.010
GIUSEPPE: Nothing to do with
the StrictMode, I know.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.435
RICH HYNDMAN: Are you having the
issue on all devices that

00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:29.870
you test it on, or just
one or two devices?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.110
GIUSEPPE: No, all devices.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.210
If I open a simple connection,
then I open the cursor.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.710
I redo the cursor, close the
cursor, close the connection,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.700
close the database, and then
change the activity, and then

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.960
this throws the exception.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.510
Very simple code, a few lines.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.470
RICH HYNDMAN: How much
exception is it?

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.910
GIUSEPPE: It says, you are
closing an activity that has

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.650
an open connection with
database, or something like

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.900
that approximately.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.210
YOSSI: Have you tried
using CursorLoader?

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.210
GIUSEPPE: No.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.175
I didn't try.

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:13.620

standard mode.

using a simple SQL helper.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.880
RICH HYNDMAN: I wonder how
StrictMode is tracking that,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.060
whether it's waiting for the
garbage collection to clear up

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.230
the database before it realizes
that the activity no

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.300
longer has it open.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.360
I don't know what StrictMode
is using.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.080
GIUSEPPE: The problem of the
garbage collector was when you

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.120
use the provider.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.970
When you use the provider to
connect to the database, then

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.467
you don't have to close any
cursor because the provider

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:46.560
takes charge of closing
everything.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.000
But in the case of a simple
code, you open the connection,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.910
you open the cursor, you close
it, and then why is the

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.820
StrictMode is throwing
this exception?

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.360

And then there is also
a second question.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:48.230
Is there any way to use a

that I know of.

You can check Stack Overflow

STEPHAN LINZNER: There
is a DexClassLoader.

and you can--

GIUSEPPE: With the
DexClassLoader, I can load

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.230
Java library.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.790
I am talking about .so library,
native library.

trying to do inside

of doing it.

And then the user would have
to install the extra--

GIUSEPPE: I would like to ask
if you can repeat the answer

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.030
because I lost the connection.

is how most video

You have the video player and
then other sort of plug-ins

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:48.790
you can install which give you
CPU-specific binaries.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.490
So you can create another
application.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.330
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, but the user
will have two applications.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.160
In that case, this
is a solution.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.100
But to use this, my
application and

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.630
my application codec?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.080
Codec one, codec two.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.430
It's not very good
for the user.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.090
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, but the other
side of it's quite a bit

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.560

can just download--

I think that--

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.280
CHRIS BANES: I can't think
of a way to do it,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.630
and I doubt you can.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.286
NICK BUTCHER: You can't just
download and open it?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.726
RICH HYNDMAN: Not from the data
directory apparently.

00:15:31.726 --> 00:15:34.680
Not if it wasn't bundled
inside the application.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.440
GIUSEPPE: Because there is one
of our applications that uses

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.010
some codec for special things.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.630
But not all of the
users need it.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.390
The codec [? weight ?]
is upwards 10

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.910
megabytes for each processor.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.830
So if I wanted to take care of
everybody, everybody must have

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.460
an application larger
than 50 megabytes,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.030
and that's not good.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.525
So if you needed a function,
then you download the codec.

00:16:01.525 --> 00:16:05.670
But I was finding some
way to download a new

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.350
package, a new IPK.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.630
Just looking if I can download
myself, unzip the file, and

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.195
then load using the system
load for example.

00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:15.630
But I tried it myself.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.440
There is no way because
say that

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.976
prompted for no execution.

00:16:21.976 --> 00:16:24.050
Correct?

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.710
RICH HYNDMAN: Correct.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.280
CHRIS BANES: Because the thing
is when you install the

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.030
application and the framework
just doesn't--

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.300
I can't remember
specifically--

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.700
but links against the
system libraries.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.520
And it does lots of specific
stuff with that.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.580
So if the libraries you're
linked against, the ones that

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.860
run the device, it will
do some special stuff.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.240
I can't remember
the specifics.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.190
So it's all tied in to install
applications, so the framework

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.670
needs to do stuff.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.110
So you can't really just
download library space.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.640
GIUSEPPE: You know what
personally, this is in my

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.320
opinion, and then later I leave
the space and allow

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.560
other people to speak?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.089
My opinion is that it's very
bad to see that application

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.000
that uses a root system.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.569
They are able to write
in the data folder.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.869
They are able to load from the
data folder of this library.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.480
They have concept logic better
than an application that

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.079
doesn't use the root.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.720
RICH HYNDMAN: Of course.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.580
There's a lot of things that
root access would make it a

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.280
lot easier for you.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.210
But it's a worse security
hole OK.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.320
We don't actually have
answers for those

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.260
questions right now though.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.000
I'm sorry, Giuseppe.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.500
Hopefully when you ping the
Tools Team, you'll find out

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.390
some of the answers.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.990
CHRIS BANES: There's
quite a lot of chat

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.370
going on in the window.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.700
RICH HYNDMAN: There is.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.030
I can't read any of the
chat in the window.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.160
RICH HYNDMAN: So have we got
another question from the

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.234
moderator we can jump into?

00:17:52.234 --> 00:17:54.420
And then I'll take one from
the G+ Stream after that.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.100
NICK BUTCHER: Lyndon just asked
in the comments, Lyndon

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.610
Darling asks, how does he get
into the pure Android?

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.850
So that's generally as a result
of going through the

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.820
App Clinic and Android Designer
Action process.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.010
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.930
is the way to go there.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.912
Do suggest new topics if your
app doesn't fall into one of

00:18:15.912 --> 00:18:16.170
the topics.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.900
Or if it does fall into one of
the topics already suggested,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.390
then make it clear that you are
the developer, and you're

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.430
self nominating, because we
do totally prefer those.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.810
I think the bitly link is broken
so you can't go to

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.090
bit.ly/appclinic.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.800
If you just Google for Android
App Clinic, try to

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.310
fix it at first hit.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.650
RICH HYNDMAN: I might have
to do that myself.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.220
I want to be pure Android.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.880
I'm straining to read that
bar at the side.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.520
Actually, talking about that,
someone's put in the comments,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.156
they would like to know why we
went from a surface view to a

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:48.910
custom view on the Ultimate
Stopwatch and what the

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.250
performance benefits were
and why we did it.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.670
Generally the surface views on
Android have always been a

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.593
hole punched through your UI
layers and then rendered on

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.410
the very top as a canvas.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.340
They've never been hardware
accelerated.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.890
So if you were using surface
views, you got a lot of

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.220
flexibility, but you missed out
on all the hotness that

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.324
was introduced with the hardware
acceleration 3, 3.4,

00:19:08.324 --> 00:19:09.574
4.1, and 4.2.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.300
It actually didn't
take long at all.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.264
I'd been putting it off for
ages, but it didn't take long

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:17.800
at all to convert from a surface
view to a custom view.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.920
And now I've done a whole load
of benchmarking on it, and

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.890
frame redraws have gone down
from like 45 miliseconds to

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.250
one millisecond now.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.780
So there's other things
in the way.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.820
I'm using the Vsync
as suggested by--

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.110
was it Sue who chimed in saying
I should use Vsync?

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.610
I think it was.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.790
So it's limiting it at 60 frames
a second, and it easily

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.130
manages it with the hardware
acceleration But even on non

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.780
hardware accelerated devices,
because a whole load of new

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.430
tools become available to you
once you're doing hardware

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.730
accelerated rendering.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.760
The GPU profiling tools and
that sort of thing have

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.240
managed to optimize it
so it's a lot faster.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.920
Even as a custom view on
Gingerbread than it was on--

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.610
NICK BUTCHER: Do
you use Tracer?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.960
Or OpenGL ES?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.180
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm not
using OpenGL.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.450
RICH HYNDMAN: No I just use
the tools inside developer

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.660
options on here.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.360
Turning on overdraws and
that sort of thing.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.900
And CPU profiling
and overdraws.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.010
And it turned out that I had
a white background on my

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.040
[? Geo Pager ?] that was being
drawn every frame, which you

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.470
couldn't see, and there was
another white background

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.500
somewhere else that was being
drawn every frame.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.570
I took a few of those out, and
it halved the original times.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.450
Everything turned green.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.860
STEPHAN LINZNER: I think it's
very helpful to use those

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.540
tools because you can
easily optimize.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.870
Because sometimes it's just
a low-hanging fruit.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.630
RICH HYNDMAN: See with that you
have to read through every

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.936
single line of code trying
to optimize it,

00:20:26.936 --> 00:20:28.274
which can be a pain.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.065
NICK BUTCHER: In the comment
thread, Jamie Hybod asks, if

00:20:36.065 --> 00:20:39.610
he has an app that is
distributed via email, will

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.516
his stats appear in the
Developer Console

00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:44.110
for ANRs and so forth?

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.950
I don't think it will, right?

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.525
I think if you have that package
name reserved on the

00:20:48.525 --> 00:20:50.940
Developer Console, you will
still get it, no matter where

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.370
they install it from.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.655
But you have to have
it on the Developer

00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:54.410
Console first, right?

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.800
CHRIS BANES: Yeah if there's
a list in flat package.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:20:59.950
NICK BUTCHER: Back
to the moderator.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.345
RICH HYNDMAN: Where
did you see that?

00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:02.740
Was it on the G+ thread?

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.091
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:04.341
Those were on the comments
on the Hangout thread.

Do we have any moderator
questions we're ready for?

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.540
Using Maps fragments inside of
a ViewPager causes black

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.150
rectangles to be left when
paging, a bit like shearing.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.430
Any tips to avoid this?

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.250
CHRIS BANES: It's the same
thing as what Rich was on

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.640
about earlier.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.340
And Maps actually uses
surface view.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.130
So again, it's a sort of view
punched through the back of

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.480
the window.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.210
There isn't really many
tips you can do.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.150
You can kind of display a view
over the top and kind of block

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:48.950
the flash so it's not
so visually obvious.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.310
Other than that, it's just the
way it is kind of thing.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.350
If you're having a map view in
a ViewPager, you've got two

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.495
horizontally scrolling items
anyway, so I'd be careful.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.360
There's not much you can do.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.160
You can hide it, but you
can't really fix it.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.530
There's a question in
the chat, actually.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.490
Claudio has asked, "Do you have
any examples of doing

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.670
facial recognition?"

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.910
We have a facial recognition
sample somewhere.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.730
It pulls out eyes, nose,
mouth stuff.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.193
To find facial recognition
actually, it will tell you

00:22:32.193 --> 00:22:34.760
that there's faces in the
picture and how many faces and

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.810
where the various points
on those faces are.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.995
What it won't do is say that
it's Chris Banes, or Stephan

00:22:39.995 --> 00:22:40.410
Linzner, or whatever.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.390
You have to do that bit
with your own eyes.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.210
So by facial recognitions, you
mean the fact that there's

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.080
faces there, or actually
who the faces are?

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.500
"Face recognition" or "facial
recognition" is how--

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Probably
the latter, in

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.880
which case no, I don't.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.420
CHRIS BANES: The class is
called face detector.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.295
But there are a few caveats
to it in that it

00:23:01.295 --> 00:23:02.760
only supports bitmaps.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.690
And it only supports bitmaps
in the format RGB565.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.520
It does not support 888s.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.400
RICH HYNDMAN: It doesn't
do the 888s?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.674
CHRIS BANES: No, it's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:12.030
RICH HYNDMAN: There you go.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.965
Now just wait to see if someone
puts that in the

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.440
So I'll launch that
from the terminal.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.060
Thanks.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.750
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, try that.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.400
If that doesn't work, then
make sure you've got the

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.980
latest version of the
ADT tools as well.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.140
You can download it packaged
up or not.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.665
You'll need the latest version
for Jelly Bean devices anyway.

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:01.620
We've had that question
a few times.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.936
You'll plug the Jelly Bean
device into your computer, and

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:08.220
you run ADB, and it says it's
offline, that's because you

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.630
need the latest version
of ADT tools where the

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.670
secure ADB is included.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.710
And the next time you run ADB
devices you'll see on your

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.960
screen, it says, "Will you allow
debugging from this hex

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.190
code computer?" And when you say
yes, then it switches from

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.660
offline to online.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.150
So if you do see that in ADB,
just make sure you've got the

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.280
latest tools from
tools.android.com.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.530
MALE SPEAKER: Perfect, thanks.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.980
CHRIS BANES: Claudio has put, "I
can detect a face, but not

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.880
which store information for
facial recognition." So you're

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.220
trying to detect individual
faces?

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.540
As in people rather
than faces?

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.120
Face Set detects eyes.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.370
That's the main thing
it detects.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Very handy
for putting glasses

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.940
on pictures of people.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.160
"I detect a face but not which
store information for face

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.030
recognition." Sorry, I still
don't understand, Claudio.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.710
One more shot at elaborating,
we'll have another go.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.900
CHRIS BANES: There's a few
online services that offer

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.150
APIs that you can do
that kind of stuff.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.450
Face.com is one off the
top of my head.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.700
NICK BUTCHER: What
about Facebook?

00:26:24.426 --> 00:26:26.410
CHRIS BANES: That's for what
Andrew Kelly's all about.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.010
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.840
Last three minutes.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.210
RICH HYNDMAN: "Any thoughts
about the background drawable

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.670
defining the minimum size
of views?" Is that

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.920
what you want to happen?

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.440
No.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.787
But you could put an imagery
inside a layout and then wrap

00:26:55.787 --> 00:26:58.196
everything to that content.

00:26:58.196 --> 00:27:02.320
And at least the whole layout
would be minimum size of the

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.080
image, and then you
could import that

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.730
into another layout.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.000
If you wanted to lay out
a hierarchy madness.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.110
CHRIS BANES: Is he trying to say
that he doesn't want it to

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.090
be minimum size?

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Or of course you
can use min width and min

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.680
height on the view and just give
it the number of DPs or

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.970
even pixels of the images, if
you really wanted to do that.

it happens every week on

Wednesdays, except when
it's on Thursdays.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.120
But that's quite rare.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.690
It's always on Wednesdays.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.140
YOSSI: Can I have a
quick question?

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.060
Yossi, of course.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.260
YOSSI: What do you think
about implementing?

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:46.330
I have a list of items
that I have.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:51.390
I want to show the user a couple
of quick actions on the

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.960
same row for each item, but I
need to have two more actions

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:02.870
to each item on the list.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.180
So basically I have four
actions, but two of them

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.900
should be quick actions, so
I'll do a custom view with

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.810
added buttons or something?

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.680
And what do you think should be
the implementation or the

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.920
UI for having an interaction
for two more actions?

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:26.000
I thought about the long press,
but I'm not sure that's

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.190
proper, because I have
actions on the view.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.280
What's your suggestion?

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.290
NICK BUTCHER: You could do
contextual by a long press,

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.240
contextual action bar.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.230
But just don't do a
pop-up dialogue

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.470
is what I was thinking.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.670
Or an alternative, if you can
look at something like the

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.170
cards in Google Now, they have
like a small version of the

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.040
overflow button which leads
to additional actions.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.390
Or I was talking about the music
app at this [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.870
seminar where they drop down
their little disclosure arrow

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.370
which you could normally
use for spinners.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.994
You could do that to
show a pop-up menu.

00:28:55.994 --> 00:28:57.930
That could work as well.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:04.270
YOSSI: The overflow button from
Google Now could be on

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.400
each item on the list?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.240
NICK BUTCHER:Yep.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.050
Or the disclosure
triangle thing.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.350
CHRIS BANES: I prefer
the triangle.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.600
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
me too actually.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.520
The thing about the contextual
action bar is that if it is

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.980
contextual actions, I mean
that's what it's there for.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.510
And also it means if you can
perform the action on multiple

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.250
items, you kind of get that
behavior for free with the

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.430
contextual bar imitation,
which I really like.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.550
YOSSI: Yeah.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.820
And that's what I thought
because I'm trying to merge

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:40.140
several actions to
be more specific.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:45.160
I wanted to use the speed
action bar to show quick

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.430
actions that are changing
contextually when you long

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:55.000
hold and when you don't have
the long press edit mode.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.840
And I wasn't sure if I can maybe
show that button, or

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.933
should I use the contextual
menu?

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.020
I thought of a lot
of suggestions.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.785
I wasn't sure which
ones to implement.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.950
NICK BUTCHER: I like some kind
of contextual action bar, or

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.200
some kind of drop-down
with [INAUDIBLE].

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.990
CHRIS BANES: Just don't do
a single click to open

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.945
contextual action bar.

00:30:27.945 --> 00:30:28.350
That's horrible.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.030
YOSSI: No, no, no.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.570
Wouldn't do it no matter what.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.440
RICH HYNDMAN: Nick did clarify
that he actually wanted the

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.020
background image not to specify
the minimum size.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.440
So if you got a 100X20 text
view, and the image is

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.240
100X100, the text
view will grow.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.210
You could use 9-patch images,
something like that, or your

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.620
own custom version
of text view.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.600
I would say go with the
9-patch if you can.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.280
And then just define the scaling
areas and the content

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.090
areas so that you actually have
some consistency over

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.250
what the background
image will be.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.350
Otherwise you're not
going to know.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.130
I mean the system's not just
going to make a guess at which

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.890
part of the image you
want the shot.
