00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Let's solve a few equations. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.000
 I know you will see these equations 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640
 require more steps (ALGORITHM), 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.490
 from the hitherto decided ones. 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.420
 Fun in the equations is that there are more than one 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.060
 a true way of solving. 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.260
 As long as you do the right steps, that means 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.760
 whatever you do on the left side, the same 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 to do right, and then there is no way to go wrong. 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.100
 And you will get the right answer. 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.990
 Let's solve a few equations. 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.700
 The first equation: 1,3x - 0,7x = 12. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.280
 (one whole and three by X minus zero and seven by x equals 12). 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
 The first thing that instinct tells us to do, 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.900
 is to tie those two members together. 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.020
 We have 1.3 something less minus 0.7 on the same thing. 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.180
 This is the same variable. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.340
 For example, if we have 1.3 apples minus 0.7 of the same apples, 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 we can get 1.3 out of 0.7. 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 The X is the same, so we can export it as a TOTAL GENERATOR. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.630
 -&gt; 1.3x - 0.7x = x (1.3 - 0.7) 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.720
 This is equal to 12. The left hand is equal to the right. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.800
 As we have already said, we have brought out a TOTAL GENERATOR 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.430
 before brackets. 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.080
 And we did it for X. 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 X is an unknown number. We call it PARAMETER or UNKNOWN. 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180
 When a number such as 0.7 multiplies by one variable, 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.240
 they become literally inseparable until they remain alone on one side of the equal. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 1.3 by the variable x minus 0.7 by x is equal to 0.6 by x. 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.750
 0.6x = 12 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.970
 We have transformed the task to an easier level. We know how to solve this type of task 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.690
 from other video lessons. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 We have a number (coefficient) X (variable) equal to a number. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 Let us divide the two sides of the equation of the number multiplied by X, 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.870
 of the COEFFICIENT. 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.310
 Divide to 0.6 (zero and six). 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.570
 It's like SUCCESSING at the RECIPRONAL number of 0.6, which is 1 / 0.6. 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.970
 On the left, 0.6 divided by 0.6 is 1. Only X remains. 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.700
 X equals 12 divided by 0.6. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.160
 To make the division of 12 divided by 0.6 easier, 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.870
 we multiply both numbers by 10. 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.320
 12 by 10 is 120. 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.630
 0.6 by 10 is 6. 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.280
 It turned out that 120 divided into 6. 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.570
 We know that 12 divided by 6 is 2. 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.840
 So 120 divided by 6 is 20. 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.090
 12 divided by 0.6 equals 20. 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.070
 X equals 20. 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.080
 And we can check the task. 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760
 Replace X with 20. 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.090
 1.3 by 20 minus 0.7 on 20 left 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110
 is equal to 12 on the right. 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 Here's the calculator so we do not rely on 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.590
 my calculus abilities. 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.940
 1.3 by 20 is equal to 26. 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.960
 We record 26 ... 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.640
 And 0.7 by 20 ... 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920
 There is no need to consider it with a calculator, it's easy, 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.990
 It is equal to 14. 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.440
 26 minus 14 is 12. (26 - 14 = 12) 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.400
 And here it is. 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.590
 We have the left side equal to the right. 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.590
 X equals 20. 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.210
 Let's solve the next equation. 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.640
 5x - (3x + 2) = 1 (5X minus in brackets 3X plus 2, closing brackets equals 1) 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.860
 This seems very difficult. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.420
 When something seems very difficult to you, just follow the ALGORITHM (successive steps) 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.280
 and you will gradually make the equation easier. 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.610
 Over time, repeating the steps (algorithm) 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.520
 you will see progress in yourself. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.530
 The first thing we will do is to uncover the brackets. 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 We have a minus in front of brackets. 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.010
 We multiply each of the numbers in brackets by -1. 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.760
 No? 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.530
 5x minus ... 3x by -1 and 2 by -1 We get -3x and -2. 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.960
 We multiplied each of the numbers in brackets by minus 1. 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.270
 And -3x-2 was obtained. 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.460
 5x -3x - 2 on the left 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.440
 is equal to 1 on the right. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.500
 We have 5 x x minus 3 x, 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.720
 5 from something minus 3 of the same thing 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.490
 will be 2 of this thing. 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.080
 5x minus 3x is 2x. 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.370
 Because 5 minus 3 is 2. 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.570
 The equation now looks like this: 2x - 2 = 1 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.470
 The next step is to leave 2x only on the left side of the equation. 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.370
 To do this, we need to get rid of -2. 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.070
 So we add on both sides 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.390
 of the equation +2. 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.880
 Add plus 2 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.470
 and to the left and right. 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.209
 Because the left side should always be equal to the right side. 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.930
 And if we do some action on the left, we have to do the same 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.440
 and on the right. 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.870
 Add +2 and right. 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.780
 Left -2 and +2 are destroyed (because they are the same numbers but opposite characters). 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.910
 And we got: 2x is equal to 1 plus 2, which is 3. 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.910
 (2x = 1 + 2 .-&gt; 2x = 3) 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.550
 To remove the COEFFICIENT before x, divide the two sides of the equation to 2. 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.680
 We get that x = 3/2 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.910
 I'll leave your check on you to make sure that 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.900
 this is the right answer. 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.040
 Here I will a bit embrace the previous task, 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.490
 so we do not go wrong. 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.600
 In the next equation we have to find S. 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.850
 As you can see, we have a liver and two members with S. 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.030
 How will we solve this equation? 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.120
 Just like others. 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.410
 S minus 3/8 on S equals 5/6. 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.970
 S - 3 / 8S = 5/6 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.800
 S - 3 / 8S = 5/6 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.920
 We export S as TOTAL MULTIPLE TO SCOB. 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.750
 S (1- 3/8) = 5/6 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.680
 For both members, S repeats, so we can 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.440
 we bring it out before brackets, and inside it is 1 because we have it 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.520
 one S minus 3/8. 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.730
 1 minus 3/8, how much is that? 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.930
 This 1 can be represented as 8/8. Why exactly 8/8? Because the other number is 3/8 with a denominator 8, and it is easier to draw another number with the same denominator. If there is any other number, we will have to mislead a COMMON DIMMER and so on. 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.030
 Which is 1. ANY NUMBER OF SECONDLY DIVIDED BY YOU 1. 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.980
 Vadim 3/8 of 8/8 and gets 5/8. (8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.) 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.680
 We may reverse the order of multiplication. 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.510
 5/8 by equal to 5/6. 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.020
 From here we can immediately determine s. 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.100
 If we have 1 of the parameter s minus 3/8 of s, we get 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.980
 8/8 of s minus 3/8 of this. 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.340
 The result is 5/8 per s. 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.450
 Second, to find s, we must multiply both sides by 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.120
 Reciprocal value of 5/8, which is 8/5. 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.900
 We multiply from left to 8/5. 8/5 in 5 / 8s. 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.790
 What we do on the left side of the equation, the same we do 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.650
 and on the right side of the equation. 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.370
 Right to 8/5. 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.100
 Left 8/5 and 5/8 are destroyed 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.380
 and only s remains. 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.660
 And on the right 5 in the numerator it is shortened by 5 in the denominator. 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.750
 8 and 6 we can divide them into 2. 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.910
 We divide in NUMBER 8 to 2, which is 4. 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.140
 And divide 6 in the TIMER at 2, 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.890
 which gives 3. 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.890
 Four on Three remain. 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.740
 4/3 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.860
 S equals 4/3 (S = 4/3). 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.010
 Let's do one more. 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.640
 Here I have 5q minus 7 on 12 is equal to 2/3. 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.570
 Let's write it. 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.290
 Or we can write it like 5/12 in (q - 7) 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.890
 is equal to 2/3. 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.390
 And in this lesson I want to show you, 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.330
 that we can act in two ways. 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.210
 Of course, while we act as we are, we will receive 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.240
 the same answer. 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.670
 The first way we do it is 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.500
 by multiplying both sides of the equation by 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.040
 reciprocal on 5/12. 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.460
 Ie. I will multiply both sides by 12 on 5. 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.200
 Because I want to remove this 5/12 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.820
 on the left side. 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.510
 It only hinders us in this case. 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.470
 We will multiply it by 12 on 5, because it will 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.960
 remove. 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960
 5 and 5 are abbreviated and 12 and 12 are abbreviated. 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.190
 So the left side of the equation becomes Q minus 7, 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.860
 equal to the right side, 2/3 at 5/12. 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.450
 If you divide 12 to 3, you get 4. 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.190
 Divide 3 to 3 you get 1. 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.080
 And 2 in 4 is equal to 8 on 5. 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.960
 And now we can add 7 to both sides of this equation. 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.490
 Let's do it - but let it be in another color. 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.340
 Add 7 to both sides. 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.880
 These weeks are getting shorter. 

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.080
 That was our point, adding 7. 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.650
 And we stay with q = 8/5 plus 7. 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:22.270
 Or we can write 7 as 35/5. 

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.075
 And this will be equal to 8, 

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.720
 the denominator is 5, 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.490
 8 plus 35 is 43. 

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.990
 The decision, in this line of thought, is q = 43/5. 

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.250
 I said we would do it in two ways. 

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.520
 Let's try the other. 

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.240
 Let's write the same task. 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.310
 We have 5/12 ... in fact, let's solve the problem 

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.240
 in a radically different way. 

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.890
 Let's write it as it is in the condition. 

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:58.590
 5 (q - 7) / 12 = 2/3. 

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.410
 Let's remove 12 first. Let's multiply both sides 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.890
 of the equation of 12. 

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.830
 I just do not like this 12 here, that's why 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.530
 we will multiply by 12. 

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.430
 So these will catch up and we will stay 

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.440
 with 5 (q - 7) = 2/3 by 12. 

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.020
 This is the same as 24 on 3. 

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.620
 Let's write it. 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.570
 2/3 at 12/1 is equal ... if you divide it at 3, 

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.610
 you get 4, divide this at 3 

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.590
 and we get 1 equal to 8. 

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.700
 Ie. we have 5 (q - 7) equals 8. 

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.140
 And then instead of dividing the sides to 5, which will help us a lot 

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.090
 to achieve what we need here, 

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.510
 let's reveal the brackets and multiply it by 5, 

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.210
 you can multiply in different ways. 

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.830
 5 in q is 5q. 

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.130
 5 at -7 is -35, equals 8. 

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.030
 5q - 35 is equal to 8. 

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.630
 To eliminate this -35, the best 

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.230
 The way we do it is like 

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.750
 add 35 to both sides. 

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.650
 We do this to catch up with these, and we stay with 

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:15.120
 5q equal to 8 + 35, which is 43. 

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.110
 Now we can multiply both sides by 1/5, 

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.720
 which is the same as dividing the sides into 5. 

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.970
 And these are getting shorter. 

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.340
 We have q equal to 43 on 5. 

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.410
 You see there are many ways to handle these tasks. 

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.410
 As long as you do it properly, you will receive it 

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.150
 the right answer always. 

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.140
 I'll let you check if that's true 

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.240
 is the answer to q. 

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.310
 When we find q, we've decided the equation. 

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.240
 Now let's solve a textual problem. 

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.710
 Jade is alone in town and has only 10 leva to get to his home. 

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:59.360
 The taxi costs 0.75 leva per kilometer, but there is an initial fee of 2.35 leva. 

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.080
 Display a formula and use it to figure out how many kilometers 

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.290
 the girl will go by the money she has. 

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.790
 So ... 

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.250
 The entire taxi will be equal to 

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:18.960
 the initial fee is 2.35 leva + 

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.010
 BGN 0.75 per kilometer, multiplied by kilometers. 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.780
 Let me be equal to the kilometers traveled. 

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.430
 The kilometers traveled. 

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.710
 And this is our equation. 

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.700
 We know she has only 10 leva to get home. 

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.890
 Ie. the price must be 10. 

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.210
 We have already said that the price should be 10 leva. 

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:52.370
 10 is equal to 2.35 + 0.75m. 

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.320
 How to find m, or the amount of miles, 

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.815
 who can travel? 

00:11:56.815 --> 00:12:00.150
 We can remove 2.35 on the right, 

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.830
 by pulling it out on both sides 

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.860
 of this equation. 

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.900
 Let's do it. 

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:13.020
 We take out 2.35 on both sides. 

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.470
 These are destroyed. 

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.620
 That's what we want. 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:25.880
 On the left - how much is 10 minus 2.35? 

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.390
 These are destroyed. 

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.040
 And now, how much is 10 minus 2.35? 

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.070
 10 minus 2 is 8. 

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.580
 10 minus 2.3 is 7.7. 

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.620
 Ie. equal to 7.65. 

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.270
 You may believe me, but let's check it out. 

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.150
 10 minus 2.35 

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.220
 is 7.65. 

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:56.220
 And that will be 0.75 kilometers. 

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.480
 Let's write it in the same color. 

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.050
 It's good to see where things come from. 

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.360
 0.75 kilometers. 

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.930
 I have 5 shades of purple. 

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.770
 Here, here and these two 

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.970
 are destroyed. 

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.682
 Now find m. We can just divide to 0.75. 

00:13:16.682 --> 00:13:20.340
 If we divide one side to 0.75, 

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.350
 you know, we have to separate the other 

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.430
 to 0.75. 

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.990
 This is getting shorter and so on the right we stay 

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.380
 only with m. 

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.540
 And on the left ... let me take the sack 

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.350
 for this part ... 

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.350
 We have 7.65 divided by 0.75, which is 

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:42.320
 equal to 10.2. 

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.930
 Or Jade can travel 10.2 kilometers.
