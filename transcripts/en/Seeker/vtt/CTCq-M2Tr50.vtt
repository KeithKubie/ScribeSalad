00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.109
We think of spacecraft as these solid, expertly
engineered emissaries of humanity exploring

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.109
the universe.

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.630
But really, they’re just machines with computers,
and like your laptop they can be hacked, and

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.530
so can NASA, which is a little insane to think
about.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.200
When it comes right down to it, NASA is just
like any modern business, relying on a network

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.940
of computers, both on the ground and in space.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.070
And because it’s all computer-based, NASA
has to protect its network from cyber attacks

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.150
like any other big company does or else risk
the loss or theft of very important and sensitive

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.150
data.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.250
But NASA is a little more vulnerable than
most.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.730
The agency not only uses a massive amount
of computers, it relies on people working

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.480
at sites all over the world, and because all
these databases and servers are retroactively

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.890
woven together, that’s what opens weak spots
in the security system.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.440
As a point of reference, in 2010 and 2011
there were 5,408 computer security incidents

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
at NASA.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.490
In one instance, hackers even gained full
functional control to NASA networks.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.620
And it’s not just access to computers, hackers
can access NASA satellites.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.960
Hackers gained access to the Landsat-7 satellite
twice in 2007 and 2008, but only gained access;

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.020
they couldn’t control it.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.759
Two more serious attacks were waged on NASA’s
Terra EOS satellite in 2008, where the hackers

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.689
actually gained control for 2 minutes in June
and 9 minutes in October.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.049
They were able to issue commands to the satellite
but didn’t actually do it.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.571
It might seem innocuous when we're talking
about an Earth observation spacecraft, but

00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:29.280
the ability for one country to control another
country’s satellites does have some serious

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.289
implications.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.649
It could give an enemy a critical advantage
in war, the modern incarnation of which is

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.520
digital, heavily reliant on GPS, and uses
orbital cameras for reconnaissance and troop

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520
preparation.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.780
But hacking satellites isn't always nefarious.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.020
Sometimes hacking has good intentions behind
it!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.240
Say NASA’s funding for a mission runs out
but the satellite is still active.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.349
It’s possible for private citizen scientists
or lesser-funded space organizations to talk

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.850
to it with radio waves the same way NASA does!

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.209
And this happened!

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.209
Almost...

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.979
NASA’s International Sun Earth Explorer
3, or ISEE-3, launched on its space weather

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.130
mission in 1978 and was retired in 1997.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.960
But it was never shut down properly, so a
team of citizen scientists devised a way to

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.240
talk to the satellite.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.849
They actually made contact!

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.450
But couldn’t regain control over its propulsion
system to change its trajectory.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.610
The ISEE-3 experiment does show that citizen
science and hacking can be positive!

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.450
Private groups could theoretically take control
of satellites once NASA retires them and use

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.380
them for a little bit of extra science.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.250
Of course, this depends on satellites having
available consumables, things like power to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.090
work the radio and fuel for the engines.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.580
Without those key elements, there’s not
much to do with a disused satellite.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.969
