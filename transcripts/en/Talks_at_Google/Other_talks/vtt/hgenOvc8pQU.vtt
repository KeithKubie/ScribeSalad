MALE SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.690
Welcome to another outstanding
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.730
Today we're pleased to host
a Mike Marriner and the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
co-founders of the Roadtrip
Nation organization.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.570
What is Roadtrip Nation,
you may ask?

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.800
It's outstanding example
of a dream that,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.230
actually, never dies.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.090
It keeps on going.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.830
So back in college, Mike
and his friends went

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.770
on this road trip.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.050
They interviewed a few people.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.030
They posted some
videos online.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.420
It became this long
going tradition.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.910
And one road trip leads to
another, leads to another and,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.750
in this case, leads
to a company.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470
So not only do they have a PBS
series that was picked up,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.320
detailing their adventures,
but they have a foundation

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
that encourages high school
and college kids to start

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.280
their own road trip to really
explore their own communities.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.190
And so they'll tell us what
they're up to, most recently.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.690
And we'll also play a video.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.247
So Mike, did you want to talk
about video, briefly.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:54.740
MIKE MARRINER: Sure.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.140
I guess we'll begin the story
with the end in mind and show

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650
a little bit of a video, of a
snapshot of what Roadtrip

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.099
Nation is today, from one of
our recent series on public

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:04.560
television.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.910
So we'll just kick it
off with this video.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.570
-On your tombstone, at the end
of the day, they're going to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.292
see three things.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:14.370
They're going to see
your birth date.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.400
They're going to
see that dash.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.810
And they're going to see
your death date.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.490
The front and the back,
they're done.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.220
But the thing that has
the most importance

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.120
to me is that dash.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.470
What happened in your life
during the time you were born

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.030
to the time you passed away?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.035
What defines you as a person?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.120
-Hi, I'm with Roadtrip Nation.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.595
-And we're going to traveling
across the

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:43.960
country for six weeks.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.060
-From the West Coast to the
East Coast in an RV.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.210
-And interviewing people
whom we believe

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.340
followed their passions.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.780
-And meet with people that are
in really interesting places.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.315
-We're kind of at a loss for
what we should do, so hoping

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.200
to talk to the people who do
things that we really look to.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.760
-I feel like I'm just spinning
my wheels right now.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720
I'm ready to catch
something and go.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.800
-Where were you when
you were our age?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.900
-What fears or anxieties
did you have?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.940
-I really was like you.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.960
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.200
But I wanted to see
what's out there.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.190
-We travelled in a school
bus, tattooing

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.230
all over the country.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.890
-I was a messenger boy.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.934
Whatever it takes to pay your
rent so you can act.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.060
-I was really lost.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.480
I was either going to end up
pregnant or in jail or dead or

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.786
I was going to be able
to change my life.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:50.000
-It feels so good, I think, to
look into your motivations and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.082
your apprehensions.

00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:54.745
-I mean it sounds silly to say
you profit from your mistakes,

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:55.405
but you do.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.725
I mean, when you make a mistake,
and you go in the

00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:01.190
wrong direction, it will
help you somewhere.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.260
-I am nervous about taking
a step into the unknown.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.200
-And it's a call on what
you see as failure.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.270
Never doing what I wanted
to do is failure to me.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.490
-It's a huge roller
coaster, right?

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.610
It can be high times, low times,
happy times, sad times.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.240
And you just have to hang on.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.860
-Never give up on your dreams,
no excuses, Kyle Maynard.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.300
[COWS LOWING]

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.540
-Oh my gosh.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.432
-What?

00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:35.400
-We're surrounded by cows.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.090
-This has like been the
most surreal place

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.220
I've ever been to.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.580
America is so big.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.530
There are a million experiences,
and there are a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.860
million thoughts that you
can think, and a million

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.200
definitions that can be added to
who you are and how you see

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.450
yourself in the world.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.020
-Your heart is like
a GPS system.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.970
The GPS system in your car will
tell you which way to go,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.682
but it's not going to turn
your car for you.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:06.540
If your heart's telling
you to turn left,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.400
you better turn left.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.739
And there are a lot of people
who wait too late to listen to

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.989
their heart.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:16.350
-Every single person
has a story.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.120
And every person came
from somewhere.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.890
-I have these ideas of what
I want in my life

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.650
and all these things.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.690
But no one ever knows what's
going to be coming up ahead.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.920
And it could change
everything.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.910
And it could be better than
you even expected it.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.090
-I just can't wait to see
what the next few

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.340
weeks have in store.

00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:40.410
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.780
BRIAN MCALLISTER: So we wanted
to kick off with some footage.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.270
As you guys will learn to
know, we're not really

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.980
motivational speakers.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.820
We really don't bring a lot of
the drive to our presentation.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.750
So I think a big part of
it is just sharing

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.566
stories from the road.

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:56.580
And I think that's what we
really wanted to engage you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.370
guys with was some of the
stories that we've been

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.080
aggregating, over the past 12
years, now, and share, with

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.820
you guys, where Roadtrip Nation
started out and what it

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.220
has become.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.680
Because, as you can see from
this trailer, we're in our

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.180
10th season on public
television.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.600
We've had an opportunity
to write three books.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.790
We've been sending thousands
of students on road trips

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.690
throughout the United
States and,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.630
actually, around the world.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.810
And what we want to share with
you guys is some of the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.740
findings and some of the
discoveries that we have

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.970
collected through these
experiences.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.060
But we're very much on the
back end of things.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.920
We usually are behind
the scenes.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.200
And so the three of us,
actually, don't get a lot of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.280
opportunities to share the
stories that we've had along

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.640
the journey.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.350
So that's probably kind of what
we hope to get out of it.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.155
And we're all about Q&amp;A. And so
we'll open it up at the end

00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:47.420
of this to answer some
questions, to engage some

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.202
conversations.

00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:50.995
MIKE MARRINER: So everyone
always asks like, how did

00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:52.630
Roadtrip Nation start?

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.640
Was it a business plan?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.870
Was it some kind of
post-doctoral thesis or

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.560
something like that?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.800
But it it's actually
none of that.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.280
It was really just Nate, Brian,
and I being in school

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.720
and wondering, what do we want
to do with our lives?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.210
And we started to realize
there's no class in school to

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.335
help you figure out what do you
want to do with your life.

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:09.780
We though that was kind of
funny, because there's all

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.940
these classes for math and
English and science.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.530
Those are, obviously, really
important things.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.920
But we felt the big elephant in
the room was, well, what do

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.090
you want to do with your life?

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.110
And so when we asked our
teachers this, they said, go

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.200
talk to your school counselor.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.310
Maybe they can help you figure
out what do you want to do

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.130
with your life.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.580
And so we went to
our counselor.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.350
And the counselor told us, OK,
take, I think, it was the

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.890
Myers-Briggs test or something
like that.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.480
You fill in some dots.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.270
And we were like, seriously?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.570
NATHAN GEBHARD: I was supposed
to be a plumber.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.520
That was the big finding.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.740
I should be a plumber.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.700
MIKE MARRINER: So, essentially,
at that point, we

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.880
really felt, intuitively, that
we needed something more

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.320
exploratory, something
more humanized.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.260
And so that's when
we had the idea.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.380
It wasn't as much to create
Roadtrip Nation, as it was,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.470
what if we could hit the road
and go talk to people who are

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.100
doing interesting things, all
across America, and ask them,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.710
how did you get to where
you are today?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.770
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think it
really came in this real

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.980
visceral sense.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.400
I remember being in college and
passing my resume out at a

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.640
career fair.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.960
I was a business major.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.110
And so it was like a little
assembly line.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.550
Business majors at the school
I was at become consultants.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.320
And so I was passing my resume
out to like, Arthur Andersen,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.460
all these different companies.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.650
And I remember handing my resume
to a guy and saying

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.980
like, I have no idea what you
do or what I'm applying for.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.640
What is this thing?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.450
And I remember taking him
out to lunch one day.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.690
And I was like, I just need to
see what this things about,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.900
that I'm applying for.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.150
And I remember getting
to lunch.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.750
And he had a suit and tie on.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.250
And I waited politely
for a while.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.810
And I was like, so do you have
to wear the suit all the time?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.130
And he was really fired
up about it.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.660
He was like, yeah, you
get to dress nice.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.400
They give you a budget
for clothes.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.290
And the blood just completely
drained out of my body.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.420
I could just instantly, in
that one simple moment,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.340
realize that this whole path
that I was put on, to make

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.500
money and get that mortgage
and be a professional, was

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.390
just kind of falling apart at
the simplest thing of like, I

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.060
can't wear a suit every day.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.210
I think we, each of us, had that
freak out moment, where

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.180
we really realized we needed to
see what else was out there

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.870
and what we were
interested in.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.470
BRIAN MCALLISTER: And
I think so much of

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.560
it was lack of exposure.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.710
Like to Nate's point, we
didn't really know

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.460
what was out there.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.530
And to what Mike was saying,
you take these tests, these

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.070
assessment tests, and Nate
figures out he's going to

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.870
become a plumber.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.580
But we really needed something
more human.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.049
There was almost like a
frustration that, at the end

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.890
of the day, we just wanted to go
out and talk to people from

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.230
all walks of life and ask
them, how did you get

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.039
to where you are?

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.890
Was there ever a time in your
life that, perhaps, you're

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.900
going through a period of
ambiguity, or you were

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.430
displaced, or you just weren't
sure where the next step was?

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.230
Or how did you identify those
values within and see that?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.420
And how did you align
a lifestyle or a

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.670
culture to a job?

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.320
And I think these were some
of the questions we were

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.000
challenging with.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.610
And it wasn't like academia
was bringing this to us.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.960
As you guys know, a lot of cool
projects sometimes start

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960
in a garage.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.260
This project was started
out in a motor home.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.200
So we bought my parents old,
beat-up motor home.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.230
The thing barely ran.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.060
I mean, Nate and I--

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.620
NATHAN GEBHARD: It
didn't matter.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.520
BRIAN MCALLISTER: We pretty
much fixed the thing as we

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.680
travelled across the
United States.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.410
And this was our vehicle.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.070
This was our space.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.790
So this thing was an old,
beat-up motor home.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.760
We painted it green, because
the paint was on

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.160
sale at Home Depot.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.040
I mean we were funding this
thing through credit cards.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.470
It wasn't like we had some agent
behind us that was like,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.430
hey, we're going to make you
guys some reality show on MTV.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.520
It was very, very sincere
and authentic.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.340
And we started just to question
like, who's out there

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.390
doing creative things?

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.140
Who's out there really
changing the world?

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.480
Where are some of these
change agents?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.480
And let's ask them, like,
what's driving them?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.940
And so that's what led us to
the people that we actually

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.980
ended up interviewing.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.350
We booked over 85 interviews.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.550
We got denied, probably,
500 times, 1,000 times.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.790
And we found these people
through magazine articles,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.580
different subscriptions that
we're applying, magazines.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.460
We were combing through
mastheads.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.190
We found ourselves at newspaper
stands just saying,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.320
where are the cool people?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.250
What are they doing?

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.950
And let's go talk to them and
ask them, how did you get to

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.230
where you are today?

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.250
NATHAN GEBHARD: And it was this
simple sense of I like

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.380
snowboarding, and I like art.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.530
Well, what about the guys that
put that together, like the

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.620
art on snowboards?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.690
And so like literally just cold
called Burton Snowboards

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.680
and said like can we talk
to somebody there?

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.400
I'm kind of a tech geek.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.750
I was watching TV, and there
was a Dell commercial.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.790
And I got the 1-800
number off the

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.250
commercial to buy a computer.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.770
And I just asked for Michael,
Michael Dell.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.870
And it was about six transfers
later, and I ended up speaking

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.530
to Laura Strange, who was
overseeing all of his

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.480
communications.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.890
And six months after that, he
was just sitting shotgun in

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.900
the actual, original RV.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.420
But it was literally just cold
call, no connections.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.410
I cold called the Supreme Court
and asked for Sandra.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.560
Mike ended up calling the
director of "Saturday Night

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.980
Live" every three days, for
three months straight, until

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.570
she finally picked up the phone
on the stage for the MTV

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.930
Music Videos Awards
or something.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.740
MIKE MARRINER: Yeah.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.610
It wasn't just like
high-up executives

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.810
or people like that.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.230
It was a lobsterman from
the coast of Maine.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.140
It was an environmental
activist in DC.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.460
It was just people who--

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.860
how we defined it later is like
people who define their

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.820
own roads in life, which is
really the mission of Roadtrip

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.000
Nation today.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.500
But over the course of 2 and
1/2 months, we drove over

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.190
15,000 miles in Brian's old,
family, beat-up motor home,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.900
interviewed over 84 people.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.270
And I think that's what we want
to do is show you guys a

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.030
little bit of a glimpse
of that road trip.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.050
We ended up buying this old,
beat-up video camera.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.070
None of us had any
film experience.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.560
We weren't film majors,
anything like that.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.080
But around that time,
video cameras were

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.450
getting pretty cheap.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.770
So we ended up just filming
everything.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.580
And we were able to then kind
of aggregate some of that

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.400
footage together, at the
end of that trip.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.530
So here's a little glimpse into
one section of our road

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.850
trip, from, I think, about
Vermont down through Maine and

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.580
then into Boston.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.078
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:08.078 --> 00:13:50.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.380
-You can work hard, and you
can, hopefully, be good at

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:53.870
what you do.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:58.350
But things like Burton, that's a
once in a lifetime deal that

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.580
somehow I happened to
hook up with a guy

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.208
that invented a culture.

00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:06.980
I don't know.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.660
I realized I sucked at math
and shit early on.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.395
And I focused on art work.

00:14:11.395 --> 00:14:13.990
And also punk music was going
off at that point.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.450
It was all Clash, Sex Pistols,
Ramones was the whole program.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.550
My first date, with my wife,
was the Clash, in Montreal.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.370
So I went on that path.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.000
I didn't have any calculated
route I was going to take.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.900
Because my parents didn't have
a clue about that stuff.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.070
My father worked in a factory
making cottage cheese.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.785
And my mother was beautician
from Maine.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.790
I think a lot of it is, as you
guys are trying to prove here,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.250
you really just have to go with
what you believe in and

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.750
what you really want to do.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.290
Simon Woodruff said that the
world will conspire to support

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.150
you, if you really magnify what
it is you believe in.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.840
People will rally around
you and help.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.520
And I think you'll find that
from your family and your

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.920
friends and everything else, if
you decide you're going to

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.600
be a sculptor, if you decide
you're going to be an

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.930
architect, or you decide you're
going to be a kick-ass

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.000
accountant.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.370
It's like, if you really believe
it, and you wear it on

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.720
your shoulder, and you really
do it with distinction, the

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.030
world will conspire to do it.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.670
Distinction is everything.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.180
You've got to be willing
to do that.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.920
And if you look at any examples
of people that have

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.370
been successful in what they're
doing-- and not

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.210
monetarily successful,
successful in their life--

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.690
they are generally pretty
distinctive individuals.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.810
And it's because they've got the
self-confidence to have a

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.370
point of view.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.290
And I think that can be a
farmer in the boonies of

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.160
Vermont or Montana or something,
and it can be the

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.140
most progressive artist
in New York City.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.110
But they will both have
self-confidence in what

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.200
they're doing, and they'll both
have a point of view.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.830
They'll have a philosophy
that they'll back up.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.044
Just do it with some fricking
balls, that's all I'd say.

00:15:54.044 --> 00:15:54.820
I don't know.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.050
There's so many people that
just have this sort of

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.370
milquetoast existence.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.690
And they get frustrated that
they sort of get washed around

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.310
in the flow.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.890
And it's like, you're doing
that to yourself.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.100
That's where I'm at, at this
point, and what I'm trying to

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.940
inspire people here to do, that
you can do whatever the

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.470
hell you want.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:17:38.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.750
-It's frightening to be making
decisions now, because you

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.275
feel like, OK, I'm going to make
a small decision now, and

00:17:43.275 --> 00:17:44.710
that's probably going
to affect the way

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.570
my life pans out.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.260
-What is the next step?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:47.992
-What is the next step?

00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:50.020
-Because I don't know.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.740
And it scares me.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.090
And I don't want to do something
that I hate.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.740
But I also am afraid of taking
the serious risks that I think

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.180
involve not doing something
that I hate.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.930
-I'm studying post-colonial
African-American migration

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.630
narratives.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.885
-Holy.

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:06.480
-Wow.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.620
-See.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.800
-Can I get one of those?

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.054
Another one of those?

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:09.890
That was sweet.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.940
-It looks like we'll go to
lunch with you guys.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.292
-Where are you going?

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:13.750
-I don't know.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.950
Where are you taking me?

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.750
-I want to go with you.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.070
I'll like hop on this thing
right now, totally.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.035
-Now that I think about it,
maybe the core of everything

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:23.470
is that I'm not believing
in myself.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:30.130
-To some degree, I feel like the
path that I'm on has been

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.990
laid out for me, in some ways.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.380
Sometimes I've had a kind of
crisis of, you now, is this

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.500
really what I'm supposed to do
or have people just told me

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.440
all the time that this
is what I want to do?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.405
And is this it?

00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:45.740
Is there something else?

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.360
-It's funny, actually, a bunch
of people have approached us,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.340
over the years, my partner and
me, to write a book about the

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.520
history of Nantucket Nectars.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.620
And I never really wanted to
write a book about the history

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.280
of Nantucket Nectars.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.500
I wanted to write a book about
figuring out who I was.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.726
-Cheers.

00:19:05.726 --> 00:19:07.440
-Cheers.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.430
-To the New World.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.320
-And there I was, living
on Nantucket.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.010
And the first time I was out
there, I got my commercial

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.120
fishing license, because we'd
know other way to make money.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.990
I wore these big, rubber boots
and the whole fishing outfit

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.330
and everything.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.810
My parents came out there
a couple times.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.340
And I'm sure they looked
at me and were like,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.820
what is this kid doing?

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.200
-I had another kind of life.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.760
It was the life of a traveling
vagabond, essentially.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.390
I was traveling Europe and
having extraordinary, unusual

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.590
experiences, no question
about it.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.150
-The last thing I had to do at
night was I'd have to wash out

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.910
all the buckets.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.220
They had the shells and the
scallop guts in them.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.700
And I'm on this back
dock, right

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.180
over the water, Nantucket.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.310
And it's midnight.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.520
And it was Christmas Eve.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.610
And the water is, literally,
freezing on the

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.510
dock under my feet.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.050
I didn't even notice it.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.400
And all of a sudden, I turned
and feet come out from

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.990
underneath me.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.125
I slam on the dock.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.830
The hose is shooting
up in the air.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.600
I'll never forget this, just
sitting there, looking up in

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.800
the sky, thinking, what
the hell am I doing?

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.910
I mean, what am I doing?

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.200
I'm washing out guts out of a
scallop bucket on Christmas

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.960
Eve in Nantucket.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.240
I'm 23 years old.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.080
I went to Brown.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.830
I mean, I should be doing
something different.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.350
My parents are pissed at me.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.260
Well, I ended up living on
Nantucket for four more years

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.650
and building this business.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.840
And even two or three years
into Nantucket Nectars, my

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.355
parents were like, starting
a juice company?

00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:31.106
I mean, are you kidding me?

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.640
What do you mean you're
starting a juice?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.642
Who starts a juice company?

00:20:35.642 --> 00:20:38.720
-I heard a very funny story,
when I was nine.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.420
I wrote some compositions, as
kids do, I just wrote these

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.080
little things.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.000
And my mother put them
in for an arts

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.520
festival, in our village.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.840
Everybody in England, every
villager has an arts festival.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.850
And the time came for giving
out the awards and prizes.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.700
And he held my compositions
above his head.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.250
And he said, these compositions
are so bad, that

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.760
not only can I not consider
them for the competition--

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.090
that goes without saying--

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.370
but this young man should
be discouraged from ever

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.410
composing again.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.030
That's what he said.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:08.550
-Wow.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.770
-There's a million different
paths to get there.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.240
And everyone thinks
there's one, when

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.130
they give you advice.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.720
And there isn't one.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.940
Could anyone have ever
predicted my path?

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.190
OK, this is how you're
going to make it.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.900
What you do is--

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.090
you want to start
a juice company?

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.770
OK, this is how you do it.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.360
You should move to Nantucket.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.920
Start a boat business, end
up being a fisherman.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.490
And then get into distribution
and start a juice business.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.630
That's how you get into juice.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.440
Like who would ever say that?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.360
-So it's important to know
what you're after.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.330
And then, if you know what
you're after, and you really

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.020
want it, then you don't look
around wondering whether

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.000
you're better or worse than the
next person, because it's

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.170
not about that.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.820
It's about what you
want to do.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.070
[SINGING - BEETHOVEN,
"ODE TO JOY"]

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.970
It's the "Ode to Joy"
of Beethoven.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.880
[LAUGTHER]

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.370
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.020
MIKE MARRINER: So that's just
a little glimpse into that

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.940
experience.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.090
And like we said, we did 84
interviews, over 15,000 miles,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.560
2 and 1/2, almost 3 months,
on the road.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.490
And I think, over and over
again, everyone always tries

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.780
to boil down into one insight.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.140
But we think that one of the
big, overarching things that

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.830
we found was this notion of
defining your own road life.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.980
And especially at that age,
when you're growing up in

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.340
American culture, there's
all different types of

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.020
expectations, and things that
we heard a few of our people

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.510
on the road call, noise,
trying to influence the

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.560
decisions that we're making
around that time in your life

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.460
when you're trying to
figure out what you

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.540
really want to do.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.460
And that was the overarching
theme that we found.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.620
A lot of defining our own road
in life is about shedding that

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.690
noise and getting down to what
are the elements that really

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.750
make you who you are?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.640
What are the things that are
your interests, your values,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.340
the things that make
up the DNA and the

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:58.660
grain of who you are?

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.540
And how do you shed enough of
that noise to build your life

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.230
around those things that matter,
that matter the most?

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.490
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think one of
the things, for me, was said

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.250
by a guy named Randy Komisar.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.010
He was the author of "The Monk
and the Riddle." And he said,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.490
in perfect metaphor to our
experience, life is only

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.440
linear in the rearview mirror.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.160
And I think, for me, that was
really instrumental, because I

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.950
had this expectation, from
family and friends, that you

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.200
had to, if you're interested in
art, and you wanted to be

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.160
creative, than you were likely
going to live under the

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.980
boardwalk, poor and homeless.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.700
And I really, really
listened to that.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.560
And that was what put me on the
path to study business and

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.860
go down that route.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.350
And that's where, ultimately,
I felt hollow.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.425
And it wasn't until we had done
this road trip, where I

00:23:43.425 --> 00:23:45.920
was able to see that you could
take your interest in

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.120
something as odd as lobsters
or something as exciting as

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.920
snowboards and you can put
them together, maybe not

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.330
lobsters and snowboards.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.900
But, for me, it design and
snowboards or design and

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.370
technology.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.720
But you can mash these
things up.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.090
It's not this like, sit on an
assembly line kind of approach

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.520
that I think we have, both in
our current mentality, as well

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.140
as the way in which we raise
our children in our

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.100
educational system.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.590
So it freed my thinking
up to think that so

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.700
much more was possible.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.470
And I think it was those voices
in my head that kept us

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.140
going through the adventure of
starting Roadtrip Nation after

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.320
the road trip.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.810
BRIAN MCALLISTER: So it was
such a transformative

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.220
experience on the three of us
that we really came back from

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.850
this three and a half month
journey having a drive and a

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.740
desire to share.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.000
We had a lot of friends that we
felt needed to hear some of

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.720
these stories and break down
some of their master plans or

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.000
even just provide perspective.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.520
I think that was probably one
of the biggest things that I

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.956
took away, from being on this
journey, was just perspective

00:24:41.956 --> 00:24:47.330
of identifying who you are
and how to align it.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.740
You guys heard--

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.880
Jager's actually one most
influential interviews that we

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.290
had on that trip, as he just
talked about distinction.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.405
And you've got to wear it on
your shoulder, and you've got

00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:55.510
to be proud about it.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.960
And I think we had the fear
of having this milquetoast

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.630
existence, that you
get washed around.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.080
And I think like, coming back
from that journey was really

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.600
something that the three
of us went through.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.320
But it was more of a
desire to share it.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.440
What we wanted to share with
you guys is that original

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.160
trip, because it's rooted in
everything that we do now.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.850
It really provided
the framework of

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.510
where we are today.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.220
But it was definitely a long,
long journey of how we got

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.730
from that original road trip,
in an old, beat-up

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.680
motor home, to today.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.320
MIKE MARRINER: So everyone
always asks that question.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.310
We know you took Brian's old,
family RV, painted it green

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.230
and lived in it for
three months and

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.730
did that whole thing.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.980
But how do it evolve into this
organization that has an

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.130
annual documentary series and
a nonprofit education

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.050
foundation that has curriculum
in schools across America and

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.790
all that stuff?

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.890
And think there's no
real clean answer.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.950
I think the best way we can
describe is there was a very

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.110
incremental, evolutionary
process over a 10 year period.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.280
And that we didn't go out and
get venture capital and scale

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.000
it over two years.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.440
I mean it's something that we
did very incrementally and in

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.210
as organic and mission-based
a manner as we could.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.670
And it really started with, on
that road trip, we had met

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.180
someone who was a writer
at "Forbes

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.050
Magazine," in New York City.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.470
And she tagged along for some of
those interviews we did in

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.760
New York City, like Len Riggio,
from Barnes &amp; Noble,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.170
and "Saturday Night Live." and
she ended up doing a very

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.280
small article in "Forbes"
on Roadtrip Nation.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.920
It was definitely not
a cover story.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.940
It was literally two inches.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.370
But it got a little
bit of attention.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.740
And we learned that big New York
book publishers, if you

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.540
get an article in a magazine
like that, there's some

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.460
credibility.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.590
So through a series of events,
we ended up getting a

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.290
publishing contract with
Random House's imprint

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.140
Ballantine Books.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.670
And that's the book that's
in the back there.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.520
But essentially, we had the
chance, for a year and a half

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.740
after that road trip, to write
a book about our experiences,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.075
really reflect on some of the
content and the stories and

00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:46.830
the insights we gained over
that experience and

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.160
release that book.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.330
The book came out in 2003.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.630
It didn't sell very
well at first.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.960
It was like the 600,000th best
selling book in America.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.020
And we were like, no big deal.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.400
We had a great experience.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.960
And then the publisher got
behind it and put us on this

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.820
major PR blitz.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.590
And we were on CNN, "Carson Daly
Show," "Newsweek," NPR,

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.285
"Today Show." And the day we
were on the "Today Show", it

00:27:10.285 --> 00:27:13.420
became 15th best selling book
in America on Amazon.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.320
It was just for a day.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.100
But we still claim it.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.850
Mom and dad are proud.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.910
But around that time, there was
lots of different kind of

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.710
energy for Roadtrip Nation,
Hollywood agents and MTV show

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.130
this, and blah, blah, blah.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.170
And around that time, that's
when we really got intentional

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.360
with building a grassroots
organization that was

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.130
mission-based that could empower
other people to define

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.520
their own roads in life.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.750
And one of the first steps that
we took was too launch a

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.220
series on public television by
first creating a program, on

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.450
college campuses, called "Behind
the Wheel," where

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.950
college students could apply for
the chance to go on these

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.440
annual summer road trips.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.420
We had a few organizations that
got behind us to support

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.430
it and fund the production.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.310
And over a period of 7 years,
we expanded to 350 college

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.860
campuses across America.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.390
We created a fleet
of motor homes.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.330
These trips went around
the world to

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.070
New Zealand, Australia.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.380
There was Roadtrip Nation Israel
in Hebrew, Africa,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.670
South America, all over.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.500
And the movement proliferated
on a college level.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.440
And the first three minute
overview that we showed you

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.630
was season seven from that.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.140
And then the interesting thing
about this was that, over this

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.150
period of time, we chose to
go with public television,

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.790
because we could have a
mission-based approach, the

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.610
creative control.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.750
But the interesting part was
that by doing that, public

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.250
television also allows you to
maintain the rights to all of

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.550
your content.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.650
If we would have gone with like
an MTV or something, it

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.780
would have been gobbled
up by Viacom.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.420
And we would have had
a salary from them.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.550
But because it was public media,
we were able to then

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.740
build an independent
organization around it and

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.036
have some longevity.

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:52.350
So can you show the
content archive.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.780
NATHAN GEBHARD: Yeah.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.870
MIKE MARRINER: So, essentially,
now, 10 years

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.910
later, after doing Roadtrip
Nation and mobilizing this

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.810
movement of other student road
trips, not only were we

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.310
mobilizing these experiences to
impact the student's lives

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.130
who were participating and
creating this TV show and

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.270
whatnot, we were also creating
this enormous digital content

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.320
archive, which I don't think
we could have predicted the

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.210
power of from the beginning.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:21.490
But, essentially, it's almost
like an ethnographic study.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.520
Someone called it that
the other day.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.835
But in terms of like, if you
did mobilize teams of road

00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:29.120
trippers, for 10 years, to go
across America and across the

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.850
world and collect people's
personal stories, like a huge

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.360
oral history project, and just
ask them a simple question,

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.620
how did you figure out
what you wanted to

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.200
do with your life?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.600
And what were the steps that
you've taken to get

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.860
where you are today?

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.590
And what are the insights
and lessons

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.780
learned along that journey?

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.250
Those are stories and insights
we've been collecting for the

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.730
past 10 years.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.130
And that's what's really led us
into the new education work

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.200
we're dealing.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.180
In 2008, we saw something really
interesting happening,

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.440
outside a little town in
Pittsburgh called Mon valley.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.890
We'd been doing Roadtrip Nation,
as the college model,

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.860
in the PBS series, for
about five years.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.410
And I think we're thinking
about, what's the next step

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.420
for Roadtrip Nation?

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.450
How can we spread this
impact further?

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.740
We were mobilizing several
green RV trips a

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.600
year, around the world.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.650
But was there another model that
could be accessible to

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.940
more and more students,
especially students that are

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.920
growing up in communities where
they don't have a lot of

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.240
chances to explore or connect
with leaders and explore

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.100
what's possible for
their own futures?

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.820
And so, outside of Pittsburgh,
there was a little town called

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.570
Mon Valley, a school
district there.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.370
And there was a lot of,
essentially, mining

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.290
jobs in that area.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.020
But the mining industry
was drying up.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.640
And the district was looking
for a way to engage their

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.550
students and show them that
there's a whole world of

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.490
possibilities for
their future.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.730
In short, they were looking
for a project, a career

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.170
exploration project based
learning activity.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.530
And our documentary series was
airing on prime time in WQED.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.330
And some of the leadership in
the school district there

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.850
said, we've got an idea.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.540
Let's do a Roadtrip Nation
Western Pennsylvania.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.870
And let's localize it.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.870
And this is when things really
got interesting.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.430
Because it showed us that you
really don't need a green RV

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.810
or a cross-country trip
to have the impact

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.600
from Roadtrip Nation.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.320
When you really strip it away,
the impact was always about

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.130
these conversations that were
happening on the road, the

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.780
people that you meet.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.770
And so these students, in Mon
Valley, and their teachers,

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.190
they created this ad hoc, duct
tape Roadtrip Nation

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.170
curriculum.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.220
And the students were road
tripping around Western

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.970
Pennsylvania and Mon Valley, in
their own cars, on school

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.220
buses, just on day trips,
interviewing entrepreneurs,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.060
local restaurateurs, the
taqueria owner, the guy who

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.350
started the movie store, local
small businesses, EMT

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.630
technicians.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.730
And we had been somewhat
following this, but we were

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.910
more involved in our TV show
and that kind of a thing.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.070
At the end of the year,
they flew us out.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.430
And we walked into this
conference area, hall, where

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.420
there was hundreds of kids,
organized into teams of three,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.360
showing off their projects,
with poster boards and

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.570
computers, with showing some of
the videos from their road

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.320
trips and the people
they'd interviewed.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.260
And, at that moment, we knew
that we that we had stumbled

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.800
upon what we thought could be
the ultimate incarnation of

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.780
what the Roadtrip Nation
movement could be, which was

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.610
not only having people watch
the experiences of other

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.900
students, who were lucky go in
the green RV, but to actually

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.060
create the experience
themselves.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.220
So in 2008, we launched
roadtripnation.org, as a

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.530
501(c)3 organization, that
creates curriculum and tools

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.670
and resources for teachers,
especially in low income

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.340
communities, to bring this
Roadtrip Nation experience to

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.810
their students.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.600
So we're going to walk you
through a little bit of that

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:28.980
curriculum.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.590
Before he keep going, is there
any quick questions on the

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.290
history of Roadtrip Nation or
how we got here, before we

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.690
dive into the education piece?

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.430
NATHAN GEBHARD: The real
exciting part.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.820
AUDIENCE: You've become experts
on this topic, right?

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.816
Because you've had a movie, you
got a book, so people come

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:45.812
up to you and say, so what
should I do with my life?

00:32:45.812 --> 00:32:47.310
You get this question.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.040
So besides telling them that
they should be a product

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.620
manager at Google, what
else do you tell them?

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.560
MIKE MARRINER: Be a product
manager at Google.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.040
I think you guys hit
the jackpot.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.970
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think we
really try not to be the

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.120
experts in anything.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.860
I think, for us, it wasn't
about people

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.100
telling us what to do.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.920
I mean, I think everybody
can relate to that.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.040
To discover your own road, to
make it for yourself, that

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.990
matters so much more than
somebody coming down and

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.770
saying, you know, you
look like you'd

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.240
make a great plumber.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.790
And so for us, our whole
experience is

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.110
about sharing stories.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.520
And so it's not for us to become
the experts on career

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.240
exploration.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.360
It's for us to present the
avenue and the opportunity to

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.260
explore, for the individual, and
for that person to define

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.890
their own road.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.205
So experts of none, maybe.

00:33:33.205 --> 00:33:36.460
AUDIENCE: Did you make the cold
calls before the trip, or

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.960
you were calling people
along the trip?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.610
BRIAN MCALLISTER: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.820
We made all the cold calls.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.460
And we actually booked all the
interviews before we left.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.280
AUDIENCE: How many?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.920
How many were there?

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.510
BRIAN MCALLISTER: 84
interviews total.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.820
So we had a lot of intention.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.120
It wasn't like we were nomads
just kind going with the wind,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.660
and wherever we end
up, we end up.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.780
We had a lot of intention.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.520
I think it was a lot to just
prove to our parents that we

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.315
had a project happening.

00:33:59.315 --> 00:34:01.440
As you guys can remember, at
that age, when people are--

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.050
your parents.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.390
And we had a lot of pressure
from like, what are you guys

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.000
going to do?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.660
And we really felt that we
wanted to have that intention

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.739
lined upfront.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.989
And once we start booking
interviews, we really needed

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:12.630
to schedule all that
out, right?

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.710
So once we landed an interview
with Justice Sandra Day

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.520
O'Connor, then we wanted to
interview some other folks.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.489
You really started to build
out the itinerary.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.070
And that actually really
built a lot of

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.370
momentum for our project.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.980
AUDIENCE: How did you screen
out the 84 people?

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.320
BRIAN MCALLISTER: Yeah, it's
kind of a self-selecting

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.370
prophecy, almost.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:31.330
A lot of people said, no.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.590
We got rejected a lot.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.880
And the people that we accepted
was really based on,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.449
they remembered a time,
in their life, that

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.389
they were like us.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.810
And so it's almost
like giving back.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.650
And I think that was one of the
biggest things, why people

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.110
said, well, how do a couple
scrappy kids, out of college,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.650
book some of these interviews
with Michael Dell or Howard

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.265
Schultz, the chairman of
Starbucks, or the hair stylist

00:34:49.265 --> 00:34:50.989
to Madonna and Lenny Kravitz?

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.989
Honestly, they remember the time
in their lives that they

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:53.969
could have used some
of the advice that

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.060
they were giving us.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.370
They identified with us.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.380
And I think, once they saw us,
that age and that turmoil or

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.410
that ambiguity creeped back in,
saying, wow, I wish I had

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.900
someone that would have put
some advice on my table.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.840
And so they really identified
with the age and our

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.825
situations that we were
going through.

00:35:10.825 --> 00:35:12.930
MIKE MARRINER: And we've seen
that with the students today,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:13.960
who are going through
the curriculum.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.766
So over the last 3 years, over
100,000 students have gone

00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:18.440
through the Roadtrip Nation
Experience curriculum, on a

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.470
high school level.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.120
And it's the same thing.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.530
Our first pilot ever, for the
curriculum, was in Fresno, in

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.200
a corner of Fresno called Orosi,
California, southeast

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.170
Fresno County.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.395
And a lot of the students there
and the teachers and the

00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:32.170
school district at first was
like, who are they going to

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:33.430
interview in Orosi,
there's no one.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.070
There's no Michael Dell
here or whatever.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.050
But what we realize is that
their are leaders in

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.710
everyone's community.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.600
When you localize it, those
conversations become even more

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.260
relevant and more impactful,
because there's a gap in

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.120
social capital we've seen a
lot of communities, where

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.450
students, from a certain part of
Orosi, may not have access

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.990
to interviewing even EMT
technicians or local lawyers

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.830
or local government officials.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.800
One team, from Fresno,
interviewed

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.750
the mayor of Fresno.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.780
And to them, the mayor of Fresno
was like Barack Obama.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.060
That was like the biggest
deal ever.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.350
And one of the most impactful
interviews we've ever seen was

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.700
in our first pilot.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.650
Some of the students there
interviewed a gang violence

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.150
activist, in southeast Fresno
county, who was in one of the

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:18.100
earliest Central California
gangs, was put in prison years

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.590
when he was like 19 years old,
got out on early parole,

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.990
because he worked off
some of his time.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.030
And now he's giving back
to his community.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.640
But to him, to those students,
that issue of gang violence is

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.820
so central, in the California
Central Valley, that that was

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.500
their Michael Dell and to have
them localize that experience.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.320
And so what we've seen is that
now the students are doing the

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.130
cold calling.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.020
And that's part of
the curriculum.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.320
And so, actually, why don't we
just jump into showing a

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.490
little except of
the curriculum.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.940
But this was one of the big
humps we had to get through

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.860
from Roadtrip Nation, which
was how do you scale the

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.920
impact of this experience?

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.610
We know that providing a
transformative experience by

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.470
helping students to get outside
of their comfort zone,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.940
connecting with leaders is a
huge way to help students

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.770
figure out what they want
to do with their lives.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.910
But being in the green RVs
is obviously limiting.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.720
And so what we did was-- if you
can click on the lessons

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.280
and projects, the table
of contents.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.550
So this is essentially
roadtripnation.org.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.460
There's a roadtripnation.com,
which is our public television

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.680
focused site and college
programs and

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.000
student facing site.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.440
Roadtripnation.org is the
educational resources that

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.910
school districts bring into
the classroom as a project

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.060
based learning curriculum.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.940
It's been aligned to the
Educational Standards for

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.300
English Language Arts.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.690
So it's like official on the
back end and funded by the

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.330
California Department of
Education and the Hewlett

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:34.970
Foundation.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.550
But on the front end, it feels
student based and exactly like

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.660
you would feel if you're living
in the motor home for

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.690
three months.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.450
So it's kind of a window into
what we hope is the future of

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.360
education, which is more for
students, by students

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.290
curriculum and programming
that really empowers and

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.490
galvanizes students on the front
end, rather than just

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.420
like hitting them with standards
and tests and

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.550
rubrics on the back end,
focusing more upstream on the

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.160
more self-efficacy, student
agency side of the equation,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.550
that will then help
them to engage.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.720
And then you start to see some
of those outcomes downstream,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.770
rather focusing it the
other way around.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.440
So essentially, the curriculum
is a three part curriculum.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.160
Part one is called exposure.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.800
Part two is called
self-construction.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.850
And part three is the
Roadtrip project.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.340
Part three is the component
where it's the big culminating

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.380
piece of actually going out,
in their communities, and

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.210
building these projects.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.040
But we knew, with a lot of the
populations that we were

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.870
serving, having them to
basically build a Roadtrip is

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.420
kind of like, sure, right.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.730
I'm going to go cold call the
mayor of my local town or like

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.680
an EMT technician.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.340
We realized we needed to
have some exploratory

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.660
experience up front.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.290
So for part one, what we did
was we had our staff go

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.310
through the entire interview
archive, of 1,100 interviews

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.410
over the last 10 years,
and start to take that

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.080
ethnographic approach of,
essentially, boiling down the

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.660
common themes and insights of
how these leaders have figured

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.500
out what they wanted to
do with their lives.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.380
We then took those themes and
boiled them down to what we

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.180
call the seven core axles of
Roadtrip Nation, which are

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.900
these real life insights, in
terms of how people have

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.340
figured out what they wanted
t do with their life.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:05.570
So if you didn't grow up with
Howard Schultz as your dad or

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.500
someone who had these incredible
insights, this is a

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.210
way to boil that down.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.570
And then each lesson--

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.630
like making it work,
we're going to

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.790
play here in a second--

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.700
is essentially boiled down into
these topical lessons,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.190
from the archive, along
this theme.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.100
So we're going to play one
sample lesson here, which is

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.480
making it work, which we heard
time and time again.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.200
This is a perfect commonality.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.690
Finding your road in life
is not always easy.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.420
It's not like you just
stick it, find your

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.490
dream, and make it happen.

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.100
Along the way, there are
lots of potholes.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.350
Being a bartender to pay
off financial aid.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.020
So here's an example
of that theme.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.410
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.110
-What I did is a series
of many odd jobs.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.740
I worked in a music store.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.650
I did all of these different
jobs, none of which were very

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:52.480
gratifying.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.200
And at night, I did what I
really wanted to do, which was

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.480
watch television and think about
it and have opinions and

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.880
bore people with my opinions
about what I thought.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.170
Over time, it just became
apparent that, gee, I seem to

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.540
know a lot about that or at
least I believed that I did.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.150
So I found myself
at a TV network.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:20.820
I took a massive pay cut
to deliver mail.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.850
And it really wasn't mail.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.860
They could have told me, we want
you to dig holes out in

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.800
the backyard, or we want
you to tie string

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.250
together all day long.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.690
But if there were TV monitors
in the vicinity, I would've

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.940
been happy.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.250
-[SPUTTERING ENGINE]

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.800
-Is that getting worse?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.540
-Yeah, we've put about
10,000 miles on it

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.220
in the past 6 weeks.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.390
-Well, I'd have to say major
engine work, from listening to

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.426
that, to be honest with you.

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:52.810
-Shh, it's OK.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:53.483
-I think it's just gone.

00:40:53.483 --> 00:40:55.320
It's on its last legs.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.160
-Look, unless someone's handing
you something, right

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.370
after you get out of school,
it's going to be tough for the

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.180
first couple of years.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.270
I've slept in every rest stop
along the Jersey turnpike.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.500
I had an alarm clock,
a comforter, and a

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.600
pillow in the back.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.790
I put my seat on recline.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.580
I had a portable toothbrush.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.780
I would take a bird bath
in the bathroom.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.320
I would show up at the radio
station, here, in New York,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.705
and I would do my shift.

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:23.830
-I ate, you know, in rotation,
tomato soup and SpaghettiOs

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.130
and tuna fish, every
day for a year.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.750
-Average day, I'd do
18 to 20 hour days.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:35.750
-The first five years of this
job were really, really

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.980
emotionally difficult for me.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.900
And so I remember going home, on
the train, my first years--

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.240
I shouldn't admit
this on camera--

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.610
crying a lot, because
it was so difficult.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.160
-I used to sit in my dorm, my
freshman year, I was so afraid

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.980
to leave to go brush my teeth,
that I would wait until I

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.270
heard everyone was sleeping, at
like 2:30-3:00 AM, just to

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.350
go brush my teeth, so I could
run back into my room.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.490
I was petrified of people.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.360
But I did have my dream of
being a broadcaster.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.900
And that's what kept
me on my path.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.790
-You might live in
an apartment that

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.790
is the size of this.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.900
You might not be able to
afford to buy clothes.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.420
None of that stuff
is important in

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.445
your grinding years.

00:42:18.445 --> 00:42:21.370
The things that you learn about
yourself on the way are

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.830
the most important things.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.810
-Ah, I got to go, got
to go, got to go.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.370
Every second that we try to find
this place, we're taking

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.166
time off the interview.

00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:38.505
-I drew for hours and endless
hours, every day, without

00:42:38.505 --> 00:42:41.920
fault, every day, seven days a
week, until I got my portfolio

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.010
pages right.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.170
But what happened was that I
was working at a lighting

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.000
design store.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.870
And a guy comes in who needed
some lighting for his studio.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:52.970
I asked him what kind
of art he does.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.860
And he says, well,
I work in comics.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.180
And I said, do you know anybody
at DC or at Marvel? he

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.310
says I know one guy at DC.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.940
He was just hired there.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.360
He's a brand new editor,
so don't expect a lot.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.980
So I went down there
with my portfolio.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.440
And the editor wouldn't even
see me in his office.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.690
So he met me in the lobby.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.110
And he's like, all right,
what have you got, kid?

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:13.910
What have you got?

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.080
And I opened up my portfolio.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.130
And he's like, holy mackerel,
this is good.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.270
He's like, wait here, right?

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:21.060
So he comes back.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.660
He's like, listen, you're
broke, aren't you?

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.990
I'm like, yeah, I'm
pretty broke.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.060
He's like, do an inventory
cover.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.740
Here are three characters that
appear in this story.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.850
Just give me a cover
with these three

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.530
characters, all right?

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.120
And come back when
you're finished.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.270
I went home.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:35.190
I finished the cover
overnight.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.140
And I was at his doorstep,
at DC, first

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.180
thing in the morning.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.870
Once again, he meets me in the
hallway, in the lobby.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.650
He's like, what are
you doing here?

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:44.990
I'm like, here's your cover.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.665
He's like, I didn't
need it overnight.

00:43:46.665 --> 00:43:49.030
I'm like, here's your cover.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.010
And he looks at me.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.270
And I had these really
sad, puppy dog eyes.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.890
And he's like, you need
a job, don't you?

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.390
I'm like, yeah.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.090
He's like, man, I'm sorry.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.520
I've got nothing.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.370
But I'll tell you what.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.950
Wait out here.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.450
I'll ask around the office,
see if somebody's got

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.040
something but don't
hold your breath.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.940
I'm like, OK.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.725
So I'm literally sitting in the
lobby, it must have been

00:44:09.725 --> 00:44:11.040
an hour plus.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.890
And the receptionist picks
up the phone, and

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.680
she goes, OK, OK.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:13.885
And she hangs up.

00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:15.740
She's like, are you
Joe Quesada?

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.370
I'm like, yeah.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.350
She's like, Mr. [? Alsey ?]
would like to

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.005
see you in his office.

00:44:20.005 --> 00:44:20.810
I'm like, OK.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.980
So I trot on over
to the office.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.580
And I'll never forget this.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.370
As long as I live, I will
never forget this.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:26.910
I walk through the door.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:27.880
And he looks at me.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.560
He's like, what art the odds
that while you're waiting out

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.970
there, one of my two artists,
on my two books,

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.390
just calls and quits?

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.010
I'm like, it's pretty
astronomical.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.292
He's like, what are the
odds that I'm going

00:44:40.292 --> 00:44:41.420
to offer you a job?

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.540
I'm like, next to nil.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.490
He's like, you want the job?

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:44.290
I'm like, sure.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.520
-If you hadn't got that cover
done the night before?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.200
-Exactly.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.440
My whole life would be
completely different.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.240
-That's incredible.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.750
-I may have gotten a day job
that would've distracted me,

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.230
whatever it may be.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.240
I firmly also believe though
that, if you have the desire

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.340
and the passion, which
I did, I would have

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.410
eventually broken in.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.980
Some people are just incredibly,
naturally talented

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.160
and are born athletes or are
born singers or are born

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.665
artists and they can just, one
day, sit down and just do it.

00:45:10.665 --> 00:45:14.080
But those are the one
in a kazillion that

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.530
can actually do that.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.850
Everyone else on planet Earth
has to work really, really

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.610
hard for it.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.120
-You know, as far as like
working, work ethic, you have

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.735
to work hard.

00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:23.600
You know what I mean, like
always work hard?

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.340
Don't expect anybody to
give you anything.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.825
-It's not like I walked into MTV
and I was like, whoo, I'm

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.010
directing two weeks later.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.550
I mean, I worked my butt
off for a long time.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:38.050
-If you think of your situation
as being like a

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.140
tripod, on three legs
that hit the ground.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.970
And each of those
legs has a name.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.250
And one of them is luck.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.810
The other one is talent.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.970
And the other one
is hard work.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.910
Although one of those things
will get you into a situation,

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.640
as quickly as possible, you
have to get another one of

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.680
those tripod legs
on the ground.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.230
-You just have to run at
something until something is

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.510
talking to your heart loudly
enough that you won't even

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.200
have to wonder if it's
the right thing.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.770
But you have to run
pretty hard.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.760
And you have to be a moron
along the way.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.450
And you have to accept that
there's going to be a lot of

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:17.140
wasted time and energy and that
that is not a bad thing.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.570
-It is more important to me to
fulfill this larger goal,

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.890
which I wanted Chicago to have
a Shakespeare theater.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:30.200
And so I always came back to
that, in saying, you know

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.330
what, so you're crying.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.230
So you had a horrible day.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.460
But you're still doing something
that, if you left,

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.800
you might never forgive
yourself.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.390
-There was something in me that
just said, you're not

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.310
going to fail.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.870
It's just how long is it
going to be hard for?

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:50.290
-Like anything else in
life, it's a huge

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:50.740
roller coaster ride.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.230
There can be high times, low
times, happy times, sad times.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:59.830
-Will.i.am wore my shoe to,
I think, the BET Awards.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:02.860
The shoe got on display
at the DNC.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.620
And then like the first big
thing to happen was the

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.600
Smithsonian emailing me.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.562
And I thought it was a joke.

00:47:07.562 --> 00:47:08.110
I was saying, no.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:11.030
I had to call the lady and
say, are you serious?

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:16.030
You want my shoe in the large
museum in the world, a painted

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.400
tennis shoe that I did?

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.950
And she was like,
yes, we want it.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:19.630
It's beautiful.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.420
And I cried.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.520
I was like, I was almost
homeless in January.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.992
Had I quit a month before I made
that shoe, if I quit an

00:47:28.992 --> 00:47:31.510
hour before I made that shoe
and decided, I'm just going

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.560
forget my art, this would've
never happened.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.290
I could've quit.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.705
I was about to be kicked
out of my house.

00:47:37.705 --> 00:47:40.150
And I didn't quit and then
look what happened.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.020
-One thing that does give me
satisfaction, when I sit back

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.010
and think about what could have
happened, what if I'd

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:50.680
just got a job doing something
that I didn't enjoy and stayed

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.120
back in Boston and was with the
guys I grew up with and

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.740
didn't really evolve and grow
and change and be the person I

00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.270
could've been?

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.930
That give me satisfaction, when
I look back and go, wow,

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:02.960
I don't even really work.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.860
I'm doing what I love to do.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.400
It's fun.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.260
-The UG named me reporter
of the year, last year.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.000
And I can't believe it.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.130
I can't believe that I'm getting
to do exactly what I

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:14.050
wanted to do.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.340
I'm seriously, seriously
living my dreams.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.200
See, I'm getting emotional.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.140
Because I really didn't think
this was going to happen.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.190
And it's happening.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.270
So to you guys, I say,
just keep fighting,

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.734
keep doing your thing.

MIKE MARRINER: --a third
of the curriculum.

00:48:33.054 --> 00:48:35.440
That's mostly based on the 10
years of Roadtrip Nation

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.570
content and interviews.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.850
The curriculum culminates with
a project based learning

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.400
experience, where students
build their own

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.050
local Roadtrip projects.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.870
And we're going to show you
one example video, now.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.890
And this is the part that's been
really exciting for us.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.530
Over the last three years, we've
had a 100,000 students

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.630
in schools, across 22 states,
building these Roadtrip

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.955
projects, as part of their
classroom assignments, mostly

00:48:55.955 --> 00:48:58.790
in English language arts or
advisory periods, or 8th to

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.240
9th grade transition programs,
right at the point where a lot

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.630
of students are really in danger
of dropping out and

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.620
seeing the relevance of
why I'm in education

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.010
in the first place.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.370
But here's an example.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.180
And this is on YouTube.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.120
So YouTube, we're also launching
some really new,

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.190
exciting partnerships with
YouTube, here at Google, which

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.590
is exciting, as well.

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.670
But here's an example of how
we started to see students,

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:21.730
cross the country, doing
Roadtrip Nation Projects and

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.110
releasing them through
YouTube.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:23.420
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.800
-If you live in San Diego, you
know Sam, Sam the cooking guy.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.050
A couple of Hoover students
decided to get the 411 on how

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.490
Sam got to be a local
TV celebrity.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:38.070
This is our Roadtrip Nation
project, San Diego style.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.760
-I was 40 when I figured
it out, 40.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.290
I had no clue the rest
of the time.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.760
And I did like five different
things trying to just keep

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.140
myself from going crazy
and figuring out how

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.460
to make some money.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:57.350
But it took me to get to that
age before I finally went holy

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.570
[INAUDIBLE], this is like,
maybe this could work.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.950
MIKE MARRINER: Just to end on
impact, what we've been

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.860
learning, lately, in education,
is that you can't

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.650
just go into the education world
and say, we're going to

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.820
inspire people.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.810
There's a responsibility, when
you're working with students,

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:13.890
especially students in the
communities where we work.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.905
And so over the last year, the
Hewlett Foundation has funded

00:50:16.905 --> 00:50:19.615
a third party efficacy study on
Roadtrip Nation's expansion

00:50:19.615 --> 00:50:21.990
and proliferation through
these school systems and

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.670
trying to really ascertain,
what is the impact we're

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.390
really having on
these students?

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.510
And essentially, what
they've been

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:29.130
finding is that students--

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.170
through different modalities,
in terms of how they've

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.420
researched this--

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.530
self-efficacy rates, which is,
essentially, students'

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:40.790
self-belief in their ability to
solve complex problems and

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.780
more the non-cognitive senses,
in terms of their belief in

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.980
themselves and their futures,
have increased

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.920
at significant rates.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.440
But also, their GPA rates
have been increasing.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.470
So this study just came out
last week, by a Dr. David

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:55.000
[? Connelly ?].

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.480
But it found that students, in
a comparison study, in San

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.960
Jose Unified School District,
in credit recovery settings,

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.230
the most at-risk students,
when the Roadtrip Nation

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.330
students, over a nine month
period, had twice the rate of

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:09.320
GPA increase, when compared to
the non-Roadtrip students, in

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.240
the exact same socioeconomic
and demographic settings.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.120
And the researcher said this
was interesting, because

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.140
Roadtrip Nation, nowhere in
our curriculum do we say,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.720
study hard, get good grades,
follow the standards, all

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.190
those things.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.000
It's all kind of connected to
the new common core standards

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.220
for ELA anchor standards on the
back end, so it's legit

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.520
from a district standpoint.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.630
But we focus more on the
self-efficacy component.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.110
Students taking ownership over
their futures and actually

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.100
being an active participant in
what they want to do with

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:34.800
their life.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.450
And by focusing on those more
upstream, self-efficacy

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.780
factors, we start to see
downstream academic gain start

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.030
to increase.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.365
It's an interesting part of
the journey for Roadtrip

00:51:45.365 --> 00:51:47.250
Nation, because.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.910
It is our 10th year anniversary

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:49.616
for Roadtrip Nation.

00:51:49.616 --> 00:51:52.720
But we really feel like it's
beginning of an entire new 10

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.980
year chapter, where
were continuing to

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.250
proliferate the movement.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.100
And we're just scratching the
surface on what we can do.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.210
So we just want to thank you
guys for staying here for

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.700
lunch and listening
to our story.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.230
And if you guys have any
questions, we're here to give

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:11.170
you a sense of how the heck
where we're doing this.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:14.420
AUDIENCE: I had a quick question
about if you saw

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.160
difference, with the economy
going down and coming back up,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.970
in this last 10 years, and
how that impacted your

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.730
conversations, with both the
people you're interviewing and

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:24.980
then the students?

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.410
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think it was
interesting, because, when we

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:35.410
started, it was just
before the crash.

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.170
And it was all like, every
single magazine, every

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.190
business cover was like how
to hire the best people.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.660
And it was a totally, incredibly
competitive place.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.510
But I think, as a young person
getting out of college and

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.010
trying to find that first job,
there was still that question

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.590
in your mind of like, do I take
that huge signing bonus,

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:55.020
salary job that my parents will
be really excited about?

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.340
Or do I take this thing that I
actually really care about?

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.730
And I think, regardless of the
economic times, those same

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:02.660
questions are asked.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.150
And the realities, obviously,
are different.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:07.220
And there's more compromise
that each of us, as

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.270
individuals, have to take
in certain situations.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.370
But those fundamental questions,
of who am I and

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:15.550
what's important to me and do
I make these decisions for

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:20.860
myself or for other people, I
don't think those ever change.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.570
BRIAN MCALLISTER: I would
also add, too--

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.770
and perhaps it's more of a
generational thing than an

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.130
economic crisis--

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.070
but people want to be involved
in mission-driven companies.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.950
The mission-driven side,
CSR, corporate social

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.760
responsibility, starting
to become really hot.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.160
And a lot of the generations
that we're working with, I

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.460
mean, the college students, they
really want to be a part

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.620
of something bigger, that was
sustainable, that had a

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.220
lasting impression, that had
a lasting footprint.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.860
And I think that was something
that we were really hearing

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.580
from both sides.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.800
And I think some of it was
probably driven from the

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.560
economic side.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.790
But I think a lot of this
younger generation we're

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.350
working with, they want to be
a part of something that was

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.280
going last the test of time.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.190
So I think mission-driven is
starting to become a pretty

00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:59.810
big theme, as you guys know.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.980
MIKE MARRINER: And that last
theme of making it work, we've

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.930
seen that be more pervasive
as well.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.070
You can follow what it is you're
really passionate about

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:07.920
and define your own road.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.340
But you've got to find a
way to make it work.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.050
That's why that whole theme in
the curriculum was called,

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:11.780
making it work.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.690
Because, essentially, you might
see someone who's the

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:18.660
director of "Saturday Night
Live," but what you also need

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.290
to hear is that she worked at
the Gap, for two years, during

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.890
the holidays, so she
could pay her rent.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.850
Because she was getting
paid next to

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.840
nothing doing her thing.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.080
And I'm sure even guys, like the
roots of Google, you see

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:29.940
this huge thing today.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.790
But I'm sure, in the early
days, there was a lot of

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.650
making it work that had to
happen, whether it was

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.210
starting it out of a garage or
whatever, not being in this

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.110
big, fancy office building.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:41.780
In America, we're so success
obsessed, in our culture, we

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.730
kind of forget those parts
of the story, like

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:45.180
the groveling periods.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.660
And I think that we've really
tried to celebrate that with

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.500
Roadtrip Nation, where we're
looking back on these people

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.680
stories as like, these are the
grinding times, when, yes,

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.210
they may have taken a
really tough path.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:57.920
But how do we inspire and
empower the next generation of

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.360
leaders, too?

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.170
Who's going to be the next
person that cures cancer?

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.180
What if there's a kid out there
who has a real genius

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.750
instinct for science, but who
never really connected with

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:10.580
that interest, because, A, there
was too much noise and

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.300
pressure around them to not go
away to college, to stay home

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.830
and be with family,
or, B, that it's

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:16.850
going to be too hard.

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:18.440
I don't want to make it work.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.120
Getting my Ph.D.?

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.750
No freaking way.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.810
I'm going to go do something
much easier.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.220
So what we're trying
to is decipher all

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.130
these stories down.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:28.890
And I think that, as culture
changes, there is some kind of

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:29.830
tonality shifts.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.770
But I think, per Nate's point, a
lot of the core ethos remain

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.690
pretty consistent.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:36.400
AUDIENCE: Have you ever thought
to expand this program

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.650
internationally?

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.530
MIKE MARRINER: Yes.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.910
We have done a few international
Roadtrips.

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.480
We actually started to tone
it back a little bit, only

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.660
because we realized that
America is so big.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.860
And now that we've really
gotten into the

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.750
heavy lifting work.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.570
I mean, talk about hard work,
like education, that is really

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.840
hard, complicated,
incredible work.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.840
And so when we started to see
how, over the last 3 years,

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.150
we've expanded to 22 states.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:02.700
And that has taken
all of our focus.

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.400
So Roadtrip Nation, it's much
bigger than just Nate,

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.150
Brian, and I now.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:07.220
We have 40 employees.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.600
We have an office based down
in Southern California, in

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.250
Costa Mesa, right between
LA and San.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:14.710
Diego and we have 40, totally
dedicated, passionate

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.930
individual who are building
this, editing the footage,

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:20.070
implementing the curriculum,
working with the schools,

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.880
researching the data,
all of that.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.250
And so I think we've seen the
need to focus that effort,

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.390
domestically, for now.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.870
But we do, ultimately, have a
vision of going to countries

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:32.880
around the world that really,
obviously, where their youth

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.100
are in high need of figuring
out what their

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.140
futures are as well.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.870
AUDIENCE: To what degree have
you found that it's not just

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.310
adversity that people are
overcoming but also a sense of

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.070
diversity in their lives, or in
their work experience and

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:47.330
stuff like that, that's really
helped fuel them or push them

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:48.580
onto their ultimate careers?

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:52.320
NATHAN GEBHARD: Diversity?

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.630
In what sense do you mean?

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:56.430
AUDIENCE: Diversity and like
difference in things they've

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.590
done or experiences that
they've had and stuff.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.670
Because I think we hear that
constant plea of follow your

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:02.980
passion and that
kind of thing.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.100
But part of it is, sometimes,
people maybe--

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.610
it's not like they don't have
passions or particular

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:09.710
passions, but they don't really
know what their passion

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.930
is or where they would
find that.

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:16.390
So in experiencing a diverse
life or diverse jobs or a

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.770
diverse career paths and that
kind of thing can sometimes

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.370
lead you then to, eventually,
what it is

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:24.620
that you really love.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.870
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think I would
say that diversity, that

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:32.860
ability and that comfort to kind
of just be OK wandering

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.025
is something that an
instructor or a

00:57:37.025 --> 00:57:39.730
counselor or a parent--

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:42.020
it's hard advice to
give to somebody.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.630
But I think, as we've
interviewed so many people,

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.370
that's the reality
of their life.

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:52.200
I mean I think that sense of
just bumping into things is a

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.410
really important part.

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:56.210
And I think what we've seen is
that the people that are

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.110
comfortable following their own
compass and then having

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.470
that diversity of experience,
those are the ones that start

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:05.380
on one thing and then realize,
oh, well, there's something

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.690
about this that's interesting.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:07.880
And there's something
about this.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.400
And if I put them together,
I'll get here.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.900
But those that take that linear
path often miss those

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.840
other opportunities.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.150
So I think some of the most
interesting people have been

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.580
comfortable wandering
and changing careers

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.430
and starting over.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.930
And there's countless examples
of people that we've had that

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.870
have had that exact
experience.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:28.570
AUDIENCE: I know you primarily
targeted schoolchildren and

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:29.980
people who were starting up.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.840
What's your experience with
people who are in a midlife

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.110
crisis or who need to figure
out the next thing?

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.970
They had like a mindless,
corporate job for majority of

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.880
their lives.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.380
Not Google, by the way.

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.440
So what's your experience
been?

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.990
MIKE MARRINER: Our mission,
very intentionally, is to

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:51.520
empower people to define their
own roads in life.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.400
We've only been really focusing
on students, because

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.410
they're so vulnerable at that
age, especially in certain

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.560
geographical locations
around America.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.540
If you don't focus on some
demographics of students, like

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.170
the alternate thing is a student
that drops out of high

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.080
school is eight times as likely
to be more incarcerated

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.120
or living on welfare or to have
kids that are also on

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.870
welfare and be incarcerated.

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:15.650
But we hear, all the time,
because of the PBS series, the

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.260
demographic is a little
bit older.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.460
And we hear, all the time, that
the message is timeless.

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.560
The messages is you don't just
define your own road in life

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.010
when you're 18 years old, and
then you like stick it, great,

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.110
no big deal.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.600
Defining your own road
in life happens

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.600
throughout your entire life.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.020
And so especially when you get
in your 30s, 40s, 50s and you

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.760
have this wealth of experience,
just kind of being

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.300
open and pliable and taking a
lot of these same ethos and

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.840
themes and applying them
to your own life.

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.200
Like Nate was saying, mashing
it up, having more

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.280
experiences, be comfortable
with wandering.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.590
I think that we absolutely
see as a lifelong piece.

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.110
NATHAN GEBHARD: I think one
story that comes to mind is

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.780
the founder of Sam Adams.

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.230
He was a consultant.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.340
And I think he was at Bain
Capital, I think.

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.360
MIKE MARRINER: Boston
Consulting Group.

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.450
NATHAN GEBHARD: Boston
Consulting Group.

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.270
And here he was, going
through the machine.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.370
He was part of that machine.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:06.360
And there are consultants that
absolutely love what they do.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.240
But he just wasn't
one of them.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.180
And when the Roadtrippers
were asking him like,

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.150
what about that risk?

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.970
You leave this really high
paying job, and you're going

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.310
to go brew beer in your
mom's kitchen?

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.620
And you watched him pause
for a while and

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.350
really think about it.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.295
And I loved his reaction.

01:00:21.295 --> 01:00:23.840
And his reaction was, the bigger
risk would have been

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.110
staying and doing something that
I didn't love then taking

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:30.600
this risk in brewing beer
in my mom's kitchen.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.250
And I think that it's the
clarity and the confidence

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.090
that need to come together
in those moments.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.740
And so the exposure we have is
that, while it's young people

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.270
roadtripping, we're talking
to people that

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:43.110
have figured it out.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:44.740
So we're getting it
on both ends.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.980
But that's an example
that comes to mind.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.890
We can chill, too.

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.290
AUDIENCE: Why, I was going to
say, to close, what is the

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:55.210
number one tip you have for
driving an RV across your 10

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.290
years of experience?

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.910
MIKE MARRINER: RV driving
is a team sport.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:01.180
That was our whole thing.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.630
I think that our first road trip
prepared us for building

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:04.770
a business together.

01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:07.550
Because if you can get a motor
home, especially a 30 year old

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.700
motor home, around the
country in one piece.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:13.720
And the same thing, like when
you're driving down the road,

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.230
blind spot is an
understatement.

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.770
I mean you really can't see when
you're changing lanes.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:20.520
So if you're going to change
lanes, it's like, I'm going to

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.160
change lanes.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.260
So someone's out the window,
please, don't.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.490
I'm coming in.

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:27.640
NATHAN GEBHARD: The oddest thing
is there's a rearview

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.740
mirror in an RV.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.610
But you can't.

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:30.870
There's no.

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.290
You only look at the person
sitting on the

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.180
couch behind you.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.500
BRIAN MCALLISTER: I would
say, don't wait

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.680
until you master it.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.890
It's a work in progress.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.170
And that might be
a deep metaphor.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.830
But you got to hit the road,
sooner or later.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:48.200
And I would say, don't wait
until you've got it all

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.590
figured out.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.790
Because, when you get to Boston,
and there's no grids

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.350
there, you're screwed.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:55.110
So just train as you go.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.280
NATHAN GEBHARD: I would say be
comfortable getting lost.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.560
I think that's something that
actually I have a complaint

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.140
about with the GPS is that
you don't get lost.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.850
And the number of times that we
had meaningful experiences

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.040
when we just got lost.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.360
We've lost those lost moments.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.060
And so I think, in life or in
driving, get lost every once

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.530
in a while.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.840
MALE SPEAKER: On that note,
thank you very much for

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.600
speaking with us today.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.200
Amazing speech.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.405
[APPLAUSE]
