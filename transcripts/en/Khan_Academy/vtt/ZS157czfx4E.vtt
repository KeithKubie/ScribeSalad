00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.630
So we're told that Minli
has $5.00 more than James.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.730
Minli has $33.00.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.160
How much does James have?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.150
So let's use some letters to
represent the amount of money

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.020
Minli has and the amount
of money James has.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.300
So let's say that m
represents the amount of money

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.010
that Minli has.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.390
And j represents the
amount that James has.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.760
So we're told that Minli
has $5.00 more than James.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.770
So Minli's money, or the
amount of money Minli has,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.270
is going to be equal
to the amount of money

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.648
James has plus 5.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.630
Start with the amount James has.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.310
Add 5, you have Minli's.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.440
Minli has $5.00 more than James.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.400
Now they tell us,
Minli has $33.00.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.790
So let me write this down.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.800
So we know that m is equal to--
so this the sentence right here

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.197
tells us, this right here tells
us, that m is equal to $33.00.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.780
So instead of an m
here, we could say,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.205
well $33.00 is equal to the
amount of money James has plus

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:15.967
5.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:17.550
And so now we just
need to think about

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.110
how much money does James have.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.693
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:22.280
and think about it on your own.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.860
Well, one way to visualize
this is maybe on a number line.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.020
So let me draw a number
line right over here.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.200
And let's say this is 0.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.460
This is the amount that
Minli has right up here.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.290
So Minli has $33.00.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.930
That represents that
point right over here.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.600
And j is the amount
the James has.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.700
So let's say that this
is j right over here.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.470
And we know that if we add 5
to j-- if you take j, add 5,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.150
you get to 33.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.410
Well how can I go to 33?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.110
How can I start
with m or how can I

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.100
start with the amount
Minli has and then end up

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.429
with the amount James has?

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.220
Well, I could just go
the other way around.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.370
I could start with m,
and I could subtract 5.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.070
So we could say that 33, which
is m, the amount of money

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.170
Minli has, minus 5, is
equal to the amount of money

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.840
that James has.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.030
So how much money
does James have?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.110
Well, 33 minus 5
is going to be 28.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.500
So we can say that James
has, 28 is equal to j,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.860
or James has $28.00.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.742
So this right over here is 28.

00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:41.450
And you see that.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.630
28 plus 5 is 33.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.360
33 is 5 more than 28.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.955
So this all works out.

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:51.210
Now let's think about
this next question.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.500
Jessica's house
is 5 times as far

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.790
from school as Paulette's house.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.110
Jessica's house is
15 miles from school.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.750
How far is Paulette's
house from the school?

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.420
So just like we did, let's just
look at each of these sentences

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.753
and see what they're telling us.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.220
And I encourage you to
define use of letters

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.080
to represent the distance
Jessica's house from school

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.550
and Paulette's
house from school.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.900
And try to figure
this out on your own.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.316
Pause the video
right now, and try

00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:16.930
to figure it out on your own.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.250
So you could imagine j might
be a good letter for Jessica's,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.770
the distance from
Jessica's house to school.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.170
And let's say that p we'll
use for Paulette's house

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.530
from school.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.940
So we're told that, however
far Paulette's house

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.260
is from school, you
take 5 times that

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.220
to see how far Jessica's
house is from school.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.680
So we could write that p, which
is how far Paulette's house is

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.770
from school, times 5, is equal
to how far Jessica's house is

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.650
from school.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.240
Jessica's house is 5
times as far from school

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.790
as Paulette's house. p is
Paulette's house's distance

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.390
from school.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.670
j is Jessica's house's
distance from school.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.350
They then tell us that Jessica's
house is 15 miles from school.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.700
So they're essentially telling
us, this sentence right

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.710
over here, they're telling
us that j is equal to 15.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.919
So we can rewrite this as
the distance Paulette's house

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.860
is from school times
5, which we know

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.930
to be Jessica's
distance from school,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.910
or Jessica's house's
distance from school,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.830
which we now know to be 15,
is going to be equal to 15.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.630
So what would p be?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.320
Some number times 5 is
going to be equal to 15.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.524
Some number of miles times
5 is equal to 15 miles.

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.190
Well, you might already
be able to think

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.190
about this in your head, but
we could also visualize it.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.110
So let's draw a
number line again.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.040
And if you start
with that number,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.430
p-- so this is Paulette's
distance from school so, p--

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.770
and you multiply it by 5.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.510
So that's times 1, times 2,
times 3, times 4, times 5.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.070
So notice this is p, this
distance is p right over here,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.790
this is another p
right over here,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.880
this is another p
right over here,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.810
that's another p
right over there,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.860
and another p right over there.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.360
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.818
this whole distance
right over here

00:05:23.818 --> 00:05:29.045
is going to be p plus p plus
p plus p plus p, or p times 5.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.710
And that's equal to how
far Jessica is from school,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.550
or Jessica's house
is from school.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.900
So this right over
here is equal to 15,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.480
which is the same thing as j.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.960
So how would you figure it out?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.360
Well, if 5 times
p is equal to 15--

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.800
if I want to figure
out what p is,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.890
I could just divide 15
into 5 equal groups.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:01.080
So we could say that
p is equal to 15

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.100
divided into 5 equal groups.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.300
If you take 15 miles and
divide it into 5 equal groups,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.130
you're going to end up with p.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.400
So what is this?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.800
Well, we get p, 15
divided by 5 is 3.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.722
So Paulette lives 3
miles from school.

00:06:18.722 --> 00:06:19.430
And you see that.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.610
This is a 3, another 3,
another 3, plus another 3,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.425
and another 3.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.460
3 time 5 is 15.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.730
Jessica's house, which
is 15 miles from school,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.080
is 5 times as far from
school as Paulette's house,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.960
which is 3 miles from school
so it all makes sense.
