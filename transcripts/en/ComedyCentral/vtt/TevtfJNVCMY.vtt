00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.538
- THE NEXT REVIEW REQUEST
COMES TO US VIA TWITTER

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.206
FROM @BUBBLEBATHS.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.574
- AH, AND WHAT WOULD
@BUBBLEBATHS

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:08.775
LIKE TO SEE ME REVIEW?

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.311
- THE TWEET SAYS...

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.218
- IS THERE--IS THERE MORE
TO THAT, OR IS THAT--

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.354
- NO.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.222
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.791
- THERE ALL IS--YEAH.
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.094
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.730
- [laughs] YEAH, WELL,
IT'S GOOD THAT I'M THE REVIEWER

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.366
IN SITUATIONS
EXACTLY LIKE THIS

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.870
SO THAT I CAN OFFER
UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO...

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.605
"THERE ALL IS ACHING."

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.575
AND HERE I GO,
DOING EXACTLY THAT.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.778
GOOD.
- OOH.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.114
- "THERE ALL IS ACHING."

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.250
THIS WAS CLEARLY SOME KIND
OF COMPLICATED CODE.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:53.987
THE BACKWARDS PHRASING WAS LIKE
A COMBINATION OF A ZEN KOAN,

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.758
YODA'S CRYPTIC ADVICE, AND ALEX
TREBEK'S QUESTION-ANSWERS.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.494
I DECIDED TO ADOPT
THAT SAME MANNER OF SPEECH

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.962
IN ORDER TO HAVE AN AUTHENTIC

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.131
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"
EXPERIENCE.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:08.068
ON RYE TOAST,
B.L.T. ORDERING.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.071
- SAY WHAT?

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.608
- UH...MAYONNAISE HAVING,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.612
BUT NOT MUCH TOO, THINK I.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.647
- I'M GONNA GET YOU
A COBB SALAD.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.483
- AH, PRODUCER BATHROOM
IS GOING.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.652
- DID YOU HAVE A STROKE?

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:29.756
- FORREST FINE, I'M FEELING.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.460
- SIRI, STROKE DOCTORS
IN MY AREA.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.128
- ARE YOU EXPERIENCING
ANY MEMORY LOSS?

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.164
- FIDDLE I FIT AS I'M FEELING.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.533
"THERE ALL IS ACHING"
WAS PROVING

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.969
TO BE A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE
TO REVIEW.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.304
BUT I WAS HOPEFUL THAT AN EXPERT
IN THE HUMAN BRAIN

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.639
COULD HELP MAKE SENSE OF IT.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.841
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING
SO STRANGELY?

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.810
- "THERE ALL IS ACHING."

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.345
SENSE MAKE TO YOU?

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.848
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- THERE ALL IS ACHING.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:58.151
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- THERE ALL IS ACHING.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.420
- HMM.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.124
- MY COMMITMENT
TO "THERE ALL IS ACHING"

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.227
HAD APPARENTLY MADE ME
A DANGER TO MYSELF AND OTHERS,

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.563
AT LEAST IN THE EYES
OF ONE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:13.300
BUT I WAS EAGER TO FOLLOW THIS
EXPERIENCE WHEREVER IT TOOK ME.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.969
[screams]

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.538
THERE ALL IS ACHING!

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.239
DO NOT UNDERSTAND TOPIC!

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.675
NURSE, WHY ARE SMILING?

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.910
WHY ARE SMILING, NURSE?

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:24.811
[screams]

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.814
[cheerful music]

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.516
