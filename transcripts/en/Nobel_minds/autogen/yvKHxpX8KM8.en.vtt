and we start again now in a session
called paying for truths and paying for

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
called paying for truths and paying for
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.609
called paying for truths and paying for
truths is some a term which can have

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
truths is some a term which can have
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.359
truths is some a term which can have
many kinds of interpretations and what

many kinds of interpretations and what
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.000
many kinds of interpretations and what
we will try and discuss today with Helga

Novotny and Bharat Stein is what those
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090
Novotny and Bharat Stein is what those
different interpretations are and what

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
different interpretations are and what
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.639
different interpretations are and what
it means to us in different spheres

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649
it means to us in different spheres
 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.319

all over Europe and Bharat Stein is now

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
all over Europe and Bharat Stein is now
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.650
all over Europe and Bharat Stein is now
from our very own Gothenburg here and he

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
from our very own Gothenburg here and he
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.029
from our very own Gothenburg here and he
was recently at Oxford University and he

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
was recently at Oxford University and he
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220
was recently at Oxford University and he
deals with very important questions of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
deals with very important questions of
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009
deals with very important questions of
ethics and society and how we make

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
ethics and society and how we make
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140
ethics and society and how we make
decisions about those kinds of matters

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
decisions about those kinds of matters
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.830
decisions about those kinds of matters
so from science and society we have

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
so from science and society we have
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800
so from science and society we have
views on how what paying for truth means

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
views on how what paying for truth means
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.510
views on how what paying for truth means
a painful truth could mean three things

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520
a painful truth could mean three things
 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.310
a painful truth could mean three things
how do we build institutions how do we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
how do we build institutions how do we
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.300
how do we build institutions how do we
pay for them where truth and all signs

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
pay for them where truth and all signs
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.660
pay for them where truth and all signs
are all kinds of ideas can be discussed

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
are all kinds of ideas can be discussed
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.270
are all kinds of ideas can be discussed
secondly paying for truth means that if

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
secondly paying for truth means that if
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280
secondly paying for truth means that if
you speak the truth you could be paying

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
you speak the truth you could be paying
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830
you speak the truth you could be paying
for it you could be in trouble how does

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
for it you could be in trouble how does
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480
for it you could be in trouble how does
one deal with those kinds of situations

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
one deal with those kinds of situations
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.630
one deal with those kinds of situations
and thirdly you could pay to create your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
and thirdly you could pay to create your
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480
and thirdly you could pay to create your
own version of the truth so let's find

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
own version of the truth so let's find
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420
own version of the truth so let's find
out what our panelists think about these

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
out what our panelists think about these
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789
out what our panelists think about these
three versions of paying for the truth

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
three versions of paying for the truth
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880
three versions of paying for the truth
so first of all Helga how do we build

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
so first of all Helga how do we build
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.050
so first of all Helga how do we build
institutions where truths can be

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
institutions where truths can be
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.920
institutions where truths can be
discussed safely and with multiple ideas

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
discussed safely and with multiple ideas
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920
discussed safely and with multiple ideas
coming forth but we have started some

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
coming forth but we have started some
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.830
coming forth but we have started some
400 years ago or some people say even

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
400 years ago or some people say even
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.889
400 years ago or some people say even
longer when the first universities came

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
longer when the first universities came
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.029
longer when the first universities came
about in the 12th or 13th century but

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
about in the 12th or 13th century but
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.990
about in the 12th or 13th century but
since modern science we have also

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
since modern science we have also
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.680
since modern science we have also
universities or other places were in a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
universities or other places were in a
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.520
universities or other places were in a
systematic way we explore first the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530
systematic way we explore first the
 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190
systematic way we explore first the
natural world and then later on also the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
natural world and then later on also the
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.670
natural world and then later on also the
social world or ourselves so we have

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
social world or ourselves so we have
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.520
social world or ourselves so we have
these institutions we call them

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
these institutions we call them
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.710
these institutions we call them
scientific institutions universities

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720
scientific institutions universities
 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.250
scientific institutions universities
research institutions etc now what is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
research institutions etc now what is
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.789
research institutions etc now what is
peculiar is if you go to any lab or to

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799
peculiar is if you go to any lab or to
 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.300
peculiar is if you go to any lab or to
any university you will not find many

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
any university you will not find many
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.339
any university you will not find many
people apart from the philosophy

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
people apart from the philosophy
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.220
people apart from the philosophy
department where people actually discuss

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
department where people actually discuss
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.479
department where people actually discuss
truth if you go to a lab what people are

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
truth if you go to a lab what people are
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.020
truth if you go to a lab what people are
discussing all the time is does it work

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
discussing all the time is does it work
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.229
discussing all the time is does it work
or does it not work you set up an

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239
or does it not work you set up an
 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.199
or does it not work you set up an
experiment and you're interested does it

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
experiment and you're interested does it
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.620
experiment and you're interested does it
work so of course there is something

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
work so of course there is something
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.530
work so of course there is something
underneath it because you are not just

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
underneath it because you are not just
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.220
underneath it because you are not just
setting things up in a random way you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
setting things up in a random way you
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.920
setting things up in a random way you
need years of training to know what you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930
need years of training to know what you
 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.120
need years of training to know what you
are doing you need years of also

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130
are doing you need years of also
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.490
are doing you need years of also
training in terms of a discipline or

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
training in terms of a discipline or
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.129
training in terms of a discipline or
more than one discipline etc to have

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139
more than one discipline etc to have
 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.140
more than one discipline etc to have
this kind of knowledge and and the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150
this kind of knowledge and and the
 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.190
this kind of knowledge and and the
skills to produce something and to come

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
skills to produce something and to come
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.020
skills to produce something and to come
back to your question you know who pays

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
back to your question you know who pays
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.000
back to your question you know who pays
for it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
for it
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.379
for it
modern societies don't pay for truth by

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389
modern societies don't pay for truth by
 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.870
modern societies don't pay for truth by
setting up these institutions they are

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
setting up these institutions they are
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.840
setting up these institutions they are
interested in the technological output

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
interested in the technological output
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.539
interested in the technological output
they are interested in the kind of

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549
they are interested in the kind of
 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.819
they are interested in the kind of
knowledge that comes from these

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829
knowledge that comes from these
 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.819
knowledge that comes from these
institutions for the sake of human

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829
institutions for the sake of human
 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.550
institutions for the sake of human
betterment to make us more healthy to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
betterment to make us more healthy to
 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.129
betterment to make us more healthy to
cure certain diseases to make progress

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139
cure certain diseases to make progress
 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.949
cure certain diseases to make progress
in the way even the Grand Challenges

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
in the way even the Grand Challenges
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.949
in the way even the Grand Challenges
today that we are facing so we turned to

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959
today that we are facing so we turned to
 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.490
today that we are facing so we turned to
these institutions to look for solutions

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
these institutions to look for solutions
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.770
these institutions to look for solutions
to the problems we have but we are not

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
to the problems we have but we are not
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.440
to the problems we have but we are not
paying them in order to produce truth

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450
paying them in order to produce truth
 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.589
paying them in order to produce truth
and yet truth is important and for

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599
and yet truth is important and for
 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.610
and yet truth is important and for
science I would say truth is not really

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620
science I would say truth is not really
 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.550
science I would say truth is not really
something that you can negotiate science

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
something that you can negotiate science
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.430
something that you can negotiate science
is essential a truth is essential for

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440
is essential a truth is essential for
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.720
is essential a truth is essential for
science for

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730
science for
 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060
science for
for epistemic reasons I mean you need

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070
for epistemic reasons I mean you need
 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.520
for epistemic reasons I mean you need
the basis and you have to get some

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530
the basis and you have to get some
 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.480
the basis and you have to get some
agreement testing what you know against

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
agreement testing what you know against
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.030
agreement testing what you know against
reality

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040
reality
 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.440
reality
validating it but you also want to have

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450
validating it but you also want to have
 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.890
validating it but you also want to have
something that improves the way how we

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
something that improves the way how we
 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.820
something that improves the way how we
live and the way how the world functions

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830
live and the way how the world functions
 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.790
live and the way how the world functions
so this is you know what what we're

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800
so this is you know what what we're
 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.270
so this is you know what what we're
actually paying for and and and the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280
actually paying for and and and the
 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920
actually paying for and and and the
question of course is if we are not

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930
question of course is if we are not
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.440
question of course is if we are not
paying for truth and truth yet is

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450
paying for truth and truth yet is
 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.610
paying for truth and truth yet is
essential it also binds together the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
essential it also binds together the
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.340
essential it also binds together the
scientific community you know something

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350
scientific community you know something
 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.460
scientific community you know something
like fraud in science it happens but

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470
like fraud in science it happens but
 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.410
like fraud in science it happens but
there's a very strong inbuilt tendency

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420
there's a very strong inbuilt tendency
 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.640
there's a very strong inbuilt tendency
to to react very strongly against it

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650
to to react very strongly against it
 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.220
to to react very strongly against it
because it is so important to have a

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230
because it is so important to have a
 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.280
because it is so important to have a
common basis and to know does it work

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290
common basis and to know does it work
 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.210
common basis and to know does it work
does it not work so in many ways society

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220
does it not work so in many ways society
 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.330
does it not work so in many ways society
creates institutions to solve its

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340
creates institutions to solve its
 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.750
creates institutions to solve its
problems truth is essential for this

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760
problems truth is essential for this
 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.930
problems truth is essential for this
problem-solving but society sometimes or

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940
problem-solving but society sometimes or
 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.170
problem-solving but society sometimes or
many times doesn't explicitly pay for

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
many times doesn't explicitly pay for
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.680
many times doesn't explicitly pay for
truth seeking institutions there the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690
truth seeking institutions there the
 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.810
truth seeking institutions there the
humanities and Social Sciences play a

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820
humanities and Social Sciences play a
 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.220
humanities and Social Sciences play a
critical role you pointed out very

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230
critical role you pointed out very
 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.160
critical role you pointed out very
nicely how scientists are caught up in

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170
nicely how scientists are caught up in
 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.010
nicely how scientists are caught up in
their work of the day following the

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020
their work of the day following the
 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.530
their work of the day following the
scientific method as it were and you

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540
scientific method as it were and you
 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.530
scientific method as it were and you
know doing things honestly but sometimes

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540
know doing things honestly but sometimes
 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.620
know doing things honestly but sometimes
this can allow them to make that to miss

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630
this can allow them to make that to miss
 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.750
this can allow them to make that to miss
bigger things which are happening around

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760
bigger things which are happening around
 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.360
bigger things which are happening around
them or new ideas which are coming from

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370
them or new ideas which are coming from
 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.540
them or new ideas which are coming from
other areas so do you think that is a

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
other areas so do you think that is a
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.690
other areas so do you think that is a
room in such in institutions where we

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700
room in such in institutions where we
 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.230
room in such in institutions where we
pay for the truth for humanities and

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240
pay for the truth for humanities and
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.910
pay for the truth for humanities and
Sciences and the social sciences to come

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920
Sciences and the social sciences to come
 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.220
Sciences and the social sciences to come
together in some kind of a meeting place

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230
together in some kind of a meeting place
 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.770
together in some kind of a meeting place
where ideas makes regularly yeah I think

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780
where ideas makes regularly yeah I think
 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.930
where ideas makes regularly yeah I think
so and I think the central notion of

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940
so and I think the central notion of
 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.560
so and I think the central notion of
this is the idea of impartiality or

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570
this is the idea of impartiality or
 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.120
this is the idea of impartiality or
neutrality you're not supposed if you

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130
neutrality you're not supposed if you
 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.660
neutrality you're not supposed if you
work in science to sort of further any

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670
work in science to sort of further any
 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.489
work in science to sort of further any
ideological or religious or

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:37.499
ideological or religious or
 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.230
ideological or religious or
economic interests there are sort of

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240
economic interests there are sort of
 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.510
economic interests there are sort of
areas where disinterestedness or

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520
areas where disinterestedness or
 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.959
areas where disinterestedness or
impartiality is the central thing and I

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969
impartiality is the central thing and I
 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.480
impartiality is the central thing and I
think the humanities and the social

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490
think the humanities and the social
 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.209
think the humanities and the social
sciences are extremely important for

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219
sciences are extremely important for
 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.909
sciences are extremely important for
understanding this similar notion of

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919
understanding this similar notion of
 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.689
understanding this similar notion of
impulsivity I mean if you would

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699
impulsivity I mean if you would
 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.700
impulsivity I mean if you would
summarize human suffering in the world

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710
summarize human suffering in the world
 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.610
summarize human suffering in the world
today I can assure you it has very

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620
today I can assure you it has very
 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.409
today I can assure you it has very
little to do that we have not invented

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419
little to do that we have not invented
 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.649
little to do that we have not invented
new technological devices or new

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:07.659
new technological devices or new
 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.320
new technological devices or new
medicines I would say that most human

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330
medicines I would say that most human
 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.999
medicines I would say that most human
suffering in this world is caused by

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009
suffering in this world is caused by
 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.279
suffering in this world is caused by
that about seventy seventy five percent

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.289
that about seventy seventy five percent
 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.529
that about seventy seventy five percent
of the human population live under

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:16.539
of the human population live under
 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.110
of the human population live under
incompetent is functional or corrupt

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120
incompetent is functional or corrupt
 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.129
incompetent is functional or corrupt
government institutions so it there is a

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139
government institutions so it there is a
 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.219
government institutions so it there is a
very clear sort of notion between the

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229
very clear sort of notion between the
 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:27.989
very clear sort of notion between the
social sciences and humanities

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:27.999
social sciences and humanities
 

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.179
social sciences and humanities
understanding why this is so and what

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:30.189
understanding why this is so and what
 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:32.760
understanding why this is so and what
can be done to change it and the Natural

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770
can be done to change it and the Natural
 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.249
can be done to change it and the Natural
Sciences so I'll come back to this very

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:35.259
Sciences so I'll come back to this very
 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.700
Sciences so I'll come back to this very
important point about how human problems

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710
important point about how human problems
 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.029
important point about how human problems
and suffering can be solved by

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039
and suffering can be solved by
 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.850
and suffering can be solved by
communicating the truth to leaders and

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860
communicating the truth to leaders and
 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.369
communicating the truth to leaders and
so on but let's segue into that next

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379
so on but let's segue into that next
 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.219
so on but let's segue into that next
point the next question which is what

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:50.229
point the next question which is what
 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.999
point the next question which is what
are the consequences of stating what you

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:54.009
are the consequences of stating what you
 

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:56.909
are the consequences of stating what you
believe to be the truth in a blunt

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919
believe to be the truth in a blunt
 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.689
believe to be the truth in a blunt
manner do you deal with that in a nernst

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:00.699
manner do you deal with that in a nernst
 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.159
manner do you deal with that in a nernst
way I are you supposed to be very

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:02.169
way I are you supposed to be very
 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.409
way I are you supposed to be very
careful about what the consequences are

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:04.419
careful about what the consequences are
 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.170
careful about what the consequences are
or do you say what you want to say

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.180
or do you say what you want to say
 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.980
or do you say what you want to say
irrespective of what the consequences

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:07.990
irrespective of what the consequences
 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.769
irrespective of what the consequences
are do you deal with it in a manner

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:10.779
are do you deal with it in a manner
 

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:13.649
are do you deal with it in a manner
which rocks the institution which you

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:13.659
which rocks the institution which you
 

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.899
which rocks the institution which you
work in or could you let certain things

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:15.909
work in or could you let certain things
 

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:19.469
work in or could you let certain things
be I was a legendary political scientist

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479
be I was a legendary political scientist
 

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:21.959
be I was a legendary political scientist
Aaron Wildavsky who said that what our

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:21.969
Aaron Wildavsky who said that what our
 

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:25.050
Aaron Wildavsky who said that what our
job is is to speak truth to power now I

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.060
job is is to speak truth to power now I
 

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.629
job is is to speak truth to power now I
can assure you you do not always get

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639
can assure you you do not always get
 

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.699
can assure you you do not always get
very popular there is one specific

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:29.709
very popular there is one specific
 

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.699
very popular there is one specific
problem sometimes the truth that you

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:32.709
problem sometimes the truth that you
 

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:37.139
problem sometimes the truth that you
discover points in a direction that you

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:37.149
discover points in a direction that you
 

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.110
discover points in a direction that you
normatively don't agree with yourself

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120
normatively don't agree with yourself
 

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.689
normatively don't agree with yourself
yeah so for example I would love for

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:42.699
yeah so for example I would love for
 

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:45.660
yeah so for example I would love for
democracy to be a functioning cure

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:45.670
democracy to be a functioning cure
 

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.319
democracy to be a functioning cure
against corruption it is not and that is

00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:49.329
against corruption it is not and that is
 

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.360
against corruption it is not and that is
of course a problem for myself and

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.370
of course a problem for myself and
 

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.670
of course a problem for myself and
big fan of democracy but that is not the

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680
big fan of democracy but that is not the
 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.740
big fan of democracy but that is not the
the major cure for this problem that we

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
the major cure for this problem that we
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.470
the major cure for this problem that we
see so that can create problems of

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480
see so that can create problems of
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.329
see so that can create problems of
course and then there of course you know

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:00.339
course and then there of course you know
 

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:04.410
course and then there of course you know
sometimes everyone runs in the same

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.420
sometimes everyone runs in the same
 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.019
sometimes everyone runs in the same
direction all of your friends all of

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:07.029
direction all of your friends all of
 

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.990
direction all of your friends all of
your colleagues the whole society gets a

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000
your colleagues the whole society gets a
 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.910
your colleagues the whole society gets a
kind of moral panic and they run there

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920

other Institutes of Advanced Study and

other Institutes of Advanced Study and
now there is a tendency to set up

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:22.069
now there is a tendency to set up
 

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:24.129
now there is a tendency to set up
Institutes of Advanced Study within

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:24.139
Institutes of Advanced Study within
 

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:27.879

universities because we need a space for

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:27.889
universities because we need a space for
 

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:30.970
universities because we need a space for
people to meet not just your own tribe

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:30.980
people to meet not just your own tribe
 

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.730

and if you come with an open mind you

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:33.740
and if you come with an open mind you
 

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.730
and if you come with an open mind you
can learn a lot and therefore you know

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:36.740
can learn a lot and therefore you know
 

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.280

little afraid you know it's supposed to

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:51.860
little afraid you know it's supposed to
 

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.250
little afraid you know it's supposed to
leave your your city your home for a

leave your your city your home for a
 

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.970
leave your your city your home for a
semester or a year to be there I think

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.980
semester or a year to be there I think
 

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.730
semester or a year to be there I think
these institutions are built on an idea

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:00.740
these institutions are built on an idea
 

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.720
these institutions are built on an idea
of just today namely that you can bring

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:04.730
of just today namely that you can bring
 

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.000
of just today namely that you can bring
your partner freely with you without any

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.010
your partner freely with you without any
 

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.500
your partner freely with you without any
problems you know they are built on the

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:08.510
problems you know they are built on the
 

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.360
problems you know they are built on the
idea that leading scholars are either

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:10.370
idea that leading scholars are either
 

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.210
idea that leading scholars are either
unhappily married or single and that is

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:13.220
unhappily married or single and that is
 

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.289
unhappily married or single and that is
not so much the case anymore so I think

00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:17.299
not so much the case anymore so I think
 

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:19.240
not so much the case anymore so I think
it can be problematic because they

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.250
it can be problematic because they
 

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.929
it can be problematic because they
attract a very special type of scholars

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:22.939
attract a very special type of scholars
 

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:24.909
attract a very special type of scholars
but in general I agree we should have

00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919
but in general I agree we should have
 

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.500
but in general I agree we should have
more but you can have this within

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:26.510
more but you can have this within
 

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.930
more but you can have this within
university so I think within the

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:28.940
university so I think within the
 

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.060
university so I think within the
universities is helga saying it allows

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.070
universities is helga saying it allows
 

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.909
universities is helga saying it allows
different departments people to meet I

00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919
different departments people to meet I
 

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.860
different departments people to meet I
remember a friend of mine telling me

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
remember a friend of mine telling me
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.310
remember a friend of mine telling me
that he had a philosopher on a biology

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320
that he had a philosopher on a biology

PhD thesis committee and

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320
PhD thesis committee and
 

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.289
PhD thesis committee and
the philosopher refused to shake hands

00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:44.299
the philosopher refused to shake hands
 

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:46.180
the philosopher refused to shake hands
with biologists because they could be

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:46.190
with biologists because they could be
 

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.669
with biologists because they could be
infectious and therefore did this and

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679
infectious and therefore did this and
 

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:50.200
infectious and therefore did this and
sort of shaking hands so better

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.210
sort of shaking hands so better
 

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.600
sort of shaking hands so better
communication between philosophers and

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:52.610
communication between philosophers and
 

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.870
communication between philosophers and
biologists would be useful but let's

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880
biologists would be useful but let's
 

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.169
biologists would be useful but let's
move on to that to the last aspect which

00:17:59.169 --> 00:17:59.179
move on to that to the last aspect which
 

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:01.840
move on to that to the last aspect which
is paying for truth and I'd like to hear

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.180
most critical problem facing this planet
which is climate change and its

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.190
which is climate change and its
 

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.740
which is climate change and its
consequences and mitigating that

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:14.750
consequences and mitigating that
 

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.870
consequences and mitigating that
requires us to do things soon yet being

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880
requires us to do things soon yet being
 

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.909
requires us to do things soon yet being
for truth that is paying for your

00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919
for truth that is paying for your
 

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:23.740
for truth that is paying for your
version of truths to be put out is a

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:23.750
version of truths to be put out is a
 

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.710
version of truths to be put out is a
serious problem in this context so Helga

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720
serious problem in this context so Helga
 

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.850
serious problem in this context so Helga
as a scientist and science at MIT let me

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:29.860
as a scientist and science at MIT let me
 

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.490
as a scientist and science at MIT let me
let me rephrase your question slightly I

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:33.500
let me rephrase your question slightly I
 

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.779
let me rephrase your question slightly I
think the question really is why is

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:37.789
think the question really is why is
 

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:43.450
think the question really is why is
society not willing to value truth I

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:43.460
society not willing to value truth I
 

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.970
society not willing to value truth I
mean pay you pay for something that you

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:45.980
mean pay you pay for something that you
 

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.539
mean pay you pay for something that you
consider valuable so the value of truth

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:49.549
consider valuable so the value of truth
 

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:53.889
consider valuable so the value of truth
in society has gone down and you see

00:18:53.889 --> 00:18:53.899
in society has gone down and you see
 

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:56.230
in society has gone down and you see
this in in many ways that I don't have

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240
this in in many ways that I don't have
 

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.879
this in in many ways that I don't have
to detail and I think that it's

00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:00.889
to detail and I think that it's
 

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.610
to detail and I think that it's
worthwhile to consider the reasons why

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:03.620
worthwhile to consider the reasons why
 

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.120
worthwhile to consider the reasons why
why are people not valuing truth anymore

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.130
why are people not valuing truth anymore
 

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.629
why are people not valuing truth anymore
I think one reason has to do with the

00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:10.639
I think one reason has to do with the
 

00:19:10.639 --> 00:19:16.530
I think one reason has to do with the
shifting ratio between signal and noise

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:16.540
 

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.030
this by the way is noise and if the

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.040
this by the way is noise and if the
 

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.030
this by the way is noise and if the
signal is strong in noise you become

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.040
signal is strong in noise you become
 

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.180
signal is strong in noise you become
indifferent you know you start not to

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.190
indifferent you know you start not to
 

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.130
indifferent you know you start not to
see the value anymore because it's

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:29.140
see the value anymore because it's
 

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.450
see the value anymore because it's
strongly noise another reason is going

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:33.460
strongly noise another reason is going
 

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.330
strongly noise another reason is going
back to tribalism you know living in a

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.340
back to tribalism you know living in a
 

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:41.880
back to tribalism you know living in a
fragmented society where people tend to

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:41.890
fragmented society where people tend to
 

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.760
fragmented society where people tend to
listen to those that confirm your own

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:44.770
listen to those that confirm your own
 

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.940
listen to those that confirm your own
views so then there's your tools and

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:47.950
views so then there's your tools and
 

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.890
views so then there's your tools and
might rose so why should I be interested

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:49.900
might rose so why should I be interested
 

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.100
might rose so why should I be interested
in your toes if I have my toes and I get

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.110
in your toes if I have my toes and I get
 

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.440
in your toes if I have my toes and I get
confirmation from my friends and my my

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:57.450
confirmation from my friends and my my
 

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.470
confirmation from my friends and my my
friends in the cyberspace all the time

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480
friends in the cyberspace all the time
 

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.420
friends in the cyberspace all the time
so I think these are important changes

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:03.430
so I think these are important changes
 

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.230
so I think these are important changes
in society and to get back to make

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240
in society and to get back to make
 

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.910
in society and to get back to make
people hell eyes again truth matters and

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:10.920
people hell eyes again truth matters and
 

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.710
people hell eyes again truth matters and
truths has a value I think if this is a

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720
truths has a value I think if this is a
 

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.460
truths has a value I think if this is a
big challenge and coming back to climate

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.470
big challenge and coming back to climate
 

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.240
big challenge and coming back to climate
change there are of course these

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.250
change there are of course these
 

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.060
change there are of course these
enormous gaps between what people see

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.070
enormous gaps between what people see
 

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.600
enormous gaps between what people see
happening at the micro level and then

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:27.610
happening at the micro level and then
 

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.720
happening at the micro level and then
this immense complexity that we are

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:30.730
this immense complexity that we are
 

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.840
this immense complexity that we are
unable to understand but again I think

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:33.850
unable to understand but again I think
 

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:38.250
unable to understand but again I think
you know by bringing but by using

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.260
you know by bringing but by using
 

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.810
you know by bringing but by using
simulation models by visualizing what is

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:42.820
simulation models by visualizing what is
 

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.780
simulation models by visualizing what is
going to happen and these are not

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:45.790
going to happen and these are not
 

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.390
going to happen and these are not
scaremongering

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400
scaremongering
 

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.050
scaremongering
visuals but just telling people if you

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:52.060
visuals but just telling people if you
 

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.870
visuals but just telling people if you
continue to do this this is likely to

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880
continue to do this this is likely to
 

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.550
continue to do this this is likely to
happen and you explain it

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:56.560
happen and you explain it
 

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.830
happen and you explain it
in an impartial way you explain it

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840
in an impartial way you explain it
 

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.440
in an impartial way you explain it
patiently but you have to also tell

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.450
patiently but you have to also tell
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.620
patiently but you have to also tell
stories and use visual means yeah on

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.630
stories and use visual means yeah on
 

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.340
stories and use visual means yeah on
that notebook

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:05.350
that notebook
 

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.230
that notebook
I mean something like climate change we

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240
I mean something like climate change we
 

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.540
I mean something like climate change we
are used to because of a mindset from

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:12.550
are used to because of a mindset from
 

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.850
are used to because of a mindset from
the Industrial Revolution to thinking no

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:14.860
the Industrial Revolution to thinking no
 

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.980
the Industrial Revolution to thinking no
matter what we do to the planet it will

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:16.990
matter what we do to the planet it will
 

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.090
matter what we do to the planet it will
set itself back to an ok state but what

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:21.100
set itself back to an ok state but what
 

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.860
set itself back to an ok state but what
we are done in the recent past is not

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:22.870
we are done in the recent past is not
 

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.630
we are done in the recent past is not
equally different and the consequences

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640
equally different and the consequences
 

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.170
equally different and the consequences
are going to be immense is there room

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:27.180
are going to be immense is there room
 

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.130
are going to be immense is there room
while others pay for truths

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.140
while others pay for truths
 

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.710
while others pay for truths
of a kind that the planet is resilient

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720
of a kind that the planet is resilient
 

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.530
of a kind that the planet is resilient
to whatever abuse we give it is there

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:35.540
to whatever abuse we give it is there
 

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.470
to whatever abuse we give it is there
room for science and social media and

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480
room for science and social media and
 

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.380
room for science and social media and
better communication as Helga put it to

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:41.390
better communication as Helga put it to
 

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.190
better communication as Helga put it to
overthrow the big powers for status Co

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200
overthrow the big powers for status Co
 

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.090
overthrow the big powers for status Co
yes I think so and people our research

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.100
yes I think so and people our research
 

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.650
yes I think so and people our research
show that people are willing even if

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:53.660
show that people are willing even if
 

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.950
show that people are willing even if
they would have to pay quite substantial

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960
they would have to pay quite substantial
 

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.250
they would have to pay quite substantial
cost to do things that are not

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:00.260
cost to do things that are not
 

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.980
cost to do things that are not
detrimental to the planet for example

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:02.990
detrimental to the planet for example
 

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.010
detrimental to the planet for example
but only if something can convince them

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.020
but only if something can convince them
 

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.350
but only if something can convince them
that most other not everyone but most

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360
that most other not everyone but most
 

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.780
that most other not everyone but most
other people are also willing to do this

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:10.790
other people are also willing to do this
 

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.390
other people are also willing to do this
yeah and this is of course a social

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400
yeah and this is of course a social
 

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.520
yeah and this is of course a social
dilemma problem I mean it's to make it

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:15.530
dilemma problem I mean it's to make it
 

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.110
dilemma problem I mean it's to make it
simple you're willing to sort your

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120
simple you're willing to sort your
 

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.730
simple you're willing to sort your
garbage but it's meaningless if you're

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:18.740
garbage but it's meaningless if you're
 

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.200
garbage but it's meaningless if you're
the only one in the neighborhood right

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.210
the only one in the neighborhood right
 

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.720
the only one in the neighborhood right
and on the global scale it is the same

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:22.730
and on the global scale it is the same
 

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.480
and on the global scale it is the same
so we have to come up with institutions

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:25.490
so we have to come up with institutions
 

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.800
so we have to come up with institutions
and and and and new ideas that can

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:29.810
and and and and new ideas that can
 

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.870
and and and and new ideas that can
convince people that if they are

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880
convince people that if they are
 

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.090
convince people that if they are
contributing most other people will also

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.100
contributing most other people will also
 

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.220
contributing most other people will also
be concrete absolutely but we have a

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:36.230
be concrete absolutely but we have a
 

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.500
be concrete absolutely but we have a
problem here with paying with truth and

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:38.510
problem here with paying with truth and
 

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.600
problem here with paying with truth and
that is especially in the social science

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:40.610
that is especially in the social science
 

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.100
that is especially in the social science
and in economics we see fewer and fewer

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.110
and in economics we see fewer and fewer
 

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.220
and in economics we see fewer and fewer
leading academic scholars at least in

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.230
leading academic scholars at least in
 

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.040
leading academic scholars at least in
the area that I can see are

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.050
the area that I can see are
 

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.420
the area that I can see are
participating in this discussion and

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:52.430
participating in this discussion and
 

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.510
participating in this discussion and
