00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.782
Ann: Barnett Newman's
paintings are those which among

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:14.867
the abstract expressionists
themselves caused

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:18.355
the greatest amount of
skepticism and doubt.

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:23.394
Newman epitomized the common sense
of many abstract expressionists

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:27.450
painters works that anybody can do that.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.669
I think Newman's paintings pushed
that to its furthest extreme.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.805
Not so much in that they looked
like something a child could do,

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:38.865
because it's pretty hard to
make those straight lines,

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:43.533
but something that a house-painter
could do and in fact one of the critics

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:48.580
of one of his early shows
at the Betty Parsons Gallery

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.453
wrote that when you went
into the gallery, you thought

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:55.174
you were looking at the wall
but then you realized oh no,

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:57.125
you were looking at the paintings.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.394
So our question is, what really
does separate these paintings?

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:05.033
Well for one thing, the layers
of color on a Newman painting

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.508
are not the one or two that
a house-painter might make

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:14.542
but in fact countless layers to
achieve the saturation and the subtlety

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:20.047
of tone that Newman was looking
for in the surface of his painting.

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:25.509
Also he's not dealing
with a predetermined area,

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.675
for the feeling of a Newman
that's smaller than you

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:33.759
as opposed to one that occupies
the whole length of a room,

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.284
communicate very different feelings.

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.833
So of all the decisions
that Newman is making

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:45.440
to get the effect that we see today,
none of them is actually that simple.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.721
Instead what Newman is doing is
trying to communicate a mood,

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.806
a profound feeling, one might
call it a spiritual feeling.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:02:00.286
At that time he would have, today that
would be quite unfashionable to use.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:05.759
But there's no doubt in my mind that
for Newman, what he was expressing

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.465
in a rather secular medium,
painting, was the kind of thing

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:15.889
that in previous times would
have been called religious.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.890
The idea behind a Newman painting
is not that you look at it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.723
and understand it or get it.

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:24.640
I think that's one of the things
that has bothered people about Newman

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.722
ever since these paintings
first were shown 60 years ago.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:33.854
With a Newman you have to set
aside all expectations of that

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:36.591
and surrender yourself to
the physical experience

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:41.223
and the psychic experience of
being in the space of this picture.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:46.134
In fact if you look through New Yorker
magazines of the 1950's and 1960's,

00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:49.270
you'll find many many
cartoons filling its pages

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.980
of perplexed viewers standing in front
of abstract expressionist paintings,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.147
probably right here at
the Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:57.147 --> 00:03:01.646
But instead really what they're trying
to convey is that it wasn't easy

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:05.229
for them as painters to make
the art that they were making,

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:10.454
nor should it be easy for the
viewers to experience what they made.

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:17.191
For all of these artists it was essential
that they form a signature style

00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:22.805
and much as Pollock is somebody
we associate with his drips,

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:27.721
Newman is somebody we associate
with what we now call his zips.

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.556
This was something new in modern
art and yet at the same time

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:35.775
as they were concerned with
making Rothko's or Newman's,

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:39.246
with these very clearly
identifiable styles,

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:44.306
at the same time they maintained that
these pictures were not about them,

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:52.425
that they were not about their mood
or their story they wanted to tell,

00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:56.889
certainly not about any biographical
detail and instead they were about

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.889
the much larger issues of
values and ideals of humankind.

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.442
This is something that should
take you above your daily routine.

00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:11.305
Out of your ordinary work, out
of your ordinary family life.

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:14.514
When you're with these paintings
you're going somewhere else

00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:17.806
and you're bringing your soul,
you're bringing your brain,

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:24.106
you're bringing your physical
body into a different realm.
