00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.080
Next, we're going to get some
practice tracing through Turing

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.670
machine computations and
programming Turing machines.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.210
The point of these exercises is not so
that you can put on your resume

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.680
that you're good at
programming Turing machines.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.630
And if someone asks you in an interview
to write a program to test, say,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.580
whether an input number is prime,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.240
I wouldn't recommend trying to draw
a Turing machine stake diagram.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.130
Somehow, I doubt that
will land you the job.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.820
Rather, the point is to
help you convince yourself

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.350
that Turing machines can do everything
that we mean by computation.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.670
And if you really had to, you could
program a Turing machine to do anything

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660
you could write a procedure to do in
your favorite programming language.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.200
There are two ways to
convince yourself of this.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320
One is to just practice so

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.840
that you build up enough of a facility
with programming Turing machines.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.000
That is to say,
it just becomes easy enough for you, so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.950
that it seems intuitive
that you could do anything.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.370
Another way to convince yourself
of the power of Turing machines

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.270
is to show that a Turing
machine can simulate the action

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.769
of models that are closer to real world
computers, like the random access model.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740
We'll do that in a later lesson.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.610
But to be able to understand
these simulation arguments,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.460
you need a pretty good facility with
how Turing machines work anyway.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.190
So make the most of these examples and
exercises.
