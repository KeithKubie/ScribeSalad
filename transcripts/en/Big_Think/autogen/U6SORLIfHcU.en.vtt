I've got that's near zero how could

there be was the numbers out there how

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639
there be was the numbers out there how
 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.919
there be was the numbers out there how
could there not be lots of them out

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929
could there not be lots of them out
 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.589
could there not be lots of them out
there but what what is the possibility

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599
there but what what is the possibility
 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.620
there but what what is the possibility
that there are so few that the distances

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
that there are so few that the distances
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.109
that there are so few that the distances
involved make it so not even said he

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119

blasting out the sort of messages that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779
blasting out the sort of messages that
 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.200
blasting out the sort of messages that
the movie contact is suggesting when

that's not happening and setting itself

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220
that's not happening and setting itself
 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.860

agrees that chief we don't find anybody

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870
agrees that chief we don't find anybody
 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.590
agrees that chief we don't find anybody
in the next 30-40 years this could be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600
in the next 30-40 years this could be
 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.690
in the next 30-40 years this could be
pretty good chance there's nobody close

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700
pretty good chance there's nobody close
 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.160
pretty good chance there's nobody close
enough to us that we would ever be able

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170
enough to us that we would ever be able
 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.200
enough to us that we would ever be able
to either talk to them let alone get out

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
to either talk to them let alone get out
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.700
to either talk to them let alone get out
there and see them

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
 
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.970
 
I suspect the chances are that we will

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
I suspect the chances are that we will
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.460
I suspect the chances are that we will
not at least in the next few centuries

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470
not at least in the next few centuries
 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.750
not at least in the next few centuries
perhaps our technology we get to the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
perhaps our technology we get to the
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000
perhaps our technology we get to the
point that we can pinpoint not just the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
point that we can pinpoint not just the
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770
point that we can pinpoint not just the
immediate area which is really all that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
immediate area which is really all that
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350
immediate area which is really all that
we're good for now and spotlight the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
we're good for now and spotlight the
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600
we're good for now and spotlight the
entire galaxy or perhaps we get good

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
entire galaxy or perhaps we get good
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.800
entire galaxy or perhaps we get good
enough that we can really start looking

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
enough that we can really start looking
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.719
enough that we can really start looking
at other galaxies and think then we'll

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
at other galaxies and think then we'll
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359
at other galaxies and think then we'll
start picking up evidence that there's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
start picking up evidence that there's
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920
start picking up evidence that there's
other life out there but if you're

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
other life out there but if you're
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749
other life out there but if you're
talking about places hundreds of

talking about places hundreds of
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580
talking about places hundreds of
thousands of light-years away there's no

your response and then it comes back to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
your response and then it comes back to
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.180
your response and then it comes back to
you and says message garbled please

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190
you and says message garbled please

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.649
 
well it could be a aspect of

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659
well it could be a aspect of
 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.599
well it could be a aspect of
communication but it also could be just

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609
communication but it also could be just
 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.149
communication but it also could be just
another indication that Medea is correct

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
another indication that Medea is correct
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.669
another indication that Medea is correct
the life gets going on a planet and then

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679
the life gets going on a planet and then
 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.830
the life gets going on a planet and then
kills itself off through colossal

blunders friend of mine said well I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450
blunders friend of mine said well I
 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.209
blunders friend of mine said well I
shouldn't call it the madea hypothesis

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219
shouldn't call it the madea hypothesis
 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.969
shouldn't call it the madea hypothesis
but evolution is more like mr. bean mr.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979
but evolution is more like mr. bean mr.

another you know let's hey let's make

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450
another you know let's hey let's make
 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.449
another you know let's hey let's make
oxygen that'll be cool and then

photosynthesis and then reducing carbon

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069
photosynthesis and then reducing carbon
 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.979
photosynthesis and then reducing carbon
dioxide so much that we go into it with

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989
dioxide so much that we go into it with
 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.859

snowball earth or hey let's make forests

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869
snowball earth or hey let's make forests
 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.350

and then reducing co2 even further and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360
and then reducing co2 even further and
 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.139

Age in the carboniferous so yeah Alice

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
Age in the carboniferous so yeah Alice
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.950
Age in the carboniferous so yeah Alice
let's let's do this as mr. bean
