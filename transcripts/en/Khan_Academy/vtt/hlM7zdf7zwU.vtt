00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:01.583
- [Instructor] It is election season,

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.679
and there is a runoff between candidate A

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.269
versus candidate B.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:07.305
And we are pollsters.

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:08.885
And we're interested
in figuring out, well,

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:12.150
what's the likelihood that
candidate A wins this election?

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.306
Well, ideally, we would go
to the entire population

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.220
of likely voters right over here,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.798
let's say there's 100,000 likely voters,

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.910
and we would ask every one of
the them, who do you support?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.905
And from that,

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.625
we would be able to get
the population proportion,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.714
which would be, this
is the proportion that

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:32.358
support,

00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:33.721
support

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.398
candidate A.

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:36.537
But it might not be realistic.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.303
In fact, it definitely
will not be realistic

00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:41.164
to ask, well, all 100,000 people.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:42.616
So instead, we do the thing

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.341
that we tend to do in statistics is,

00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:46.900
is that we sample this population,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.158
and we calculate a
statistic from that sample

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:52.778
in order to estimate this parameter.

00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:55.388
So let's say we take a
sample right over here.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.237
So this sample size,

00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.154
let's say n equals 100.

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:03.043
And we calculate the sample proportion

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:04.578
that support candidate A.

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:07.061
So out of the 100, let's say that 54

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.155
say that they're going
to support candidate A.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:12.322
So the sample proportion here is 0.54.

00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:15.819
And just to appreciate

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.300
that we're not always going to get 0.54,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.360
there could've been a situation

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.216
where we sampled a different 100,

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:25.059
and we would've maybe gotten
a different sample proportion.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:27.642
Maybe in that one, we got 0.58.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090
And we already have
the tools in statistics

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.800
to think about this,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.057
the distribution of the possible

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:38.153
sample proportions we could get.

00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:39.063
We've talked about it

00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:41.376
when we thought about
sampling distributions.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:45.209
So you could have the
sampling distribution of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.652
the sample proportions,

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:50.735
of the sample

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.171
proportions,

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:54.966
proportions.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:57.196
And it's going, this
distribution's going to be specific

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.698
to what our sample size is,

00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:01.285
for

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:02.785
n is equal to 100.

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.809
And so we can describe

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:07.726
the possible sample
proportions we could get

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:11.055
and their likelihoods with
this sampling distribution.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:12.866
So let me do that.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.071
So it would look something like this.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.827
Because our sample size

00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:18.833
is so much smaller than the population,

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:20.420
it's way less than 10%,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.834
we can assume that each
person we're asking,

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.543
that it's approximately independent.

00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:28.527
Also, if we make the assumption
that the true proportion

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:33.122
isn't too close to zero
or not too close to one,

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:34.216
then we can say that, well, look,

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:38.383
this sampling distribution is
roughly going to be normal.

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:42.353
So we'll have a normal, this
kind of bell curve shape.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:44.341
And we know a lot about
the sampling distribution

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.872
of the sample proportions.

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:47.291
We know already, for example,

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.315
and if this is foreign to
you, I encourage you to

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:51.930
watch the videos on this on Khan Academy,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.549
that the mean of this
sampling distribution

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.299
is going to be the actual
population proportion.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.053
And we also know what
the standard deviation

00:03:00.053 --> 00:03:01.417
of this is going to be.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:02.428
So,

00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:04.287
let me, maybe that's
one standard deviation.

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:05.476
This is two standard deviations.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:08.930
That's three standard
deviations above the mean.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.493
That's one standard deviation,
two standard deviations,

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:14.718
three standard deviations below the mean.

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:17.729
So this distance, let me do
this in a different color,

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.848
this standard deviation right over here,

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:24.704
which we denote as the
standard deviation of

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:29.234
the sample proportions, for
this sampling distribution,

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:31.022
this is, we've already
seen the formula there.

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:33.105
It's the square root of p

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:36.091
times one minus p,

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.291
where p is, once again,
our population proportion

00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:41.236
divided by our sample size.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:45.248
That's why it's specific
for n equals 100 here.

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:47.355
And so in this first scenario,

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:49.661
let's just focus on this
one right over here,

00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.003
when we took a sample size of n equals 100

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:55.720
and we got the sample proportion of 0.54,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.116
we could've gotten all
sorts of outcomes here.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.871
Maybe 0.54 is right over here.

00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:03.390
Maybe 0.54 is right over here.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.188
And the reason why I
had this uncertainty is

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:07.260
we actually don't know what the real

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.388
population parameter is,

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:11.965
what the real population proportion is.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:15.814
But let me ask you maybe a
slightly easier question.

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:16.647
What is,

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.356
what

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:20.909
is

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.682
the probability,

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:24.418
probability

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:25.251
that

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:28.985
our sample proportion of 0.54

00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:31.130
is within,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.663
is within two times
two standard deviations

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.178
of p?

00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:43.015
Pause the video, and think about that.

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:45.531
Well, that's just saying, look,
if I'm gonna take a sample

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:48.459
and calculate the sample
proportion right over here,

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:49.905
what's the probability that I'm within

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:51.838
two standard deviations of the mean?

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:54.449
Well, that's essentially going to be

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.303
this area right over here.

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:58.393
And we know, from studying normal curves,

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:01.572
that approximately 95% of the area

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.784
is within two standard deviations.

00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:07.438
So this is approximately 95%.

00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:11.009
95% of the time that I
take a sample size of 100

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.734
and I calculate this sample proportion,

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:15.797
95% of the time,

00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:19.379
I'm going to be within
two standard deviations.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.970
But if you take this statement,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.720
you can actually construct
another statement

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.369
that starts to feel a little bit more,

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:27.849
I guess we could say inferential.

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.432
We could say there,

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:31.749
there is

00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:33.480
a 95%

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:36.455
probability

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:38.688
that

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:41.188
the population proportion p is

00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:43.875
within,

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:46.458
within two standard deviations,

00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:50.825
two standard deviations of p-hat,

00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:53.334
which is equal to 0.54.

00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:54.167
Pause this video.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.043
Appreciate that these two
are equivalent statements.

00:05:57.043 --> 00:06:00.768
If there's a 95% chance
that our sample proportion

00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:04.418
is within two standard deviations
of the true proportion,

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:07.428
well, that's equivalent to
saying that there's a 95% chance

00:06:07.428 --> 00:06:10.988
that our true proportion is
within two standard deviations

00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:13.519
of our sample proportion.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.625
And this is really, really interesting

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.452
because if we were able to
figure out what this value is,

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.346
well, then we would be able to create

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:23.972
what you could call a confidence interval.

00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:26.732
Now, you immediately might
be seeing a problem here.

00:06:26.732 --> 00:06:28.565
In order to calculate this,

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:31.291
our standard deviation
of this distribution,

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.476
we have to know our population parameter.

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:35.767
So pause this video,

00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:37.790
and think about what we would do instead.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.695
If we don't know what p is here,

00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:41.672
if we don't know our
population proportion,

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:45.069
do we have something that
we could use as an estimate

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.691
for our population proportion?

00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.193
Well, yes, we calculated p-hat already.

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:52.697
We calculated our sample proportion.

00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:54.876
And so a new statistic
that we could define

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:56.881
is the standard error,

00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:01.178
the standard error of
our sample proportions.

00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:05.369
And we can define that as being equal to,

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:08.011
since we don't know the
population proportion,

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.564
we're going to use the sample proportion,

00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:12.636
p-hat times one minus p-hat,

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:14.145
all of that over n.

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:16.057
In this case, of course, n is 100.

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:17.472
We do know that.

00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:18.482
And it actually turns out,

00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:20.142
I'm not going to prove it in this video,

00:07:20.142 --> 00:07:22.561
that this actually is
an unbiased estimator

00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:24.293
for this right over here.

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:27.293
So this is going to be equal to 0.54

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.774
times one minus 0.54,

00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:31.857
so it's 0.46,

00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:35.307
all of that over 100.

00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:39.637
So we have the square root of .54

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:42.585
times .46

00:07:44.132 --> 00:07:45.382
divided by 100,

00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.284
close my parentheses, Enter.

00:07:49.284 --> 00:07:52.144
So if I round to the nearest
hundredth, it's going to be,

00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:53.635
actually, even if I round
to the nearest thousandth,

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:56.192
it's going to be approximately 5/100.

00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:58.109
So this is going to be,

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:01.203
this is approximately 0.05.

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:07.765
So another way to say all
of these things is, instead,

00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:09.636
we don't know exactly this,

00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:11.795
but now we have an estimate for it.

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.795
So we could now say with

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:15.844
95%

00:08:16.912 --> 00:08:19.617
confidence, and that will often be known

00:08:19.617 --> 00:08:21.997
as our confidence level right over here,

00:08:21.997 --> 00:08:24.747
with 95% confidence between,

00:08:26.657 --> 00:08:27.490
between,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.480
and so we'd want to go two standard errors

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.379
below our sample proportion

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:35.193
that we just happened to calculate.

00:08:35.193 --> 00:08:39.564
So that would be 0.54
minus two times 5/100.

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:43.140
So that would be 0.54 minus 10/100,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.807
which would be 0.44.

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:48.738
And we'd also want to
go two standard errors

00:08:48.738 --> 00:08:50.700
above the sample proportion.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.338
So that would be that plus 10/100.

00:08:53.338 --> 00:08:54.171
And 0.64

00:08:56.621 --> 00:08:58.081
of voters,

00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.183
of

00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:00.016
voters

00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:01.704
support,

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:04.182
support

00:09:04.182 --> 00:09:05.278
A.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.725
And so this interval that
we have right over here,

00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:08.558
from 0.44

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.095
to 0.64,

00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:13.593
this will be known as
our confidence interval,

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:14.426
confidence

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:17.112
interval.

00:09:17.112 --> 00:09:18.263
And this will change,

00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:20.788
not just in the starting
point and the end point,

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:22.677
but it will change the actual length

00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:23.867
of our confidence interval,

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:25.525
will change depending on

00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:28.365
what sample proportion we happened to pick

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:30.762
for that sample of 100.

00:09:30.762 --> 00:09:33.142
A related idea to the confidence interval

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:35.746
is this notion of margin of error,

00:09:35.746 --> 00:09:36.579
margin

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.337
of error.

00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:41.543
And for this particular case,

00:09:41.543 --> 00:09:43.192
for this particular sample,

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:44.421
our margin of error,

00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.488
because we care about 95% confidence,

00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:49.577
so that would be two standard errors.

00:09:49.577 --> 00:09:52.853
So our margin of error here is
two times our standard error,

00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:55.020
would just be 0.1 or 0.10.

00:09:56.842 --> 00:09:59.535
And so we're going one margin of error

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:02.273
above our sample
proportion right over here

00:10:02.273 --> 00:10:03.387
and one margin of error

00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:05.853
below our sample
proportion right over here

00:10:05.853 --> 00:10:07.518
to define our confidence interval.

00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:09.780
And as I mentioned, this
margin of error is not going

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.373
to be fixed every time we take a sample.

00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:14.826
Depending on what our
sample proportion is,

00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:16.954
it's going to affect our margin of error

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:19.117
because that is calculated, essentially,

00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:20.960
with the standard error.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.937
Another interpretation of this is

00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:25.558
that the method that we used

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.363
to get this interval right over here,

00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:30.399
the method that we used
to get this confidence,

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:32.428
to get this confidence interval,

00:10:32.428 --> 00:10:35.216
when we use it over and over,

00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:37.417
it will produce intervals,

00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:38.886
and the intervals won't
always be the same.

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:41.044
It's gonna be dependent
on our sample proportion,

00:10:41.044 --> 00:10:42.731
but it will produce intervals

00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:44.932
which include the true proportion,

00:10:44.932 --> 00:10:47.006
which we might not know
and often don't know.

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:51.173
It'll include the true
proportion 95% of the time.

00:10:52.056 --> 00:10:55.245
I'll cover that intuition
more in future videos.

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:56.843
We'll see how the interval changes,

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:58.558
how the margin of error changes.

00:10:58.558 --> 00:11:00.381
But when you do this calculation

00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.951
over and over and over again,

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:05.263
95% of the time,

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:08.476
your true proportion is
going to be contained

00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:12.930
in whatever interval you
happen to calculate that time.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.641
Now, another interesting question is,

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.384
is, well, what if you wanted to

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.490
tighten up the intervals on average?

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.069
How would you do that?

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:22.848
Well, if you wanted to
lower your margin of error,

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.971
the best way to lower the margin of error

00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.054
is if you increase this
denominator right over here.

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.736
And increasing that denominator means

00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:31.457
increasing the sample size.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.133
And so one thing that you will often see

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:36.122
when people are talking
about election coverage is,

00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:37.982
well, we need to sample more people

00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:41.066
in order to get a lower margin of error.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:41.899
But I'll leave you there,

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:44.095
and I'll see you in future videos.
