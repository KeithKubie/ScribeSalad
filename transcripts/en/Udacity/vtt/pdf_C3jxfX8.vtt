00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.780
Now, let's take it a step further and

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.480
produce a UML analysis model of those requirements.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.580
In particular, let's come up with a particular class called

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.440
the account class and you can make some assumptions.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.510
You can assume that all of the deposits and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.880
withdrawals are made in amounts that are positive integer number of dollars.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.690
And you also do not need to include an attribute for the current bank balance.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.030
We will add that as a refinement later.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.300
Recall that a class description UML has a rectangle with three boxes.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.430
The top box is the name of the class.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.270
Here we're going to call it account.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.860
The middle box has any attributes of that class.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.640
And here the attribute that makes sense is some history of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.600
the users' transactions, the, the withdrawals and deposits.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.910
I call that particular attribute transactions.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.930
And I'm treating it as a sequence of integers,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.620
because we already assume that all the.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.690
wi, deposits and withdrawals within in integers.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.500
The class also has three operations, corresponding to the requirements.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.600
One is deposits that takes an integer value and doesn't return anything.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.360
Second is a withdrawal which takes a.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.970
Integer value and doesn't return anything.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.780
And the third is the query asking for

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.840
the balance, which doesn't take any arguments but returns an integer value.
