00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.520
In terms of k, where
k does not equal 0,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.040
what is the y-intercept of
the line tangent to the curve

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.170
f of x is equal to 1/x
at the point of the curve

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.814
where x is equal to k?

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:13.730
So let's just think about
what they're asking.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.120
So if I were to
draw myself-- let

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.330
me draw some quick
axes right over here.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.670
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.180
This is my x-axis
right over here.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.410
And the graph f of
x is equal to 1/x

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.920
would look something like this.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.060
So it looks something like this.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.720
So it kind of spikes up
there, and then it comes down,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.930
and then it goes like this.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.888
And I'm just doing a
rough approximation of it.

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:42.450
So it would look
something like that.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.120
And then on the negative side,
it looks something like this.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.830
So this is my hand-drawn
version of roughly

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.170
what this graph looks like.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.890
So this right over here
is f of x is equal to 1/x.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.150
Now, we are concerning ourselves
with the point x equals k.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.010
So let's say-- I mean, it could
be anything that's non-zero,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.740
but let's just say that
this is k right over here.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.310
So that is the point k 1/k.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.590
We can visualize the line
tangent to the curve there.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.015
So it might look
something like this.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.130
And we need to figure
out its y-intercept.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.790
Where does it
intercept the y-axis?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.629
So we need to figure out
this point right over here.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.670
Well, the best way to do
it, if we can figure out

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.440
the slope of the
tangent line here,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.730
the slope of the tangent
line is just the derivative

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.982
of the line at that point.

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:45.190
If we could figure out the
slope of the tangent line,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.820
we already know that
line contains the point.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.370
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.940
We know it contains
the point k comma 1/k.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.470
So if we know its slope, we
know what point it contains,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.756
we can figure out what
its y-intercept is.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.380
So the first step is
just, well, what's

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.477
the slope of the tangent line?

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:09.560
Well, to figure out the
slope of the tangent line,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.460
let's take the derivative.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.000
So if we write f of x,
instead writing it as 1/x,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.466
I'll write it as x to
the negative 1 power.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.090
That makes it a little
bit more obvious

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.460
that we're about to use
the power rule here.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.260
So the derivative
of f at any point x

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.520
is going to be equal
to-- well, it's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.460
going to be the exponent
here is negative 1.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.920
So negative 1 times
x to the-- now

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.550
we decrement the exponent
to the negative 2 power.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.680
Or I could say it's negative
x to the negative 2.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.130
Now, what we care about is
the slope when x equals k.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:57.090
So f prime of k is going
to be equal to negative k

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.870
to the negative 2 power.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.320
Or another way of thinking about
it, this is equal to negative 1

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.655
over k squared.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.710
So this right over
here is the slope

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.330
of the tangent
line at that point.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.962
Now, let's just think
about what the equation

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:19.920
of the tangent line is.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.890
And we could think about
it in slope-intercept form.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.650
So we know the equation of a
line in slope-intercept form

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.360
is y is equal to mx plus
b, where m is the slope

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.544
and b is the y-intercept.

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:34.960
So if we can get it in this
form, then we know our answer.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.793
We know what the
y-intercept is going to be.

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:37.610
It's going to be b.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.770
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.140
This equation, so
we could say y is

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.540
equal to our m, our slope
of the tangent line, when

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.820
x is equal to k, we just
figure out to be this business.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.192
It equals this thing
right over here.

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:52.400
So let me write that in blue.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:01.050
Negative 1 over k
squared times x plus b.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.570
So how do we solve for b?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.440
Well, we know what y is
when x is equal to k.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.770
And so we can use
that to solve for b.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.610
We know that y is equal to
1/k when x is equal to k.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.740
So this is going to be
equal to negative 1--

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.833
that's not the same color.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:34.655
Negative 1 over k
squared times k plus b.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.370
Now, what does this simplify to?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.340
See, k over k squared is
the same thing as 1/k,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.110
so this is going
to be negative 1/k.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.800
So this part, all of this
simplifies to negative 1/k.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.140
So how do we solve for b?

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.410
Well, we could just
add 1/k to both sides

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.987
and we are left with-- if
you add 1/k here-- actually,

00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:07.820
let me just do that.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.560
Plus 1/k, left-hand side,
you're left with 2/k,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.070
and on the right-hand side,
you're just left with b,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.250
is equal to b.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.300
So we're done.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.260
The y-intercept of
the line tangent

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.887
to the curve when x equals
k is going to be 2/k.

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:34.720
If we wanted the equation
of the line, well,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.430
we've done all the work.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.221
Let's write it out.

00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:37.300
It'll be satisfying.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.580
It's going to be y is equal
to negative 1/k squared

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.400
x plus our
y-intercept, plus 2/k.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.940
And we're done.
