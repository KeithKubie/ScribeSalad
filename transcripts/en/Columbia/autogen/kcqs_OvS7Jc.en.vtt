one and three has two of two getting
 

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.120
one and three has two of two getting
ofuro answer those so the first question

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.130
ofuro answer those so the first question
 

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:16.140

automatic protection so in almost every

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:27.930
automatic protection so in almost every
 

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.380
automatic protection so in almost every
case it would be a very odd unusual case

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:30.390
case it would be a very odd unusual case
 

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.540
case it would be a very odd unusual case
that this wasn't true I could look at

you can still provide access through
your dissertation that you're submitting

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220
 

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.989
I

00:43:29.989 --> 00:43:29.999
 

00:43:29.999 --> 00:43:31.909
just brought up this morning I just

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:31.919
just brought up this morning I just
 

00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:38.959
just brought up this morning I just
signed away the copyright privileges to

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:38.969
signed away the copyright privileges to
 

00:43:38.969 --> 00:43:40.999
signed away the copyright privileges to
get one of my chapters published in a

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:41.009
get one of my chapters published in a
 

00:43:41.009 --> 00:43:44.119
get one of my chapters published in a
journal so I'm going to use that chapter

00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:44.129
journal so I'm going to use that chapter
 

00:43:44.129 --> 00:43:46.939
journal so I'm going to use that chapter
as a district as a I'm gonna use that

00:43:46.939 --> 00:43:46.949
as a district as a I'm gonna use that
 

00:43:46.949 --> 00:43:49.999
as a district as a I'm gonna use that
paper that as part of a chapter in my

00:43:49.999 --> 00:43:50.009
paper that as part of a chapter in my
 

00:43:50.009 --> 00:43:52.549
paper that as part of a chapter in my
dissertation and I imagine about half my

00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559
dissertation and I imagine about half my
 

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:55.429
dissertation and I imagine about half my
dissertation will probably I won't have

00:43:55.429 --> 00:43:55.439
dissertation will probably I won't have
 

00:43:55.439 --> 00:43:58.639
dissertation will probably I won't have
the copyrights for but maybe because I'm

00:43:58.639 --> 00:43:58.649
the copyrights for but maybe because I'm
 

00:43:58.649 --> 00:44:00.199
the copyrights for but maybe because I'm
in the sciences so as the papers come

00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:00.209
in the sciences so as the papers come
 

00:44:00.209 --> 00:44:01.609
in the sciences so as the papers come
out you just kind of send them up to the

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619
out you just kind of send them up to the
 

00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:05.209
out you just kind of send them up to the
journals so how does that work with some

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:05.219
journals so how does that work with some
 

00:44:05.219 --> 00:44:08.959
journals so how does that work with some
of the chapters like maybe half your

00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:08.969
of the chapters like maybe half your
 

00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:12.979
of the chapters like maybe half your
dissertation so I mean it depends

00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:12.989
dissertation so I mean it depends
 

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:15.439
dissertation so I mean it depends
partially on the publishers because they

00:44:15.439 --> 00:44:15.449
partially on the publishers because they
 

00:44:15.449 --> 00:44:17.539
partially on the publishers because they
all have different policies but I mean

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:17.549
all have different policies but I mean
 

00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:20.449
all have different policies but I mean
as a baseline you know the thing is that

00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:20.459
as a baseline you know the thing is that
 

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:23.989
as a baseline you know the thing is that
when you're submitting you are offering

00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:23.999
when you're submitting you are offering
 

00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:27.079
when you're submitting you are offering
that you've cleared the permissions for

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:27.089
that you've cleared the permissions for
 

00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:28.969
that you've cleared the permissions for

just record in the commons that's also
 

00:44:30.689 --> 00:44:33.409
just record in the commons that's also
pro quests requirement that when you

00:44:33.409 --> 00:44:33.419
pro quests requirement that when you
 

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:36.669

scientific publishers in many cases

00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:44.909
scientific publishers in many cases
 

00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:47.569

like a bed zero thank you put in your

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:31.220
like a bed zero thank you put in your
 

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.849
like a bed zero thank you put in your
information and just auto creates PDF

00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:33.859
information and just auto creates PDF
 

00:50:33.859 --> 00:50:37.390
information and just auto creates PDF
for the sample so you don't have to

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400
for the sample so you don't have to
 

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:44.060
for the sample so you don't have to
worry about you know copy pasting

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:44.070
 

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:50.470
thank you

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480
 

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.260
the embargo or the academic comments

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:54.270
the embargo or the academic comments
 

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:56.109
the embargo or the academic comments
would that allow me to sort out

00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119
would that allow me to sort out
 

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.570
would that allow me to sort out
copyright issues or I have to be done

00:50:59.570 --> 00:50:59.580
copyright issues or I have to be done
 

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.230
copyright issues or I have to be done
with all that when I actually foul the

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240
with all that when I actually foul the
 

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:11.480
with all that when I actually foul the
dissertation I would say that it's

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:11.490
dissertation I would say that it's
 

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:13.250
dissertation I would say that it's
better to sort them out before you

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260
better to sort them out before you
 

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.800
better to sort them out before you
submit and for the reason that it's not

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:15.810
submit and for the reason that it's not
 

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.230
submit and for the reason that it's not
just academic commons it's also ProQuest

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240
just academic commons it's also ProQuest
 

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.490
just academic commons it's also ProQuest
and so you can get embargoes with both

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:21.500
and so you can get embargoes with both
 

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.040
and so you can get embargoes with both
but you know the fact is if you if you

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.050
but you know the fact is if you if you
 

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.770
but you know the fact is if you if you
submit a particular version and then

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780
submit a particular version and then
 

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.170
submit a particular version and then
were you know we're just waiting that

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180
were you know we're just waiting that
 

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.790
were you know we're just waiting that
one year or two years at which point

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800
one year or two years at which point
 

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.160
one year or two years at which point
we'll make it available the version that

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.170
we'll make it available the version that
 

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.410
we'll make it available the version that
we got and so if you in that time

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420
we got and so if you in that time
 

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.910
we got and so if you in that time
weren't able to clear up all the

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920
weren't able to clear up all the
 

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.680
weren't able to clear up all the
copyright issues that would leave us in

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:39.690
copyright issues that would leave us in
 

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.930
copyright issues that would leave us in
a gray area where you would have

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940
a gray area where you would have
 

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.150
a gray area where you would have
submitted your dissertation write the

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160
submitted your dissertation write the
 

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.850
submitted your dissertation write the
version of record and then that version

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:46.860
version of record and then that version
 

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.740
version of record and then that version
can't be made available because there's

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:48.750
can't be made available because there's
 

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.690
can't be made available because there's
a copyright problem so I would say

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:52.700
a copyright problem so I would say
 

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.060
a copyright problem so I would say
before you submit resolve what you can
