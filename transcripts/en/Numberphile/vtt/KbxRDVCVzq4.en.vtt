00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.210
So some of you may have noticed
it's been a little

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.100
while since I uploaded a video
here on Numberphile, and I

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.250
thought it might be fun
to explain why.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.890
Basically I've been away.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.910
I've been in Canada and in
the US for two events--

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.660
a conference called BrainSTEM
and the big VidCon conference

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.440
in Anaheim in California.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.870
While I was at those events, I
had the opportunity to meet

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.580
some of the big players of
YouTube Science, including Vi

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.660
Hart, who I know a lot
of you watch already.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.230
VI HART: And a ratio of 100
million to 141 million.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.010
BRADY: Henry from
Minute Physics.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.650
HENRY: All in one equation.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.970
And it's humbly called
the standard model.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.950
BRADY: Destin from Smarter
Every Day.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.620
DESTIN: Hey, it's me, Destin.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.790
Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.800
And today we're going
to show you some

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.120
pretty cool high speed.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.690
Derek from Veritasium.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.670
DEREK: The first thing I need
to do is talk about vectors.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.570
BRADY: Michael from VSAUCE.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.090
MICHAEL: Hey, VSAUCE,
Michael here.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.410
BRADY: And the mysterious
CGP Grey.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.800
CGP GREY: Cayman Islands, the
Turks and Caicos islands,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.700
Gibraltar, the British Virgin
Islands, Akrotiri and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.740
Dhekelia, Anguilla--

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.610
BRADY: I didn't only
meet them.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.200
I also had a chance to film a
few quick interviews with

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.218
them, and I'll be uploading
them soon.

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.130
DESTIN: [LAUGHS]

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.280
Good Morning, Brady.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.230
BRADY: Probably on my channel
Sixty Symbols.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.820
So keep an eye out for that.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.500
There's already the interview
with Henry from

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.370
Minute Physics there.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.280
HENRY: I'll read it aloud while
I'm writing it, so I can

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.170
hear what it sounds like.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.820
And then once it's done, I'll
print it off and bring in here

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.850
and record it.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.410
BRADY: Now while we were at
VidCon, Destin, from Smarter

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.740
Every Day, brought along his
Phantom high-speed camera,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230
which is great fun.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.180
We set it up in the main hall.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.670
Here's me about to be
slapped in the face.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.620
And that's a slap from
two of the most

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.370
famous hands on YouTube.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.750
That's Minute Physics
and Vi Hart.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.740
What a privilege that was.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.840
Now, I had a great time.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.360
There's lots to talk about from
it, lots of photos and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.750
links, and I'll put them all in
the video description under

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.270
this video.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120
So please do have a look.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.110
And I hope to see all those
people again soon.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.270
Although it won't be too soon,
because I actually just put my

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.360
passport through the
washing machine.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.290
So I think I need to send
off for another one.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.870
But there'll be another normal
Numberphile video very soon.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.400
DR. JAMES GRIME: Then you
list the third diagonal.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.720
Then you take the fourth
diagonal, and the fifth.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.410
So eventually you are going
to list every fraction.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.570
Every faction appears on
a diagonal, and you're

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.820
going to list them.
