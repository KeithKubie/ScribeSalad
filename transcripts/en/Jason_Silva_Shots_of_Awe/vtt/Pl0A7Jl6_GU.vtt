This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Toyota.

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:24.530
So I'm fascinated by the
paradoxical function of art.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.080
There's that great
line that says,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.200
art is the lie that
reveals the truth.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.730
This paradoxical
nature, the fact

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.370
that art speaks to kind
of deeper ecstatic truth.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.170
It goes beyond empirical truth.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.300
It goes beyond empirical
reality and scratches

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.400
at the very edges of our psyche,
digs deeply into our soul.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.864
It appeals to that
space of archetype,

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:50.590
dream, of myth, of metaphor.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.090
Right?

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.391
It's like Werner
Herzog used to say,

00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.640
facts are not the most
interesting thing in the world.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.930
If facts were the most
interesting thing in the world,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479
then go buy the phone book.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.270
It's full of facts.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.100
What we're interested
in is ecstatic truth,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.825
[INAUDIBLE] wrote about,
reveals deeper truths

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.627
than a journalist's
more literal grid.

00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:13.300
In other words, the artist gets
us somewhere beyond the factual

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.988
and somehow reveals the truth.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.320
There's something kind of
beautiful about that idea,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.510
and I think that's
the function of art,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.965
to communicate with
us at that depth,

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.040
and thus, worth celebrating.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.390
