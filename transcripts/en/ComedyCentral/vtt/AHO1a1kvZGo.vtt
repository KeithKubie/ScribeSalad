LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS A

TREVOR, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.754
WELCOME, SIR!
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.756
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW ARE YOU? WE'RE
REALLY DELIGHTED THAT YOU'RE

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.926
GOING TO BE JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:31.064
AND I KNOW YOU FLEW IN JUST
YESTERDAY FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.836
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I JUST FLEW IN AND BOY
ARE MY ARMS TIRED!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:42.209
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY. ALL RIGHT THERE,
OLDIE BUT A GOODIE. VERY NICE.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.610
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, SERIOUSLY, I'VE BEEN
HOLDING MY ARMS LIKE THIS SINCE

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:44.811
I GOT HERE.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.346
YEAH, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
MORE AFRAID OF POLICE IN AMERICA

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.548
THAN IN SOUTH AFRICA.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.549
IT KIND OF MAKES ME A LITTLE
NOSTALGIC FOR THE OLD DAYS BACK

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.917
HOME.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.921
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S JUST -- C'MON,
ARE YOU SAYING BLACK PEOPLE IN

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:58.759
SOUTH AFRICA TODAY DON'T GET
ASSAULTED AND KILLED BY POLICE?

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.360
&gt;&gt; OH NO, NO, I MEAN THEY
DO, BUT SINCE APARTHEID ENDED

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.430
THEY'RE NOW ALSO GETTING KILLED
BY BLACK POLICE.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:03.797
PROGRESS.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.865
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.568
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL THAT'S,
THAT'S, LISTEN, BABY STEPS.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:15.442
BUT YOU'RE RELAXED NOW, YOU'RE
NOT NERVOUS, YOU FEEL GOOD.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.345
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT
NERVOUS, TO BE HONEST.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.247
BETWEEN YOUR COPS, AND, FRANKLY,
YOUR EBOLA.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR EBOLA, MY FRIEND!
IT'S NOT OUR, BELIEVE ME, HE

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.819
MISPOKE -- YOU ARE FROM AFRICA,
IT'S YOUR EBOLA, MY FRIEND.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.921
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. NO,NO. SOUTH AFRICA,
JON.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.122
WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE CASE IN
OVER 18 YEARS.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.524
IN FACT, MY FRIENDS WARNED ME,
THEY WERE LIKE

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.959
"TREVOR, DON'T GO, DON'T GO TO
THE U.S., YOU'LL CATCH EBOLA!"

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.160
BUT I WAS LIKE, "YOU
KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.964
JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD A FEW
CASES OF EBOLA DOESN'T MEAN WE

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:37.631
SHOULD CUT OFF TRAVEL THERE.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.032
THAT WOULD BE IGNORANT."

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.033
RIGHT?

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:46.740
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Jon: SURE -- THAT, THAT

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.841
-- THAT WOULD BE IGNORANT.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:54.615
YOU KNOW, I GUESS WE TEND
TO FORGET THAT SOUTH AFRICA,

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.617
YOU KNOW, ISN'T, YOU KNOW, RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO LIBERIA. RIGHT?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.586
&gt;&gt; IT'S 4,000 MILES AWAY.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.155
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I, YEAH, I WAS
CALCULATING IN KILOMETERS.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.560
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU WERE, JON,
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANKS.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.828
&gt;&gt; I KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.629
TO A LOT OF AMERICANS AFRICA IS
JUST ONE GIANT VILLAGE, FULL OF

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:09.830
AIDS HUTS AND STARVING CHILDREN
WHO

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.064
YOU CAN SAVE FOR JUST FIVE CENTS
A DAY!

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:15.469
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SIDE
OF AFRICA YOU NEVER GET TO SEE.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.604
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH! YOU'VE GOT THAT
VIDEO OF THE LIONS WHO CHASE

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.106
THAT BUFFALO, AND
THEN THE CROCODILE COMES UP

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.841
AND HE GRABS IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN? AND THEN HE GOES --

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.043
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH, AND THEN THE
BUFFALO GETS AWAY.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.445
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, YEAH YEAH!

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.280
&gt;&gt; YES. YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.548
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.416
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOPE, ME NEITHER.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.517
&gt;&gt; JON, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S
PLAY A LITTLE GAME.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:33.187
IT'S CALLED "SPOT THE AFRICA".

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.657
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE
ME

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.225
IDENTIFYING ANYTHING ON A MAP,
RIGHT?

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:38.692
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO
YOU.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:39.893
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU.

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:40.594
&gt;&gt; JUST TELL ME WHICH OF THESE
PICTURES WAS TAKEN IN AMERICA

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.695
AND WHICH IS FROM AFRICA.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:42.896
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I GOT THIS. THE
BEAUTIFUL HIGHWAY ON THE RIGHT

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.097
THERE, PROBABLY SILICON VALLEY,
IT'S PROBABLY HEADING OFF TO

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.165
TWITTER THERE. THE ONE ON
THE LEFT, CLEARLY BEEN SHELLED

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.266
BY REBELS, I'M GONNA GO
WITH SOMALIA, MAYBE. AND --

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.437
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, THE ROAD ON THE
RIGHT IS A SUPERHIGHWAY IN

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.673
CENTRAL AFRICA, THE PHOTO ON THE
LEFT I TOOK FROM MY CAB ON MY

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.275
WAY HERE FROM THE AIRPORT.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:03:00.380
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YEAH, THAT'S THE F.D.R.!

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:06.053
TRY AGAIN. TRY AGAIN.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:10.290
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. OKAY, THIS
ONE'S EASY. ON THE LEFT THERE

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:11.525
THAT'S THE "SUCCESS ACADEMY" IN
HARLEM. ON THE RIGHT THERE WE

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.759
GOT, YOU KNOW, WE GOT HOMELESS
KIDS. I'M GOING WITH IN SOMALIA

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:13.760
AGAIN. I THINK THAT'S MY GO TO
REFERENCE.

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.262
SOMALIA. HOMELESS KIDS.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.230
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, JON. THE ANSWER I
WAS LOOKING FOR WAS

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:17.564
"CLASSROOM IN
KENYA" ON THE LEFT AND "CHILDREN

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.166
IN DETROIT" ON THE RIGHT.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.134
LAST ONE.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.872
&gt;&gt; Jon: I HATE THIS (BLEEP)
GAME.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:27.975
ALRIGHT, NOW, I GET HOW THIS
WORKS NOW. THE ONE ON THE

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.378
RIGHT THERE, THAT'S DETROIT,
RIGHT? OKAY? AND THEN UH --

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.881
&gt;&gt; WELL ACTUALLY, THAT'S, THAT'S
A SLUM IN JOHANNESBURG.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:37.017
SOME PLACES IN AFRICA ARE STILL
PRETTY (BLEEP).

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.353
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT, I GET YOUR
POINT THERE, TREVOR. BUT

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:44.458
YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT THINGS
IN AFRICA ARE BETTER THAN THEY

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:45.692
ARE IN AMERICA, ARE YOU?

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.996
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT. YOU GUYS ARE SAYING THAT.

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:49.997
&gt;&gt; THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW
INCARCERATES MORE

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.534
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS A
PERCENTAGE THAN APARTHEID

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.537
IN SOUTH AFRICA DID. THE RACE
GAP IN WEALTH IN THE UNITED

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.539
STATES RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE
MEDIAN WHITE FAMILY AND THE

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.608
MEDIAN BLACK FAMILY IS 18 FOLD.
THAT'S GREATER THAN THE

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:05.646
BLACK-WHITE GAP WAS IN APARTHEID
SOUTH AFRICA.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:12.352
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH MY GOD.
&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE AMAZING PART.

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:15.622
FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO ACHIEVE
THAT KIND OF BLACK-WHITE WEALTH

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.959
GAP, WE HAD TO CONSTRUCT AN
ENTIRE APARTHEID STATE, DENYING

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.728
BLACKS THE RIGHT TO VOTE OR OWN
PROPERTY.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:25.065
BUT YOU, YOU DID IT WITHOUT
EVEN TRYING!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.167
WE TRAINED FOR DECADES AND YOU
JUST WALTZED IN AND WON THE GOLD

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.235
MEDAL.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:28.969
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL THAT'S,
YOU KNOW, BLUNDERING INTO THINGS

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.071
IS HOW WE ROLL.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.941
&gt;&gt; WELL, AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING
BETTER, WE STARTED FROM THE

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:37.945
BOTTOM AND NOW WE'RE HERE.
&gt;&gt; Jon: A LITTLE BIT OF DRIZZY.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.346
A LITTLE BIT OF DRAKE RIGHT
THERE. A LITTLE BIT OF --

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.914
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HER.
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT.

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.916
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST,
JON.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.086
AFRICA IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU
GUYS. YOU KNOW WHAT AFRICAN

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.122
MOTHERS TELL THEIR CHILDREN
EVERY DAY?

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:50.924
BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU
HAVE BECAUSE THERE ARE FAT

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.594
CHILDREN STARVING IN
MISSISSIPPI. IN FACT,

00:04:53.627 --> 00:05:02.202
WE ARE SO WORRIED THAT ME
AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS IN

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:06.406
SOWETO GOT TOGETHER AND I
TOLD THEM, I SAID GUYS, FOR

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.943
JUST A FEW PENNIES A DAY,
YOU CAN HELP AN AMERICAN.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.912
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S VERY KIND,
TREVOR.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:15.048
&gt;&gt; NOW THEY'RE EXPECTING
SOMETHING FROM YOU IN RETURN.

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:16.850
THEY'RE EXPECTING AT LEAST A
LETTER A MONTH.

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:17.618
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I KNOW. I KNOW HOW
THAT GOES.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:18.919
I KNOW HOW -- YOU HAVE TO WRITE
--

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:21.288
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU CAN JUST DRAW A PICTURE.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.589
&gt;&gt; Jon: WILL YOU PUT IT UP
ON THE FRIDGE? THAT'S NICE.

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.691
&gt;&gt; OH AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE
WROTE A SONG FOR YOU AS WELL.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.460
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALRIGHT. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.528
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH. GOES A LITTLE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:31.798
♪ FEED AMERICA.

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:36.270
♪ LET THEM KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:37.871
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, NO! ALRIGHT NO,

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:41.041
&gt;&gt;♪ FEED AMERICA

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.309
