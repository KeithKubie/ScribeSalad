intensities now we got a little bit of
 

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.260

since then we've implemented a what we
 

00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:24.819
since then we've implemented a what we
call project payback fund so the

implementing this we feel there's a lot

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:43.940
implementing this we feel there's a lot
 

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.329
implementing this we feel there's a lot
of low-hanging fruit and hopefully we'll

00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:46.339
of low-hanging fruit and hopefully we'll
 

00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:47.829
of low-hanging fruit and hopefully we'll
be able to come up with some rapid

be able to come up with some rapid
 

00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:51.489
be able to come up with some rapid
payback quickly so what are we doing

00:30:51.489 --> 00:30:51.499
payback quickly so what are we doing
 

00:30:51.499 --> 00:30:53.499
payback quickly so what are we doing
what are some of those energy projects

00:31:06.109 --> 00:31:07.749
continuous commissioning fact just this
morning before I came here I was in the

00:31:07.749 --> 00:31:07.759
morning before I came here I was in the
 

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:13.810
morning before I came here I was in the
meeting looking at another approach at

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:13.820
meeting looking at another approach at
 

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.729
meeting looking at another approach at
continuous commissioning which would

00:31:15.729 --> 00:31:15.739
continuous commissioning which would
 

00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:20.739
continuous commissioning which would
look promising we're looking at doing

00:31:20.739 --> 00:31:20.749
look promising we're looking at doing
 

00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:23.169
look promising we're looking at doing
energy audits we've conducted the

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:23.179
energy audits we've conducted the
 

00:31:23.179 --> 00:31:25.779
energy audits we've conducted the
initial energy audit 16 of our buildings

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:25.789

what we called our energy hogs and David

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:31.990
what we called our energy hogs and David
 

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.750

will remember that term from the Navy

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760
will remember that term from the Navy
 

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.090
will remember that term from the Navy
but those are our most wasteful

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.100
but those are our most wasteful

perspective and so we've got those ECMs

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:43.450
perspective and so we've got those ECMs
 

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.299
perspective and so we've got those ECMs
we're gonna lump those in along with

00:31:47.299 --> 00:31:47.309
we're gonna lump those in along with
 

00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:49.650
we're gonna lump those in along with
some approach for continuous

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:49.660
some approach for continuous
 

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.520
some approach for continuous
commissioning and we are also going to

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:53.530
commissioning and we are also going to
 

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.610
commissioning and we are also going to
do campus-wide lighting survey we're

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:56.620
do campus-wide lighting survey we're
 

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.760
do campus-wide lighting survey we're
gonna look at tying that because this

00:31:59.760 --> 00:31:59.770
gonna look at tying that because this
 

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.890
gonna look at tying that because this
you know we got to show payback so that

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:01.900
you know we got to show payback so that
 

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.210
you know we got to show payback so that
lighting survey will include some select

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220
lighting survey will include some select
 

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.430
lighting survey will include some select
replacement so I social energy savings

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440
replacement so I social energy savings
 

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.789
replacement so I social energy savings
and we didn't want this energy project

00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799
and we didn't want this energy project
 

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:15.000
and we didn't want this energy project
payback fund to be tied to just doing

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.010
payback fund to be tied to just doing
 

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.620
payback fund to be tied to just doing
studies you know we wanted it to

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:16.630
studies you know we wanted it to
 

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.640
studies you know we wanted it to
literally each piece of that payback and

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:20.650
literally each piece of that payback and
 

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.950
literally each piece of that payback and
then one of the big things that we're

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960
then one of the big things that we're
 

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.060
then one of the big things that we're
doing is trying to figure out what are

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.070
doing is trying to figure out what are
 

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.590
doing is trying to figure out what are
our target EU is across the campus as I

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600
our target EU is across the campus as I
 

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.940
our target EU is across the campus as I
mentioned we got some buildings at about

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:32.950
mentioned we got some buildings at about
 

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.340
mentioned we got some buildings at about
a hundred years old some buildings that

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.350
a hundred years old some buildings that
 

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.190
a hundred years old some buildings that
are much newer so are as you can imagine

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200
are much newer so are as you can imagine
 

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.159
are much newer so are as you can imagine
our energy use intensity is it's all

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:41.169
our energy use intensity is it's all
 

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:43.860
our energy use intensity is it's all
over the mat and we're trying to find

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:43.870
over the mat and we're trying to find
 

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.149
over the mat and we're trying to find
those targets that are reasonable and

00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159
those targets that are reasonable and
 

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:50.159
those targets that are reasonable and
worth the investment in those older

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:50.169
worth the investment in those older
 

00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:52.710
worth the investment in those older
buildings and then seeing what we can

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720
buildings and then seeing what we can
 

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.169
buildings and then seeing what we can
also do even in the newer buildings to

00:32:55.169 --> 00:32:55.179
also do even in the newer buildings to
 

00:32:55.179 --> 00:32:57.210
also do even in the newer buildings to
tighten that up and so we are in the

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:57.220
tighten that up and so we are in the
 

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.990
tighten that up and so we are in the
process right now of trying to define

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000
process right now of trying to define
 

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.200
process right now of trying to define
with our design partners what a status

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.210
with our design partners what a status
 

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:09.539
with our design partners what a status
quo a better and a best might cost and

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:09.549
quo a better and a best might cost and
 

00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:11.520

locations most dramatically first to
 

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.950
locations most dramatically first to
generate the most savings and then we

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960
generate the most savings and then we
 

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.930
generate the most savings and then we
can take that savings and use it to

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:31.940
can take that savings and use it to
 

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.140
can take that savings and use it to
justify additional projects as well so

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:35.150
justify additional projects as well so

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.910
technology I can pretty much guarantee
you that we'll never blindly roll out a

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920
you that we'll never blindly roll out a
 

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.040
you that we'll never blindly roll out a
project all of our locations without

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.050
project all of our locations without
 

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.430
project all of our locations without
really rigorously testing it I love

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440
really rigorously testing it I love
 

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.530
really rigorously testing it I love
doing pilots because it's a way of

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:56.540
doing pilots because it's a way of
 

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.090
doing pilots because it's a way of
engaging people that aren't really

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:58.100
engaging people that aren't really
 

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.920
engaging people that aren't really
familiar with energy and sustainability

00:36:59.920 --> 00:36:59.930
familiar with energy and sustainability
 

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:03.190
familiar with energy and sustainability
to show the value of a project one of my

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200
to show the value of a project one of my
 

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.660
to show the value of a project one of my
favorite days that I've ever spent

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:04.670
favorite days that I've ever spent
 

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.030
favorite days that I've ever spent
working at Giant Eagle was the day that

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040
working at Giant Eagle was the day that
 

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.100
working at Giant Eagle was the day that
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.110
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales
 

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.170
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales
floor and what we did is we went into

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.180
floor and what we did is we went into
 

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.690
floor and what we did is we went into
one store and we retrofitted half of the

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:13.700
one store and we retrofitted half of the
 

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.420
one store and we retrofitted half of the
sales floor with LEDs and the other half

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:16.430
sales floor with LEDs and the other half
 

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.450
sales floor with LEDs and the other half
we left as fluorescence we then invited

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:19.460
we left as fluorescence we then invited
 

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.610
we left as fluorescence we then invited
all the executives to literally walk the

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:21.620
all the executives to literally walk the
 

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.770
all the executives to literally walk the
store so they could literally see pre

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:23.780
store so they could literally see pre
 

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.570
store so they could literally see pre
and post post project what we were

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:25.580
and post post project what we were
 

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.760
and post post project what we were
trying to do and at the same time I

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:27.770
trying to do and at the same time I
 

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.579
trying to do and at the same time I
showed them we have real time energy

00:37:30.579 --> 00:37:30.589
showed them we have real time energy
 

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:32.589
showed them we have real time energy
honoring on all of our stores so I used

00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599
honoring on all of our stores so I used
 

00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:34.299
honoring on all of our stores so I used
that as a really valuable tool for

00:37:34.299 --> 00:37:34.309
that as a really valuable tool for
 

00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:36.219
that as a really valuable tool for
telling the energy story and I was

00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:36.229
telling the energy story and I was
 

00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:37.839
telling the energy story and I was
literally able to show them exactly how

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:37.849
literally able to show them exactly how
 

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:40.269
literally able to show them exactly how
much energy we reduced they could see

00:37:40.269 --> 00:37:40.279
much energy we reduced they could see
 

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:42.489
much energy we reduced they could see
aesthetically this won't help hurt the

00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:42.499
aesthetically this won't help hurt the
 

00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:44.289
aesthetically this won't help hurt the
stores it's gonna really improve our

00:37:44.289 --> 00:37:44.299
stores it's gonna really improve our
 

00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:46.719
stores it's gonna really improve our
guest experience and oh by the way this

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:46.729
guest experience and oh by the way this
 

00:37:46.729 --> 00:37:48.519
guest experience and oh by the way this
is we're actually saving that much

00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:48.529
is we're actually saving that much
 

00:37:48.529 --> 00:37:52.269
is we're actually saving that much
energy they could physically see it so I

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:52.279
energy they could physically see it so I
 

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:53.829
energy they could physically see it so I
think that's really important when you

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839
think that's really important when you
 

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:55.599
think that's really important when you
pilot projects it also gives you the

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:55.609
pilot projects it also gives you the
 

00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:57.219
pilot projects it also gives you the
opportunity for feedback which is very

00:37:57.219 --> 00:37:57.229
opportunity for feedback which is very
 

00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:58.809
opportunity for feedback which is very
important so literally that day

00:37:58.809 --> 00:37:58.819
important so literally that day
 

00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:01.239
important so literally that day
executives were going up to guess and

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:01.249
executives were going up to guess and
 

00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:02.349
executives were going up to guess and
asking what do you think about these

00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359
asking what do you think about these
 

00:38:02.359 --> 00:38:04.749
asking what do you think about these
lights do you like it you know what I

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:04.759
lights do you like it you know what I
 

00:38:04.759 --> 00:38:06.789
lights do you like it you know what I
mean so it was really a it was really

00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:06.799
mean so it was really a it was really
 

00:38:06.799 --> 00:38:07.930
mean so it was really a it was really
nice because we were able to get that

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:07.940
nice because we were able to get that
 

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.670
nice because we were able to get that
feedback and go to team members that are

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680
feedback and go to team members that are
 

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.079
feedback and go to team members that are
gonna be in the stores every single day

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:11.089
gonna be in the stores every single day
 

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:13.539
gonna be in the stores every single day
and ask how they feel about it so a lot

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:13.549
and ask how they feel about it so a lot
 

00:38:13.549 --> 00:38:14.920
and ask how they feel about it so a lot
of times that's really helpful because I

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:14.930
of times that's really helpful because I
 

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:15.910
of times that's really helpful because I
mean you're when you're in that

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920
mean you're when you're in that
 

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.440
mean you're when you're in that
highlighting stage you can refine the

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:17.450
highlighting stage you can refine the
 

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.870
highlighting stage you can refine the
rollout before you you know roll out

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880
rollout before you you know roll out
 

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.219
rollout before you you know roll out
something to all the stores then realize

00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:21.229
something to all the stores then realize
 

00:38:21.229 --> 00:38:23.799
something to all the stores then realize
oh shoot I wish I hadn't made these

00:38:23.799 --> 00:38:23.809
oh shoot I wish I hadn't made these
 

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:26.859
oh shoot I wish I hadn't made these
three changes before doing so one thing

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:26.869
three changes before doing so one thing
 

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:27.849
three changes before doing so one thing
that's really important when you're

00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:27.859
that's really important when you're
 

00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:29.259
that's really important when you're
talking about implementing projects is

00:38:29.259 --> 00:38:29.269
talking about implementing projects is
 

00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:30.910
talking about implementing projects is
to talk about all of the benefits

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920
to talk about all of the benefits
 

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.380
to talk about all of the benefits
associated with the project so it's not

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:32.390
associated with the project so it's not
 

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.569
associated with the project so it's not
just energy you have that aesthetic

00:38:34.569 --> 00:38:34.579
just energy you have that aesthetic
 

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:36.400
just energy you have that aesthetic
value you might have maintenance savings

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.410
value you might have maintenance savings
 

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.660
value you might have maintenance savings
so it's really important that when you

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:37.670
so it's really important that when you
 

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.489
so it's really important that when you
have that cross-functional team it

00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:39.499
have that cross-functional team it
 

00:38:39.499 --> 00:38:40.900
have that cross-functional team it
enables you to look at a project very

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:40.910
enables you to look at a project very
 

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.910
enables you to look at a project very
holistically and talk about all the

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920
holistically and talk about all the
 

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.359
holistically and talk about all the
benefits associated with it one thing

00:38:46.359 --> 00:38:46.369
benefits associated with it one thing
 

00:38:46.369 --> 00:38:48.789
benefits associated with it one thing
that's also really key into implementing

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:48.799
that's also really key into implementing
 

00:38:48.799 --> 00:38:50.829
that's also really key into implementing
rollouts is to kind of minimize how many

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839
rollouts is to kind of minimize how many
 

00:38:50.839 --> 00:38:53.049
rollouts is to kind of minimize how many
rollouts you have to do so when you're

00:38:53.049 --> 00:38:53.059
rollouts you have to do so when you're
 

00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:54.400
rollouts you have to do so when you're
doing something like a lighting project

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.410
doing something like a lighting project
 

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.289
doing something like a lighting project
you want to see are there any kind of

00:38:56.289 --> 00:38:56.299
you want to see are there any kind of
 

00:38:56.299 --> 00:38:57.940
you want to see are there any kind of
peripheral projects that I want to pull

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:57.950
peripheral projects that I want to pull
 

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.279
peripheral projects that I want to pull
into this rollout so a really great

00:39:00.279 --> 00:39:00.289
into this rollout so a really great
 

00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:03.099
into this rollout so a really great
example is where towards the end of

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:03.109
example is where towards the end of
 

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:05.829
example is where towards the end of
implementing LED across all of our sales

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839
implementing LED across all of our sales
 

00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:08.079
implementing LED across all of our sales
floor when we were at the beginning of

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:08.089
floor when we were at the beginning of
 

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:09.969
floor when we were at the beginning of
that projects we looked at the lighting

00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:09.979
that projects we looked at the lighting
 

00:39:09.979 --> 00:39:11.920
that projects we looked at the lighting
controls and we actually realized we

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:11.930
controls and we actually realized we
 

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.870
controls and we actually realized we
want to pair a dimming system with this

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880
want to pair a dimming system with this
 

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.630
want to pair a dimming system with this
LED retrofit because we can maximize the

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640
LED retrofit because we can maximize the
 

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.700
LED retrofit because we can maximize the
savings of the project we're reducing

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:18.710
savings of the project we're reducing
 

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.559
savings of the project we're reducing
upfront costs because now we have one

00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:20.569
upfront costs because now we have one
 

00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:23.799
upfront costs because now we have one
rollout instead of two rollouts so

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:23.809
rollout instead of two rollouts so
 

00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:25.150
rollout instead of two rollouts so
that's something that's really important

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160
that's something that's really important
 

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.319
that's something that's really important
you're implementing a project you want

00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:26.329
you're implementing a project you want
 

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:27.999
you're implementing a project you want
to make sure what other projects do I

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:28.009
to make sure what other projects do I
 

00:39:28.009 --> 00:39:31.599
to make sure what other projects do I
want to wrap in to this roll up one

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:31.609
want to wrap in to this roll up one
 

00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:33.069
want to wrap in to this roll up one
thing that I don't think people talk

00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079
thing that I don't think people talk
 

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.839
thing that I don't think people talk
about enough but I worry about it all

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:34.849
about enough but I worry about it all
 

00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:35.790
about enough but I worry about it all
the time

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800
the time
 

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.060
the time
locations is how can we simplify energy

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.070
locations is how can we simplify energy
 

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.050
locations is how can we simplify energy
projects in terms of implementation so I

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:43.060
projects in terms of implementation so I
 

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.000
projects in terms of implementation so I
don't know hopefully people are familiar

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.010
don't know hopefully people are familiar
 

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.870
don't know hopefully people are familiar
with Giant Eagle

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880
with Giant Eagle
 

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.670
with Giant Eagle
but here in the city if you think about

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680
but here in the city if you think about
 

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.020
but here in the city if you think about
all of our stores they're vastly

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.030
all of our stores they're vastly
 

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.360
all of our stores they're vastly
different from one another if you want

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:51.370
different from one another if you want
 

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.040
different from one another if you want
an example go to the Giant Eagle in

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.050
an example go to the Giant Eagle in
 

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.690
an example go to the Giant Eagle in
Squirrel Hill and then go to our shady

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:54.700
Squirrel Hill and then go to our shady
 

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.970
Squirrel Hill and then go to our shady
side Market District location incredibly

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:56.980
side Market District location incredibly
 

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.340

different stores so when we do something

00:39:59.340 --> 00:39:59.350
different stores so when we do something
 

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.290
different stores so when we do something
like an LED rollout I don't have the

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:01.300
like an LED rollout I don't have the
 

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.970
like an LED rollout I don't have the
time and internal resources to

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:02.980
time and internal resources to
 

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.920
time and internal resources to
necessarily do a custom solution at

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:04.930
necessarily do a custom solution at
 

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.200
necessarily do a custom solution at
every single store so how can I actually

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.210
every single store so how can I actually
 

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.300
every single store so how can I actually
roll this out in a time effective manner

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.310
roll this out in a time effective manner
 

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.160
roll this out in a time effective manner
I can't be upgrading our stores for the

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.170
I can't be upgrading our stores for the
 

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.600
I can't be upgrading our stores for the
next five years I need to get it done

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:12.610
next five years I need to get it done
 

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.620
next five years I need to get it done
within a year so this ties in to the

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:16.630
within a year so this ties in to the
 

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.720
within a year so this ties in to the
dimming systems that we paired with our

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:18.730
dimming systems that we paired with our
 

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.140
dimming systems that we paired with our
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:22.150
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say
 

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.490
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say
hundreds of different fixtures that we

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:23.500
hundreds of different fixtures that we
 

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.960
hundreds of different fixtures that we
would need to actually implement this

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:24.970
would need to actually implement this
 

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.610
would need to actually implement this
rollout we were able to narrow it down

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:26.620
rollout we were able to narrow it down
 

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.040
rollout we were able to narrow it down
to ten but but then because we have the

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.050
to ten but but then because we have the
 

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.080
to ten but but then because we have the
dimming control system we can then

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.090
dimming control system we can then
 

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.390
dimming control system we can then
custom the light levels at every single

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400
custom the light levels at every single
 

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.270
custom the light levels at every single
store so it makes it very easy to do the

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280
store so it makes it very easy to do the
 

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.190
store so it makes it very easy to do the
rollout and meet the needs of every

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200
rollout and meet the needs of every
 

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.840
rollout and meet the needs of every
single store without having to go to

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:39.850
single store without having to go to
 

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.700
single store without having to go to
every single store do a lighting layout

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:41.710
every single store do a lighting layout
 

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.000
every single store do a lighting layout
to a light analysis and things like that

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.010
to a light analysis and things like that
 

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.530
to a light analysis and things like that
so it helps really ease the

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:46.540
so it helps really ease the
 

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.070
so it helps really ease the
implementation one thing you also have

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:50.080
implementation one thing you also have
 

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.260
implementation one thing you also have
to work with is all of your partners

when you're getting ready to do an
 

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.410
when you're getting ready to do an
implementation project you have to

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:55.420
implementation project you have to
 

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.510

really be able to trust your vendors you
 

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.610
really be able to trust your vendors you
want to partner with your utilities if

00:40:59.610 --> 00:40:59.620
want to partner with your utilities if

you're pursuing things like rebates make
 

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.020
you're pursuing things like rebates make
sure you're really getting all the value

you can and also set expectations set

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:06.490
you can and also set expectations set
 

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.370
you can and also set expectations set

want the outcome to be so everyone is on
 

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.490
want the outcome to be so everyone is on
the same page and then when you actually

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:14.500
the same page and then when you actually
 

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.050
the same page and then when you actually
start to implement the project make sure

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:16.060
start to implement the project make sure
 

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.210
start to implement the project make sure
you're in constant communication make

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.220

that they found an efficiency and
they're able to you know reduce install

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:28.750
they're able to you know reduce install
 

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.660
they're able to you know reduce install
time by 10% you want to make sure that

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:30.670
time by 10% you want to make sure that
 

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.180
time by 10% you want to make sure that
all the install teams are sharing from

all the install teams are sharing from
 

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.380
all the install teams are sharing from
that knowledge and you're benefiting

make sure you're actually implementing

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:41.780
make sure you're actually implementing
 

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.530
make sure you're actually implementing
your plan as necessary and one important

aspect of implementing projects that I

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.280
aspect of implementing projects that I
 

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.590
aspect of implementing projects that I
think a lot of times people forget about

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:47.600
think a lot of times people forget about
 

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.240
think a lot of times people forget about
is when it's done

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:49.250
is when it's done
 

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.730
is when it's done
following up reporting on it you know

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:51.740
following up reporting on it you know
 

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.990
following up reporting on it you know
one thing that I always kind of laugh

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000
one thing that I always kind of laugh
 

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.490
one thing that I always kind of laugh
about it is when it comes to energy fit

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:54.500
about it is when it comes to energy fit
 

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.930
about it is when it comes to energy fit
and see a lot of people are focused on

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:55.940
and see a lot of people are focused on
 

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.440
and see a lot of people are focused on
the P&amp;L statements and I always track

00:41:59.440 --> 00:41:59.450
the P&amp;L statements and I always track
 

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.260
the P&amp;L statements and I always track
energy cost energy consumption and

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:02.270
energy cost energy consumption and
 

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.870
energy cost energy consumption and
energy price so as we're doing this LED

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880

retrofit I'm all over the stores for

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:06.530
retrofit I'm all over the stores for
 

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.750
retrofit I'm all over the stores for
watching their films watching their

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760
watching their films watching their
 

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.550
watching their films watching their
energy line and there was a handful of

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560
energy line and there was a handful of
 

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.040
energy line and there was a handful of
stores that I noticed their energy costs

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.050
stores that I noticed their energy costs
 

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.650
stores that I noticed their energy costs
went up after this LED project so I

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:14.660
went up after this LED project so I
 

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.510
went up after this LED project so I
start stressing out I go into all the

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520
start stressing out I go into all the
 

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.950
start stressing out I go into all the
bills and I realize okay they actually

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960
bills and I realize okay they actually
 

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.410
bills and I realize okay they actually
reduce consumption to line items

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:20.420
reduce consumption to line items
 

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.600
reduce consumption to line items
increased to the point it completely

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:22.610
increased to the point it completely
 

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.450
increased to the point it completely
negated from a cost perspective our LED

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.460
negated from a cost perspective our LED
 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.190
negated from a cost perspective our LED
rollouts and then I actually had to

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200
rollouts and then I actually had to
 

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.020
rollouts and then I actually had to
create the story internally and say

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.030
create the story internally and say
 

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.350
create the story internally and say
listen this turned from a cost savings

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:32.360
listen this turned from a cost savings
 

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.590
listen this turned from a cost savings
to cost avoidance and actually show

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:35.600
to cost avoidance and actually show
 

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.870
to cost avoidance and actually show
people we absolutely reduced and the

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880
people we absolutely reduced and the
 

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.210
people we absolutely reduced and the
project was successful and this is what

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:40.220
project was successful and this is what
 

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.650
project was successful and this is what
would have happened if we hadn't done it

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:41.660
would have happened if we hadn't done it
 

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.820
would have happened if we hadn't done it
so it's really important that you're

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:42.830
so it's really important that you're
 

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.960
so it's really important that you're
communicating with your vendors

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:43.970
communicating with your vendors
 

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.150
communicating with your vendors
communicating internally on the success

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160
communicating internally on the success
 

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.400
communicating internally on the success
of a project you also want to monitor it

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:48.410
of a project you also want to monitor it
 

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.930
of a project you also want to monitor it
to make sure you actually did receive

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:49.940
to make sure you actually did receive
 

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.240
to make sure you actually did receive
that savings for a lot of projects you

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:52.250
that savings for a lot of projects you
 

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.970
that savings for a lot of projects you
can install controls incorrectly and

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:54.980
can install controls incorrectly and
 

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.410
can install controls incorrectly and
then they're actually not functional so

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:56.420
then they're actually not functional so
 

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.520
then they're actually not functional so
you always want to do that due diligence

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:57.530
you always want to do that due diligence
 

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.310
you always want to do that due diligence
after you implement a project

00:42:59.310 --> 00:42:59.320
after you implement a project
 

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.480
after you implement a project
communicate that success I'm sure it's

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:01.490
communicate that success I'm sure it's
 

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.470
communicate that success I'm sure it's
working as it should be and that eases

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480
working as it should be and that eases
 

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.480
working as it should be and that eases
kind of when you have your next project

from the top down we look for ways to

from the top down we look for ways to
 

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.099
from the top down we look for ways to
take the next step in that direction but

00:45:48.099 --> 00:45:48.109
take the next step in that direction but
 

00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:49.630
take the next step in that direction but
again I think the biggest challenges for

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640
again I think the biggest challenges for
 

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.319
again I think the biggest challenges for
us are proving proving it out in an

00:45:53.319 --> 00:45:53.329
us are proving proving it out in an
 

00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:55.450
us are proving proving it out in an
efficient process and then also being

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:55.460
efficient process and then also being
 

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.549
efficient process and then also being
able to execute the prop the projects

00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559
able to execute the prop the projects
 

00:45:57.559 --> 00:45:59.049
able to execute the prop the projects
efficiently so that they're successful

00:45:59.049 --> 00:45:59.059
efficiently so that they're successful
 

00:45:59.059 --> 00:45:59.980
efficiently so that they're successful
in the end

00:45:59.980 --> 00:45:59.990
in the end
 

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.200
in the end
and then obviously lead to the next

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.210
and then obviously lead to the next
 

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.019
and then obviously lead to the next
project so we aren't certainly aren't

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:05.029
project so we aren't certainly aren't
 

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.630
project so we aren't certainly aren't
doing as much as we'd like I know from

doing as much as we'd like I know from

here locally to have resources that can
assist us with that and can also kind of

assist us with that and can also kind of
 

00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:28.870
assist us with that and can also kind of

I learned that as I mentioned we have a
 

00:47:31.269 --> 00:47:33.749
I learned that as I mentioned we have a
wide range of portfolios that's the

00:47:33.749 --> 00:47:33.759
wide range of portfolios that's the
 

00:47:33.759 --> 00:47:37.199
wide range of portfolios that's the
older buildings as Aurora said you know

learned you got to be very careful on

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559
learned you got to be very careful on
 

00:48:05.559 --> 00:48:08.339

the first time I tried to explain it
just the 5x to the board and so I've

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880
just the 5x to the board and so I've
 

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.039
just the 5x to the board and so I've
learned my lesson and it's you have to

00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:20.049
learned my lesson and it's you have to
 

00:48:20.049 --> 00:48:22.729
learned my lesson and it's you have to
be careful you have to tell the story on

00:48:22.729 --> 00:48:22.739
be careful you have to tell the story on
 

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:29.910
be careful you have to tell the story on
how how that energy cost is is better it

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920
how how that energy cost is is better it
 

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.669
how how that energy cost is is better it
might be more for that space than it was

00:48:32.669 --> 00:48:32.679
might be more for that space than it was
 

00:48:32.679 --> 00:48:35.429
might be more for that space than it was
but we bought a benefit so it becomes a

but we bought a benefit so it becomes a
 

00:48:35.439 --> 00:48:38.579
but we bought a benefit so it becomes a
cost avoidance rather than a cost

00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:38.589
cost avoidance rather than a cost
 

00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:39.390
cost avoidance rather than a cost
savings

I think it's yes and no and so you know

00:48:44.519 --> 00:48:44.529
I think it's yes and no and so you know
 

00:48:44.529 --> 00:48:46.529
I think it's yes and no and so you know
the example of the LED lights is a great

00:48:46.529 --> 00:48:46.539
the example of the LED lights is a great
 

00:48:46.539 --> 00:48:48.779
the example of the LED lights is a great
example right so make cost more upfront

00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:48.789
example right so make cost more upfront
 

00:48:48.789 --> 00:48:50.809
example right so make cost more upfront
but the lifecycle cost may be

00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819
but the lifecycle cost may be
 

00:48:50.819 --> 00:48:53.189
but the lifecycle cost may be
significant or especially you have to

00:48:53.189 --> 00:48:53.199
significant or especially you have to
 

00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:55.529
significant or especially you have to
pay you know eighty to eighty dollars an

00:48:55.529 --> 00:48:55.539
pay you know eighty to eighty dollars an
 

00:48:55.539 --> 00:48:57.239
pay you know eighty to eighty dollars an
hour for electrician to come out and

00:48:57.239 --> 00:48:57.249
hour for electrician to come out and
 

00:48:57.249 --> 00:48:59.339
hour for electrician to come out and
real amp you know every two or three

00:48:59.339 --> 00:48:59.349
real amp you know every two or three
 

00:48:59.349 --> 00:49:02.880
real amp you know every two or three
years versus every 15 year right so I

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:02.890
years versus every 15 year right so I
 

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:04.849
years versus every 15 year right so I
think you know what Scott talked about

00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859
think you know what Scott talked about
 

00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:07.289
think you know what Scott talked about
what we're working on as well changing

00:49:07.289 --> 00:49:07.299
what we're working on as well changing
 

00:49:07.299 --> 00:49:09.809
what we're working on as well changing
the design criteria so that we actually

00:49:09.809 --> 00:49:09.819
the design criteria so that we actually
 

00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:12.059
the design criteria so that we actually
are more thoughtful and what we put in

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:12.069
are more thoughtful and what we put in
 

00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:13.919
are more thoughtful and what we put in
there and then I think more importantly

00:49:13.919 --> 00:49:13.929
there and then I think more importantly
 

00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:16.979
there and then I think more importantly
going from what you talked about the

00:49:16.979 --> 00:49:16.989
going from what you talked about the
 

00:49:16.989 --> 00:49:19.650
going from what you talked about the
first cost of construction to lifecycle

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:19.660
first cost of construction to lifecycle
 

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.259
first cost of construction to lifecycle
cost and so looking at the entire system

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:22.269
cost and so looking at the entire system
 

00:49:22.269 --> 00:49:24.749
cost and so looking at the entire system
from you know when you build it when you

00:49:24.749 --> 00:49:24.759
from you know when you build it when you
 

00:49:24.759 --> 00:49:27.900
from you know when you build it when you
plan it and build it to disposal

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:27.910
plan it and build it to disposal
 

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.030
plan it and build it to disposal
and looking at the lifecycle of the

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040
and looking at the lifecycle of the
 

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.530
and looking at the lifecycle of the
people and seeing what's the right

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:31.540
people and seeing what's the right
 

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.530
people and seeing what's the right
investment to make in doing that in the

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:34.540
investment to make in doing that in the
 

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.670
investment to make in doing that in the
early stages of planning I think is the

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680
early stages of planning I think is the
 

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.950
early stages of planning I think is the
direction that we need to head in and so

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960
direction that we need to head in and so
 

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.220
direction that we need to head in and so
the focus has always been on the first

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:44.230
the focus has always been on the first
 

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.650
the focus has always been on the first
cost how can I save money on this you

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:46.660
cost how can I save money on this you
 

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.570
cost how can I save money on this you
know multi-million dollar project well

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:48.580
know multi-million dollar project well
 

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.030
know multi-million dollar project well
you may be saving five hundred thousand

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040
you may be saving five hundred thousand
 

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.650
you may be saving five hundred thousand
dollars but you're gonna be paying eight

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:52.660
dollars but you're gonna be paying eight
 

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.660
dollars but you're gonna be paying eight
million dollars over sixty years of the

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:54.670
million dollars over sixty years of the
 

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.640
million dollars over sixty years of the
life of the building which is probably

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:56.650
life of the building which is probably
 

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.980
life of the building which is probably
not the smartest investment so I think

00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:58.990
not the smartest investment so I think
 

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.670
not the smartest investment so I think
that approach is so we answer this

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680
that approach is so we answer this
 

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.990
that approach is so we answer this
question every day up down in sideways

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000
question every day up down in sideways
 

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.730
question every day up down in sideways
and we make the case for it with all

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:08.740
and we make the case for it with all
 

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.250
and we make the case for it with all
sorts of different owners and sizes and

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:11.260
sorts of different owners and sizes and
 

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.140
sorts of different owners and sizes and
types and the answer is it doesn't have

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:13.150
types and the answer is it doesn't have
 

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.360
types and the answer is it doesn't have
to but sometimes it does and sometimes

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:15.370
to but sometimes it does and sometimes
 

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.490
to but sometimes it does and sometimes
people get super excited about

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:17.500
people get super excited about
 

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.200
people get super excited about
everything that they're doing and they

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:19.210
everything that they're doing and they
 

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.300
everything that they're doing and they
want to change the paradigm and that's a

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.310
want to change the paradigm and that's a
 

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.410
want to change the paradigm and that's a
really important thing that I think

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:22.420
really important thing that I think
 

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.660
really important thing that I think
David just hit on is you know this

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:24.670
David just hit on is you know this
 

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.280
David just hit on is you know this
question about buildings consume 40

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.290
question about buildings consume 40
 

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.690
question about buildings consume 40
percent of all the energy that we use in

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:27.700
percent of all the energy that we use in
 

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.610
percent of all the energy that we use in
the United States we've been using that

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:29.620
the United States we've been using that
 

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.710

statistic in the green building industry

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720
statistic in the green building industry
 

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.040
statistic in the green building industry
for 25 years and the number hasn't

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.050
for 25 years and the number hasn't
 

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.250
for 25 years and the number hasn't
changed that's the problem right because

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:38.260
changed that's the problem right because
 

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.350
changed that's the problem right because
we're not shifting we're just like doing

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:40.360
we're not shifting we're just like doing
 

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.630
we're not shifting we're just like doing
these incremental reductions and this is

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640
these incremental reductions and this is
 

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.910
these incremental reductions and this is
why things like the Passivhaus movement

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920
why things like the Passivhaus movement
 

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.340
why things like the Passivhaus movement
has really resonated with some people

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:47.350
has really resonated with some people
 

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.230
has really resonated with some people
because it takes an entirely different

approach it's like great take energy use

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:51.130

cut it down by half at the beginning a

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:54.090
cut it down by half at the beginning a
 

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.250
cut it down by half at the beginning a

minimum could have got my half maybe all
 

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.410
minimum could have got my half maybe all
the way down to 10% and then have your

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:58.420
the way down to 10% and then have your
 

00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.700
the way down to 10% and then have your
most efficient building layer on

00:50:59.700 --> 00:50:59.710
most efficient building layer on
 

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.320
most efficient building layer on
renewables and don't worry about it

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:01.330
renewables and don't worry about it
 

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.970
renewables and don't worry about it
because you're building an asset and I

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:02.980
because you're building an asset and I
 

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.140
because you're building an asset and I
think that's one of the things that we

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.150
think that's one of the things that we
 

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.580
think that's one of the things that we
sometimes forget about in the building

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:05.590
sometimes forget about in the building
 

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.980
sometimes forget about in the building
industry it's not just about economics

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:07.990
industry it's not just about economics
 

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:10.530
industry it's not just about economics
we're building somewhere that's gonna be

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:10.540
we're building somewhere that's gonna be
 

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.910
we're building somewhere that's gonna be
a place it's going to contribute to that

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920
a place it's going to contribute to that
 

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.230

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.460
community and our environment for 50 100
200 years and we really need to be

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:17.470
200 years and we really need to be
 

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:22.900
200 years and we really need to be
treating our buildings like assets

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:22.910
 
 

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.900
 
as lifecycle assessment also talking

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:25.910
as lifecycle assessment also talking
 

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:29.200
as lifecycle assessment also talking
about risk as well so talking about what

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:29.210
about risk as well so talking about what
 

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.569
about risk as well so talking about what
happens if energy prices double in ten

00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:31.579
happens if energy prices double in ten

happens if energy prices double in ten
years

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:31.970
years
 

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.339
years
we're planning on this building being

00:51:33.339 --> 00:51:33.349
we're planning on this building being
 

00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:35.859
we're planning on this building being
here for another twenty years so you

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:35.869
here for another twenty years so you
 

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:37.779
here for another twenty years so you
know both in terms of energy costs in

00:51:37.779 --> 00:51:37.789
know both in terms of energy costs in
 

00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:39.609
know both in terms of energy costs in
terms of sustainability in terms of

00:51:39.609 --> 00:51:39.619
terms of sustainability in terms of
 

00:51:39.619 --> 00:51:41.710
terms of sustainability in terms of
resilience we also have to be talking

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720
resilience we also have to be talking
 

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.230
resilience we also have to be talking
about risk especially when it comes to

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240
about risk especially when it comes to
 

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.210
about risk especially when it comes to
new construction and we're gonna be

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:46.220
new construction and we're gonna be
 

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.920
new construction and we're gonna be
stuck with that asset for decades to

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:47.930
stuck with that asset for decades to
 

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:48.430
stuck with that asset for decades to
come

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440
come
 

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.620
come
this is really the best opportunity to

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:50.630
this is really the best opportunity to
 

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:51.910
this is really the best opportunity to
avoid some of that risk so we're not

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920
avoid some of that risk so we're not
 

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.500
avoid some of that risk so we're not
implementing projects halfway through

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:53.510
implementing projects halfway through
 

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.839
implementing projects halfway through
and then this benefit from doing it from

00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:55.849
and then this benefit from doing it from
 

00:51:55.849 --> 00:52:01.150
and then this benefit from doing it from
the beginning well I agree yeah I agree

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160
the beginning well I agree yeah I agree
 

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.470
the beginning well I agree yeah I agree
with everything that's been said I think

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480
with everything that's been said I think
 

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.140
with everything that's been said I think
that the challenge again is also there

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:05.150
that the challenge again is also there
 

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:06.819
that the challenge again is also there
certainly as that first cost and it is a

00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:06.829
certainly as that first cost and it is a
 

00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:09.640
certainly as that first cost and it is a
challenge but the and the lifecycle cost

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:09.650
challenge but the and the lifecycle cost
 

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.170
challenge but the and the lifecycle cost
is something that needs to be evaluated

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:11.180
is something that needs to be evaluated
 

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.450
is something that needs to be evaluated
and that's something that at least in a

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:13.460
and that's something that at least in a
 

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.680
and that's something that at least in a
lot of the markets that we deal with

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:14.690
lot of the markets that we deal with
 

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.750
lot of the markets that we deal with
changing that paradigm because so much

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760
changing that paradigm because so much
 

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.299
changing that paradigm because so much
of our lifecycle costs are reliant on

00:52:19.299 --> 00:52:19.309
of our lifecycle costs are reliant on
 

00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:23.020
of our lifecycle costs are reliant on
tenant behaviors and you know where this

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:23.030
tenant behaviors and you know where this
 

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.849
tenant behaviors and you know where this
where the savings are actually realized

00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:24.859
where the savings are actually realized
 

00:52:24.859 --> 00:52:27.039
where the savings are actually realized
and how that affects kind of the success

00:52:27.039 --> 00:52:27.049
and how that affects kind of the success
 

00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:28.809
and how that affects kind of the success
of the project on the economic model and

00:52:28.809 --> 00:52:28.819
of the project on the economic model and
 

00:52:28.819 --> 00:52:30.099
of the project on the economic model and
it's something that we're working to try

00:52:30.099 --> 00:52:30.109
it's something that we're working to try
 

00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:31.900
it's something that we're working to try
to get better at it's a little different

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:31.910
to get better at it's a little different
 

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.299
to get better at it's a little different
than an institutional scenario where you

00:52:34.299 --> 00:52:34.309
than an institutional scenario where you
 

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:35.859
than an institutional scenario where you
know the same people that own it live

00:52:35.859 --> 00:52:35.869
know the same people that own it live
 

00:52:35.869 --> 00:52:38.710
know the same people that own it live
there and you know can be controlled

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720
there and you know can be controlled
 

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.970
there and you know can be controlled
maybe a little bit better one of the

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:39.980
maybe a little bit better one of the
 

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.690
maybe a little bit better one of the
biggest differentiators for us is the

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:42.700
biggest differentiators for us is the
 

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.740
biggest differentiators for us is the
would be in some of the amenities and

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:44.750
would be in some of the amenities and
 

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.380
would be in some of the amenities and
the the attractiveness of the property

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:47.390
the the attractiveness of the property
 

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.120
the the attractiveness of the property
so some of the low-hanging fruit whether

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:49.130
so some of the low-hanging fruit whether
 

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.329
so some of the low-hanging fruit whether
it's you know enhanced energy

00:52:52.329 --> 00:52:52.339
it's you know enhanced energy
 

00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:53.980
it's you know enhanced energy
performance that the tenants realize on

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:53.990
performance that the tenants realize on
 

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:55.120
performance that the tenants realize on
you know where we can do it

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:55.130
you know where we can do it
 

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.370
you know where we can do it
incrementally evie stations that are put

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:57.380
incrementally evie stations that are put
 

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.779
incrementally evie stations that are put
in our properties things like that that

00:52:58.779 --> 00:52:58.789
in our properties things like that that
 

00:52:58.789 --> 00:53:00.789
in our properties things like that that
they see and we start to see the tenants

00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799
they see and we start to see the tenants
 

00:53:00.799 --> 00:53:02.829
they see and we start to see the tenants
that want it pay maybe a slight premium

00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839
that want it pay maybe a slight premium
 

00:53:02.839 --> 00:53:04.809
that want it pay maybe a slight premium
for it that's where it helps to feed the

00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:04.819
for it that's where it helps to feed the
 

00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:06.700
for it that's where it helps to feed the
model back and it's easier to take those

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:06.710
model back and it's easier to take those
 

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.980
model back and it's easier to take those
things on at the beginning thank you I

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:08.990
things on at the beginning thank you I
 

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.380

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.030
little bit about so our audience is
 

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:25.450
little bit about so our audience is
familiar with what happens when you're

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:25.460

they come out and how do they change
 

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.630
they come out and how do they change
just briefly yeah sure so when you are

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640
just briefly yeah sure so when you are
 

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.470
just briefly yeah sure so when you are
injecting your frack fluid that may be a

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.970
fracturing operation or some of that
water may actually be recycled so we'll

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:51.980
water may actually be recycled so we'll
 

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.010
water may actually be recycled so we'll
come back to that in just a second

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.020
come back to that in just a second
 

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.470
come back to that in just a second
you also have formation water or water

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480
you also have formation water or water
 

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.110
you also have formation water or water
that is present in the shale itself and

01:01:59.110 --> 01:01:59.120
that is present in the shale itself and
 

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.450
that is present in the shale itself and
so after the fracturing operation

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:01.460
so after the fracturing operation
 

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.750
so after the fracturing operation
actually happens you get flowback water

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760
actually happens you get flowback water
 

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.280
actually happens you get flowback water
the composition of which looks something

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:06.290
the composition of which looks something
 

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.170
the composition of which looks something
like the composition of the water that

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:08.180
like the composition of the water that

you put down the well in the first place

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.090
you put down the well in the first place
 

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:13.240
you put down the well in the first place
and then over time it evolved to look

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:13.250
and then over time it evolved to look
 

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.280
and then over time it evolved to look
much more like the water that's present

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:15.290
much more like the water that's present
 

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.340
much more like the water that's present
in the formation itself these shales

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:18.350
in the formation itself these shales
 

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:22.570
in the formation itself these shales
have a number of different minerals that

concentrations of clay sometimes which
 

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.950
concentrations of clay sometimes which
have lots and lots of ions in sort of

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960
have lots and lots of ions in sort of
 

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.200
have lots and lots of ions in sort of
trapped in that clay layer and and that

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:35.210
trapped in that clay layer and and that
 

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.240
trapped in that clay layer and and that
is most likely the source of a lot of

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:37.250
is most likely the source of a lot of
 

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.540
is most likely the source of a lot of

that we see in the flowback water here
 

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.320
that we see in the flowback water here
in the Marcellus it sounds like a

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:44.330
in the Marcellus it sounds like a
 

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:47.560
in the Marcellus it sounds like a
terrible treatment challenge and and in

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:47.570
terrible treatment challenge and and in
 

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:51.130
terrible treatment challenge and and in
some respects is is this putting new

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:51.140
some respects is is this putting new
 

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.380
some respects is is this putting new

exciting frontiers do you see emerging

01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720
exciting frontiers do you see emerging
 

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.020
exciting frontiers do you see emerging
from the science side of things yeah so

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.030
from the science side of things yeah so
 

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:05.700
from the science side of things yeah so
I think that the first frontier is

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:05.710
I think that the first frontier is
 

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.590
I think that the first frontier is
actually avoiding treatment altogether

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:07.600
actually avoiding treatment altogether
 

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.570
actually avoiding treatment altogether
or minimizing treatment treatment is

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.580
or minimizing treatment treatment is
 

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.850
or minimizing treatment treatment is
very very costly it's also energy

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:11.860
very very costly it's also energy
 

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.650
very very costly it's also energy
intensive and it's hard to do at the

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:13.660
intensive and it's hard to do at the
 

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.720
intensive and it's hard to do at the
distributed scale that's relevant to

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:15.730
distributed scale that's relevant to

dealing with water in the energy sector
 

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.529
dealing with water in the energy sector
in the United States can you look at

01:09:01.529 --> 01:09:01.539
in the United States can you look at
 

01:09:01.539 --> 01:09:03.299
in the United States can you look at
other countries as Veolia working

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:03.309
other countries as Veolia working
 

01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:04.649
other countries as Veolia working
elsewhere in the world and are you

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:04.659
elsewhere in the world and are you
 

01:09:04.659 --> 01:09:06.899
elsewhere in the world and are you
seeing some interesting examples or

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:06.909
seeing some interesting examples or
 

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:10.049
seeing some interesting examples or
lessons that can be inform the United

01:09:10.049 --> 01:09:10.059
lessons that can be inform the United
 

01:09:10.059 --> 01:09:11.279
lessons that can be inform the United
States or are we really on the forefront

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:11.289
States or are we really on the forefront
 

01:09:11.289 --> 01:09:13.519
States or are we really on the forefront
of dealing with some of these challenges

01:09:13.519 --> 01:09:13.529
of dealing with some of these challenges
 

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:16.140
of dealing with some of these challenges
yeah I mean there is a lot of it depends

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.150
yeah I mean there is a lot of it depends
 

01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.470
yeah I mean there is a lot of it depends
the scope you take I mean if you take

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480
the scope you take I mean if you take
 

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.200
the scope you take I mean if you take
shale gas definitely I think here is at

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:22.210
shale gas definitely I think here is at
 

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.669
shale gas definitely I think here is at
the front of what's happening if you

01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679
the front of what's happening if you
 

01:09:23.679 --> 01:09:26.970
the front of what's happening if you
enlarge to wet gas and then you are not

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:26.980
enlarge to wet gas and then you are not
 

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.089
enlarge to wet gas and then you are not
shale and then then we have seen we've

01:09:30.089 --> 01:09:30.099
shale and then then we have seen we've
 

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.279
shale and then then we have seen we've
seen projects in the world we have seen

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:32.289
seen projects in the world we have seen
 

01:09:32.289 --> 01:09:34.499
seen projects in the world we have seen
very interesting projects they are all

01:09:34.499 --> 01:09:34.509
very interesting projects they are all
 

01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.599
very interesting projects they are all
very different the regulations are

01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:36.609
very different the regulations are
 

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:39.959
very different the regulations are
different the but the funny thing is the

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:39.969
different the but the funny thing is the
 

01:09:39.969 --> 01:09:42.959
different the but the funny thing is the
technologies base is similar but to make

01:09:42.959 --> 01:09:42.969
technologies base is similar but to make
 

01:09:42.969 --> 01:09:45.349
technologies base is similar but to make
the process resilient you know small

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359
the process resilient you know small
 

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.980
the process resilient you know small
changes are very very

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:46.990
changes are very very
 

01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:49.800
changes are very very
important I think for me the keys so we

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:49.810
important I think for me the keys so we
 

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:50.700
important I think for me the keys so we
are in the world there is a lot

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:50.710
are in the world there is a lot
 

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:53.700
are in the world there is a lot
demanding yeah there is a lot of

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:53.710
demanding yeah there is a lot of
 

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:55.680
demanding yeah there is a lot of
interesting projects world why we are

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:55.690
interesting projects world why we are
 

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:58.440
interesting projects world why we are
also working a lot in the power industry

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:58.450
also working a lot in the power industry
 

01:09:58.450 --> 01:10:00.810
also working a lot in the power industry
in general you know power plants so we

01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:00.820
in general you know power plants so we
 

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.470
in general you know power plants so we
could enlarge it but for shale gas I

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480
could enlarge it but for shale gas I
 

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.040
could enlarge it but for shale gas I
mean here is is really yeah they you you

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:08.050
mean here is is really yeah they you you
 

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.530
mean here is is really yeah they you you
bring up the the point that water and

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:10.540
bring up the the point that water and
 

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.930
bring up the the point that water and
energy are interconnected from across

Australia built an incredible capacity
of design nation plans which was good

01:14:25.379 --> 01:14:25.389
of design nation plans which was good
 

01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:27.600
of design nation plans which was good
for an industry and suddenly started to

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:27.610
for an industry and suddenly started to
 

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:29.490

rain a lot as if that's right It was as

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:29.500
rain a lot as if that's right It was as
 

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.100
rain a lot as if that's right It was as
if they made a big pile of money on the

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:32.110
if they made a big pile of money on the
 

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.990
if they made a big pile of money on the
beach and it set it on fire and the

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000
beach and it set it on fire and the
 

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.060
beach and it set it on fire and the
rains came from the sky so that's a bad

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:36.070
rains came from the sky so that's a bad
 

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:40.500
rains came from the sky so that's a bad
example so but I think we really need to

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:40.510
example so but I think we really need to
 

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.899
example so but I think we really need to
plan to think I think also what's

01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:42.909
plan to think I think also what's
 

01:14:42.909 --> 01:14:44.609
plan to think I think also what's
important Singh energy don't sing on

01:14:44.609 --> 01:14:44.619
important Singh energy don't sing on
 

01:14:44.619 --> 01:14:46.800
important Singh energy don't sing on
your water it costs a lot of energy to

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:46.810
your water it costs a lot of energy to
 

01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:49.740
your water it costs a lot of energy to
desalinate seawater so what about the

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:49.750
desalinate seawater so what about the
 

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.390
desalinate seawater so what about the
reuse I think we you should be

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400
reuse I think we you should be
 

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.570
reuse I think we you should be
definitely a big part of the city

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:54.580
definitely a big part of the city
 

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.879
definitely a big part of the city
thinking because reuse is cheaper in

01:14:56.879 --> 01:14:56.889
thinking because reuse is cheaper in
 

01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:58.410
thinking because reuse is cheaper in
terms of energy it has less you know

01:14:58.410 --> 01:14:58.420
terms of energy it has less you know
 

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.590
terms of energy it has less you know
easier you know way cheaper so uh so I

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600
easier you know way cheaper so uh so I
 

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.950
easier you know way cheaper so uh so I
think some of our cities have not

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960
think some of our cities have not
 

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.959
think some of our cities have not
planned enough in the u.s. we know that

01:15:06.959 --> 01:15:06.969
planned enough in the u.s. we know that
 

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:08.540

in terms of water infrastructure

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:08.550
in terms of water infrastructure
 

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.010
in terms of water infrastructure
unfortunately there hasn't been enough

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:11.020
unfortunately there hasn't been enough
 

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.050

renewal so the underground

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:13.060

the are totally some of them are need

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:18.250
the are totally some of them are need
 

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:20.459
the are totally some of them are need
change and the budget needed to really

01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:20.469
change and the budget needed to really
 

01:15:20.469 --> 01:15:22.290
change and the budget needed to really
upgrade that is is very it's a very big

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:22.300
upgrade that is is very it's a very big
 

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.600
upgrade that is is very it's a very big
budget so and then think innovative

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:24.610
budget so and then think innovative
 

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.250
budget so and then think innovative
don't think they like the old ways do we

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:26.260
don't think they like the old ways do we
 

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.580
don't think they like the old ways do we
need this mega centralized structures or

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.810
associated with them some people suggest
that really a lot of our needs could be

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:30.820
that really a lot of our needs could be
 

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.790
that really a lot of our needs could be
addressed simply by conservation do you

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800
addressed simply by conservation do you
 

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.330
addressed simply by conservation do you
think conservation is is is largely an

01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:36.340
think conservation is is is largely an
 

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:36.859
think conservation is is is largely an
answer

01:18:36.859 --> 01:18:36.869
answer
 

01:18:36.869 --> 01:18:38.300
answer
do you think they're there what's the

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:38.310
do you think they're there what's the
 

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.790
do you think they're there what's the
point of no-return with conservation

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800
point of no-return with conservation
 

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.950
point of no-return with conservation
yeah so I want to point out that there's

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960
yeah so I want to point out that there's
 

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.450
yeah so I want to point out that there's
not just a carbon footprint but there's

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460
not just a carbon footprint but there's
 

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.160
not just a carbon footprint but there's
also air mission externalities

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:46.170
also air mission externalities
 

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.839
also air mission externalities
associated with this electricity

01:18:47.839 --> 01:18:47.849
associated with this electricity
 

01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:49.729
associated with this electricity
consumption as well as chemical

01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739
consumption as well as chemical
 

01:18:49.739 --> 01:18:51.530
consumption as well as chemical
consumption so we've done a lot of work

01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540
consumption so we've done a lot of work
 

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.570
consumption so we've done a lot of work
to try to quantify that and in many

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580
to try to quantify that and in many
 

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.399
to try to quantify that and in many
cases we find that these air mission

01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:55.409
cases we find that these air mission
 

01:18:55.409 --> 01:18:57.709
cases we find that these air mission
externalities are even larger than the

01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719
externalities are even larger than the
 

01:18:57.719 --> 01:18:59.839
externalities are even larger than the
public health benefits of treating some

01:18:59.839 --> 01:18:59.849
public health benefits of treating some
 

01:18:59.849 --> 01:19:00.890
public health benefits of treating some
of these water sources

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900
of these water sources
 

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.109
of these water sources
so really the smog is worse than that

01:19:03.109 --> 01:19:03.119
so really the smog is worse than that
 

01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:05.839
so really the smog is worse than that
the harmful smog is worse diffic

01:19:05.839 --> 01:19:05.849
the harmful smog is worse diffic
 

01:19:05.849 --> 01:19:09.220
the harmful smog is worse diffic
applications and some specific required

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:09.230

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.839
applications and some specific required
best availment that's the best available

01:19:11.839 --> 01:19:11.849
best availment that's the best available
 

01:19:11.849 --> 01:19:14.089
best availment that's the best available
treatment technologies and there can be

01:19:14.089 --> 01:19:14.099
treatment technologies and there can be
 

01:19:14.099 --> 01:19:16.700
treatment technologies and there can be
some real trade-offs in the air emission

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:16.710
some real trade-offs in the air emission
 

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.439
some real trade-offs in the air emission
externalities associated with water

01:19:18.439 --> 01:19:18.449

01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:28.959
recompression and crystallization where
you're taking water and you're basically

01:19:28.959 --> 01:19:28.969
you're taking water and you're basically
 

01:19:28.969 --> 01:19:31.550
you're taking water and you're basically
evaporating all that water and making a

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560
evaporating all that water and making a
 

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.479
evaporating all that water and making a
pure salt so we do need to think about

01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:34.489
pure salt so we do need to think about
 

01:19:34.489 --> 01:19:37.070
pure salt so we do need to think about
what those trade-offs are and I think

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080
what those trade-offs are and I think
 

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.720
what those trade-offs are and I think
that doing so in a quantitative manner

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:38.730
that doing so in a quantitative manner
 

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.990
that doing so in a quantitative manner
helps us to make wise decisions I also

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000
helps us to make wise decisions I also
 

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.240
helps us to make wise decisions I also

conservation because it simply means
less revenue for the power producer and

less revenue for the power producer and
 

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:48.470
less revenue for the power producer and
they're stuck with the same amount of

there any clever solutions to solving

01:20:59.879 --> 01:20:59.889
there any clever solutions to solving
 

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:02.339
there any clever solutions to solving
that problem so there's two models in

01:21:02.339 --> 01:21:02.349
that problem so there's two models in
 

01:21:02.349 --> 01:21:04.109
that problem so there's two models in
what our utilities there is one where

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:04.119
what our utilities there is one where
 

01:21:04.119 --> 01:21:06.000
what our utilities there is one where
the UT doesn't own the assets so

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.010
the UT doesn't own the assets so
 

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:07.500
the UT doesn't own the assets so
basically the utility is just an

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:07.510
basically the utility is just an
 

01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:10.229
basically the utility is just an
operator of the asset that's typically

01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239
operator of the asset that's typically
 

01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:12.209
operator of the asset that's typically
what we do in many many cases so in that

01:21:12.209 --> 01:21:12.219
what we do in many many cases so in that
 

01:21:12.219 --> 01:21:15.600
what we do in many many cases so in that
case the revenue I guess you will always

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:15.610
case the revenue I guess you will always
 

01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:17.399
case the revenue I guess you will always
probably have a biased like you

01:21:17.399 --> 01:21:17.409
probably have a biased like you
 

01:21:17.409 --> 01:21:20.160
probably have a biased like you
mentioned so yes we but I think in that

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:20.170
mentioned so yes we but I think in that
 

01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:22.799
mentioned so yes we but I think in that
case there is also an incentive

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:22.809
case there is also an incentive
 

01:21:22.809 --> 01:21:24.569
case there is also an incentive
sometimes in different cities would

01:21:24.569 --> 01:21:24.579
sometimes in different cities would
 

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.640
sometimes in different cities would
incentivize consumption I think it's

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:26.650
incentivize consumption I think it's
 

01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:30.299
incentivize consumption I think it's
very important to really look at at this

01:21:30.299 --> 01:21:30.309
very important to really look at at this
 

01:21:30.309 --> 01:21:33.390
very important to really look at at this
upstream reduction of usage and then the

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400
upstream reduction of usage and then the
 

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.520
upstream reduction of usage and then the
second second model is okay then we also

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:35.530
second second model is okay then we also
 

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:38.250
second second model is okay then we also
are a capital investor in the project so

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:38.260
are a capital investor in the project so
 

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.620
are a capital investor in the project so
but that's not what the companies like

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:40.630
but that's not what the companies like
 

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:42.709
but that's not what the companies like
ourselves would do but there is also

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719
ourselves would do but there is also
 

01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:45.660
ourselves would do but there is also
private utilities which also basically

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:45.670
private utilities which also basically
 

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:49.799
private utilities which also basically
put the money and only the assets and I

01:21:49.799 --> 01:21:49.809
put the money and only the assets and I
 

01:21:49.809 --> 01:21:52.530
put the money and only the assets and I
guess but but you know what the utility

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:52.540
guess but but you know what the utility
 

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.540
guess but but you know what the utility
is I mean it's again a partnership with

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:54.550
is I mean it's again a partnership with
 

01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:59.879
is I mean it's again a partnership with
local cities with a region to define an

01:21:59.879 --> 01:21:59.889
local cities with a region to define an
 

01:21:59.889 --> 01:22:02.370
local cities with a region to define an
agenda at a certain scale and then you

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:02.380
agenda at a certain scale and then you
 

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:03.870
agenda at a certain scale and then you
push that agenda in and the water

01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880
push that agenda in and the water
 

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.180
push that agenda in and the water
utility is part of that agenda and then

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:06.190
utility is part of that agenda and then
 

01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:08.490
utility is part of that agenda and then
so conservation just becomes one of the

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:08.500
so conservation just becomes one of the
 

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.100
so conservation just becomes one of the
elements in water strategy yeah that is

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:11.110
elements in water strategy yeah that is
 

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:13.319
elements in water strategy yeah that is
defined on a higher level and a basin

01:22:13.319 --> 01:22:13.329
defined on a higher level and a basin
 

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.359
defined on a higher level and a basin
level maybe on a water basin level and

01:22:15.359 --> 01:22:15.369
level maybe on a water basin level and
 

01:22:15.369 --> 01:22:17.910
level maybe on a water basin level and
then you basically abide by certain

01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920
then you basically abide by certain
 

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.410
then you basically abide by certain
guidelines and you have certain

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:19.420
guidelines and you have certain
 

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.810
guidelines and you have certain
incentives to you know to minimize that

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:21.820
incentives to you know to minimize that
 

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.970
incentives to you know to minimize that
your consumption yeah great I'm going to

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:23.980
your consumption yeah great I'm going to
 

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.919
your consumption yeah great I'm going to
encourage audience members to send in

01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:25.929
encourage audience members to send in
 

01:22:25.929 --> 01:22:27.299
encourage audience members to send in
some questions we've already gotten some

01:22:27.299 --> 01:22:27.309
some questions we've already gotten some
 

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.649
some questions we've already gotten some
wonderful questions here and here's one

01:22:28.649 --> 01:22:28.659
wonderful questions here and here's one
 

01:22:28.659 --> 01:22:32.729
wonderful questions here and here's one
that I I like a lot the audience member

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:32.739
that I I like a lot the audience member
 

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:35.569
that I I like a lot the audience member
asks oh what about the use of

01:22:35.569 --> 01:22:35.579
asks oh what about the use of
 

01:22:35.579 --> 01:22:38.160
asks oh what about the use of
desalination plants as a flexible load

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:38.170
desalination plants as a flexible load
 

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:41.520
desalination plants as a flexible load
so how can water treatment be actually

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:41.530
so how can water treatment be actually
 

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.379
so how can water treatment be actually
used collaboratively with energy

01:22:43.379 --> 01:22:43.389
used collaboratively with energy
 

01:22:43.389 --> 01:22:45.689
used collaboratively with energy
generation and energy supply Meghan do

01:22:45.689 --> 01:22:45.699
generation and energy supply Meghan do
 

01:22:45.699 --> 01:22:49.430
generation and energy supply Meghan do
you have any thoughts on that

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440
 
 

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.220
 
graduate students to answer this

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:52.230
graduate students to answer this
 

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:54.020
graduate students to answer this
question but he might have been the one

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:54.030
question but he might have been the one
 

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:58.790
question but he might have been the one
asking the question you know now yes so

01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800
asking the question you know now yes so
 

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.130
asking the question you know now yes so
so I think that there are some

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140
so I think that there are some
 

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.200
so I think that there are some
trade-offs these are typically pretty

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:03.210
trade-offs these are typically pretty
 

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:07.220
trade-offs these are typically pretty
capital intensive treatment plants and

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:07.230
capital intensive treatment plants and
 

01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:11.000
capital intensive treatment plants and
so you don't want to over build water

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.010
so you don't want to over build water
 

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:14.260
so you don't want to over build water
treatment capacity and if you are

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:14.270
treatment capacity and if you are
 

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:18.680
treatment capacity and if you are
concerned about you know if you're going

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:18.690
concerned about you know if you're going
 

01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:20.660
concerned about you know if you're going
to be operating a capacity factor for

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:20.670
to be operating a capacity factor for
 

01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:21.800
to be operating a capacity factor for
your water treatment facility that's

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:21.810
your water treatment facility that's
 

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:24.410
your water treatment facility that's
only 20% but you still need to supply

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420
only 20% but you still need to supply
 

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:28.430
only 20% but you still need to supply
your municipal water you know your

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440
your municipal water you know your
 

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.450
your municipal water you know your
miscible water needs

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460
miscible water needs
 

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.670
miscible water needs
you're not going to upsize that plant by

01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:31.680
you're not going to upsize that plant by
 

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.860
you're not going to upsize that plant by
five times so you need to think about

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:33.870
five times so you need to think about
 

01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:35.840
five times so you need to think about
what are the trade-offs and capital

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:35.850
what are the trade-offs and capital
 

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:38.480
what are the trade-offs and capital
costs and operational costs making this

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:38.490
costs and operational costs making this
 

01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:40.940
costs and operational costs making this
a somewhat difficult play for a

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:40.950
a somewhat difficult play for a
 

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:43.580
a somewhat difficult play for a
desalination plant and we're doing some

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:43.590
desalination plant and we're doing some
 

01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:45.950
desalination plant and we're doing some
some work right now particularly in

01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960
some work right now particularly in
 

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.130
some work right now particularly in
distribution systems to understand what

01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140
distribution systems to understand what
 

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.820
distribution systems to understand what
sort of capacity there is to shift the

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:52.830
sort of capacity there is to shift the
 

01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:56.450
sort of capacity there is to shift the
load for pumping and what implications

01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460
load for pumping and what implications
 

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.540
load for pumping and what implications
that might have for water quality in the

01:23:59.540 --> 01:23:59.550
that might have for water quality in the
 

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:01.010
that might have for water quality in the
distribution system as well

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020
distribution system as well
 

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.880
distribution system as well
and then I think the other the other

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:04.890
and then I think the other the other
 

01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:07.430
and then I think the other the other
piece that is is really important to

01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440
piece that is is really important to
 

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.620
piece that is is really important to
think about is smaller scale more

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:09.630
think about is smaller scale more
 

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:11.840
think about is smaller scale more
distributed systems and particularly

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:11.850
distributed systems and particularly
 

01:24:11.850 --> 01:24:14.120
distributed systems and particularly
that have intermittent treatment needs

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:14.130
that have intermittent treatment needs
 

01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:16.490
that have intermittent treatment needs
and in those situations I think that

01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500
and in those situations I think that
 

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.180
and in those situations I think that
there's a lot more potential for either

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:20.190
there's a lot more potential for either
 

01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:23.210
there's a lot more potential for either
load balancing or use of intermittent

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:23.220
load balancing or use of intermittent
 

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:27.440
load balancing or use of intermittent
renewable resources to help power some

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:27.450
renewable resources to help power some
 

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.020
renewable resources to help power some
of those water treatment technologies

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:29.030
of those water treatment technologies
 

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.820
of those water treatment technologies

foundation but you know there are
 

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:46.150
foundation but you know there are
opportunities to hybridize them with

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:46.160
opportunities to hybridize them with
 

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.830
opportunities to hybridize them with
thermal desalination where you optimize

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840
thermal desalination where you optimize
 

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.890

we believe that solar is going to play a

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:55.200
we believe that solar is going to play a
 

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.680
we believe that solar is going to play a
very important role in the future and

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:57.690
very important role in the future and
 

01:24:57.690 --> 01:25:00.959
very important role in the future and

nations or desalination plants are

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:03.820
nations or desalination plants are
 

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.310
nations or desalination plants are
usually in Sun rich areas and those are

01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320
usually in Sun rich areas and those are
 

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.439
usually in Sun rich areas and those are
there's there's an array of things and

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:10.449
there's there's an array of things and
 

01:25:10.449 --> 01:25:12.600
there's there's an array of things and
with automation the ability to optimize

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:12.610
with automation the ability to optimize
 

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:14.729
with automation the ability to optimize
and balance things it's a whole new

01:25:14.729 --> 01:25:14.739
and balance things it's a whole new
 

01:25:14.739 --> 01:25:16.170
and balance things it's a whole new
frontier so there's a lot of

01:25:16.170 --> 01:25:16.180
frontier so there's a lot of
 

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.140
frontier so there's a lot of
opportunities but as I said recycling

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:19.150
opportunities but as I said recycling
 

01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:21.570
opportunities but as I said recycling
water and desalination is really the

01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:21.580
water and desalination is really the
 

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.150
water and desalination is really the
solution but desalination has tremendous

01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:24.160
solution but desalination has tremendous
 

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.209
solution but desalination has tremendous
scope for optimization okay you know

01:25:27.209 --> 01:25:27.219
scope for optimization okay you know
 

01:25:27.219 --> 01:25:30.420
scope for optimization okay you know

don't want to go up and down so what

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:52.150
don't want to go up and down so what
 

01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:53.520
don't want to go up and down so what
they have done is fantastic they bought

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:53.530
they have done is fantastic they bought
 

01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:56.729
they have done is fantastic they bought
the cheap power at night you know what

01:25:56.729 --> 01:25:56.739
the cheap power at night you know what
 

01:25:56.739 --> 01:25:59.000
the cheap power at night you know what
they do with it they pump water at night

01:25:59.000 --> 01:25:59.010
they do with it they pump water at night
 

01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:01.860
they do with it they pump water at night
they bring water up the Alps at night

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:01.870
they bring water up the Alps at night
 

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:03.900
they bring water up the Alps at night
and then they resell the electricity

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:03.910
and then they resell the electricity
 

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:05.670
and then they resell the electricity
when it's high and it's hydroelectric

01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:05.680
when it's high and it's hydroelectric
 

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.100
when it's high and it's hydroelectric
power so this type of thing is possible

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:08.110
power so this type of thing is possible
 

01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:09.479
power so this type of thing is possible
we also had a project where we are

01:26:09.479 --> 01:26:09.489
we also had a project where we are
 

01:26:09.489 --> 01:26:12.030
we also had a project where we are
looking at a power plant also having

01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040
looking at a power plant also having
 

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.770
looking at a power plant also having
excess capacity at night and then we

01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:13.780
excess capacity at night and then we
 

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:16.740
excess capacity at night and then we
costed a desalination plant to do a

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:16.750
costed a desalination plant to do a
 

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.689
costed a desalination plant to do a
storage because storage of energy is the

01:26:18.689 --> 01:26:18.699
storage because storage of energy is the
 

01:26:18.699 --> 01:26:20.280
storage because storage of energy is the
big issue right energy storage at the

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:20.290
big issue right energy storage at the
 

01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:21.600
big issue right energy storage at the
end of that is all about energy storage

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:21.610
end of that is all about energy storage
 

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:25.470
end of that is all about energy storage
so can you use water to store energy and

01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480
so can you use water to store energy and
 

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.530
so can you use water to store energy and
how do you do that so one way is the

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:28.540
how do you do that so one way is the
 

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:31.229
how do you do that so one way is the
Swiss way pump up but then we are

01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239
Swiss way pump up but then we are
 

01:26:31.239 --> 01:26:33.570
Swiss way pump up but then we are
looking at this Allan ating water during

01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:33.580
looking at this Allan ating water during
 

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.459
looking at this Allan ating water during
night and then doing what is called

01:26:35.459 --> 01:26:35.469
night and then doing what is called
 

01:26:35.469 --> 01:26:37.709
night and then doing what is called
aquifer storage and recovery so you take

01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719
aquifer storage and recovery so you take
 

01:26:37.719 --> 01:26:39.270
aquifer storage and recovery so you take
this a netted water put it in the

01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280
this a netted water put it in the
 

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.370
this a netted water put it in the
aquifer and then you know you basic

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:41.380
aquifer and then you know you basic
 

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.870
aquifer and then you know you basic
that's energy that you have saved and

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880
that's energy that you have saved and
 

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.240
that's energy that you have saved and
then so the our project is not so many

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:45.250
then so the our project is not so many
 

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:47.310
then so the our project is not so many
but it's it's gonna happen more and more

01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320
but it's it's gonna happen more and more
 

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.110
but it's it's gonna happen more and more
so wait a minute so you could you could

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120
so wait a minute so you could you could
 

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.100
so wait a minute so you could you could
go to this how is it Mount Washington

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:50.110
go to this how is it Mount Washington
 

01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:52.680
go to this how is it Mount Washington
here you could potentially put a tank at

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:52.690
here you could potentially put a tank at
 

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:54.780
here you could potentially put a tank at
the top of the hill and and pump water

01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:54.790
the top of the hill and and pump water
 

01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:56.729
the top of the hill and and pump water
up from the river in the middle of the

01:26:56.729 --> 01:26:56.739
up from the river in the middle of the
 

01:26:56.739 --> 01:26:58.439
up from the river in the middle of the
night and then so there these times I

01:26:58.439 --> 01:26:58.449
night and then so there these times I
 

01:26:58.449 --> 01:26:59.939

01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719
steep you know there are some conditions
 

01:27:01.719 --> 01:27:03.240
steep you know there are some conditions
but yeah you can know they got some

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:03.250
but yeah you can know they got some
 

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:08.370
but yeah you can know they got some
steep hills here I think so turning now

01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:08.380
steep hills here I think so turning now
 

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.660

what we learn all is water chemistry is

01:28:10.209 --> 01:28:10.219
what we learn all is water chemistry is
 

01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:13.660
what we learn all is water chemistry is
very important and so in utilities you

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:13.670
very important and so in utilities you
 

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:14.859
very important and so in utilities you
know we need to pay a lot of attention

01:28:14.859 --> 01:28:14.869
know we need to pay a lot of attention
 

01:28:14.869 --> 01:28:16.660
know we need to pay a lot of attention
to that chemistry I mean as the

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:16.670
to that chemistry I mean as the
 

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:19.030

concrete we have some metals we have
some and we had we had a chemistry that

01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199
some and we had we had a chemistry that
 

01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:25.990
some and we had we had a chemistry that
was optimized for that anyway I'm

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000

talking in industries the same corrosion

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:27.830
talking in industries the same corrosion
 

01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:29.919
talking in industries the same corrosion
is a big deal and so we have to really

01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:29.929
is a big deal and so we have to really
 

01:28:29.929 --> 01:28:32.290
is a big deal and so we have to really
pay attention to to that but again I

01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:32.300
pay attention to to that but again I
 

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.450

the oil and gas sector has sometimes

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:31.430
the oil and gas sector has sometimes
 

01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:33.610
the oil and gas sector has sometimes
been criticized about their treatment of

been criticized about their treatment of
 

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.320
been criticized about their treatment of
water and some people suggested that

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:35.330

01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:07.540
stewardship and and I think that
 

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:12.940

producers typically want to meet
 

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:15.430
producers typically want to meet
environmental stewardship standards so I

01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440
environmental stewardship standards so I
 

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.520
environmental stewardship standards so I
think everything's there to do it I do

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:18.530
think everything's there to do it I do
 

01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:20.229

that a serious issue in Pennsylvania you
 

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.370
that a serious issue in Pennsylvania you
know I don't think so I mean I think

01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380
know I don't think so I mean I think
 

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.810
know I don't think so I mean I think
that responsible treatment is out there

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820
that responsible treatment is out there
 

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.210

it's well regulated well another factor
is that sometimes oil and gas is

01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260
is that sometimes oil and gas is
 

01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:12.020
is that sometimes oil and gas is
produced at a far deeper level and the

we draw our drinking water so there's
 

01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:17.360
we draw our drinking water so there's
actually some physical separation in

lot we will need sensors we are going to

01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040
lot we will need sensors we are going to
 

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.070
lot we will need sensors we are going to
need reliable sensors because data is

01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080
need reliable sensors because data is
 

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.500
need reliable sensors because data is
based on the and information so we have

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:03.510
based on the and information so we have
 

01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:05.420
based on the and information so we have
some sensors but we need more sensors

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:05.430
some sensors but we need more sensors
 

01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:08.950

that's how yeah there will be a lot what
 

01:33:13.230 --> 01:33:14.960
that's how yeah there will be a lot what
is it gonna be the industry is asking

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:14.970
is it gonna be the industry is asking
 

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:16.670
is it gonna be the industry is asking
itself how is it going to shape our

01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:16.680
itself how is it going to shape our
 

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.910
itself how is it going to shape our
industry in fact it's but there will be

01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920
industry in fact it's but there will be
 

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.470
industry in fact it's but there will be
changes other industries have been

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480
changes other industries have been
 

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.090
changes other industries have been
changed and the water industry will

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100
changed and the water industry will
 

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.810
changed and the water industry will
probably be also changed by it so yeah

01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:25.820
probably be also changed by it so yeah
 

01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.010
probably be also changed by it so yeah

the cost is low enough so by having

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:07.050
the cost is low enough so by having
 

01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:09.649
the cost is low enough so by having
pooled rides lowers the cost and

01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659
pooled rides lowers the cost and
 

01:56:09.659 --> 01:56:11.540
pooled rides lowers the cost and
therefore people are more likely to take

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:11.550
therefore people are more likely to take
 

01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:14.419
therefore people are more likely to take

me thinking about our previous

me thinking about our previous

me thinking about our previous
transportation revolutions and how they

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:36.270
transportation revolutions and how they
 

01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:39.290
transportation revolutions and how they
really opened up a lot of new access and

01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:39.300
really opened up a lot of new access and
 

01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.490
really opened up a lot of new access and

populations another thing that they also
did was sometimes bisect neighborhoods

01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179

wall off neighborhoods destroy
 

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:49.430
wall off neighborhoods destroy
neighborhoods and I wonder how we can

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440
neighborhoods and I wonder how we can
 

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:51.770
neighborhoods and I wonder how we can
make choices at the beginning of this

01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780
make choices at the beginning of this
 

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.140

wrong in the past so that we don't

wrong in the past so that we don't
 

01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:59.000
wrong in the past so that we don't
repeat some of those mistakes and how

01:56:59.000 --> 01:56:59.010
repeat some of those mistakes and how

the the median income that is a
 

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.600
the the median income that is a
substantial cost and the Pennsylvania

01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:05.610
substantial cost and the Pennsylvania
 

01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:08.840
substantial cost and the Pennsylvania
western Pennsylvania region our

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:08.850
western Pennsylvania region our
 

01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:11.970
western Pennsylvania region our
households that are in the lower fifth

01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:11.980

what their household housing costs are
so transportation costs are about double

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:23.830
so transportation costs are about double
 

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:26.100
so transportation costs are about double

as much as the infrastructure in that
 

02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:28.479
as much as the infrastructure in that
and that's because there's a tough ROI

02:01:28.479 --> 02:01:28.489

hi-hi-hi power charging I think this
 

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.620
hi-hi-hi power charging I think this
changes and probably around 2025 so when

02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:05.630
changes and probably around 2025 so when
 

02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:10.000

you look at the what it costs to drive a

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:10.010
you look at the what it costs to drive a
 

02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:12.490
you look at the what it costs to drive a
gas vehicle what you just mentioned that

02:02:12.490 --> 02:02:12.500

electric vehicle continues to go down
 

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:24.490
electric vehicle continues to go down
and I think around 2025 those lines meet

02:02:24.490 --> 02:02:24.500
and I think around 2025 those lines meet
 

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:27.010
and I think around 2025 those lines meet
and at that point it's just cheaper to

02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:27.020
and at that point it's just cheaper to
 

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.209
and at that point it's just cheaper to
buy an electric vehicle than a gas

02:02:28.209 --> 02:02:28.219
buy an electric vehicle than a gas
 

02:02:28.219 --> 02:02:31.840
buy an electric vehicle than a gas

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:40.450
the date we have we have pegged I think
it's um what was some of the automakers

02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:40.460
it's um what was some of the automakers

that VMT is likely going to rise we

02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:13.300
that VMT is likely going to rise we
 

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.240
that VMT is likely going to rise we
think that there is going to be an

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:15.250

very supportive of that we should not be
 

02:06:24.670 --> 02:06:27.090
very supportive of that we should not be
hindering people's accessibility and

02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:27.100
hindering people's accessibility and
 

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.880
hindering people's accessibility and
ability to move but how do we do it in

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:29.890
ability to move but how do we do it in
 

02:06:29.890 --> 02:06:32.520
ability to move but how do we do it in
the most energy efficient way so of

mobility limiting empty miles driven and
 

02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:45.510
mobility limiting empty miles driven and
doing all of this in the most energy

02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520
doing all of this in the most energy
 

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:47.400
doing all of this in the most energy
efficient way possible and we're not

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:47.410
efficient way possible and we're not
 

02:06:47.410 --> 02:06:50.100
efficient way possible and we're not
just talking about them when we think

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:50.110
just talking about them when we think
 

02:06:50.110 --> 02:06:53.010
just talking about them when we think
about smart cities and energy and

02:06:53.010 --> 02:06:53.020
about smart cities and energy and
 

02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:56.340
about smart cities and energy and
mobility a lot of people think strictly

02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:56.350
mobility a lot of people think strictly
 

02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:59.100
mobility a lot of people think strictly
of electric vehicles and I just want

02:06:59.100 --> 02:06:59.110
of electric vehicles and I just want
 

02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:00.930
of electric vehicles and I just want
people to be thinking about how much

02:07:00.930 --> 02:07:00.940
people to be thinking about how much
 

02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:04.860
people to be thinking about how much
bigger it is than that it's not just EVs

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:04.870
bigger it is than that it's not just EVs
 

02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:07.680
bigger it is than that it's not just EVs
it's about doing all of our mobility in

02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:07.690

it's about doing all of our mobility in
the most efficient way possible and so

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:10.450
the most efficient way possible and so
 

02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:11.610
the most efficient way possible and so
what the energy efficient mobility

02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:11.620

assets and and how we might continue to
 

02:15:08.070 --> 02:15:10.520
assets and and how we might continue to
see generation assets play into this

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:10.530
see generation assets play into this
 

02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:12.919

distributed and energy resources and I
 

02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:20.350
distributed and energy resources and I
think it was mentioned earlier as well

02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.360

think that as we see increased adoption

02:16:27.169 --> 02:16:27.179
think that as we see increased adoption
 

02:16:27.179 --> 02:16:29.330
think that as we see increased adoption
of electric vehicles that that's just

another asset that we're going to have
 

02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:32.750
another asset that we're going to have
to manage and then we're going to have

02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760
to manage and then we're going to have
 

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:35.810
to manage and then we're going to have
to create a grid that is a platform to

02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:35.820
to create a grid that is a platform to
 

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.339
to create a grid that is a platform to
manage all of these distributed energy

02:16:37.339 --> 02:16:37.349
manage all of these distributed energy
 

02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:40.040
manage all of these distributed energy
resources so we're investing those

02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:40.050
resources so we're investing those
 

02:16:40.050 --> 02:16:40.540

that it will be an environment with with
 

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:49.419
that it will be an environment with with
greater distributed generation so we're

02:16:49.419 --> 02:16:49.429
greater distributed generation so we're
 

02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:51.820
greater distributed generation so we're
testing that right now we have two smart

02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:51.830
testing that right now we have two smart
 

02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:54.070
testing that right now we have two smart
neighborhoods one in Georgia and one in

neighborhoods one in Georgia and one in
 

02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.160
neighborhoods one in Georgia and one in
Alabama that are the one in Georgia we

02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:57.170
Alabama that are the one in Georgia we
 

02:16:57.170 --> 02:17:01.690
Alabama that are the one in Georgia we
have rooftop solar all the appliances in

02:17:01.690 --> 02:17:01.700
have rooftop solar all the appliances in
 

02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:03.129
have rooftop solar all the appliances in
the house will be connected and smart

02:17:03.129 --> 02:17:03.139
the house will be connected and smart
 

02:17:03.139 --> 02:17:05.620
the house will be connected and smart
and we want to test how people interact

02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:05.630
and we want to test how people interact
 

02:17:05.630 --> 02:17:09.509
and we want to test how people interact
with a smart home and study how

02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519
with a smart home and study how
 

02:17:09.519 --> 02:17:12.389
with a smart home and study how
generation works off the rooftop solar

02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399
generation works off the rooftop solar
 

02:17:12.399 --> 02:17:15.280
generation works off the rooftop solar
and that will also inform our RDL so

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:15.290
and that will also inform our RDL so
 

02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:16.360
and that will also inform our RDL so
unfortunately the future of home

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:16.370
unfortunately the future of home
 

02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:17.770
unfortunately the future of home
building so we want to learn that the

02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:17.780
building so we want to learn that the
 

02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:19.240
building so we want to learn that the
one in Alabama is a little bit different

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:19.250
one in Alabama is a little bit different
 

02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:21.820
one in Alabama is a little bit different
it has all the the whiz-bang devices in

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:21.830
it has all the the whiz-bang devices in
 

02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:23.589
it has all the the whiz-bang devices in
the house but the neighborhood it's

02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599
the house but the neighborhood it's
 

02:17:23.599 --> 02:17:26.559
the house but the neighborhood it's
going to be powered by a micro grid so a

02:17:26.559 --> 02:17:26.569
going to be powered by a micro grid so a
 

02:17:26.569 --> 02:17:28.360
going to be powered by a micro grid so a
different technology and again we want

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:28.370
different technology and again we want
 

02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:29.679
different technology and again we want
to study that it does that make sense

02:17:29.679 --> 02:17:29.689
to study that it does that make sense
 

02:17:29.689 --> 02:17:31.240
to study that it does that make sense
for future home building so in both

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:31.250
for future home building so in both
 

02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:33.940
for future home building so in both
cases we partnered with the home builder

02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:33.950
cases we partnered with the home builder
 

02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:36.070
cases we partnered with the home builder
and we're all learning a lot about the

02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080
and we're all learning a lot about the
 

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.809
and we're all learning a lot about the
future of homes and it's distributed

02:17:37.809 --> 02:17:37.819

transportation we need to think beyond
 

02:19:49.470 --> 02:19:53.580
transportation we need to think beyond
what the near future the autonomous

Mellon is that so many of the people

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:02.350
Mellon is that so many of the people
 

02:20:02.350 --> 02:20:04.830
Mellon is that so many of the people
here are taking a look and researching

02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840
here are taking a look and researching
 

02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:06.420
here are taking a look and researching
and thinking about what that our future

02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:06.430
and thinking about what that our future
 

02:20:06.430 --> 02:20:08.250
and thinking about what that our future
is well one of the things we have to

02:20:08.250 --> 02:20:08.260
is well one of the things we have to
 

02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:10.500
is well one of the things we have to
worry about in the far future inside of

02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:10.510
worry about in the far future inside of
 

02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:12.929
worry about in the far future inside of
a smart city is new new threats and new

02:20:12.929 --> 02:20:12.939
a smart city is new new threats and new
 

02:20:12.939 --> 02:20:16.410
a smart city is new new threats and new
extreme events and maybe I want to tie

02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:16.420
extreme events and maybe I want to tie
 

02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:18.330
extreme events and maybe I want to tie
in resilience to this conversation a

02:20:18.330 --> 02:20:18.340
in resilience to this conversation a
 

02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:20.820
in resilience to this conversation a
little bit and how does like maybe we

02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:20.830
little bit and how does like maybe we
 

02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:23.939
little bit and how does like maybe we
start with Carina like what why does the

02:20:23.939 --> 02:20:23.949
start with Carina like what why does the
 

02:20:23.949 --> 02:20:26.429
start with Carina like what why does the
city even need to be resilient and how

02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439
city even need to be resilient and how
 

02:20:26.439 --> 02:20:29.939
city even need to be resilient and how
can some of this technology enhance the

02:20:29.939 --> 02:20:29.949
can some of this technology enhance the
 

02:20:29.949 --> 02:20:31.769
can some of this technology enhance the
ability to cope with extreme events in

02:20:31.769 --> 02:20:31.779
ability to cope with extreme events in
 

02:20:31.779 --> 02:20:32.840
ability to cope with extreme events in
in a city

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:32.850
in a city
 

02:20:32.850 --> 02:20:34.950
in a city
so resilience means a lot of different

02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960
so resilience means a lot of different
 

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:37.320
so resilience means a lot of different
things and I think that that is one of

02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:37.330
things and I think that that is one of
 

02:20:37.330 --> 02:20:38.460
things and I think that that is one of
the things we maybe need to talk about

02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:38.470
the things we maybe need to talk about
 

02:20:38.470 --> 02:20:41.639
the things we maybe need to talk about
first it's not just about you know that

02:20:41.639 --> 02:20:41.649
first it's not just about you know that
 

02:20:41.649 --> 02:20:46.349
first it's not just about you know that
we can withstand record-setting rains as

02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:46.359
we can withstand record-setting rains as
 

02:20:46.359 --> 02:20:51.030
we can withstand record-setting rains as
we recently or extreme temperatures or

02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040
we recently or extreme temperatures or
 

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.460
we recently or extreme temperatures or
other kinds of natural events like that

02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:53.470
other kinds of natural events like that
 

02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:56.280
other kinds of natural events like that
there's also social resiliency that's

02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:56.290
there's also social resiliency that's
 

02:20:56.290 --> 02:20:57.389
there's also social resiliency that's
necessary and I think that it's

02:20:57.389 --> 02:20:57.399
necessary and I think that it's
 

02:20:57.399 --> 02:20:58.769
necessary and I think that it's
something that really we do have to

02:20:58.769 --> 02:20:58.779
something that really we do have to
 

02:20:58.779 --> 02:21:01.469
something that really we do have to
think about in the era of autonomous

02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479
think about in the era of autonomous
 

02:21:01.479 --> 02:21:03.840
think about in the era of autonomous
mobility increased privatization of

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:03.850
mobility increased privatization of
 

02:21:03.850 --> 02:21:06.780
mobility increased privatization of
ability what happens to our social

02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:06.790
ability what happens to our social
 

02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:09.300
ability what happens to our social
cohesion to those those those ties that

02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:09.310
cohesion to those those those ties that
 

02:21:09.310 --> 02:21:11.609
cohesion to those those those ties that
bind us to one another and build that

02:21:11.609 --> 02:21:11.619
bind us to one another and build that
 

02:21:11.619 --> 02:21:14.460
bind us to one another and build that
sort of social relationship that keeps

02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:14.470
sort of social relationship that keeps
 

02:21:14.470 --> 02:21:16.200
sort of social relationship that keeps
us as a strong community this is

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:16.210
us as a strong community this is
 

02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:17.729
us as a strong community this is
something that we talk a lot about the

02:21:17.729 --> 02:21:17.739
something that we talk a lot about the
 

02:21:17.739 --> 02:21:21.210
something that we talk a lot about the
the pressures and stressors that lie on

02:21:21.210 --> 02:21:21.220
the pressures and stressors that lie on
 

02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:23.399
the pressures and stressors that lie on
a city not just from the environment but

02:21:23.399 --> 02:21:23.409
a city not just from the environment but
 

02:21:23.409 --> 02:21:26.550
a city not just from the environment but
also from the social aspects of the city

02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560
also from the social aspects of the city
 

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:29.609
also from the social aspects of the city
and so we do think about that and I

02:21:29.609 --> 02:21:29.619
and so we do think about that and I
 

02:21:29.619 --> 02:21:31.469
and so we do think about that and I

some of these technologies help us

02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:36.520
some of these technologies help us
 

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:39.870
some of these technologies help us
improve resilience in in in a future

02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880
improve resilience in in in a future
 

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:43.800
improve resilience in in in a future
city and maybe we would ask Joe as a

02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:43.810
city and maybe we would ask Joe as a
 

02:21:43.810 --> 02:21:46.290
city and maybe we would ask Joe as a
electricity provider will the lights

02:21:46.290 --> 02:21:46.300
electricity provider will the lights
 

02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:48.809
electricity provider will the lights
stay on more our lights are pretty

02:21:48.809 --> 02:21:48.819
stay on more our lights are pretty
 

02:21:48.819 --> 02:21:50.429
stay on more our lights are pretty
reliable in Pittsburgh right now thank

02:21:50.429 --> 02:21:50.439
reliable in Pittsburgh right now thank
 

02:21:50.439 --> 02:21:52.530
reliable in Pittsburgh right now thank
you I appreciate that but it you know as

02:21:52.530 --> 02:21:52.540
you I appreciate that but it you know as
 

02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:54.750
you I appreciate that but it you know as
we connect more things to the internet

02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760
we connect more things to the internet
 

02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:57.780
we connect more things to the internet
do you think that that will still be the

02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:57.790
do you think that that will still be the
 

02:21:57.790 --> 02:21:59.880
do you think that that will still be the
case and then how do we make sure ensure

02:21:59.880 --> 02:21:59.890
case and then how do we make sure ensure
 

02:21:59.890 --> 02:22:02.189
case and then how do we make sure ensure
we protect that yeah you know I guess

02:22:02.189 --> 02:22:02.199
we protect that yeah you know I guess
 

02:22:02.199 --> 02:22:05.130
we protect that yeah you know I guess
we're taking measures every day to make

02:22:05.130 --> 02:22:05.140
we're taking measures every day to make
 

02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:07.260
we're taking measures every day to make
sure that we have a reliable resilient

02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:07.270
sure that we have a reliable resilient
 

02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:09.689
sure that we have a reliable resilient
grid as you said we do currently have

02:22:09.689 --> 02:22:09.699
grid as you said we do currently have
 

02:22:09.699 --> 02:22:12.059
grid as you said we do currently have
one but it's always keeping I'm keeping

02:22:12.059 --> 02:22:12.069
one but it's always keeping I'm keeping
 

02:22:12.069 --> 02:22:14.849
one but it's always keeping I'm keeping
an eye on the future right so we're

02:22:14.849 --> 02:22:14.859
an eye on the future right so we're
 

02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:16.139
an eye on the future right so we're
investing hundreds of millions of

02:22:16.139 --> 02:22:16.149
investing hundreds of millions of
 

02:22:16.149 --> 02:22:18.420
investing hundreds of millions of
dollars in a long-term infrastructure

02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:18.430
dollars in a long-term infrastructure
 

02:22:18.430 --> 02:22:22.109
dollars in a long-term infrastructure
improvement plan to to better that and

02:22:22.109 --> 02:22:22.119
improvement plan to to better that and
 

02:22:22.119 --> 02:22:24.300
improvement plan to to better that and
then also kind of along the lines of the

02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:24.310
then also kind of along the lines of the
 

02:22:24.310 --> 02:22:26.910
then also kind of along the lines of the
theme of distributed generation we're

02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:26.920
theme of distributed generation we're
 

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.670
theme of distributed generation we're
going to be piloting a micro grid at our

02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680
going to be piloting a micro grid at our
 

02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:31.830
going to be piloting a micro grid at our
Operations Center campus on the north

02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840
Operations Center campus on the north
 

02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.979
Operations Center campus on the north
side of the city where our our primary

02:22:34.979 --> 02:22:34.989
side of the city where our our primary
 

02:22:34.989 --> 02:22:36.899
side of the city where our our primary
operations center is so whenever there

02:22:36.899 --> 02:22:36.909
operations center is so whenever there
 

02:22:36.909 --> 02:22:39.540
operations center is so whenever there
is extreme weather events we're going to

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:39.550
is extreme weather events we're going to
 

02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:41.219
is extreme weather events we're going to
essentially hard in the electrical

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:41.229
essentially hard in the electrical
 

02:22:41.229 --> 02:22:42.750
essentially hard in the electrical
infrastructure there we're going to

02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:42.760
infrastructure there we're going to
 

02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:45.929
infrastructure there we're going to
potentially pilot some generation

02:22:45.929 --> 02:22:45.939
potentially pilot some generation
 

02:22:45.939 --> 02:22:48.090
potentially pilot some generation
technologies there as well but basically

02:22:48.090 --> 02:22:48.100
technologies there as well but basically
 

02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:51.510
technologies there as well but basically
hardening and improving the resiliency

02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520
hardening and improving the resiliency
 

02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.340
hardening and improving the resiliency
and the reliability of that campus which

02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:53.350
and the reliability of that campus which
 

02:22:53.350 --> 02:22:55.649
and the reliability of that campus which
is critical to making sure the lights

02:22:55.649 --> 02:22:55.659
is critical to making sure the lights
 

02:22:55.659 --> 02:22:58.320
is critical to making sure the lights
stay on for all of our customers so I'd

02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:58.330
stay on for all of our customers so I'd
 

02:22:58.330 --> 02:23:00.899
stay on for all of our customers so I'd
say that you know who knows what the

02:23:00.899 --> 02:23:00.909
say that you know who knows what the
 

02:23:00.909 --> 02:23:03.030
say that you know who knows what the
future holds but we are at this point

02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040
future holds but we are at this point
 

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:04.710
future holds but we are at this point
you know we're investing significant

02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720
you know we're investing significant
 

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:07.830
you know we're investing significant
dollars into preparing ourselves for for

02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840
dollars into preparing ourselves for for
 

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:09.450
dollars into preparing ourselves for for
that future there's a lot of questions

02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:09.460
that future there's a lot of questions
 

02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.790
that future there's a lot of questions
about the connection between distribute

02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:11.800
about the connection between distribute
 

02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:13.050
about the connection between distribute
generation and Eve

02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:13.060
generation and Eve
 

02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:17.790
generation and Eve
charging and so do you think that new

02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800
charging and so do you think that new
 

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:19.979
charging and so do you think that new
distributed generation assets would be

02:23:19.979 --> 02:23:19.989
distributed generation assets would be
 

02:23:19.989 --> 02:23:22.139
distributed generation assets would be
coupled with EB charging have you seen

02:23:22.139 --> 02:23:22.149
coupled with EB charging have you seen
 

02:23:22.149 --> 02:23:24.300
coupled with EB charging have you seen
the examples where that works and will

02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:24.310
the examples where that works and will
 

02:23:24.310 --> 02:23:26.010
the examples where that works and will
it happen here in Pittsburgh or in

02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:26.020
it happen here in Pittsburgh or in
 

02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:29.219
it happen here in Pittsburgh or in
southern territories yeah I think that's

02:23:29.219 --> 02:23:29.229
southern territories yeah I think that's
 

02:23:29.229 --> 02:23:32.280
southern territories yeah I think that's
a conversation have so like I said the

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:32.290
a conversation have so like I said the
 

02:23:32.290 --> 02:23:34.109
a conversation have so like I said the
future Vivi charging if you're gonna try

02:23:34.109 --> 02:23:34.119
future Vivi charging if you're gonna try
 

02:23:34.119 --> 02:23:36.149
future Vivi charging if you're gonna try
to simulate the gas station experience

02:23:36.149 --> 02:23:36.159
to simulate the gas station experience
 

02:23:36.159 --> 02:23:37.859
to simulate the gas station experience
and be done in five minutes is what I

02:23:37.859 --> 02:23:37.869
and be done in five minutes is what I
 

02:23:37.869 --> 02:23:39.660
and be done in five minutes is what I
mentioned earlier the 350 kilowatt hour

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:39.670
mentioned earlier the 350 kilowatt hour
 

02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:43.139
mentioned earlier the 350 kilowatt hour
charging that is a lot of power that is

02:23:43.139 --> 02:23:43.149
charging that is a lot of power that is
 

02:23:43.149 --> 02:23:45.599
charging that is a lot of power that is
when you look from a load shape if

02:23:45.599 --> 02:23:45.609
when you look from a load shape if
 

02:23:45.609 --> 02:23:47.219
when you look from a load shape if
you're thinking of us you know in the

02:23:47.219 --> 02:23:47.229
you're thinking of us you know in the
 

02:23:47.229 --> 02:23:50.729
you're thinking of us you know in the
rural setting on a corridor off the side

02:23:50.729 --> 02:23:50.739
rural setting on a corridor off the side
 

02:23:50.739 --> 02:23:52.710
rural setting on a corridor off the side
of an interstate one of those chargers I

02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720
of an interstate one of those chargers I
 

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:55.859
of an interstate one of those chargers I
mean the spikes would be unbelievable so

02:23:55.859 --> 02:23:55.869
mean the spikes would be unbelievable so
 

02:23:55.869 --> 02:23:58.290
mean the spikes would be unbelievable so
I think you have to think about pairing

02:23:58.290 --> 02:23:58.300
I think you have to think about pairing
 

02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:02.490
I think you have to think about pairing
with battery storage or micro grid fuel

02:24:02.490 --> 02:24:02.500
with battery storage or micro grid fuel
 

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.290
with battery storage or micro grid fuel
cell I think you have to have those

02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:04.300
cell I think you have to have those
 

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:06.510
cell I think you have to have those
conversations because that that is

02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:06.520
conversations because that that is
 

02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:07.889
conversations because that that is
what's going to move the electric

02:24:07.889 --> 02:24:07.899
what's going to move the electric
 

02:24:07.899 --> 02:24:09.660
what's going to move the electric
transportation market I think fat right

02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:09.670
transportation market I think fat right
 

02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:11.729
transportation market I think fat right
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour

02:24:11.729 --> 02:24:11.739
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour
 

02:24:11.739 --> 02:24:14.519
now fast charging 50 kilowatt hour
charging it takes about 30 minutes if

02:24:14.519 --> 02:24:14.529
charging it takes about 30 minutes if
 

02:24:14.529 --> 02:24:15.840
charging it takes about 30 minutes if
someone's in front of you you could be

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:15.850
someone's in front of you you could be
 

02:24:15.850 --> 02:24:17.490
someone's in front of you you could be
there for an hour we've read about

02:24:17.490 --> 02:24:17.500
there for an hour we've read about
 

02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:20.189
there for an hour we've read about
fights at charging stations because

02:24:20.189 --> 02:24:20.199
fights at charging stations because
 

02:24:20.199 --> 02:24:22.019
fights at charging stations because
people are getting impatient please

02:24:22.019 --> 02:24:22.029
people are getting impatient please
 

02:24:22.029 --> 02:24:23.399
people are getting impatient please
don't fight people at charging stations

02:24:23.399 --> 02:24:23.409
don't fight people at charging stations
 

02:24:23.409 --> 02:24:25.800
don't fight people at charging stations
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:25.810
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour
 

02:24:25.810 --> 02:24:27.210
by the way but 350 kilowatt hour
charging sort of solves that and you

02:24:27.210 --> 02:24:27.220
charging sort of solves that and you
 

02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:29.280
charging sort of solves that and you
would need banks of those chargers so I

02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:29.290
would need banks of those chargers so I
 

02:24:29.290 --> 02:24:31.920
would need banks of those chargers so I
think that is while it's not something

02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:31.930
think that is while it's not something
 

02:24:31.930 --> 02:24:34.920
think that is while it's not something
we've seen yet I think that is that is

02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:34.930
we've seen yet I think that is that is
 

02:24:34.930 --> 02:24:36.450
we've seen yet I think that is that is
the future is pairing that with

02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:36.460
the future is pairing that with
 

02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:39.179
the future is pairing that with
distributed energy let me just chime in

02:24:39.179 --> 02:24:39.189
distributed energy let me just chime in
 

02:24:39.189 --> 02:24:40.500
distributed energy let me just chime in
there for saying cost I think this is an

02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:40.510
there for saying cost I think this is an
 

02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:42.990
there for saying cost I think this is an
important point is that we don't know

02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000
important point is that we don't know
 

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.490
important point is that we don't know
what this future looks like all that we

02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:44.500
what this future looks like all that we
 

02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:45.870
what this future looks like all that we
know is that there's going to be an

02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:45.880
know is that there's going to be an
 

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:47.639
know is that there's going to be an
increased penetration in EVs and there's

02:24:47.639 --> 02:24:47.649
increased penetration in EVs and there's
 

02:24:47.649 --> 02:24:49.290
increased penetration in EVs and there's
going to be at least I believe there's

02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:49.300
going to be at least I believe there's
 

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.670
going to be at least I believe there's
going to be an increased penetration of

02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:50.680
going to be an increased penetration of
 

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:52.590
going to be an increased penetration of
distributed generation so this is a

02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:52.600
distributed generation so this is a
 

02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:54.929
distributed generation so this is a
critical time for us to be piloting

02:24:54.929 --> 02:24:54.939
critical time for us to be piloting
 

02:24:54.939 --> 02:24:56.580
critical time for us to be piloting
things like southern like Darren and

02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:56.590
things like southern like Darren and
 

02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:58.830
things like southern like Darren and
southern are doing that Duquesne Light

02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840
southern are doing that Duquesne Light
 

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:01.139
southern are doing that Duquesne Light
is you know is just really getting off

02:25:01.139 --> 02:25:01.149
is you know is just really getting off
 

02:25:01.149 --> 02:25:03.120
is you know is just really getting off
the ground as I said because we're at a

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:03.130
the ground as I said because we're at a
 

02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:05.250
the ground as I said because we're at a
relatively early stage in terms of
