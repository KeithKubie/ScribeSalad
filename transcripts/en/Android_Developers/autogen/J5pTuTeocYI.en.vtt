going to cover connectivity AP ice for

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090
going to cover connectivity AP ice for
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.399
going to cover connectivity AP ice for
jellybeans and we're gonna announce

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409
jellybeans and we're gonna announce
 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.080
jellybeans and we're gonna announce
something really exciting at the end of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090
something really exciting at the end of
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.020
something really exciting at the end of
the presentation on connectivity API so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
the presentation on connectivity API so
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.470
the presentation on connectivity API so
stay tuned so so what we're going to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
stay tuned so so what we're going to
 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.140
stay tuned so so what we're going to
look at is what our connectivity AP is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150
look at is what our connectivity AP is
 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.720
look at is what our connectivity AP is
and what's you with jellybeans so

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
and what's you with jellybeans so
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.670
and what's you with jellybeans so
basically these are set up wireless AP

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
basically these are set up wireless AP
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.309
basically these are set up wireless AP
is and they enable devices to

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319
is and they enable devices to
 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.020
is and they enable devices to
communicate between each other so they

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
communicate between each other so they
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.759
communicate between each other so they
come they can communicate with the cloud

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
come they can communicate with the cloud
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.800
come they can communicate with the cloud
and that's about using your regular

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810
and that's about using your regular
 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.619
and that's about using your regular
Wi-Fi to connect to your servers on the

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629
Wi-Fi to connect to your servers on the
 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.720
Wi-Fi to connect to your servers on the
cloud in full data and they can also

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730
cloud in full data and they can also
 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.520
cloud in full data and they can also
talk to each other so some of these

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
talk to each other so some of these
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.800
talk to each other so some of these
technologies that are that can enable

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810
technologies that are that can enable
 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.170
technologies that are that can enable
this kind of communication or Wi-Fi

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
this kind of communication or Wi-Fi
 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420
this kind of communication or Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and Android Beam which is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
Bluetooth and Android Beam which is
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.619
Bluetooth and Android Beam which is
built on top of NFC so and these are

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629
built on top of NFC so and these are
 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.289
built on top of NFC so and these are
existing it of since ICS we had android

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299
existing it of since ICS we had android
 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.629
existing it of since ICS we had android
game and then Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639
game and then Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have
 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.030
game and then Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have
been much there much before so in terms

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
been much there much before so in terms
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.509
been much there much before so in terms
of what's new for jellybean we

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519
of what's new for jellybean we
 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.009
of what's new for jellybean we
introduced something called Wi-Fi direct

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019
introduced something called Wi-Fi direct
 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.990
introduced something called Wi-Fi direct
service discovery and network service

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000
service discovery and network service
 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.430
service discovery and network service
discovery end and these are the two

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440
discovery end and these are the two
 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.369
discovery end and these are the two
topics we will cover in detail with the

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379
topics we will cover in detail with the
 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.219
topics we will cover in detail with the
launch of ICS we introduced the Wi-Fi

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229
launch of ICS we introduced the Wi-Fi
 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.319
launch of ICS we introduced the Wi-Fi
direct which is a peer-to-peer

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329
direct which is a peer-to-peer
 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.509
direct which is a peer-to-peer
technology for connecting devices and we

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
technology for connecting devices and we
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.099
technology for connecting devices and we
jelly bean we've kind of introduced

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109
jelly bean we've kind of introduced
 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.349

they discover each other they perform

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
they discover each other they perform
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240
they discover each other they perform
discovery they are able to connect and

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250
discovery they are able to connect and
 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.789
discovery they are able to connect and
then use sockets for transferring data

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799
then use sockets for transferring data
 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.870
then use sockets for transferring data
so and these can happens within and it's

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880
so and these can happens within and it's
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.479
so and these can happens within and it's
kind of interesting because the Wi-Fi

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
kind of interesting because the Wi-Fi
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.140
kind of interesting because the Wi-Fi
range is as a much larger than the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150
range is as a much larger than the
 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.659
range is as a much larger than the
Bluetooth range and also the connection

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669
Bluetooth range and also the connection
 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.430
Bluetooth range and also the connection
is high speed connection with Wi-Fi so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
is high speed connection with Wi-Fi so
 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.870
is high speed connection with Wi-Fi so
it is it's a very interesting

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880
it is it's a very interesting
 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.240
it is it's a very interesting
and fast way of connecting high-speed

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
and fast way of connecting high-speed
 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.160
and fast way of connecting high-speed
connections between devices so which

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170
connections between devices so which
 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.550
connections between devices so which
brings us to the new API is in jelly

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560
brings us to the new API is in jelly
 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.370

introduced in ICS you could connect to
 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.450
introduced in ICS you could connect to
devices and once you connect you first

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
devices and once you connect you first
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.670
devices and once you connect you first
performed discovery and once a discovery

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680
performed discovery and once a discovery
 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.340
performed discovery and once a discovery
is done you get the netbook details of

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350

that you have to connect to devices to

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230
that you have to connect to devices to
 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.100
that you have to connect to devices to
figure out what services are available

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
figure out what services are available
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.480
figure out what services are available
so that's where the Wi-Fi service

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490
so that's where the Wi-Fi service
 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.220
so that's where the Wi-Fi service
discovery comes in Wi-Fi direct service

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230
discovery comes in Wi-Fi direct service
 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.300
discovery comes in Wi-Fi direct service
is coming and it's a pre Association

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310
is coming and it's a pre Association
 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.120
is coming and it's a pre Association
discovery so you can actually find

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130
discovery so you can actually find
 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.370
discovery so you can actually find
services before establishing or

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380
services before establishing or
 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.620
services before establishing or
associating yourself to the AP which is

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
associating yourself to the AP which is
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.260
associating yourself to the AP which is
the access point so you can figure out

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270
the access point so you can figure out
 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.760
the access point so you can figure out
what services are available then if

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770
what services are available then if
 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.800
what services are available then if
you're really interested you can connect

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
you're really interested you can connect
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.720
you're really interested you can connect
your particular device which is hosting

that service or the app that is forcing
 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.150
that service or the app that is forcing
that service on the device so the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160
that service on the device so the
 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.490
that service on the device so the
devices and this comes from Wi-Fi direct

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500
devices and this comes from Wi-Fi direct
 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.350
devices and this comes from Wi-Fi direct
itself the devices are not connected to

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360
itself the devices are not connected to
 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.660
itself the devices are not connected to
a network or don't have to be connected

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670
a network or don't have to be connected
 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.720
a network or don't have to be connected
to a network you do not have to have an

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730
to a network you do not have to have an
 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.510
to a network you do not have to have an
existing Wi-Fi network around a classic

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520

locked-room based access point out the

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430
locked-room based access point out the
 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.460
locked-room based access point out the
devices can just connect to each other

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470
devices can just connect to each other
 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.250
devices can just connect to each other
whenever they're near the Wi-Fi range of

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
whenever they're near the Wi-Fi range of
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.380
whenever they're near the Wi-Fi range of
each other so which basically means

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390
each other so which basically means
 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.360
each other so which basically means
before they're assigned the IP address

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
before they're assigned the IP address
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.580
before they're assigned the IP address
of the network they they are able to

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590
of the network they they are able to
 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.620
of the network they they are able to
discover each other the discover the

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630
discover each other the discover the
 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.710

services you and the device itself and
 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.750
services you and the device itself and
then if interested in the service

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760
then if interested in the service
 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.850
then if interested in the service
establish a connection so this actually

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
establish a connection so this actually

caplets a service which you want to
 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.560
caplets a service which you want to
publish then there's a service request

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570
publish then there's a service request
 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.500
publish then there's a service request
so another two specializations of these

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:55.510
so another two specializations of these
 

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.080

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.140
technologies like mentoring and
publishing streams of audio and video so

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.150
publishing streams of audio and video so
 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.240
publishing streams of audio and video so
there's Anna specialization for DNS

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.250
there's Anna specialization for DNS
 

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.630
there's Anna specialization for DNS
space service and a plugin upnp based

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:24.640
space service and a plugin upnp based
 

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.260
space service and a plugin upnp based
service so now we gonna get a bit more

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.270
service so now we gonna get a bit more
 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.730
service so now we gonna get a bit more
technical and we're going to see and

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:32.740
technical and we're going to see and
 

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.770
technical and we're going to see and
take a look at court and to see and some

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:34.780
take a look at court and to see and some
 

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.209
take a look at court and to see and some
code snippets to see how does this

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:36.219
code snippets to see how does this
 

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:39.000
code snippets to see how does this
actually work so the first thing you

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.010
actually work so the first thing you
 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.070
actually work so the first thing you
want to do from device a which is the

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080
want to do from device a which is the
 

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.779
want to do from device a which is the
first device that's interested in

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:42.789
first device that's interested in
 

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.390
first device that's interested in
connecting or is interested in being

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:45.400
connecting or is interested in being
 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.400
connecting or is interested in being
part of a peer to peer exchange will

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.410
part of a peer to peer exchange will
 

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.110
part of a peer to peer exchange will
publish a service so before you can

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120
publish a service so before you can
 

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.900
publish a service so before you can
actually connect to a service you need a

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:50.910
actually connect to a service you need a
 

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.410
actually connect to a service you need a
population service so you create a local

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.420
population service so you create a local
 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.889
population service so you create a local
service shop Jake and

00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899
service shop Jake and
 

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:00.119
service shop Jake and
what do you do is you have an instance

00:09:00.119 --> 00:09:00.129
what do you do is you have an instance
 

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:02.160
what do you do is you have an instance
name and a service fight so the instance

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.170
name and a service fight so the instance
 

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.509
name and a service fight so the instance
name is something really that your

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519
name is something really that your
 

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.220
name is something really that your
application is so this could be test or

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.230
application is so this could be test or
 

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.230
application is so this could be test or
you know my chat or my printing service

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240
you know my chat or my printing service
 

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.530
you know my chat or my printing service
and then there's a service type which is

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:10.540
and then there's a service type which is
 

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.499
and then there's a service type which is
a which is a standard name that's

00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:13.509
a which is a standard name that's
 

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:16.619
a which is a standard name that's
followed and these lists of names are

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:16.629
followed and these lists of names are
 

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:19.139
followed and these lists of names are
registered with I na which is a body

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:19.149
registered with I na which is a body
 

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:21.600
registered with I na which is a body
that manages manages the service types

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
that manages manages the service types
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.569
that manages manages the service types
and so if you're publishing service

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:24.579
and so if you're publishing service
 

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:26.670
and so if you're publishing service
that's not already included as part of

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680
that's not already included as part of
 

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.819
that's not already included as part of
ein a services you can register your

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:29.829
ein a services you can register your
 

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:32.579
ein a services you can register your
service type with the ine and body and

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:32.589
service type with the ine and body and
 

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:35.610
service type with the ine and body and
then use a service type so this would

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:35.620
then use a service type so this would
 

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.429
then use a service type so this would
typically be something like so for

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:38.439
typically be something like so for
 

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:39.989
typically be something like so for
example for chat service we use

00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:39.999
example for chat service we use
 

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.819
example for chat service we use
something called presents and presence

00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:41.829
something called presents and presence
 

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:43.170
something called presents and presence
is the name for a chat service so you

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.180
is the name for a chat service so you
 

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.340
is the name for a chat service so you
your service site will be present and

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.350
your service site will be present and
 

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.559
your service site will be present and
similarly there are names for printing

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:49.569
similarly there are names for printing
 

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:53.249
similarly there are names for printing
and for other network services so all

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:53.259
and for other network services so all
 

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.410
and for other network services so all
right so what we've seen is you're able

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.420
right so what we've seen is you're able
 

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.600
right so what we've seen is you're able
to create now a local service object and

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:57.610
to create now a local service object and
 

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.670
to create now a local service object and
then you register this local service

00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680
then you register this local service
 

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.780
then you register this local service
with the Wi-Fi p2p manager Wi-Fi p2p

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:03.790
with the Wi-Fi p2p manager Wi-Fi p2p
 

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.710
with the Wi-Fi p2p manager Wi-Fi p2p
manager is a system utility that it's a

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720
manager is a system utility that it's a
 

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.299
manager is a system utility that it's a
framework class that's available to you

00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:09.309
framework class that's available to you
 

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.429
framework class that's available to you
just like just like the connectivity

00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:11.439
just like just like the connectivity
 

00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:13.170
just like just like the connectivity
manager or the telephony manager you say

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.180
manager or the telephony manager you say
 

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.689
manager or the telephony manager you say
context or get system service and then

00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:15.699
context or get system service and then
 

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.939
context or get system service and then
you say well if I mean manager and you

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:17.949
you say well if I mean manager and you
 

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:24.840
you say well if I mean manager and you
get a handle to be manager object so so

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:24.850
get a handle to be manager object so so
 

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.689
get a handle to be manager object so so
we've seen the part of where a device is

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:27.699
we've seen the part of where a device is
 

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:29.340
we've seen the part of where a device is
able to publish a service now on the

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.350
able to publish a service now on the
 

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.900
able to publish a service now on the
peer device which actually wants to use

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:30.910
peer device which actually wants to use
 

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.150
peer device which actually wants to use
the service or consume this service you

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160
the service or consume this service you
 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.179
the service or consume this service you
will create a service discovery request

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:36.189
will create a service discovery request
 

00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:39.150
will create a service discovery request
and then you will go ahead and perform a

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160
and then you will go ahead and perform a
 

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.069
and then you will go ahead and perform a
service discovery so first you have on

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079
service discovery so first you have on
 

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:43.169
service discovery so first you have on
you create an instance she ate an object

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:43.179
you create an instance she ate an object
 

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:46.110
you create an instance she ate an object
that describes your request is basically

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120
that describes your request is basically
 

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.809
that describes your request is basically
you have some fields that we will look

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:48.819
you have some fields that we will look
 

00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:50.879
you have some fields that we will look
into and then you ask the Wi-Fi p2p

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:50.889
into and then you ask the Wi-Fi p2p
 

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:57.449
into and then you ask the Wi-Fi p2p
manager to form the discovery so when

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:57.459
manager to form the discovery so when
 

00:10:57.459 --> 00:10:58.949
manager to form the discovery so when
you're implementing this in android

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959
you're implementing this in android
 

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.319
you're implementing this in android
first thing is let's some of the

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:01.329
first thing is let's some of the
 

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:03.749
first thing is let's some of the
permissions you need a change Wi-Fi

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:03.759
permissions you need a change Wi-Fi
 

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:05.519
permissions you need a change Wi-Fi
state and access Wi-Fi a state

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:05.529
state and access Wi-Fi a state
 

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:07.769
state and access Wi-Fi a state
permission and also you need internet

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:07.779
permission and also you need internet
 

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:09.929
permission and also you need internet
permission it's not because we are going

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:09.939
permission it's not because we are going
 

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.160
permission it's not because we are going
to exchange

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.170
to exchange
 

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.850
to exchange
data over the Internet it's only because

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
data over the Internet it's only because
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.620
data over the Internet it's only because
we are going to use sockets to

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:16.630
we are going to use sockets to
 

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.870
we are going to use sockets to
communicate between devices ends we've

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880
communicate between devices ends we've
 

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.120
communicate between devices ends we've
kind of the sockets maintenance function

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.130
kind of the sockets maintenance function
 

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.480
kind of the sockets maintenance function
is time two sockets usage so you would

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.490
is time two sockets usage so you would
 

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.920
is time two sockets usage so you would
require this permission as well in your

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:25.930
require this permission as well in your
 

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:33.060
require this permission as well in your
manifest so now now at a code level and

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.070
manifest so now now at a code level and
 

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.389
manifest so now now at a code level and
these are in these methods of code and

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399
these are in these methods of code and
 

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:38.550
these are in these methods of code and
it's pretty easy to write this code just

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560
it's pretty easy to write this code just
 

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.939
it's pretty easy to write this code just
to three lines per per operation that

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:41.949
to three lines per per operation that
 

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:45.509
to three lines per per operation that
you want to perform in so the first

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519
you want to perform in so the first
 

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:47.639
you want to perform in so the first
thing we look at is appear adding a

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:47.649
thing we look at is appear adding a
 

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:49.889
thing we look at is appear adding a
local service so here's the service

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:49.899
local service so here's the service
 

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.360
local service so here's the service
class that we talked about earlier as a

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.370
class that we talked about earlier as a
 

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.569
class that we talked about earlier as a
key API this is Wi-Fi p2p dns service

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:54.579
key API this is Wi-Fi p2p dns service
 

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.840
key API this is Wi-Fi p2p dns service
info and you just use a static

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
info and you just use a static
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.310
info and you just use a static
initializer on that same new instance

00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320
initializer on that same new instance
 

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.160
initializer on that same new instance
and the two things that you are looking

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.170
and the two things that you are looking
 

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.139
and the two things that you are looking
at the parameters there are the other

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:04.149
at the parameters there are the other
 

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:06.449
at the parameters there are the other
ones are the instance lame and the

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:06.459
ones are the instance lame and the
 

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.819
ones are the instance lame and the
service type so the instance name is our

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:08.829
service type so the instance name is our
 

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.470
service type so the instance name is our
instance of the service which is

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480
instance of the service which is
 

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.829
instance of the service which is
underscore test here and because it's a

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839
underscore test here and because it's a
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.630
underscore test here and because it's a
kind of track service so we are using a

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:15.640
kind of track service so we are using a
 

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.600
kind of track service so we are using a
standard name for the chat service and

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:18.610
standard name for the chat service and
 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.509
standard name for the chat service and
notice the naming convention here this

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519
notice the naming convention here this
 

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.130
notice the naming convention here this
is followed for all the services type

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.140
is followed for all the services type
 

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.439
is followed for all the services type
for all in DNS based services which

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:25.449
for all in DNS based services which
 

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:27.990
for all in DNS based services which
underscore so its type underscore the

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000
underscore so its type underscore the
 

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.400
underscore so its type underscore the
protocol is going to follow over the

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.410
protocol is going to follow over the
 

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.490
protocol is going to follow over the
network so the third thing is really

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:32.500
network so the third thing is really
 

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.560
network so the third thing is really
interesting it's a record and this is a

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:34.570
interesting it's a record and this is a
 

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.579
interesting it's a record and this is a
DNX dns text recorded and this is also

00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:38.589
DNX dns text recorded and this is also
 

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:40.380
DNX dns text recorded and this is also
pretty much standard and this carries

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:40.390
pretty much standard and this carries
 

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.329
pretty much standard and this carries
additional metadata about your service

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:42.339
additional metadata about your service
 

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:44.639
additional metadata about your service
so for example if it's a chat service

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:44.649
so for example if it's a chat service
 

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:46.980
so for example if it's a chat service
and along with saying that you have a

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:46.990
and along with saying that you have a
 

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.920
and along with saying that you have a
chat service you also want to say that

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:48.930
chat service you also want to say that
 

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.019
chat service you also want to say that
as a user I am available to chat at this

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:52.029
as a user I am available to chat at this
 

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:54.480
as a user I am available to chat at this
point of time or i am busy and i cannot

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.490
point of time or i am busy and i cannot
 

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.460
point of time or i am busy and i cannot
check so the service is available but

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:56.470
check so the service is available but
 

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.680
check so the service is available but
you are busy and you cannot respond to

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:58.690
you are busy and you cannot respond to
 

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.319
you are busy and you cannot respond to
chat messages so the next extra guard is

00:13:01.319 --> 00:13:01.329
chat messages so the next extra guard is
 

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:04.319
chat messages so the next extra guard is
kind of a key value thing and this is

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:04.329
kind of a key value thing and this is
 

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:05.579
kind of a key value thing and this is
where you can publish an additional

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:05.589
where you can publish an additional
 

00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:08.250
where you can publish an additional
metadata about your service so and you

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.260
metadata about your service so and you
 

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.500
metadata about your service so and you
can keep publishing these records which

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:10.510
can keep publishing these records which
 

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.960
can keep publishing these records which
these regards can change over time so

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:12.970
these regards can change over time so
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.790
these regards can change over time so
your service is published and it's

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800
your service is published and it's
 

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.199
your service is published and it's
available as a chart service and then

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:16.209
available as a chart service and then
 

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:18.689
available as a chart service and then
you can keep pushing pls text icon

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:18.699
you can keep pushing pls text icon
 

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.460
you can keep pushing pls text icon
saying i'm available at this point of

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.470
saying i'm available at this point of
 

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.600
saying i'm available at this point of
time I'm not available and busy

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:25.610
 
 

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.450
 
so once once you've done that we add the

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:29.460
so once once you've done that we add the
 

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.310
so once once you've done that we add the
local service to and the end manager

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320
local service to and the end manager
 

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.620
local service to and the end manager
object that you see here is the Wi-Fi

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:33.630
object that you see here is the Wi-Fi
 

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.320
object that you see here is the Wi-Fi
p2p manager and then you add this local

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:36.330
p2p manager and then you add this local
 

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.810
p2p manager and then you add this local
service and there is a call back many

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820
service and there is a call back many
 

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.580
service and there is a call back many
many operations are almost all

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:40.590
many operations are almost all
 

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.820
many operations are almost all
operations of Wi-Fi p2p direct and DNS

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:43.830
operations of Wi-Fi p2p direct and DNS
 

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.730
operations of Wi-Fi p2p direct and DNS
network service discovery are

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:45.740
network service discovery are
 

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.860
network service discovery are
asynchronous and your ways register a

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:48.870
asynchronous and your ways register a
 

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.030
asynchronous and your ways register a
callback for success or failure and so

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040
callback for success or failure and so
 

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.560
callback for success or failure and so
this is kind of a standard template for

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:54.570
this is kind of a standard template for
 

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.490
this is kind of a standard template for
all operations of network for all

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500
all operations of network for all
 

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.350
all operations of network for all
operations of service discovery so we

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360
operations of service discovery so we
 

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.730
operations of service discovery so we
instituted a service info object which

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740
instituted a service info object which
 

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.590
instituted a service info object which
had our instance name and service type

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600
had our instance name and service type
 

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.130
had our instance name and service type
and a DNS texture card and so once we've

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:10.140
and a DNS texture card and so once we've
 

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.840
and a DNS texture card and so once we've
created that we go ahead and say in my

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:11.850
created that we go ahead and say in my
 

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.750
created that we go ahead and say in my
manager or not add local service and as

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760
manager or not add local service and as
 

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.070
manager or not add local service and as
soon as you do that your service is

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.080
soon as you do that your service is
 

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.550
soon as you do that your service is
published over the Wi-Fi p2p network

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560
published over the Wi-Fi p2p network
 

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.960
published over the Wi-Fi p2p network
Wi-Fi network and in case there is an

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:20.970
Wi-Fi network and in case there is an
 

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.000
Wi-Fi network and in case there is an
Ender you can have that error ensure

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.010
Ender you can have that error ensure
 

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:30.650
Ender you can have that error ensure
procreate messages to be user so I like

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660
procreate messages to be user so I like
 

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.820
procreate messages to be user so I like
it said all the operations are

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:31.830
it said all the operations are
 

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.710
it said all the operations are
asynchronous so every time you perform

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720
asynchronous so every time you perform
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.660
asynchronous so every time you perform
an operation you're going to pass a call

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:35.670
an operation you're going to pass a call
 

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.060
an operation you're going to pass a call
back or register for action listener

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.070
back or register for action listener
 

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.420
back or register for action listener
like a success failure and because it's

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:41.430
like a success failure and because it's
 

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.370
like a success failure and because it's
asynchronous in nature you don't have to

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380
asynchronous in nature you don't have to
 

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.920
asynchronous in nature you don't have to
worry about where you are placing this

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:45.930
worry about where you are placing this
 

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.140
worry about where you are placing this
call you can be your main preppy and the

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.150
call you can be your main preppy and the
 

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.820
call you can be your main preppy and the
line network all is always off the main

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:49.830
line network all is always off the main
 

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.130
line network all is always off the main
threat so you don't have to worry about

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.140
threat so you don't have to worry about
 

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.830
threat so you don't have to worry about
the lightning asynchronous async task

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:54.840
the lightning asynchronous async task
 

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.690
the lightning asynchronous async task
and then placing these calls where

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:56.700
and then placing these calls where
 

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.160
and then placing these calls where
they're inherently its appearance so all

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.170
they're inherently its appearance so all
 

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.680
they're inherently its appearance so all
right we've not published the service

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.690
right we've not published the service
 

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.850
right we've not published the service
those two lines of code on so the other

nearby service and connect to it it
 

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.990
nearby service and connect to it it
first needs to create a DNS as the

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000
first needs to create a DNS as the
 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.480
first needs to create a DNS as the
service response listener so which

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.490
service response listener so which
 

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.030
service response listener so which
basically is a call back where has one

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040
basically is a call back where has one
 

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.310
basically is a call back where has one
method which is on DNS SB service

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320
method which is on DNS SB service
 

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.010

these this is the same kind of mechanism

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.330
these this is the same kind of mechanism
 

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.110
these this is the same kind of mechanism
that you fall around for you ENT so when

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120
that you fall around for you ENT so when
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.100
that you fall around for you ENT so when
there's a UPS

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.110
there's a UPS
 

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.019
there's a UPS
always available you will see on begin p

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:39.029
always available you will see on begin p
 

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:41.360

service available with a upnp service
response display so this is a call back

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.070
response display so this is a call back
 

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.990

the the method on the anonymous
 

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.430
the the method on the anonymous
implementation there is called when the

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440
implementation there is called when the
 

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.680
implementation there is called when the
services when the framework is available

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:51.690
services when the framework is available
 

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.180
services when the framework is available
to discover a service when they have

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.190
to discover a service when they have
 

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.100
to discover a service when they have
great device discovers a service it's

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.110
great device discovers a service it's
 

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.750
great device discovers a service it's
going to give you a call back there so

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760
going to give you a call back there so
 

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.670
going to give you a call back there so
first thing you do is you instantiate a

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680
first thing you do is you instantiate a
 

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.800
first thing you do is you instantiate a
service response listener and you send

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:03.810
service response listener and you send
 

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.170
service response listener and you send
it in the manager so you say Wi-Fi p2p

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180
it in the manager so you say Wi-Fi p2p
 

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.340
it in the manager so you say Wi-Fi p2p
manager here is my services spawn

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:09.350
manager here is my services spawn
 

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.600
manager here is my services spawn
response listener in cancer is a service

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:11.610
response listener in cancer is a service
 

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:20.660
response listener in cancer is a service
call me back so we've said our response

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:20.670
call me back so we've said our response
 

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.430
call me back so we've said our response
listener and then what we want to do is

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440
listener and then what we want to do is
 

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.829
listener and then what we want to do is
actually create a service request and

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839
actually create a service request and
 

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.180
actually create a service request and
this works again if you remember one of

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.190
this works again if you remember one of
 

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:31.490
this works again if you remember one of
the key api's so you will say use the

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500
the key api's so you will say use the
 

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.860
the key api's so you will say use the
Wi-Fi p2p service request object to get

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:33.870
Wi-Fi p2p service request object to get
 

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.150
Wi-Fi p2p service request object to get
a new instance again a static

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160
a new instance again a static
 

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.040
a new instance again a static
initializer there and once you are able

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.050
initializer there and once you are able
 

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.340
initializer there and once you are able
to get a service request you add the

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:40.350
to get a service request you add the
 

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.560
to get a service request you add the
service request to the Wi-Fi PT manager

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:42.570
service request to the Wi-Fi PT manager
 

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.360
service request to the Wi-Fi PT manager
and again there's a asynchronous

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.370
and again there's a asynchronous
 

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.759
and again there's a asynchronous
fallback such as failure once this is

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:46.769
fallback such as failure once this is
 

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:48.259
fallback such as failure once this is
done you actually go ahead and perform

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:48.269
done you actually go ahead and perform
 

00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:50.329
done you actually go ahead and perform
discovery by saying manager or discover

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339
discovery by saying manager or discover
 

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:53.360
discovery by saying manager or discover
services and then this is where the

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.370
services and then this is where the
 

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.829
services and then this is where the
framework actually starts discovering

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839
framework actually starts discovering
 

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:56.660
framework actually starts discovering
your services you've already registered

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:56.670
your services you've already registered
 

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.730
your services you've already registered
of this fastener you've given yourself

00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740
of this fastener you've given yourself
 

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.920
of this fastener you've given yourself
sequest and now the framework is able to

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:00.930
sequest and now the framework is able to
 

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.509
sequest and now the framework is able to
perform discovery and if it finds

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519
perform discovery and if it finds
 

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:04.159
perform discovery and if it finds
something it's able to call back on your

00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:04.169
something it's able to call back on your
 

00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:12.620
something it's able to call back on your
interfaces so so once the service is DN

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.630
interfaces so so once the service is DN
 

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.079
interfaces so so once the service is DN
SSD services available you will also

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.089
SSD services available you will also
 

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.299
SSD services available you will also
receive a Wi-Fi p2p device object along

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:17.309
receive a Wi-Fi p2p device object along
 

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:20.120
receive a Wi-Fi p2p device object along
with it this is a basically a structure

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.130
with it this is a basically a structure
 

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.640
with it this is a basically a structure
that has details about the pier IP and

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.650
that has details about the pier IP and
 

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.620
that has details about the pier IP and
the other connection will be in it in

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:24.630
the other connection will be in it in
 

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.630
the other connection will be in it in
details and this is when you can

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640
details and this is when you can
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.280
details and this is when you can
actually go ahead and form a network

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.290
actually go ahead and form a network
 

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.060
actually go ahead and form a network
connection so you're able to query the

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.070
connection so you're able to query the
 

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.680
connection so you're able to query the
the Wi-Fi p2p manager for nearby

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:33.690
the Wi-Fi p2p manager for nearby
 

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.870
the Wi-Fi p2p manager for nearby
services and suppose you find the

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880
services and suppose you find the
 

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.850
services and suppose you find the
service or maybe a printing service or

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860
service or maybe a printing service or
 

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.799
service or maybe a printing service or
maybe or chat service that you want to

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:39.809
maybe or chat service that you want to
 

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.990
maybe or chat service that you want to
connect to this at this point of time

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000
connect to this at this point of time
 

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
connect to this at this point of time
which is after performing discovery and

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.010
which is after performing discovery and
 

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.740
which is after performing discovery and
the framework gives you a call back on

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:45.750
the framework gives you a call back on
 

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.680
the framework gives you a call back on
the interface you can now say you cannot

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:48.690
the interface you can now say you cannot
 

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.659
the interface you can now say you cannot
see the connection details and go ahead

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:50.669
see the connection details and go ahead
 

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.080
see the connection details and go ahead
and

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.090
and
 

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.019
and
from connect to the other device and

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:54.029
from connect to the other device and
 

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:56.180
from connect to the other device and
this basically means initiating an

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:56.190
this basically means initiating an
 

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.299
this basically means initiating an
access point Association and so that

00:17:59.299 --> 00:17:59.309
access point Association and so that
 

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:00.980
access point Association and so that
once once this is done you're on the

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:00.990
once once this is done you're on the
 

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.890
once once this is done you're on the
same network now you get assigned IP

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900
same network now you get assigned IP
 

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.110
same network now you get assigned IP
addresses on the same network the same

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120
addresses on the same network the same
 

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.230
addresses on the same network the same
Wi-Fi p2p network and once this is done

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240
Wi-Fi p2p network and once this is done
 

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.690
Wi-Fi p2p network and once this is done
you're able to open sockets because

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700
you're able to open sockets because
 

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.430
you're able to open sockets because
you're the same network now you can open

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440
you're the same network now you can open
 

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.350
you're the same network now you can open
tcp socket and start exchanging data

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360
tcp socket and start exchanging data
 

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.720
tcp socket and start exchanging data
which is your app data so what the

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:17.730
which is your app data so what the
 

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.159
which is your app data so what the
framework is really giving you is a

00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:19.169
framework is really giving you is a
 

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:21.279
framework is really giving you is a
mechanism is sort of a framework for

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:21.289
mechanism is sort of a framework for
 

00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:24.470
mechanism is sort of a framework for
publishing your services and consuming

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480
publishing your services and consuming
 

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.269
publishing your services and consuming
other service discovering and consuming

00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:26.279
other service discovering and consuming
 

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:31.789
other service discovering and consuming
other services so this was this was

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799
other services so this was this was
 

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.340
other services so this was this was
completely Wi-Fi p2p which is based on a

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.350
completely Wi-Fi p2p which is based on a
 

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.180
completely Wi-Fi p2p which is based on a
Wi-Fi p2p network so the condition there

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:38.190
Wi-Fi p2p network so the condition there
 

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.250
Wi-Fi p2p network so the condition there
was there doesn't have to be an existing

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260
was there doesn't have to be an existing
 

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.470
was there doesn't have to be an existing
network two devices capable of Wi-Fi p2p

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480
network two devices capable of Wi-Fi p2p
 

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.450
network two devices capable of Wi-Fi p2p
direct will find each other discover the

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460
direct will find each other discover the
 

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.090
direct will find each other discover the
services and care and the other thing is

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100
services and care and the other thing is
 

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.789
services and care and the other thing is
the other API that we produced network

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799
the other API that we produced network
 

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:52.430
the other API that we produced network
service discovery and this is basically

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440
service discovery and this is basically
 

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.490
service discovery and this is basically
based on the fact that you're already

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500
based on the fact that you're already
 

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.700
based on the fact that you're already
part of the network that you want to

00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:58.710
part of the network that you want to
 

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.350
part of the network that you want to
join and discover services and you're

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360
join and discover services and you're
 

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.350
join and discover services and you're
connected to the network organ and in

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360
connected to the network organ and in
 

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.210
connected to the network organ and in
this network you wanna discover services

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220
this network you wanna discover services
 

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.370
this network you wanna discover services
in your which are available in your

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380
in your which are available in your
 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.649
in your which are available in your
local network so this is pretty similar

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:09.659
local network so this is pretty similar
 

00:19:09.659 --> 00:19:11.810
local network so this is pretty similar
to bonjour if you work with pancho on

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820
to bonjour if you work with pancho on
 

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.760
to bonjour if you work with pancho on
the apple systems are there are other

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:13.770
the apple systems are there are other
 

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.399
the apple systems are there are other
zeroconf networking solutions available

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:16.409
zeroconf networking solutions available
 

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:18.950
zeroconf networking solutions available
on linux and other platforms and this is

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960
on linux and other platforms and this is
 

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.710
on linux and other platforms and this is
basically bringing the same dns face

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720
basically bringing the same dns face
 

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.870
basically bringing the same dns face
multicast dns based service discovery to

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880
multicast dns based service discovery to
 

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.510
multicast dns based service discovery to
android and we we call it network

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520
android and we we call it network
 

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.060
android and we we call it network
service discovery alright and like I

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.070
service discovery alright and like I
 

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.680
service discovery alright and like I
mentioned it's different from Wi-Fi

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:33.690
mentioned it's different from Wi-Fi
 

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.919
mentioned it's different from Wi-Fi
direct because Wi-Fi direct immediately

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:36.929
direct because Wi-Fi direct immediately
 

00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:39.200
direct because Wi-Fi direct immediately
you need a network and this is when

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.210
you need a network and this is when
 

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.399
you need a network and this is when
you're actually locked into a local

00:19:40.399 --> 00:19:40.409
you're actually locked into a local
 

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:43.399
you're actually locked into a local
network so if you bring your suppose you

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:43.409
network so if you bring your suppose you
 

00:19:43.409 --> 00:19:46.070
network so if you bring your suppose you
bring your device to your work place and

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080
bring your device to your work place and
 

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.200
bring your device to your work place and
you connect to your corporate Internet

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.210
you connect to your corporate Internet
 

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.560
you connect to your corporate Internet
your internet and you have some printers

announcement on the plus page as well so
 

00:28:55.139 --> 00:28:58.520
announcement on the plus page as well so
a do plus experiment is a way for you to

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:58.530
a do plus experiment is a way for you to
 

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.320
a do plus experiment is a way for you to
get involved with with the things that

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:00.330
get involved with with the things that
 

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.350

we present and today we're launching our
 

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.300
we present and today we're launching our
first experiment which based on the

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:05.310
first experiment which based on the
 

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.670
first experiment which based on the
connectivity API is that that are you

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:07.680
connectivity API is that that are you
 

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.330

is very simple actually you're tasked
 

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.140
is very simple actually you're tasked
with building a cool app this is

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.150
with building a cool app this is
 

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.240
with building a cool app this is
obviously optional for you to whether

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.250
obviously optional for you to whether
 

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.740
obviously optional for you to whether
you want to get involved or not but we

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:18.750
you want to get involved or not but we
 

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.420
you want to get involved or not but we
think this is a really great way to

developer community so build a cool app
come up with some great concept using

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:27.510
come up with some great concept using
 

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.800
come up with some great concept using
these connectivity api's and then what

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:30.810
these connectivity api's and then what
 

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.020
these connectivity api's and then what
you should do is share that APK with the

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.030
you should do is share that APK with the
 

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.810
you should do is share that APK with the
plus ADL experiments page so you know

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820
plus ADL experiments page so you know
 

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.840
plus ADL experiments page so you know
just send us a link to the APK a

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:38.850
just send us a link to the APK a
 

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.670
just send us a link to the APK a
download link whether it's Google Drive
