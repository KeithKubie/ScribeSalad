00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.680
Superhero movies are under intense scrutiny
from the very start, with millions of passionate

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.689
fans eager to dissect everything from the
storyline to the costume. Casting is the most

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.340
vital part: the wrong actor can break a movie
before it hits theatres, and fans may never

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.730
know how many close calls involved their favourite
heroes. Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Awful Superhero

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.510
Castings That Almost Happened.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.150
Superman

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.370
Nicolas Cage may have an Oscar to his name,
but that doesn�t mean he was right for director

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.650
Tim Burton�s short-lived reboot Superman
Lives. Better known for bringing hyper and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.730
hysterical characters to life, those traits
would have been a strange fit for the calm

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.320
and collected Kal-El. Clark Kent is supposed
to be an unassuming everyman who can blend

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.449
in with the crowd � not a personality Cage
is known for. The actor didn�t even look

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.230
the part in his costume test, coming off as
more of a bad Halloween get-up than the Man

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.420
of Steel. We partly regret not getting to
see a Nic Cage Superman in action, but that�s

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.450
a sacrifice worth making.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.869
Iron Man

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.760
For years, it was Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise
who was attached to star in an Iron Man film

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.270
before dropping out and giving way to Robert
Downey, Jr. While Cruise has returned to top

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.640
blockbuster form in recent years, Downey�s
casting as Tony Stark turned out to be a match

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.759
made in Heaven. It would have been nearly
impossible for audiences to separate Tom Cruise

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.880
from his superhero character, and picturing
Cruise spitting Stark�s banter still seems

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.960
wrong. The same challenges turned out to be
a good thing for Downey, having conquered

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.280
demons of his own before landing in the Marvel
spotlight. No offense to the actor, but it�s

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.189
for the best that Cruise lost interest.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.789
Spider-Man

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.022
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of his generation�s
most respected actors, but there are some

00:01:55.022 --> 00:02:00.360
parts even he�s not cut out for. Sony originally
wanted the Titanic star for the lead role

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.630
in Spider-Man before Sam Raimi cast Tobey
Maguire. While almost anyone can be convincing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.679
under the Spider-Man mask, it would have been
hard to buy DiCaprio as Peter Parker, the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.220
geeky science nerd who gets bullied at school,
and tongue-tied when talking to Mary Jane

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.980
Watson. DiCaprio is the kind of celebrity
most men aspire to be, and not someone they

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.370
see themselves in. That�s simply the wrong
dynamic for Spider-Man, whose everyman struggles

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.500
are vital character traits.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.959
Batman

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.130
Everyone loves Bill Murray, but would they
feel the same way if he had donned the cape

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.550
and cowl? Warner Bros. had to scrap plans
for a Murray-led Batman film in the vein of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.060
the campy Adam West TV show when they decided
to pursue Tim Burton�s movie, and fans can

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.410
once again breathe a sigh of relief. Even
if the project was light-hearted and fun,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.379
it�s hard to see Murray striking fear in
the hearts of criminals, or playing a clean-cut

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:02.980
billionaire playboy. Murray�s deadpan wit
and dramatic chops may have been worth seeing,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.310
but Michael Keaton�s Batman helped build
the mold that all other superheroes would

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.510
follow afterward.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.920
Green Lantern

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.590
Fans didn�t really care for the Green Lantern
film they eventually got, but at least it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.590
wasn�t this. For years, Jack Black was attached
to star in an adaptation as �Jud Plato,�

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.280
a slacker schmuck who is selected to become
a member of the Green Lantern Corp. Black�s

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.170
casting completely misses the point of the
character, typically defined by his strong

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.349
will and determination. Whether it�s Hal
Jordan, John Stewart, or anyone in between,

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.069
a potential Lantern at least gives the impression
they�re hero material, which the Black most

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.720
definitely does not. Admittedly, Black may
have been right for Jud Plato, but Jud isn�t

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.140
right for the Lanterns. At least Ryan Reynolds
had the right physique.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.319
