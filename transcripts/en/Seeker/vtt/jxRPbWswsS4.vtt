00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.910
Remember that time an astronaut diapered herself
and drove across the country to attack a rival?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.090
If you don’t, you should look that up, because
that’s a thing that happened.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.459
But look it up after this video.

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.230
Jealousy is a complex emotion that crops up
when we feel threatened, often bringing with

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.689
it feelings of fear, insecurity, anger, and
even violence, and a new study done with primates

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.929
is shedding some light on how it affects our
brains.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.169
Jealousy is a weird emotion.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.440
I mean, why would we have this irresistible
urge that makes us lurk on Becky’s instagram

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.460
to see if she’s hanging out with Chad?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.099
What good does that do us?

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.920
One idea is our fear of rejection forces us
to develop strong relationships we fight to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.920
protect.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.500
Some researchers even think that jealousy
might have manifested as a fitness advantage

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.160
as humans evolved.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.950
Jealous people boxed out competitors, secured
a mate, and passed on their jealous trait.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.780
But jealousy is a hard emotion to study, at
least in people.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.550
Researchers know that animals are easier to
control in a lab, but people aren’t always

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.000
truthful when they give their answers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
That’s why a team of researchers based their
new study on coppery titi monkeys.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.390
This is a monogamous primate species that
forms strong bonds with their partner as well

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.990
as mate-guarding that’s similar to romantic
behaviour in humans.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.510
Basically they jelly.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.630
To see what jealousy does to their brain,
the researchers introduced what they called

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.390
"jealousy conditions."

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.030
They put males in view of their female partner
and introduced her to another male.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.390
As a control the same male money was made
to watch a pair of unknown monkeys interact.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.250
In both cases, the male was filmed during
the viewing and given a brain scan after watching

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.920
the others for half an hour.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.700
In the lab as in the wild, titi monkeys were
visibly agitated when confronted with a rival

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.610
for their mate -- they arch their back, lash
their tails, and put their hands on their

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.590
female to keep them in place.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
The brain scans showed hormonal changes associated
with this behaviour.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560
Heightened activity in the cingulate cortex,which
is associated with social pain, as well as

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.440
elevated levels of testosterone and cortisol,
indicating stress.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.630
This study is, admittedly, limited since it
only looked at male monkeys, but it still

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.830
adds to growing research that says monogamy
comes down to our brain chemistry, at least

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.830
in part.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.030
It seems we’re hard wired to be jealous,
but just try and resist the urge to drive

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.000
across the country and pepperspray the new
girlfriend of your two-timing boyfriend husband.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.659
I told you to look that story up.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.829

I think so much about brains, which means
my brain is thinking about itself!

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.040
How does it even power thoughts though?

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.260
Trace contemplates that here.That’s all
for now, thanks for watching Seeker!
