00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:17.046
&gt;&gt;David Upchurch: Mangahigh is
an online educational resource.

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:21.186
&gt;&gt;Toby Rowland: Over the last
three years, we have learned

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.986
that there's some rules
for math game creation.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:27.346
&gt;&gt;One rule was that the game
mechanic had to be the map.

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.486
&gt;&gt;Chris Green: The concept that
we now have launched has gone

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:33.686
through many phases to make
it exciting and challenging

00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:37.966
and to make the gradient, the
slope, of learning just right.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:43.926
What's key is that you're constantly
having to solve mathematics problems,

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:47.496
but you're doing it in such
a way that it's exciting,

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.306
it's challenging, it's engaging.

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:52.336
&gt;&gt; David Upchurch: All our
games are built around an API

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:56.346
that queries the game constantly
about how the student's doing

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.786
and how they're performing, where
they're struggling and so forth.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:01.406
That's all fed back
to us here and some

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:04.606
of that data's also made available
to teachers via their admins.

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:08.846
&gt;&gt; Toby Rowland: The games through
the APIs are embedded in the site.

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:13.356
That means that teachers can set
tasks within games for students

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:16.596
and they can be sure that their
students are going to go directly

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:20.316
into that level of the game
and immediately be on task.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.556
&gt;&gt;Chris Green: Students have to
be out of their comfort zones.

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.546
If you're in your comfort zone and
you're getting things right and right

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:30.256
and right and teaches tiny
increments in difficulty or just more

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.266
of the same, what have you learned?

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.066
You've really learned nothing.

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:35.786
That's not something that
students are necessarily used to

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:40.146
and it's quite scary for teachers as
well to have the idea that, you know,

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.856
we want students to make mistakes.

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.306
We want them to learn
from those mistakes.

00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:46.576
We want them to be
uncomfortable in a math classroom.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:49.816
We don't want kids just sitting
there churning stuff out.

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:51.716
We want them to feel
that there's a sense

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:53.856
that I might not achieve
everything today.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.046
That is where the real
learning goes on

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:01.546
and that's a challenge
creating Mangahigh Resources.

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:02.946
That's what we want to create.
