Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Did you see a, I thought Vinny Magalhaes. She's got to take it that last I did too. I remember seeing a lot. He's really coming into his own. His striking is caught up with a lot of his grapple. Oh yeah. And he's fantastic after this back. Very dangerous. I've never seen a guy that big bath flexible. He can do everything. When it comes to Jujitsu. Do you ever see when the flying armbar paid upon? No. Nope. It's crazy. Look, who the fuck does that? Nope. I was at that match. The, uh, the Metamorris, I think it was a w w was it? Metamorris when he, what'd he grappled Keenan? Was that Metamorris few years back? Maybe like four or five years. Yeah. It could have been metamorris or, but it was clue. Metamorris matchups had some good ones, but I forget all the matchups. Yeah, those are good events, huh?

Speaker 1:          00:44          Yes. Yeah. No more. Huh? I wish there was more of those, man. I mean, I'm happy Eddie Bravo's sort of taken over that space with the Ebi and a combat. You just who now have you seen that slaps her so sick, man, it's so six great idea. It's nice. It's a great idea at times like you might be holding on, but that's slap that might cause the guy to let go of something. Changes the game. There's things aren't available anymore. You can't just allow yourself. It's just too hard. You could somebody like, oh, somebody stopped, somebody whacked the roadshow. Stop. Somebody's got on top, mounted them and just blasted them with pumps. Their head. Yeah. It was pretty rough, man. It's like you, it's almost like, am I going to look at that? I mean you can do ground and pound and we learned from boss route and way back in the Pancrase days.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Do you remember those days? Yeah. Boss route and figured out how to pull his hand back way further than other people and boss route and would smash guys with palm strikes. He was throwing like upper cuts and hooks, like he wasn't just like [inaudible]. Yeah. This, these are really high level Jujitsu to with smacks. Look at home. What? Ugh. Yeah. I need all that guy's not used to getting slapped up, not by a guy with a nasty guard like Wagner roadshow. Ah, yeah. If he wants to tap, his nose is fucked up. Goodness. Yeah. Can you tap from the slap? Yeah, you can tab. Oh, he's getting beat up the reputation. Stop Mike Bell Tron seen enough. See, once he starts dropping those palms down, boy. Huh? Paul, Huh? Yeah, it's a forehead. It's a reality check. You know, it's a reality check about how dangerous this position is.

Speaker 1:          02:22          You can't really just sit and let a guy mount you do something desperate to get out of that. But in Jujitsu, if the guy's just mounting you, you can kind of chill out, chilling out, figuring out how to escape a leg or something. That shit. Yeah. Combat you just so you gotta get the fuck out of there. That's a terrible place to be. Yeah. Same. They were like MMA, right? Being mounted. So especially when you're tired. Well, the difference between MMA grappling and regular grappling to used to always be with the, one of the big ones, at least I should say, was leg locks. They thought you really couldn't get away with leg locks in as much in MMA because as you're going for the legs, you have two arms committed to the legs. So I'm just going to punch you in the face and you don't have defense for it.

Speaker 1:          03:00          But now you're seeing when God's like m and Ra bursts on the scene and started ripping guys knees apart, you see how effective that is. And then Paul Horez people, no, no, you don't like, like less scared of it. It's they're scary, Huh? Yeah. I've actually so infatuated Cabrini operations and to reconstructions. Ah, but are you like, do you like to watch? Oh yeah, yeah. Like, yeah, John Danaher. Yeah, dude, he's so interesting. [inaudible] you know? Yeah, yeah. I remember just like kind of looking into the little bitty Cummings. Yeah. Those guys are savages. Gary, Tony, fucking people's legs up and you know, and then Craig Jones and all these other guys that are coming from all over the world that are leg locks specialists now, they all have these complex leg locks systems. Now it's a totally different thing. Holy Shit. You fuck up? You go zig when he should have zagged.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Like when Brian Hall fought Bj Penn. Right. And he caught him in that. I was like, no, no, no, not that way. Yeah, you just try to get out. He tried to get out and Ryan Hall just locked it up. Oh, I just imagined the field right now. I always tap road. Oh, well it's once that stuff gets chewed up inside there, that's the problem. I mean, some people could just take it, but once you start ripping meniscus apart and cartilage apart, once that stuff starts happening, ligaments starts getting stretched out and rip a little bit and there are always going to be wiggly. I mean, even Gordon ride just ripped his fucking leg apart. Did he really? Yeah. Yeah. He just had surgery. Um, I think he did it in an actual grappling match that I think his foot, his leg moved weird and it just, it popped his, his knee apart.

Speaker 1:          04:30          But the guy had a hold on it. I don't think so. No, no, I think it was in a scramble. I think it came apart in a scramble. Um, but there's a lot of those leg lock experts right now that scare the shit out and everything came from dean lister, which is crazy. [inaudible] you know the story? No, John Danaher was talking to Dean lister and uh, Dean lister was talking about leg locks and John Donna her said something inquired about why you do leg locks. And he goes, why would you ignore 50% of the body? And John Don heart being a fucking crazy wizards. And he is like, why would you, why would you, there's all these means there's a fucking hilarious meme of John Donna her in bed next to a woman and it says, why would you ignore 40% 50% of the body? Oh Man. Yeah. And then other guys.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Yeah. Well, Don, hers, a guy who understands things like he sees them on a very complex level, like he understands all the various possible exchanges and what's the best way to mitigate, like stop the defense, push the offense, control the situation. What is, what is the ultimate control position I have to get to? Do I have to get on the inside? Do I grab it this way? Do I grab it? And then they, once they started really experimenting and putting it together and putting it into a system, and you see how these guys who have only been doing Jujitsu for a few years, like Nicky Ryan and Gordon, right? They start tapping all these like really legit guys. They're like, what the fuck is happening? Yeah. The systems are craving Kamora system. Everything. Huh? [inaudible] I think that helps a lot. It just, when it comes to training, learning things in systems, you know what I mean? I think 10 plan, it has like their own short system right now for sure. And it helps. It helps you go to another state. Like it's the same. Yeah. Same System, right? Yeah. All systems help. Yeah. You know? I mean, and then fighters devise their own system really often, you know, have their own entries in their own ways of defending things. Yeah.
