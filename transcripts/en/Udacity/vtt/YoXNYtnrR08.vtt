00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.169
We know that to multiply this polynomial
by this polynomial, we need to ensure that

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:10.803
every term over here is multiplied by
every term over here. So if we take these

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:16.466
two terms one by one, and make sure that
each of them is multiplied by every term

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:20.529
over in the right=-hand expression, then
we'll cover every combination of pairs of

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.200
terms and also make sure that we don't
repeat any. So I'm going to start by

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:28.211
distributing the 3x to every term over
here. And now that I've multiplied it by

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:32.946
each of the three terms that I needed to,
I move on to the 1. At this point, all

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:37.134
that's left to do is to simplify each term
and combine like terms. And we get a final

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:42.734
answer of 3x^3-14x^2+x+2.
