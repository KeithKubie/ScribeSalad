00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:04.367
(VOICEOVER)- The
riverbed is bone dry.

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:06.300
But the trees are still alive.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.166
So that means that there's
still water here somewhere.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.433
And if you pay enough
attention, the desert

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:14.600
will show you where to look.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:24.133
I'm just looking at
these four-leaf ferns here.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:28.734
There's more green at this plant
than I've seen anywhere else.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:31.500
So might be promising.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.867
(VOICEOVER)- This
vegetation could be

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:40.100
the X on a hidden treasure map.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.700
I know that this plant
needs a lot of water.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.567
So for it to be alive,
there has to be a water

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.166
source just below the surface.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.266
Yeah.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.400
There must be some
sort of spring,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.333
because I know that the
water table in this river's

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.600
got to be lower than this.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:01.900
Yeah.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.433
That is wet mud, for sure.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.166
Oh, yeah.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.000
It's in there.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Look at that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.734
Water.

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.800
Oh, this is good.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.734
This is good.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.834
And it's really cold.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:26.767
This is coming from
somewhere deep underground.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.567
(VOICEOVER)- Large sand grains
like these hold nearly twice

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.667
as much water as fine sand.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.600
It's an incredible find.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.133
And it'll keep me out of
danger for a few more hours.

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.934
It's getting really
easy to dig now.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.567
Oh, yeah.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:45.300
There's water.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.533
Yup.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.900
Nice.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.266
Muddy water, but it's water.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.734
I'll wet this cloth.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:02.000
(VOICEOVER)- Since this spring
comes from deep underground,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.867
it's not likely to be
contaminated by animal waste

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:08.300
or flying insects
carrying diseases, making

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.734
it my best option for drinking.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.834
It's gritty water.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:15.567
But this is great.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.533
I am really happy
with what I got.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.433
(VOICEOVER)- I may not
find any more water today.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.433
So I need to make
the most of this.

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.567
Basically, I'm held
hostage to this waterhole

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:36.734
until I get my fill of water
as much as I can drink,

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:42.700
because I don't know if I'll be
this lucky as I keep moving on.
