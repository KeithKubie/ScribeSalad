00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.250
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.190
This video is about
derivatives.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.630
Two rules for finding
new derivatives.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.850
If we know the derivative
of a function f--

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.630
say we've found that--

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.340
and we know the derivative
of g--

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.710
we've found that--

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.250
then there are functions that
we can build out of those.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.950
And two important and
straightforward ones are the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.300
product, f of x times g of x,
and the quotient, the ratio f

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.440
of x over g of x.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.700
So those are the two
rules we need.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.900
If we know df dx and we know dg
dx, what's the derivative

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.690
of the product?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.510
Well, it is not df
dx times dg dx.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.060
And let me reduce the suspense
by writing down what it is.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.000
It's the first one times the
derivative of the second, we

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.380
know that, plus another term,
the second one times the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.690
derivative of the first. OK.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.170
So that's the rule to learn.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.200
Two terms, you see
the pattern.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.680
And maybe I ought to use it,
give you some examples, see

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.250
what it's good for, and
also some idea of

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.240
where it comes from.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.870
And then go on to the
quotient rule,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.510
which is a little messier.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.110
OK.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.400
So let me just start by using
this in some examples.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.970
Right underneath, here.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.700
OK.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.500
So let me take, as a first
example, f of x equals x

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.470
squared and g of x equals x.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.210
So then what is p of x?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.950
It's x squared times x.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.420
I'm multiplying the functions.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.100
So I've got x cubed, and I want
to know its derivative.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.970
And I know the derivatives
of these guys.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.390
OK, so what does the
rule tell me?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.590
It tells me that the derivative
of p, dp dx--

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.200
so p is x cubed.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.640
So I'm looking for the
derivative of x cubed.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.210
And if you know that, it's OK.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.450
Let's just see it
come out here.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.860
So the derivative of x cubed,
by my formula there, is the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.080
first one, x squared, times the
derivative of the second,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.890
which is 1, plus the second one,
x, times the derivative

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.170
of the first, which is 2x.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.310
So what do we get?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.495
x squared, two more x
squared, 3x squared.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.810
The derivative of x cubed
is 3x squared.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.610
x cubed goes up faster than
x squared, and this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.910
is a steeper slope.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.740
Oh, let's do x to the fourth.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.650
So x to the fourth-- now I'll
take f to be x cubed, times x.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.310
Because x cubed, I just found.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.700
x, its derivative is 1, so I
can do the derivative of x

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.510
fourth the same way.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.780
It'll be f.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.700
So practicing that formula again
with x cubed and x, it's

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.360
x cubed times 1 plus this guy
times the derivative of f.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.450
Right?

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.790
I'm always going back
to that formula.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.830
So the derivative of f, x
cubed, we just found--

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.150
3x squared-- so I'll
put it in.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.670
And what do we have?

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.020
x cubed here, three more
x cubeds here.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.200
That's a total of 4x cubed.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.830
OK.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.170
We got another one.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.950
Big deal.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.450
What is important is--

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.930
and it's really what
math is about--

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.709
is the pattern, which we can
probably guess from those two

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.240
examples and the one we
already knew, that the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.540
derivative of x squared
was 2x.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.170
So everybody sees a 2 here and
a 3 here and a 4 here, coming

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.210
from 2, 3, and 4 there.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.200
And everybody also sees that
the power dropped by one.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.660
The derivative of x
squared was an x.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.990
The derivative of x cubed
involved an x squared.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.520
Well, let's express this
pattern in algebra.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.920
It's looking like the derivative
of x to the n--

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.710
we hope for any n.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.590
We've got it for n equals 2,
3, 4, probably 0 and 1.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.540
And if the pattern continues,
what do we think?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.160
This 4, this n shows up there,
and the power drops by 1.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:29.150
So that'll be x to the n minus
1, the same power minus 1, one

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.130
power below.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.160
So that's a highly important
formula.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.820
And actually it's important
to know it, not--

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.100
right now, well, we've done
two or three examples.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.280
I guess the right way for me
to get this for n equals--

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.640
so we really could check
1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.360
All the positive integers.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.800
We could complete the proof.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.650
We could establish
the pattern.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.880
Actually, induction would
be one way to do it.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.780
If we know it for, as we did
here, for n equals 3, then

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.920
we've got it for 4.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.170
If we know it for 4, the same
product formula would get it

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.060
for 5 and onwards, and would
give us that answer.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.310
Good.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.610
Even better is the fact that
this formula is also true if n

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.000
is a fraction.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.760
If we're doing the square root
of x, you recognize the square

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.940
root of x is x to the--

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.830
what's the exponent there
for square root?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.250
1/2.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.540
So I would like to
know for 1/2.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.390
OK, let me take a couple of
steps to get to that one.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.440
All right.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.280
The steps I'm going to take are
going to look just like

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:16.350
this, but this was powers of x,
and it'll be very handy if

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.010
I can do powers of f of x.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.130
I'd like to know--

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.380
I want to find--

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.620
So here's what I'm headed for.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:34.050
I'd like to know the derivative
of f of x to the

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.730
n-th power equals what?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.290
That's what I'd like to know.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.690
So let me do f of x.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.980
Let me do it just
as I did before.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.540
Take n equals 2,
f of x squared.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.210
So what's the derivative of
f of x squared, like sine

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.460
squared or whatever
we're squaring.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.030
Cosine squared.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:04.870
Well, for f of x squared, all
I'm doing is I'm taking f to

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.390
be the same as g.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.920
I'll use the product rule.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.790
If g and f are the same, then
I've got something squared.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.480
And my product rule says that
the derivative-- and I just

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.500
copy this rule.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.010
Now I'm taking p is going
to be f squared, right?

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.330
Can I just write f
squared equals--

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.950
so it's f times--

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.150
f is the same as g.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.890
Are you with me?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.950
I'm just using the rule in a
very special case when the two

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.350
functions are the same.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.320
The derivative of
f squared is f.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.320
What do I have? f times the
derivative of f, df dx.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.320
That's the first term.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.520
And then what's the
second term?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.600
Notice I wrote f instead of g,
because they're the same.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.440
And the second term is,
again, a copy of that.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.890
So I have 2 of these.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.210
Times 2, just the way
I had a 2 up there.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.960
This was the case
of x squared.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.710
This is the case of
f of x squared.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.400
Let me go one more
step to f cubed.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.020
What am I going to
do for f cubed?

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.160
The derivative of--

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.390
hold on.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.470
I have to show you what to
pay attention to here.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.470
To pay attention to is--

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.750
the 2 we're familiar with.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.360
This would have been the x,
that's not a big deal.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.680
But there's something new.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.660
A df dx factor is coming in.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.150
It's going to stay with us.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.740
Let me see it here.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.740
The derivative of
f of x cubed.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.350
Now let's practice
with this one.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.940
OK.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.850
So now what am I
going to take?

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.150
How do I get f of x cubed?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.970
Well, I've got f, so I'd better
take g to be f squared.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.400
Then when I multiply,
I've got cubed.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.490
So g is now going to be f
squared for this case.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.590
Can I take my product rule
with f times f squared?

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.190
My product rule of f times
f squared is--

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.380
I'm doing this now with g equals
f squared, just the way

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.090
I did it over there at
some point with one

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.830
of them as a square.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.080
OK.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.150
I'm near the end of
this calculation.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.790
OK.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.220
So what do I have. If this
thing is cubed, I

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.110
have f times f squared.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.860
That's f cubed.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.340
And I take its derivative
by the rule.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.510
So I take f times the derivative
of f squared, which

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:01.860
I just figured out
as 2f df dx.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.570
That's the f dg dx.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.950
And now I have g, which is
f squared, times df dx.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.950
What are you seeing there?

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.120
You're seeing--

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.480
well, again, these combine.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.760
That's what's nice about
this example.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.460
Here I have one f squared df dx,
and here I have two more.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.080
That's, all together, three.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:38.470
So the total was 3 times
f squared times df dx.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.530
And let me write down what
that pattern is saying.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.770
Here it will be n.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.090
Because here it was a 2.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.940
Here it's going to be
2 plus 1-- that's 3.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.450
And now if I have the n-th
power, I'm expecting an n

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:00.280
times the next lower power
of f, f to the n

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.760
minus 1, times what?

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.750
Times this guy that's hanging
around, df dx.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.540
That's my--

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.030
you could call that
the power rule.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.270
The derivative of a power.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.040
This would be the power rule
for just x to the n-th, and

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.490
this is the derivative of a
function of x to the n-th.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.100
There's something special
here that we're

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.890
going to see more of.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:42.170
This will be, also, an example
of what's coming as maybe the

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.860
most important rule,
the chain rule.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:50.120
And typical of it is that when
I take this derivative, I

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.160
follow that same pattern--

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.990
n, this thing, to one lower
power, but then the derivative

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.400
of what's inside.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.540
Can I use those words?

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.130
Because I'll use it again
for the chain rule.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.640
n times one lower
power, times the

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.260
derivative of what's inside.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.060
And why do I want to
do such a thing?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.450
Because I'd like to find out
the derivative of the

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.780
square root of x.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.730
OK.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.940
Can we do that?

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.050
I want to use this, now.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.370
So I want to use this to find
the derivative of the

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.700
square root of x.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.630
OK.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.260
So that will be my function.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.390
f of x will be the
square root of x.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.580
So this is a good example.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.980
That's x to the 1/2 power.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.100
What would I love
to have happen?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.970
I would like this formula to
continue with n equals 1/2,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.590
but no change in the formula.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.430
And that does happen.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.100
How can I do that?

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.360
OK, well, square root of
x is what I'm tackling.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.170
The easy thing would
be, if I square

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.690
that, I'll get x, right?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.780
The square of the square root.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.550
Well, square root
of x squared--

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.130
so there's f of x.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.720
I'm just going to use the fact
that the square root of x

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.130
squared is x.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.470
Such is mathematics.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:30.830
You can write down really
straightforward ideas, but it

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.310
had to come from somewhere.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.670
And now what am I going to do?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.650
I'm going to take
the derivative.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.840
Well, the derivative on
the right side is a 1.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.110
The derivative of x is 1.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.020
What is the derivative of
that left-hand side?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.750
Well, that fits my pattern.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.840
You see, here is my
f of x, squared.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.940
And I had a little
formula for the

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.990
derivative of f of x squared.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.620
So the derivative of this
is 2 times the thing

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.280
to one lower power--

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.820
square root of x just
to the first power--

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.260
times the derivative of what's
inside, if you allow me to use

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.210
those words.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.360
It's this, df dx.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.630
And that's of course what I
actually wanted, the square

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.880
root of x, dx.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.310
This lecture is not going
to have too many more

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.230
calculations, but this
is a good one to see.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.120
That's clear.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.990
I take the derivative
of both sides.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.040
That's clear.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.860
This is the 2 square
root of x.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.780
And now I've got what I want,
as soon as I move these over

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.720
to the other side.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.710
So I divide by that.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.270
Can I now just do that with an
eraser, or maybe just X it

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.130
out, and put it here.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.920
1 over 2 square root of x.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.410
Am I seeing what I want
for the derivative of

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.560
square root of x?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.910
I hope so.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.720
I'm certainly seeing the 1/2.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.490
So the 1/2--

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.290
that's the n.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.980
It's supposed to show up here.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.380
And then what do I
look for here?

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.770
One lower power than 1/2,
which will be x

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.050
to the minus 1/2.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.290
And is that what I have?

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.520
Yes.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.970
You see the 1/2.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.820
And that square root of x,
that's x to the 1/2, but it's

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.410
down in the denominator.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.030
And things in the
denominator--

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:35.150
the exponent for those,
there's a minus sign.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.620
We'll come back to that.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.490
That's a crucial fact, going
back to algebra.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.970
But, you know, calculus is
now using all that--

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.230
I won't say stuff.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.710
All those good things
that we learned in

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.410
algebra, like exponents.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.980
So that was a good example.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.670
OK.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.560
So my pattern held
for n equals 1/2.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:15.710
And maybe I'll just say that
it also would hold for cube

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:23.660
roots, and any root,
and other powers.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.089
In other words, I get
this formula.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:31.610
This is the handy formula that
we're trying to get.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:38.150
We got it very directly for
positive whole numbers.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:44.250
Now I'm getting it for
n equals 1 over any--

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.510
now I'm getting it for capital
Nth roots, like 1/2.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.910
Then I could go on
to get it for--

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.630
I could take then the n-th
power of the n-th root.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.540
I could even stretch this
to get up to m over n.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.510
Any fraction, I can get to.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:15.080
But I can't get to negative
exponents yet, because those

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.380
are divisions.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.060
Negative exponent is a division,
and I'm going to

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.820
need the quotient rule,
which is right

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.840
now still a big blank.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.560
OK.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.360
Pause for a moment.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.120
We've used the product rule.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.720
I haven't explained
it, though.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.640
Let me, so, explain
the product rule.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.720
Where did it come from?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.080
I'm going back before the
examples, and before that

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.140
board full of chalk, back to
that formula and just think,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.300
where did it come from?

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.560
How did we find the derivative
of f times g,

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.740
of the product p?

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.600
So we needed delta p, right?

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.940
And then I'm going to
divide by delta x.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.340
OK.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.140
So let me try to make--

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.760
what's the delta p when p is--

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.955
remember, p is f times g.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.730
Thinking about f times g, maybe
let's make it visual.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.200
Let's make it like a rectangle,
where this side is

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.880
f of x and this side
is g of x.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.740
Then this area is f
times g, right?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.420
The area of a rectangle.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.460
And that's our p.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.580
OK, that's sitting there at x.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.760
Now move it a little.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.290
Move x a little bit.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:52.930
Move x a little and figure out,
how much does p change?

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.700
That's our goal.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.280
We need the change in p.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.925
If I move x by a little bit,
then f changes a little, by a

00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:05.650
little amount, delta f, right?

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:11.100
And g changes a little, by
a little amount, delta g.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.860
You remember those deltas?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.380
So it's the change in f.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.070
There's a delta x in here.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.490
x is the starting point.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.520
It's the thing we
move a little.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:32.700
When we move x a little, by
delta x, f will move a little,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.000
g will move a little, and their

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.640
product will move a little.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.300
And now, can you see, in the
picture, where is the product?

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.130
Well, this is where
f moved to.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.550
This is where g moved to.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:51.840
The product is this,
that bigger area.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.540
So where is delta p?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.120
Where is the change between
the bigger area and the

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.900
smaller area?

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.100
It's this.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.630
I have to figure out, what's
that new area?

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.240
The delta p is in here.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.460
OK, can you see what
that area--

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.330
well, look, here's
the way to do it.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.540
Cut it up into little
three pieces.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.460
Because now they're little
rectangles, and we know the

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.942
area of rectangles.

00:21:20.942 --> 00:21:22.050
Right?

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.760
So help me out here.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.850
What is the area of
that rectangle?

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:33.120
Well, its base is f, and
its height is delta g.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.055
So that is f times delta g.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.150
What about this one?

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:46.140
That has height g and
base delta f.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.080
So here I'm seeing a g times
delta f, for that area.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:02.400
And what about this little
corner piece?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.210
Well, its height is just delta
g, its width is delta f.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.970
This is delta g times delta f.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.290
And it's going to disappear.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.580
This is like a perfect place
to recognize that an

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.300
expression--

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.570
that's sort of like
second order.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.240
Let me use words without
trying to

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.460
pin them down perfectly.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.410
Here is a zero-order, an
f, a real number, times

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.530
a small delta g.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.740
So that's first order.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.370
That's going to show up--

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.620
you'll see it disappear.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.890
These three pieces, remember,
were the delta p.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.490
So what have I got here?

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.890
I've got this piece, f delta
g, and I'm always

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.970
dividing by delta x.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.640
And then I have this piece,
which is the g times the delta

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.530
f, and I divide by
the delta x.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.330
And then this piece that I'm
claiming I don't have to worry

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.400
much about, because I divide
that by delta x.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.580
So that was the third piece.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.830
This is it, now.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:30.770
The picture has led to the
algebra, the formula for delta

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:36.090
p, the change in the product
divided by delta x.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.030
That's what calculus says--

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.760
OK, look at that, and then
take the tricky step, the

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.740
calculus step, which is let
delta x get smaller and

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.680
smaller and smaller,
approaching 0.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.320
So what do those three terms
do as delta x gets smaller?

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.980
Well, all the deltas
get smaller.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:08.430
So what happens to this term
as delta x goes to 0?

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:13.920
As the change in x is just
tiny, tiny, tiny?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:19.970
That term is the one that gives
the delta g over delta

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:25.510
x, in the limit when delta x
goes to 0, is that one, right?

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:31.730
And this guy is giving my g.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.020
That ratio is familiar, df dx.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:40.370
You see, the cool thing about
splitting it into these pieces

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.090
was that we got this piece
by itself, which was

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.370
just the f delta g.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.425
And we know what that does.

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:50.130
It goes here.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.930
And this piece--

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.190
we know what that does.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.600
And now, what about
this dumb piece?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.890
Well, as delta x goes
to 0, this would go

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:05.310
to df dx, all right.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.780
But what would delta g do?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.350
It'll go to 0.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.190
You see, we have two little
things divided by only one

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.760
little thing.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:18.780
This ratio is sensible, it gives
df dx, but this ratio is

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.980
going to 0.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.060
So forget it.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.650
And now the two pieces that we
have are the two pieces of the

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.150
product rule.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:30.590
OK.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:38.520
Product rule sort of visually
makes sense.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.670
OK.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.960
I'm ready to go to the
quotient rule.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.690
OK, so how am I going to deal,
now, with a ratio of

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.310
f divided by g?

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:51.140
OK.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.330
Let's put that on
a fourth board.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:26:01.910
How to deal then with the
ratio of f over g.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:08.230
Well, what I know is the
product rule, right?

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:14.290
So let me multiply both sides
by g of x and get a product.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.160
There, that looks better.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.950
Of course the part that I don't
know is in here, but

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.450
just fire away.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.935
Take the derivative
of both sides.

00:26:27.935 --> 00:26:29.060
OK.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.810
The derivative of the left
side is df dx, of course.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.990
Now I can use the
product rule.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.730
It's g of x, dq dx.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.950
That's the very, very
thing I'm wanting.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:43.590
dq dx--

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.860
that's my big empty space.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.770
That's going to be the
quotient rule.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:56.730
And then the second one
is q of x times dg dx.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.040
That's the product rule
applied to this.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.360
Now I have it.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.060
I've got dq dx.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.440
Well, I've got to get
it by itself.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.010
I want to get dq dx by itself.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.200
So I'm going to move this
part over there.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.840
Let me, even, multiply
both sides--

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.980
this q, of course, I recognize
as f times g.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.080
This is f of x times g of x.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.350
That's what q was.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:32.362
Now I'm going to--

00:27:32.362 --> 00:27:35.360
oh, was not.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.500
It was f of x over g of x.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.750
Good Lord.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.900
You would never have allowed
me to go on.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.420
OK.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.270
Good.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.920
This is came from the product
rule, and now my final job is

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:55.610
just to isolate dq dx and
see what I've got.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:59.820
What I'll have will be
the quotient rule.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.460
One good way is if I multiply
both sides by g.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:11.410
So I multiply everything by
g, so here's a g, df dx.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.890
And now this guy I'm going to
bring over to the other side.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.870
When I multiply that by g, that
just knocks that out.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.620
When I bring it over,
it comes over with a

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.480
minus sign, f dg dx.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.040
And this one got multiplied by
g, so right now I'm looking at

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.830
g squared, dq dx.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.080
The guy I want.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.850
Again, just algebra.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.170
Moving stuff from one
side to the other

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.940
produced the minus sign.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.310
Multiplying by g, you
see what happened.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.420
So what do I now finally do?

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.380
I'm ready to write
this formula in.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.380
I've got it there.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.690
I've got dq dx, just
as soon as I divide

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.410
both sides by g squared.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.470
So let me write that
left-hand side.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:23.910
g df dx minus f dg dx, and I
have to divide everything--

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.240
this g squared has got
to come down here.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.060
It's a little bit messier
formula but

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.540
you get used to it.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.790
g squared.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.380
That's the quotient rule.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.750
Can I say it in words?

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.390
Because I actually say
those words to myself

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:46.680
every time I use it.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.790
So here are the words I say,
because that's a kind of

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.060
messy-looking expression.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.270
But if you just think
about words--

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.280
so for me, remember we're
dealing with f over g. f is

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.170
the top, g at the bottom.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.830
So I say to myself, the bottom
times the derivative of the

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:10.160
top minus the top times the
derivative of the bottom,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.630
divided by the bottom squared.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.910
That wasn't brilliant,
but anyway, I

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.900
remember it that way.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.730
OK.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:25.645
so now, finally, I'm ready to go
further with this pattern.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.010
I still like that pattern.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.330
We've got the quotient rule, so
the two rules are now set,

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.810
and I want to do one last
example before stopping.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:44.550
And that example is going to
be a quotient, of course.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:52.330
And it might as well be
a negative power of x.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.650
So now my example--

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.460
last example for today--

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.690
my quotient is going to be 1.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:09.380
The f of x will be 1 and the
g of x-- so this is my f.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.360
This is my g.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.220
I have a ratio of two things.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:21.285
And as I've said, this
is x to the minus n.

00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:23.570
Right?

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.650
That's what we mean.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.800
We can think again
about exponents.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:37.520
A negative exponent becomes
positive when it's in the

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.930
denominator.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:43.880
And we want it in the
denominator so we can use this

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.820
crazy quotient rule.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.280
All right.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.120
So let me think through
the quotient rule.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:58.580
So the derivative of this ratio,
which is x to the minus

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.750
n That's the q, is 1
over x to the n.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.260
The derivative is--

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.800
OK, ready for the
quotient rule?

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.950
Bottom times the derivative
of the top--

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.350
ah, but the top's just
a constant, so its

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.350
derivative is 0--

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.390
minus--

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:21.210
remembering that minus-- the
top times the derivative of

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.460
the bottom.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:24.445
Ha.

00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:27.190
Now we have a chance to use our

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.550
pattern with a plus exponent.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:36.620
The derivative of the bottom
is nx to the n minus 1.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.230
So it's two terms, again,
but with a minus sign.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.830
And then the other thing I must
remember is, divide by g

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:51.520
squared, x to the
n twice squared.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.790
OK.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.730
That's it.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.440
Of course, I'm going
to simplify it,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.430
and then I'm done.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.280
So this is 0.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.680
Gone.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.170
This is minus n, which I like.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.690
I like to see minus
n come down.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.620
That's my pattern, that this
exponent should come down.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.450
Minus n, and then I want
to see-- oh, what

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.480
else do I have here?

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.050
What's the power of x?

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.440
Well, here I have an
x to the n-th.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.930
And here I have, twice, so can
I cancel this one and just

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.540
keep this one?

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.930
So I still have an
x to the minus 1.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.530
I don't let him go.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.430
Actually the pattern's here.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:43.980
The answer is minus n minus
capital N, which was the

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:49.700
exponent, times x to
one smaller power.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.690
This is x to the minus n, and
then there's another x

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.060
to the minus 1.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:34:01.770
The final result was that the
derivative is minus nx to the

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.950
minus n, minus 1.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:11.360
And that's the good pattern
that matches here.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.460
When little n matches minus
big N, that pattern is the

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.199
same as that.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:24.860
So we now have the derivatives
of powers of x as an example

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.830
from the quotient rule
and the product rule.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.407
Well, I just have to
say one thing.

00:34:30.407 --> 00:34:31.920
We haven't got--

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:38.820
We've fractions, we've got
negative numbers, but we don't

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.469
have a whole lot of other
numbers, like pi.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.989
We don't know what is,
for example, the

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:49.110
derivative of x to the pi.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.150
Because pi isn't--

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.909
pi is positive, so we're OK in
the product rule, but it's not

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.820
a fraction and we haven't
got it yet.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.400
What do you think it is?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.490
You're right--

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:09.520
it is pi x to the pi minus 1.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.340
Well, actually I never met x
to the pi in my life, until

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:21.340
just there, but I've certainly
met all kinds of powers of x

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.310
and this is just one
more example.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.350
OK.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:26.600
So that's quotient rule--

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:36.270
first came product rule, power
rule, and then quotient rule,

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.770
leading to this calculation.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.200
Now, the quotient rule I can
use for other things, like

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.330
sine x over cosine x.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.400
We're far along, and one
more big rule will

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.440
be the chain rule.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.770
OK, that's for another time.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.976
Thank you.

00:35:55.976 --> 00:35:56.410
