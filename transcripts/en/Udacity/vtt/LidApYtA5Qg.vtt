00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.730
Alright, so I want to make a pie chart showing the distribution of musical

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.590
genres, so I made a new report on bands, and I added this genre column.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.610
&gt;&gt; I'm going to have to make it a summary.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.240
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt; And I want to group by genre, right? Oh, okay, I didn't mean to do that.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.700
&gt;&gt; It's okay.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.130
&gt;&gt; It's okay. And you will probably want to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.180
show, I'm mean if this were a real report.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.985
Other fields about the bands that are playing. I would assume.

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:28.825
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.860
&gt;&gt; So drag a few of those guys in there too.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.078
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to add my chart. going to make

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:37.720
it a pie chart. Values will be record count.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yep

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.720
&gt;&gt; The wedges will be genre.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.884
&gt;&gt; Just knows.

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:41.620
&gt;&gt; This is really good.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, and then they will hover and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.390
you said you wanted to show percentages, right?

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.280
Very cool. And then I'm just going to run the report, or save

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.370
it first to run the report and then add it to my dashboard.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.020
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.220
&gt;&gt; And Sam, I'm sorry, but it looks like we're only going

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.140
to have 6% of the bands at our festival will be Bossa Nova.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.446
&gt;&gt; That sounds about right.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:04.571
[LAUGH]

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.440
&gt;&gt; 30% rock, 20% electronic quite a bit

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.370
of reggae and even 14% salsa. Pretty cool.
