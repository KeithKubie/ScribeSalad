[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.640
JULIAN SAYARER: Thanks
very much, guys.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.280
Thanks very much for
the introduction.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.220
Yeah, so I'm coming from a
background in political science

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.960
but at a young age
really started cycling.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.540
Essentially, I grew up
in the Midlands of the UK

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.790
in a quite sort of
post-industrial, slightly

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.410
depressed town with
not a lot going on.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.260
I had my bicycle
and loved the way

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.780
that it could take
me out of that town.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.259
After university, I
cycled to Istanbul

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:36.800
and fell in love
with the fact that I

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.270
could cross a
continent in a month

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.640
with only my legs
and my bicycle.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
And in Istanbul, I discovered
that the world record

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.710
for a circumnavigation
by bicycle

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.390
was being broken
in this very kind

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.705
of corporate-backed attempt that
was sort of at odds with all

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:55.557
that I'd found travel
by bicycle to be.

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:57.140
And so I set out to
break that record.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.690
And this sort of
led me to the genre,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.250
if you like, of politics
at roadsides, basically.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.060
And as John says, the book
that I'm talking about today

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.330
is "Interstate," from the
United States, which is actually

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.370
more of a hitchhiking book.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.590
There are some kind
of correlations

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.980
or contrasts between travel by
bike and hitchhiking in the US,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.300
which I'll come on to.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.970
And having cycled 6,000
miles across the US

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.640
and then hitchhiked
maybe 4,000 miles,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.660
it's kind of different
perspectives on that country,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.040
and that you find,
again, at the roadsides.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.020
And the title of
"Interstate" was

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.040
kind of no coincidence
in that respect.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.560
Starting out, then, at
the beginning of the trip,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190
which began in New York
City, as we can see.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.250
An image we're all
pretty familiar with.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.190
And I'd gone there to work
on a documentary project,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.860
but that year failed
to materialize.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.530
And interestingly enough,
that was taking a boat

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.730
down the Hudson River from
the Adirondack Mountains

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.500
to Manhattan.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.030
The boat was made from
rubbish that was found

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.170
on the streets of the city.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.390
And the idea was to
take it to the source

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.150
of the river in nature and
return to the metropolis.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.460
And so that's another kind
of interesting element

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.740
that came into my
relationship with the US

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.320
and with New York State.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960
And that diversity that
you see in the population,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.980
as soon as you leave the hubs
of airport terminal to airport

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.080
terminal, or office
to office, when

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.080
you go through the space
between those places,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.600
whether that's on the road, or
wherever that's off the road,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.840
or at the roadside hitchhiking,
or along the river, that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.690
doesn't have the
same-- the geographies

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.690
that don't have the same kind
of regard for place as the very

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.940
charted existences that
we as humans often lead

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.930
in our ways of going between
countries, around the country,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800
and between cities.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.530
The book begins in New York.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.210
And actually, oddly enough,
with today being local elections

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.410
in London, I was out canvassing
with a friend for the de Blasio

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.260
campaign, Bill de
Blasio, who I think

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.420
got elected in 2013 with
a majority of about 70%

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.760
on a very low voter turnout.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.460
And in some ways, that kind of
frames the start of the book,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.510
because you see this kind of
metropolitan elite, or elite,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.740
question mark.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.480
And this bubble
existence of Brooklyn

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.714
with the sourdough bread
and the spinach and salmon

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:26.130
and the coffee and all of the
things that we know and love

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.430
and like.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.730
Electing this apparently
progressive politician

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.760
in the same way that London
would have elected Sadiq Kahn,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.410
or we see the rising
popularity of Jeremy Corbyn.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.040
And you see this optimism for
the future and progressive

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.610
ideals.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.120
And then crossing over the
Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.180
and then the George Washington
Bridge out of Manhattan

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.460
into New Jersey--

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.020
I don't mean-- hopefully there's
no one from New Jersey here,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.380
but I don't want to do
that thing of presenting

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.609
New Jersey as the
frontiers of the badlands.

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.650
I really like New Jersey.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.860
Some of my best friends
are from New Jersey--

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.660
and taking their
shot on the way out.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.430
And then you land
on the other side

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.570
into this less controlled
existence where you're not sure

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.890
exactly where you're going
and what's happening next.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.970
Hitchhiking-- the sign,
as you can imagine,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.620
is quite important when
you're hitchhiking.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.350
I headed towards Ohio,
and my first destination

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.130
that I had vaguely
in mind was Columbus.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.140
So for that, I needed to
go through New Jersey,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.530
Pennsylvania.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.070
Discovered-- at
the time, I didn't

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.350
know that Pennsylvania
was called the wide state,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.210
but it certainly made
sense after a while.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.420
And I ended up cheating a
little bit on the hitchhiking.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.670
That was the only time.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.230
And I got a Greyhound for
a couple of hundred miles

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.720
to get to Columbus
just to get me moving.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.350
The sign and the
nature of standing

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.670
at the roadsides in the US is
kind of a particular thing.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.400
I think the first
sign that I had

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.260
and I held up just said "west."

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.740
The project in the
US, in New York,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.115
had fallen through
for that year.

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:12.980
So I was there in New
York with no real plans,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.440
having rented out
my room in Dalston.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.870
And so thinking, well, I
should really go to California

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.990
and hitchhike there.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.380
And it seemed like a
sensible enough thing to do.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.890
And I started with my
very enigmatic, evocative

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.610
"west" sign and then realized
that nobody was picking me up.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.170
So then I started adding
more words to it, like Ohio,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.720
then please.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.310
And suddenly you realize that
your very simple looking sign

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.590
that you really want to
catch the driver's attention

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.810
is suddenly looking
quite cluttered.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.660
So you get a new bit of
cardboard and you start again.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.250
And it's kind of an
iteration of that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.160
again and again until you find
something that seems to work.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.440
I remember this sign with Ohio.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.480
A guy who picked me
up and gave me a ride

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.831
said, well, you
were going to Ohio,

00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:57.080
and I'm going there next week.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.677
So I thought I'd pick you up.

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.260
And then after that
I thought, OK, I'm

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.720
always going to put
a place name on it.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.339
And it was interesting
that in the United States,

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:06.880
you have so many
people just standing

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.724
at roadsides just moving.

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:12.140
And you have so many people
in the-- it's a very migratory

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.400
culture, I think, the States.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.950
There's a strong kind
of notion of traveling

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.380
within your country,
seeing your country.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.640
And there are a lot of
people at those roadsides.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.430
I think were they
in Europe possibly

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.714
wouldn't have fallen so far
out of the bottom of society.

00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:31.130
Some of them, I think, might
be getting professional help.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.770
I spoke to a guy in
New Mexico who was--

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.920
he'd lost the front of his teeth
to presumably class-A drugs

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.260
and smoking them.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.916
And he told me that he'd just
buried his mother in Texas,

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.790
and this was all within
the first two minutes

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.540
of meeting him.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.041
And so you kind of
get to understand

00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.290
why people are driving
straight by you at the roadside

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.860
and not picking you up.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.810
So actually, writing a
destination on your sign

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.720
came to feel like a
statement of intention

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.670
and a statement of purpose.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.980
And I found that it
got me more lifts.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.270
There was also things about how
I would stand at the roadside.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.890
Sometimes you'd
just sort of lazily

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.560
be there like that
with your thumb out,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.671
and then realize you're
not getting any lifts.

00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.920
So you think, maybe I should
put more effort into this

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.210
and be a bit more upright.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.752
Sometimes I'd kind of be zipped
right up because it was cold.

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:18.251
And then I thought,
well, maybe that

00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:20.105
looks a little bit
robotic and inhuman,

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:23.090
so you unzip and
relax a little bit.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.610
And again, with these hours
and hours at the roadside,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.760
you're just slowly trying
to figure out, actually,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.990
what is going to work?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.610
What is going to get
one of these cars

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.030
to stop and pick me up?

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.210
And when you're
actually in the car,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.790
it's an interesting experience.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.380
Has anyone hitchhiked
here before?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.880
Oh, cool.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.700
That's a really
great percentage.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.560
Normally, when I
do a talk about it,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.048
it's probably about one
or two hands at most.

00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:55.318
AUDIENCE: I've hitchhiked
out of Desperation

00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:56.516
It wasn't intention.

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:57.390
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:00.430
AUDIENCE: But if could have--

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.596
JULIAN SAYARER: Did it work?

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:02.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.080
In Texas.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.710
JULIAN SAYARER: Oh, Texas is
a great place to hitchhike,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.360
but Texas isn't necessarily the
best place to try and cycle.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.910
Because every time you stop at
the roadside with your map--

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.951
in the days when they're
actually made of paper--

00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:14.245
and someone pulls in
with a pickup saying,

00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.120
we can put your bike in
the back if you like.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.260
No, I'm doing it for fun.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.280
And then, you're sure?

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.392
So yeah.

00:08:23.392 --> 00:08:26.140
But yeah, the
experience of it, where

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.590
you're kind of strangers,
complete strangers,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.280
and then placed into this
automobile confessional booth

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.289
almost, because you've
got to keep one another's

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.200
company for whatever
amount of time you will.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.720
And that's a finite
amount of time.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.045
And you don't know the
person, but at the same time,

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:44.420
you need to talk
about something.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.500
And so the tendency is to
talk about the things that

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.170
actually matter.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.046
You talk about, well,
why are you doing this?

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:52.586
And it's like, well, there's a
project that's fallen through,

00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:54.170
and I thought I'd
go to California.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.180
Where are you driving?

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.060
Well, I'm driving
home to visit my kids.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.290
Me and the wife separated.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.570
Or I'm driving home from work.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.650
I don't much like it.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.500
So in this sort of
automotive 21st century

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.280
environment of the car, or 20th
century, I'd say, motor car,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.270
you end up talking quite
quickly about the things that

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.180
actually matter.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.170
And in a world where
increasingly communication

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.596
pathways and the
objects, the people

00:09:19.596 --> 00:09:21.220
that we are actually
communicating with

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.390
are ever more controlled.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.410
And perhaps we
become ever more wary

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.160
of leaving those
controlled pathways.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.480
The random encounter
of "I've got the trust

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.300
to be standing at a roadside
and requesting a lift,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.955
and you've got the random
trust to pull in and say,

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:39.250
here, I'm going to
give you one" gives you

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.330
that sort of connection
just for a short time.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.920
And it kind of--

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.864
yeah, it kind of brings
out a certain bond

00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:49.030
between people who actually
might be very different.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.680
They might be Republican voters.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.560
They might be Democrat voters.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.920
They might be immigrants.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.940
They might identify as being
settlers from the first Scots

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.140
that went over to the US.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.180
But they've all got
the idea to pick up

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.980
this stranger at the roadside.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.310
And this is an older
photo, actually,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.910
and goes back to the
point I touched on earlier

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.730
of the differences between
cycling and hitchhiking

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.160
in the United States.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.450
This guy is Super
Dave, as he went known.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.280
This is from 2009
when I was cycling

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.360
the West Coast of California.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.000
And he had two trailers here.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.150
He had a dog that
ran along with him.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.790
He had a story, as everyone
traveling the US has a story.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.640
His destination on the
roadside was basically

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.610
to get down to Santa Barbara.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.820
He was from Washington.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.340
And Washington State, of
course, has a very cold winter.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.710
So he was moving
south to get warm

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.300
for winter, which is a fairly
timeless and distressingly

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.880
common migration within the US.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.870
I met another guy
on that same trip

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.620
who was from Montana,
which is, of course,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.200
also bitterly cold winters.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.670
And he was cycling down
into New Mexico for winter

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.750
just to stay warm.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.980
So again, you have
this hard reality

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.630
of life for tens or hundreds of
thousands or millions of people

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.760
in the richest
country in the world.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.920
But nevertheless,
at all times kind

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.970
of connected to this
eternally optimistic spirit.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.920
These guys living by bicycle.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.170
I remember Mike, the
guy from Montana,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.744
telling me that he was
all right on the bike,

00:11:36.744 --> 00:11:38.410
because he could see
the stars at night.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.035
And if he could see
the stars at night,

00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:43.360
he knew that Jesus was
watching out for him.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.030
And that same sort of good
feeling that the guys on bikes

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.410
have out there seems to
get reflected back at it

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.670
by the US population.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.630
And the amount of
money, for example,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.570
that I was given, having
never once asked for it,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.710
while cycling across the
US was unfathomable to me.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.830
I'd had bicycle repairs
that needed doing

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.680
and strangers fronting
up $100 because they

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.820
wanted to pay for them.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.530
I had a family from
South Carolina who

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.610
took me in and paid for
another set of repairs

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.280
and wanted to set me off with
$100 to put me on my way.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.130
I rode 300 miles
in one long stretch

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.480
to get to New York
in time for a friend,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.270
and crossing into Delaware had
a woman wind down the car window

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.360
and say, you're doing
something amazing here,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.479
and just pass out $10 for me.

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.020
Well, I think I am,
but how did you--

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.400
[LAUGHS]

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.520
And the contrast between
that and hitchhiking

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.010
was actually really
difficult. Because I'd

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.950
gone there in the past
and had this sense

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.000
of being kind of welcomed and
supported at the roadside.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.910
I think something about
the bicycle appeals

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.974
to that US spirit
of bootstrapping.

00:12:59.974 --> 00:13:01.140
They assume you're homeless.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.723
It doesn't matter
that your bicycle is

00:13:02.723 --> 00:13:07.920
made in a artisan bike factory
in the south of Germany,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.320
or that your pannier bags
and your Brooks saddle

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.320
were made by craftsmen
in the Midlands

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.450
or elsewhere in Germany,
and it's collectively

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.710
worth a thousand or so pounds.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.210
There's an assumption
that if you're

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.626
traveling the
States on a bicycle,

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:20.790
you're a homeless person.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.970
But they think you're a
really good homeless person.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.501
You're actually trying.

00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:27.000
And it's kind of
ironic, because one

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.708
of the things I love
about travel by bike

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.940
is you're really independent.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.850
It's a machine that keeps going.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.847
It's rare that it would
have a mechanical that

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:36.930
would stop you from going.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.513
And even if it was
a minor mechanical,

00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:39.780
you can generally keep going.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.820
So you can be independent.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.250
Whereas when you're
actually standing

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.800
at the roadside waiting
for a ride, needing a ride,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.500
you are entirely
reliant and dependent

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.300
upon the people passing you.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.940
And whereas I'd had the ability
to keep going on a bicycle

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.860
myself, and nevertheless been
met with all of this help,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.900
as a hitchhiker stuck in
the middle of a desert

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.270
waiting for someone
to pick you up

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.920
and being met with this
constant mistrust and fear,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.630
it was a kind of war of
attrition a little bit.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.770
And the determination required
to sort of not be worn down

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.335
by this constant
rejection that's going on

00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:18.210
was actually one of the
most difficult things

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.410
about the journey.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.340
I kind of will definitely cut
some slack to the US population

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.180
and the driver
population of the US.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.800
I mean, Hunter S.
Thompson called

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.020
the US the kingdom of fear.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.250
And much as I think there's an
awful lot of unjustified fear

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.740
in American society, American
popular culture, American news

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.400
stroke entertainment,
I do think, as I say,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.220
there are a lot of
people on the interstates

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.910
and highways of the US who in
Europe would be either getting

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.890
professional help
or would simply not

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.350
be there because
migrating south for winter

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.890
is something that doesn't really
belong in the 21st century

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.900
wealthy nations.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.530
But I sympathize with
the American population,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.040
because yeah, it's a
hard place out there.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:12.420
The interstate is in itself
its own kind of place.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.000
This was just a
photo that I found

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.840
while I was pulling out the
other ones, but this was to--

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.970
in America they say--
air up your tires, which

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.380
was an interesting phrasology.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.060
The first time I
asked on the bicycle,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.220
can I pump up my tires,
and the guy said, you

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.780
want to air up your tires?

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.000
Yeah, that makes sense as well.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.770
But yeah, putting
a dollar into it

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.630
to help feed children
elsewhere in the States.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:43.770
And then these kind of thousands
of miles of empty highways.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.380
And as I say, it's kind of a
culture all of its own, really.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.784
With the highways, the
truck stops, and again,

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:55.950
the space in between, and
not a whole lot happening.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.040
Because people are going
between rest areas.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.820
And you just see these desert
stretches in the meantime.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.720
And with truck drivers
who are counting

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.592
not in miles but in
hours, because they

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:10.800
say that if they were counting
miles, they'd go crazy

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.640
and they'd never get anywhere.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.300
And I think of that as the
interstate is a little bit

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.040
like a monocrop in some ways.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.930
In the way that we
mass agriculture,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.690
you have a field where
they're growing the crop

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.580
and nothing else
grows within it,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.960
because it's all about the crop.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.493
Likewise on the interstates--
it's a car saturated culture.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:36.600
And where it's sort of not
many signs of human life.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.720
And especially as a
hitchhiker and occasionally

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.750
as a pedestrian walking
down the highways,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.870
you really feel that
sense of deviance.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.780
I would have been
picked off the highways

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.450
many times by state
troopers saying

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.880
that it's illegal to hitchhike
in the United States.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.510
And other variants
of that, saying it's

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.430
illegal to hitchhike
in this state.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.745
And variants again, saying
you can't hitchhike here,

00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:03.120
but if you cross
the county line,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.494
then you can
hitchhike all right.

00:17:04.494 --> 00:17:06.819
It's not my turf.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:12.119
So that kind of process
always interrupting you.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.349
And "Interstate" won-- it
won an award for travel

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.869
book of the year last year.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:22.240
I gave half of the
prize money to the ACLU.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.319
A time when the Muslim ban
was just coming in in the US,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:30.564
but largely, more than
anything, because the book was--

00:17:30.564 --> 00:17:31.980
I was very conscious
in the number

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.310
of times I was pulled off of
highways by state troopers

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.080
or cops.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.670
Although the
experience of it was

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.610
very aggressive,
was very forthright,

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.460
I'd be standing there,
and a car would pull in.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.900
I'd sort of roll my eyes knowing
what was about to happen.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.844
And then you'd get the
microphone on the roof,

00:17:48.844 --> 00:17:50.760
the loudspeaker on the
roof would shriek at me

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.890
to go over to the crash barrier.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.130
So I'd go lazily over
to the crash barrier

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.580
and lean on the crash barrier
and start unhooking my bag

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.190
straps from my shoulders.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.540
And then it shrieks again,
like, don't move, stay there,

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.520
leave your pack on,
at which point, OK.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.640
And then he comes out
and comes up to me

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.530
and asks if I'm armed,
which as a European,

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.113
it's an absolutely
crazy question ever

00:18:14.113 --> 00:18:16.120
to be asked anyway.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.350
And then he pats me down.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:24.260
And we've seen-- we've all now
seen many images of black men,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.690
generally men-- black
men and black people

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.600
shot dead by state troopers in
situations that I can really

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.400
relate to having been in.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.770
And actually, my situation
being that bit more deviant--

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.830
I wasn't even sat at
the wheel of my own car.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.500
But there's this
sense of the armor

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.210
of white skin, the
lack of prejudice that

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.500
came from law enforcement.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.610
Although they were suspicious
of what I was doing,

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.960
they were, none the less,
willing to tolerate it.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.510
Some of them even giving me a
lift to the edge of the county

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.700
line and taking me along
a little bit on my way.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.670
And by the time I
got out of the car,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.530
us having some kind
of conversation

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.510
and forming a bit
of a relationship.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.650
And similarly, although
hitchhiking in the States

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.050
was often a case
of counting cars,

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.300
and sometimes you'd count 10,
and you'd get really lucky,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.750
and you'd get another
ride after 10.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.110
Sometimes you'd still
be counting after 200.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.140
But I have no doubt whatsoever
that those numbers would

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.510
be a lot higher, especially in
certain parts of the country,

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.590
were I not white.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.720
So there's an interesting
sort of intersection with race

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.770
at the roadsides in that way.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.740
And the truck stop
is another kind

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.680
of insight on the US in itself.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.140
And I spent a lot of my time
in truckstops going round

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.327
the rigs that were parked in.

00:19:47.327 --> 00:19:49.160
Occasionally taking a
break and sitting down

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.960
and get myself a
coffee in the canteen.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.060
And these places are generally
always known in the US

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.630
as a food desert, which
is a concept that I think

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.220
might be coming
to parts of Europe

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.440
as well, which
isn't a great thing.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.309
But places where there
is no fresh produce,

00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:04.100
there's no fresh
vegetables, and everything

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.410
that you can buy
to eat is packaged,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.640
is made from refined flour or
refined sugar, which slowly

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.490
has a sort of gently
debilitating effect

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.490
on your sense of will
to go on, I think,

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.720
when you can't look forward to
your next meal at any point.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.370
The other thing
about the truckstops

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.070
was how martial the culture was.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.660
I remember being conscious
of this very military edge

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.350
to the stenciled
images that drivers

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.879
would put on their cabs.

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:36.920
I remember going down the
highway and one of them

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.960
next to me with a silhouetted
man with a rifle kneeling over

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.920
a fallen comrade.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.740
And it says, we will
honor their sacrifice.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.530
I remember walking into a shop,
and there's a big American flag

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.130
on the side of it
in a truck stop,

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.220
and saying, the
American flag does not

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.380
flutter with the wind but
the last breaths of all

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.311
who died for it.

00:20:58.311 --> 00:20:59.810
Which is a really
intense thing when

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.380
you're just looking for some
orange juice or something.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.890
But you kind of see this
massive sentimentality

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:13.190
and emotional investment placed
into the area of the truckstop.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.424
Because you have guys
here that are driving,

00:21:16.424 --> 00:21:18.590
well, as the adverts on the
back of some of the rigs

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.450
will attest, for a cent a mile.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.000
Which is evidence, I think,
of both how crazily enormous

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.310
the US is but also
how incredibly poorly

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.270
paid truck drivers are.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.170
I remember as well the truck
stop shops often had toys in,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.470
which is unusual for this
population of slightly

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.060
surly adult men.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.540
But they are, of course, often,
if not always, absent fathers.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.010
Sometimes you'll see a
trucker with his dog.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.380
Sometimes a trucker with
his dog and his wife.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.870
Maybe sometimes his wife has
also got a trucker license,

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.070
and they share the wheel and go
back and forth across country.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.427
But often, they are
just absent fathers away

00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:01.260
from their families.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.690
So you'd see the toys there as
you walk into the truck stop.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.050
And again, this very
martial culture--

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.540
toy tanks, toy soldiers.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.990
Again, because I feel
that on the roads

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.770
with this fairly
modern serf existence

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.644
of driving someone else's rig
just to stay afloat in America,

00:22:22.644 --> 00:22:24.560
you need to feel that
you're part of something

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.520
bigger, that the cargo you're
moving corresponds somehow,

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.300
in a small way, to the American
dream that you're possibly

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.139
getting short sold
on but nevertheless

00:22:35.139 --> 00:22:35.930
have to believe in.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.555
Because if not, why
would you carry on?

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.520
There are also the more
interesting characters

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.950
at the truckstops.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.450
And a lot of humanity
in amongst it as well.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.590
My ride after Columbus, Ohio--

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.530
I would have hitchhiked down
towards Cincinnati, where

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.000
I got a really nice ride with--

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.860
it was a retired--

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.080
well, reluctantly
retired local radio DJ

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.440
who'd been put out of work
by automation, essentially.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.800
Which is a theme of the book,
because in the old days,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.990
he would have gone into
the studio for five days

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.910
of the week and spun records.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.300
Now he only needs to go in for
two hours on a Monday morning

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.030
to say, next up is
Casey and the Waves,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.231
and it's a good morning
here in Cincinnati,

00:23:24.231 --> 00:23:26.480
because the rest of it can
all be put into a playlist.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.450
So you've got this guy
who would have been--

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.790
and he said, I wouldn't
be able to sleep at night.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.630
I was so excited about my job.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.380
And I met him on a
Sunday, and he was just

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.540
going out for a drive
for something to do.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.010
He took me down to a truck
stop outside of Cincinnati.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.450
And there, eventually, I met--

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.510
I invested at that truck
stop for about a day of time

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.230
just walking between rigs.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:57.280
Got offered a ride
by a Bosnian migrant

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.410
trucker who had a vehicle
recovery-- big vehicle recovery

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:00.910
rig.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.110
And he was driving
down to Mississippi,

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.020
which wasn't quite on
my route to California,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.020
but it would have taken
me a few hundred miles.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.660
I thought I could get
a bit bigger than that,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.576
and so I kept walking.

00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:13.360
And eventually I
met Pala, who is

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.370
kind of the hero of the
book in loads of ways,

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.200
because we spent
five days together.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.700
And we would have driven
from there in Cincinnati

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.100
back north towards
Lexington, Ohio,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.560
to pick up 30,000 kilograms of
laminate wrapped plastic that

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.590
was going to be driven
down to Yuma, Arizona,

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.330
on the Mexico border,
where it would

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.640
be wrapping of
courgettes, or zucchinis,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.820
coming over from Mexico.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.830
It was produce.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.037
So it was my 3,000
mile ride that

00:24:41.037 --> 00:24:43.120
was going to get me most
of the way to California.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.480
And so Pala was my
man sort of thing.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.990
And we spent five
days or so together.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.630
And those five days were
probably-- certainly

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.730
the easiest in terms
of moving miles,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.380
but also in terms
of actually having

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.660
a kind of human
encounter were definitely

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.550
the easiest and the best
period within the entire trip.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.330
Pala is from the Punjab
in north of India.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:13.420
He's been 10 years in the
United States, approximately.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.640
He kind of has to pay rent
to the bank on his cab,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.050
on the cab of his truck.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.960
But he, nevertheless, is in
the position where one day he

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.190
will own it, which is
unusual and very fortunate.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.200
And he's very grateful
for that position.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.880
And the fact that he
is in that position

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.330
is an evidence of the
diaspora of Punjabi community

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:34.960
in the USA.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.780
He had a cousin who is an
architect in San Francisco who

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.880
makes good enough money
that he could sign

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.850
to be the guarantor on the
debt for his cab, which means

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.150
that Pala could one day make
his own money rather than just

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.000
being a servant of
a trucking company.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.750
Nevertheless, there
are still these sort

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.320
of interesting
and intricate ways

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.920
by which he goes about
making a living in the US,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.440
and staying healthy
in particular.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.140
He's a Sikh, and thus a
vegetarian, which in the US

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.660
is probably not a bad way of
staying that bit healthier,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.510
especially at truckstops.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.690
And it was an incredible
experience for me

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:19.430
to be in the backwaters
of Missouri or Oklahoma

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.460
eating parathas, because Pala
would have been well in touch

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.130
with the Punjabi trucking
community that is dotted

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.330
across the roadsides of
the US, would have spoken

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.600
with a kind of grudging respect
for the Gujarati trucking

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.420
community, which he says
works that little bit harder

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.840
and a little bit smarter.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.770
So they now own all
of the truck stops,

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.719
and the Punjabis just
drive the trucks.

00:26:41.719 --> 00:26:43.760
But we would have been
there eating our parathas,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.430
eating our dal and our thali
in New Mexico, in Indiana.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.690
And just having this
fascinating insight

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.740
on a different
part of US culture.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.040
And especially US road
culture, which is often

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.810
very forceful and inhuman,
and you're shut off

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.580
from a community there.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.070
Because everyone's living
this isolated existence,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.967
where they're just trying
to get from A to B.

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:10.550
And everything that
happens in between

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.050
is almost like an inconvenience.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.090
And so for me and Pala to spend
those five days hanging out

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:20.030
was really valuable.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.730
And I mean, some of
the things that he

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.890
would have talked about--

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.340
the one that always
stays with me,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.200
or a couple that
stays with me most--

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.200
well, he remembered that
he'd voted for Obama in 2012.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.540
But he wasn't sure if he'd
voted for the Republicans

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.580
or the Democrats,
which was, I thought,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.340
really kind of nice
insight on what people

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.780
say about polarization.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.230
Which is certainly an
issue in modern politics,

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.430
modern communication.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.310
I found it really
striking that more

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.500
than the polarization
there, what you saw

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.960
was just a disconnect-- a
disconnection and an apathy

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.180
and a political system
that was completely

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.800
irrelevant from his
daily life on the roads.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.330
The most endearing thing of Pala
was his love of field hockey.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.760
And he would have talked about
as a child in the Punjab,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.247
his mom having to ground
him or tell him off

00:28:10.247 --> 00:28:12.830
because she found him practicing
his field hockey strokes late

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.330
at night in his bedroom.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.440
And the best part of it
was that in modern America,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.900
his survival regime involved
partly going back to the Punjab

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.300
for two months of every year
so that he could play field

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.870
hockey, and therefore stay
healthy because he couldn't

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.220
afford health insurance.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.035
So he would get another cousin
to drive his rig on his behalf

00:28:34.035 --> 00:28:34.910
for those two months.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:38.570
He went home and played
field hockey to stay healthy.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.390
There was one time
when I asked him,

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.480
I said to him as we went
by a tornado shelter, which

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.960
they have at the interstate
roadsides for when tornadoes

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.550
come through.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.240
It was a shelter
in Texas that Pala

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.360
wanted to stop at and show
me because he loved it

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.767
because it was so quiet.

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:56.350
And as we were walking
back to the cab

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.780
and doing our stretches, having
had our five days of vegetarian

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.910
food in Oklahoma and Texas.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.090
I was like, Pala, we must be
the healthiest guys in any truck

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.630
in the United States.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.110
No, no, my cousin is a trucker.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.990
He does 45 minutes of
yoga in his cab every day.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.590
And again, that's the
sort of theme of the book

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.000
that I'd hoped comes through.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.125
I think it has.

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:23.420
And this human, this
humanity, this human spirit

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.930
that's kind of wrapped inside
the metal capsule of a car

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.170
or of a truck, or of
the industrial economy

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.670
of modern nation, somewhere
on the highways of the US,

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.920
there is a Punjabi trucker
doing yoga stretches

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.170
behind those curtains.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.780
And I always found that an
incredibly heartening thing.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.090
And that's sort of
a migratory thing

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.410
as well, whether it's from
Punjabis coming from the Punjab

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.000
to work the US.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.340
And speaking of the fact that
the Gujaratis have a head

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.650
start on them, because
every cousin of a newcomer

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.980
from Gujarat who is
already in the US

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.650
will put forward $10,000 so
that the next person in has

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.900
a $50,000 pot to start from.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.620
All of these moments
of globalization,

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.170
which is actually, much as
it shouldn't be, as low pay

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.100
as it is, and it should be with
more rights and protections,

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.260
is globalization working
in the way that it should.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.050
And also, with the trail
of plastic from Ohio--

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.710
recycled plastic going
from Ohio down to Arizona

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.740
to wrap courgettes that
have been grown in Mexico.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.970
This sort of almost
invisible commerce

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.280
that underpins the
lunches that we

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.700
eat in the city and
the global supply

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.950
chain that we rely
on and can take

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.460
for granted in our daily lives.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.190
You kind of see that
out on the roads.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.925
And in all my books
and all my journeys,

00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:49.550
that's kind of been
a theme as a result

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.315
of going less seen places.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.120
From Arizona, Pala and I, we
would have gone Cincinnati down

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.050
into Mississippi.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.460
My geography of this
journey has faded a little.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:15.090
Down into Mississippi along
and across towards Texas

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.850
via Oklahoma, the top of
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.640
I got out of the cab at
Grand Canyon and Flagstaff,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.570
walked and hitchhiked
a little bit further,

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.880
and then came to San Francisco.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.780
And returning,
essentially, to that--

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.070
the bubble, if you like, from
New York City and Brooklyn

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.660
back to the mission
of San Francisco.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.180
Although, again, I'd sort
of questioned to what extent

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.940
these places are bubbles,
certainly walking

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.720
through the Mission District
anytime after 8 o'clock

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.920
on an evening doesn't
feel much like a bubble.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.690
And it seems there
every bit similar

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.070
to having visited refugee
camps in Calais or in Greece.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:58.150
People that have been washed
up, destitute, from a society

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.400
that doesn't take them or
doesn't have space for them.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.280
So yeah, I think that's
kind of a key thing.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.550
Much as we think of
ourselves as disconnected

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.850
in cities, the victims or the
hardships of the modern city,

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.490
the modern economy are,
of course, all around us.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:21.390
And I think I just
wanted to close, really,

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.030
on a note of what
the book is and what

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.210
the journey was in terms
of optimism or pessimism,

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:27.710
essentially.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.280
And I think optimism is
an eternal US trait, which

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.260
is potentially
the one thing that

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.270
can save the country
from itself in some ways.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.090
The fact that there's always
hope that we can improve this,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:42.140
we can make it better,
we can fix this.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.890
And the tone of the book
is very much one of America

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.420
is a hard place.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.960
And it is, because you'll
meet a guy at a roadside who's

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.800
obviously got substance abuse
problems and has just told you

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.360
that he's gone and buried his
mom within minutes of meeting.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.370
You'll pass signs near
prisons saying, do not pick up

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.270
hitchhikers, because 1% of
the United States population

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.250
is in jail.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.590
And there's a kind of prison
industry economy attached

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.870
to that.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.610
And so it is a very stark place.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.080
I find it very disheartening
in lots of ways.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.080
But there are the moments
within the journey

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.360
and within culture and
society, the meeting of Pala

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.750
and the guy who's just
working for his 10 years

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.510
before he can start
making his own money,

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.670
but has hope for the future, who
has a feeling that, actually, I

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.437
don't understand why
people in this world fight.

00:33:31.437 --> 00:33:32.270
I just want to work.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.130
I just want to make
a way for myself.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.370
There is also that
threaded through the book

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.370
and threaded
through the journey.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.960
And I think the
value of the journey

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.810
is something else that I always
like to draw attention to.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.580
I kind of see the
world currently

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.630
as dividing very much
between flows and accounts.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.835
And flows might be
flows of capital,

00:33:58.835 --> 00:34:02.270
or flows of transit,
flows of people.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.979
And the accounts are
the pocketed versions

00:34:04.979 --> 00:34:06.770
of that that we make
for ourselves, that we

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.239
take security in.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.380
In the internet, we have
the social media account

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.350
in amongst the flow
of information.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.280
On the highways, you have
the automobile account,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.750
where you're safe
and it's your place

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.900
in amongst the movement and all
of the life that swarms around

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.900
it.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.040
And even in the cities, I
mean, I don't normally--

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.639
I used to be a cycle courier
and saw all of the cities

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.580
and spent a lot of time
just on the streets

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.529
looking at what was
going on around me.

00:34:33.529 --> 00:34:35.570
And I think increasingly,
in a modern development

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.800
such as this one even, you see
the architecture is very much

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.969
done as if an account.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.150
It's a controlled,
localized place

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.230
that is designed to
make one feel at home,

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.449
but often at the expense of that
random act of life or moment

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.510
or chance that you encounter
as a matter of course

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.719
when cycling between places or
when hitchhiking and opening

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.060
yourself to that
sense of possibility.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.410
And obviously, being at
Google and working in Search,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:08.420
again, that's a model
that often filters us

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.150
towards accounts that
we're comfortable with

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.730
and moves us away
from anything that we

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.455
think we might not like as a
result of past performance.

00:35:17.455 --> 00:35:19.580
And I think it's always
important to question, what

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.871
are we losing to those moments?

00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:25.250
What are we losing to that
reliance on a sense of security

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.660
and a desire for it and to
repeat the past in the future

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.740
that we build for ourselves?

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.060
So I think that's key to
the journey, hitchhiking,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.020
and certainly all that I
write about and my projects.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.730
And yeah, I hope that that
was an interesting reflection

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.570
on 5,000 miles across
the United States

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.780
in the age of Donald Trump.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.244
Thank you very much.

00:35:52.244 --> 00:35:55.208
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:57.212 --> 00:35:58.920
SPEAKER 1: We do have
time for questions.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.176
Please wait for the microphone.

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:03.800
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of questions.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.390
Let me just change
microphone there.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.790
The first one, how does it
feel to be absolutely alone

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.560
on this chart or
on this journey?

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.166
So you're on your own.

00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:14.990
You're alone.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.260
Especially, how did
you keep yourself alive

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.960
being in like in the
middle of deserts

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.086
and counting up to
200 cars in one row?

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.244
JULIAN SAYARER:
Yeah, good question.

00:36:30.244 --> 00:36:31.660
I mean, in terms
of being alone, I

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.070
think I've always just done
all right with that for one.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.111
I don't know if I'm a
natural loner or something.

00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:40.285
But yeah, I mean, I cycled
to Istanbul on my own

00:36:40.285 --> 00:36:41.660
for the first time
when I was 20.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.330
And kind of cycling through
the Alps and having no one

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.820
around was the first
time I started feeling,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.952
actually, this is amazing,
and this is what I like.

00:36:49.952 --> 00:36:51.410
I think writing
has actually always

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:57.290
been a great companion to me,
because much as the books are

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.840
true to life,
nevertheless you're

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.881
kind of creating a slightly
external view of what you're

00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:04.380
doing when you're writing it
down, when you're recording it.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.060
So it's not exactly a
diary, but it gives you

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.690
a sense of-- a space to reflect
and to converse with yourself,

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.546
if you like, via your notepad.

00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:15.920
And then the States
and that sort

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.180
of physical issues of
going between empty space,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.470
and especially in
cars or in a truck,

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.840
is comparatively easy
relative to cycling.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.730
I mean, going through
the deserts of Central

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.550
Asia on a bicycle and
you've got 250 miles

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.650
to cycle between villages.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.080
And maybe you'll get
to a caravan pulled

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.710
to the crossroads
in the middle of it,

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.710
where someone will be
selling some grilled meat.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.151
But maybe you won't.

00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:43.650
So yeah, in the States it was
comparatively simple for that,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.859
just having some
water with me and--

00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:48.650
yeah, the harder part
was finding something

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.440
that I wanted to actually
eat, to take for my pack lunch

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.490
kind of thing.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.800
AUDIENCE: And you also
said that you'd like--

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.490
on the road with drivers
who talk with you openly,

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:06.240
so it was really easy to
make a sincere conversation.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.880
How does it feel when here,
when most of human encounters

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.527
are usually smalltalk, but don't
actually care about each other?

00:38:14.527 --> 00:38:16.110
JULIAN SAYARER: In
the city, you mean?

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.750
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah,
it's really true.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:25.130
Yeah, I think cities are
interesting environments

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.195
for me, or quite challenging
in some ways, especially a city

00:38:28.195 --> 00:38:33.400
as developed and controlled
as London, essentially.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.330
There's lots of very
high paid people here.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.329
There's lots of companies
making a lot of money.

00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:41.030
And so everyone has a very
sort of predetermined agenda

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.720
and route.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.320
And I think that kind of
removes a lot of the opportunity

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.889
for chance encounter.

00:38:47.889 --> 00:38:49.430
But they are still
there, and I think

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.980
you just have to appreciate
them when they come.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.340
I mean, riding a bicycle is
essential to me in London,

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.690
and that small moment of
agreeing with someone,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.271
even about the weather at
traffic lights, is great.

00:38:59.271 --> 00:39:01.520
I had a brilliant moment a
couple of weeks back having

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.920
an electrical device repaired
at a shop in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.850
a guy who's been there forever.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.300
And we were just
making small talk.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.960
And it was Wednesday.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.340
It was prime minister
questions time.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.625
He had it on TV.

00:39:16.625 --> 00:39:20.097
And a Tory backbencher had asked
a question about Christianity

00:39:20.097 --> 00:39:22.430
and the importance of protecting
the world's Christians,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.360
which of course, I'm
completely down with.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.210
But I said I'd like if they
talked more about persecution

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.260
of Muslims as well.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.000
I'm half Turkish,
and it's an issue

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.374
that Islamophobia in the
Tory party concerns me.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.790
And I said that,
and he said that.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:43.100
And then he said, it's like
paradise is a roundabout.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.080
And we all are going
to the same roundabout,

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.160
just on different roads.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.540
This is Allah's world.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.545
And the Christian road
and the Muslim road, they

00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:50.420
go to the same place.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.940
And we're there with like
solder around and wires

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.400
hanging over the place in
this basement on Church Street

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.640
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.610
And the man is just
evangelizing to me

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.820
about the need for the world's
religions to kind of come

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.070
together and be as one.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.130
And so it does happen.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.671
I think independent businesses
are really good for it as well

00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:10.100
as the way that we travel.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.120
AUDIENCE: Do you have any photos
of yourself from the journey,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.805
because you showed
the photos of places.

00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:21.620
But like, it's interesting
how it doesn't look different.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.260
JULIAN SAYARER:
Yeah, from that one,

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.440
I have a couple of
selfies from that one.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.224
I look pretty grizzly.

00:40:29.224 --> 00:40:30.890
From cycling around
the world, though, I

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.098
have a lot more because I
broke a world record for it

00:40:33.098 --> 00:40:36.080
and Guinness wanted
ratification stuff.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.774
So they wanted to see that I
was actually in those places.

00:40:38.774 --> 00:40:40.940
And yeah, they must exist
somewhere on the internet.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.220
AUDIENCE: Maybe I missed
this earlier, but--

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.620
so the book is about Emre.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.852
Is that you as well?

00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:02.810
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah, so
Emre's my middle name.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:08.210
And it's just a way of creating
a slight distance between--

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.160
I mean, it's what
happened to Julian,

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.125
but it's my written
persona in that book.

00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:14.750
AUDIENCE: Do you find
that that sort of

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.760
helps you to think about it in
third person a little bit more?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.240
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah, slightly.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.460
And I think when you're
putting something out

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.255
for public consumption,
it's kind of just nice to--

00:41:25.255 --> 00:41:26.130
when it is your life.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.213
And there are elements in
there that are personal.

00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:30.140
So it's just kind
of wanting to create

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.690
that sort of small buffer.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.060
But yeah, it's
definitely a good point.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.930
My publisher had a couple of
things to say about it as well.

00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.840
AUDIENCE: How much
of the book did you

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.600
write when you were on the
road as opposed to later on,

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.960
and how were you writing
it, like laptop, phone?

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.050
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah, I always
write in a notepad really.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.410
I don't think I've ever
traveled with a laptop.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.340
And I was just scribbling
down in my notepad.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.620
And generally, I must have
written about half of it

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.820
while I was out on the road.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.010
I mean, occasionally
with Pala in his truck

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:16.890
talking about his life and daily
life in the truck or trucker

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.580
community, occasionally I'd
just start scribbling down.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.230
Oh, you can't put
this in a book.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.109
So I'd make my note there.

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.775
Occasionally, though,
it's just really--

00:42:26.775 --> 00:42:29.340
I'm profoundly impacted
by what would happen.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.680
And my penultimate
ride was a guy

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.370
in the Central Valley of
California, a very depressed

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.630
agricultural community.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.180
And he couldn't take me
as far as he wanted to

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.250
because he was on parole,
and it would violate

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.340
the terms of his parole.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.904
He was a guy that
told me that he

00:42:45.904 --> 00:42:47.820
doesn't keep many friends
because they get him

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.200
into trouble.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.480
Which was just such a
profoundly sad thing

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.730
to be told by
another human being.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.950
So things like that, I
would have just been--

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.410
I would have finished the
ride, and I'd just make time

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.995
to write always, really.

00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:04.320
Just because it's-- it becomes
a way of processing after

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.170
a while.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.610
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.180
You mentioned that you are
also a cycle courier in London,

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.900
I guess.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.350
So what kind of
memorable experiences

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.250
do you make in this
role, rather than--

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.661
I guess it's very different.

00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:24.285
JULIAN SAYARER: Yeah, I mean, it
has a similar kind of quality.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.110
There's some element
of being a human cog

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.022
in a mechanical
machine when I think

00:43:33.022 --> 00:43:34.230
you're traveling in that way.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.260
I think it's a big part on
the bicycle or hitchhiking.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.700
I mean, memorable moments
as a courier, 2008

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:47.685
in the financial crisis, and
riding from the EC2 Square Mile

00:43:47.685 --> 00:43:50.070
out to Canary Wharf
to Lehman Brothers

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.250
to deliver receivership
notices worth $33 billion

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.860
and getting paid 2 pound
50 for each delivery

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.980
was a very interesting
perspective on a collapse

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.750
of the world economy.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.570
Or equally taking
bouquets of flowers

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:07.080
from hedge funds in
Mayfair to brothels.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.882
So it's kind of, yeah--

00:44:08.882 --> 00:44:10.840
like the first book,
"Life Cycles" is sort of--

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.311
I saw it as globalization
at the roadsides.

00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:15.060
And then "Messengers"
was the second book.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.450
And that, to me, was the
globalized city sort of thing.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:22.470
So there's always, yeah, humans
looking at modernity kind

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.492
of thing going on, hopefully.

00:44:30.487 --> 00:44:32.820
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a quick
question as another cyclist,

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.450
then?

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.870
Well, do you still
cycle around London?

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:42.380
And what's your opinion of cycle
lanes and facilities in London?

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.635
And if you could change one
thing, what would that be?

00:44:45.635 --> 00:44:47.260
JULIAN SAYARER: That's
a good question.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.170
Yeah, I'm definitely still a
cyclist anywhere I go, really.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.910
It's just my way of travel,
including in London.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.470
I cycled down to Victoria
yesterday and went along

00:44:56.470 --> 00:45:00.010
the embankment, which is now,
as you've probably mostly seen,

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.130
this nice wide segregated
cycle path that only got put

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.000
in a few years ago.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.575
And I just-- yeah, it
gives me a great optimism

00:45:06.575 --> 00:45:08.950
that there are so many more
people visibly getting around

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:09.860
on bikes.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.610
And actually, the
architecture of the city

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.330
is changing to reflect that.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.480
There was a great moment
by Waterloo Bridge

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.480
a couple of years back when
that cycle route had first

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.380
been put in.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.400
And there's actually
a wider pavement

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.200
also that separates that cycle
track from where the road is

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.824
and where the traffic is.

00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:29.740
And that wider pavement
would have been a lane

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.880
of traffic three years ago.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.480
And I remember seeing
an old couple--

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.310
and it's always nice seeing old
couples being romantic together

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:39.490
anyway, but they were having
a prolonged goodbye and a kiss

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.240
goodbye on that
bit of former road

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.630
that is now a wide pavement.

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:44.800
And it was just--

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.500
I remember looking at it and
thinking, wow, two years ago

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.050
that space exactly there
was just a line of smoking,

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.380
gnarling, impatient traffic.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.920
And now it's actually a place
that humans can actually

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.070
stand and be as humans.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.360
And so I think that
is increasingly

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.100
the culture of the modern city.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.270
And cars have less
and less place in it,

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.380
which I think is
a positive trend.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.930
And I hope that London can carry
on progressing, with any luck.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.910
AUDIENCE: At the start,
you mentioned about your

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.210
around the world
cycling record, and you

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.540
felt the whole process of
around the world cycling

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.810
had become very commercialized
and been somewhat devalued

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.440
by all the sponsorship into it.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.230
And I think that's
probably a trend that's

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.870
continued since then as well.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.200
How did you feel as you
went through that process

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.450
and completed it,
like the fact that you

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:51.070
were during the
Guinness attributions

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.200
or getting the proof of that,
and going through the Guinness

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:54.700
presence?

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.810
Did that feel quite
commercialized anyway,

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.860
or did you feel
like you achieved

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.180
what you wanted that that?

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.520
JULIAN SAYARER: No, really
good, perceptive question.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.860
And absolutely, when I was--

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.110
things like making notes on my
daily log and stuff like that

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.030
seemed fine.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.860
My mile-- my start point and
my finish point, all of that

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.450
was fine.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.010
But yeah, taking
a photo of myself

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.229
with a redwood and
things like that.

00:47:19.229 --> 00:47:21.770
And the redwoods in particular
are quite an interesting place

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.228
to ride, through the redwood
forest in Northern California.

00:47:24.228 --> 00:47:26.870
You're there with
a tree that started

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.850
growing at the time
of the Roman Empire.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.870
And it's still growing.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.110
And you're on this silly six
month quest to break a record

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.845
when you're not really
a competitive person--

00:47:36.845 --> 00:47:39.510
apparently not a
competitive person.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.780
Yeah, so it was a bit strange.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.750
And it's kind of a
mixture of necessity

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.350
and just seeing it through,
really, in the end.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.670
I really hadn't liked
the corporate approach.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:54.614
It misrepresented it in
terms of the meaning of life

00:47:54.614 --> 00:47:56.030
on the open road
as something that

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.830
was for sale to banks
and investment funds,

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.660
but also misrepresented
it as something

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:04.310
that was this unpleasant alpha
male man against the world

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.840
thing, where time
and again, it's

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.910
the world that actually
helps you along.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.320
And so I wanted to show that
it could be done differently.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.770
And actually, it
was a lot of fun

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.970
that it wasn't as hard as
it had been made to look

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:20.804
or as unpleasant at
all as an experience.

00:48:20.804 --> 00:48:22.220
And then halfway
through, I'd been

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.920
a courier in London anyway, so
I was going off funds of that.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.750
And so come the
midpoint, I needed

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.125
to finish because I was going
to run out of money anyway.

00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:31.670
So there's always
that wolf at the door

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:34.219
to make sure you keep going.

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:36.010
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
again, Julian Sayarer.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.760
[APPLAUSE]
