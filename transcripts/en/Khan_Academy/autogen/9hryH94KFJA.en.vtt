00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310
 . 

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.990
 In this presentation we will solve a set of examples that 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.180
 It deals with parallel and perpendicular lines 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.960
 If we have parallel lines, orthogonal lines, and of course 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.129
 There are lines that are not parallel or 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.950
 Orthogonal 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.120
 And with a little review, if you've seen 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.510
 By, parallel lines, where it does not intersect 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 Let me draw some axes 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 If these axes are Cartesian, this is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.360
 X axis, and this y axis 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.070
 If this line I draw in purple, a parallel line 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.480
 It seems so 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.710
 It's not the same line, but they do 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530
 The same inclination 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.150
 If this moves by a certain amount, if the change in y 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.070
 / Change in x is a certain amount, this change in y / 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.000
 The change in x is the same amount 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.620
 That is why they do not intersect 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.030
 If they have the same tendency 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.670
 They have the same inclination 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.290
 Parallel lines have the same inclination 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.990
 Orthogonal lines, depending on how you see them 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.640
 It's kind of the opposite 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.610
 Let's assume that this is a line 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 The orthogonal line will not 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.340
 Just cut the line, but cut it at an angle 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.860
 Ie at an angle of 90 degrees 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.420
 I will not prove this to you here 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.270
 Because I actually proved it in linear algebra display, however 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.410
 Oblique orthogonal line - Let us assume that this is one 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.110
 Here, let's assume that the yellow line has the inclination m 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.940
 Then this orange line, vertical on the yellow line 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.000
 It has a tendency of -1 / m 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.310
 Their miles will be 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.690
 The negative inverse of each other 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.410
 Now, using this information, let's look at a set of fonts 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.600
 We find if they are parallel, or if they are 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 Orthogonal, or none of the above 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.570
 To do so, we have to keep looking at the tendencies 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.690
 To see, we were told that a line is going through 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 Points 4, -3 and 8.0- 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.039
 And the other passes points, -1 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.670
 -1 and 2.6- 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.720
 Let's find the inclination of each of these lines 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 I will find the first line of the line 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.700
 Tilt here, line 1 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 I will call it Mile 1 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.780
 Tilt 1 is, let's assume it - well, I'll take this on 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.590
 End point 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 If -3 - 0 - remember the change in y-- 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.130
 -3-0 / 4-8 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.250
 = -3 / - This is equivalent 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.180
 4 + 8-- -3 / 12 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.220
 = 1/4 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.750
 We divide the rugs and set up on 3 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.610
 This is the line 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.760
 This first line 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.870
 Now, what about the second line? 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.180
 The second line inclination is, well, let's take 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:16.780
 1 - 6 / -1 - -2 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.230
 = --- 1 - 6 = -7, / -1 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.620
 - 2 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.750
 This is equivalent to -1 + 2 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.250
 Which equals 1 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.300
 If the tendency here is 7 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.410
 So here, their miles are not equal - if they are not 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.390
 Parallel - and not both 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.440
 The negative inverse of each other 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 If neither 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.020
 Ie they are not parallel or perpendicular 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.350
 They are not parallel or perpendicular 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.350
 If these two lines intersect, they will not 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.740
 Intersect at an angle of 90 degrees 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.210
 Let's solve these more questions 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.540
 I have here, again, a line going by 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.330
 Points, then the other line passes through these points 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.770
 Let's look at their miles 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.010
 This Green Line, what is its tendency? 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.012
 The tendency of the Green Line, I will call the first line 

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:16.329
 We will say, let me see, the change in y 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.030
 I have done so 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.120
 2. First, so I will first 1 - / 1 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.090
 - 3 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.140
 If -2 - 14 = -16 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.200
 1-3. Equivalent 1 + 3 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.460
 This is divided by 4 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.000
 This is -4 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.610
 Now, what is the second line inclination? 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.420
 If we have this second line inclination 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:57.070
 Let me say 5 -3, this is the change in y / 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.490
 2 - 0 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 = 5 - -3 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.540
 This is equivalent to 5 + 3 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.210
 = 8 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.460
 Then -2 - 0 = -2 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.700
 This also equals -4 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.280
 If these two steps are parallel 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.320
 These two lines are parallel 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.660
 They have the same inclination 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.890
 I urge you to find equations for each of these 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.790
 Lines and you represent each, and prove to yourselves 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.060
 They are parallel 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.750
 Let's do this 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.210
 Again, this exercise is about finding the inclination 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.190
 This first line has these points 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.080
 Let's find his inclination 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.480
 First line inclination, line passes 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.720
 With these points 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.480
 Let's see, 3 -3, this change in y 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.240
 / 3-6 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.000
 This is equivalent to 3 + 3, ie 6, / 3 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.120
 + 6, IE9 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.300
 If the first line inclination is 2/3 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.590
 What is the tendency of the second line? 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.230
 This is the second line, which is the other line 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.890
 Pass through these points 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.550
 If the second line inclination, let's see, can say 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:27.340
 8 - 4 - 2 - 6 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.720
 how much? 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.150
 -8 - 4 = -12 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.140
 2 - 6 equals 2 + 6 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.610
 Where the negative signal is eliminated 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.260
 Equals -12 / 8, ie equivalent if 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.070
 We divided the rugs and established on 4 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.320
 3 / 2- 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.930
 They slapped 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.120
 Note, these are negative 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.740
 The opposite of each other 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.850
 If you take 1 / 2/3, it equals -1 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.870
 X 3/2, equivalent to 3 / 2- 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.350
 Each one is the negative inverse of the other 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.300
 We turn the rugs and the place, and make them 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.430
 And thus equal to each other 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.580
 If these lines are perpendicular 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.150
 And motivate you to find equations - you've already got 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.560
 Your tendencies - but they created the equations of each of these 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.090
 The lines, and put them down, and prove to yourselves that they are 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.620
 Orthogonal 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.580
 Let's solve one another 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.890
 Find the equation of the vertical line on this line 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.590
 Which passes through point 2.8 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.440
 The first part of the information, he 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.650
 Vertical on that line there, what 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.810
 Explains to us? 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.330
 Well, if he's vertically on this line, his cam should be 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.950
 Negative reversal of 2/5 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.920
 His inclination, the negative inverse of 2/5, is reversed 

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.510
 2/5 is - let me write it in a better color, a beautiful green color 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.870
 If the slope of this line is 2/5, equation 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.610
 The line we have to find is vertical 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.970
 His inclination would be inverse 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.180
 If instead of 2/5, it will be 5/2 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.580
 Instead of being negative, it would be positive 

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.170
 If this is a negative inverse of 2 / 5- 

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.580
 Right? 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.240
 We take the negative signal and become positive 

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.690
 And turn the 5 and 2, we get 5/2 

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.600
 If this must be the inclination 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.430
 We can use the tilt point model here 

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.850
 He goes through this point 

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.580
 Let's use the tilt point model 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.220
 y - value of these y, and must be on line 

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.880
 = Inclination, 5/2 x x - this x value 

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.220
 X value when y = 8 

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.740
 This is the line equation in the tilt point model 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.940
 If you want to put it in a model point of inclination, you can 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.960
 The use of little reparation, or forced manipulation 

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.910
 y - 8 = - Let us distribute 

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:59.960
 5/2 - If 5 / 2x - - 5/2 × 2 = - 5 

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.570
 Then we add 8 for both parties 

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.900
 We get y = 5 / 2x 

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.635
 Add 8 to 5, and get positive 3 

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.340
 We're done
