00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.050
We're on problem 185.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.710
Car x and car y traveled
the same 80 mile route.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:21.660
If car x took 2 hours-- so, x
went 80 miles in 2 hours, and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.080
that's 40 miles per hour-- and
car y travelled at an average

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.710
speed that was 50% percent
faster than the average

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.420
speed of car x.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.500
So, 50% faster.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.670
So y went 50% faster than x.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.550
50% faster times 40
miles per hour.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.130
Well that's 40 plus 20.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.510
That's equal to 60
miles per hour.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.410
How many hours did it take car
y to travel the route?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.210
So, distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
80 miles is the distance.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.760
The rate is 60 miles an hour.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.270
So the time is equal to 80/60,
which is equal to 1 and 20/60.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.270
Which is equal to
1 and 1/3 hours.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.410
And that is what they
have there.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.290
They have choice c.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.120
I thought they might have 1 hour
and 20 minutes written.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.160
Next problem.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.920
186.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.070
If the average of the four
numbers k, 2k plus 3, 3k minus

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.810
5, and 5k plus 1 is 63, what
is the value of k?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.590
So let's just average
the numbers.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:55.400
k, plus 2k plus 3, plus 3k
minus 5, plus 5k plus 1.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.660
And that was four numbers.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.650
So, divide by 4.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.200
That is equal to 63.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.230
Let's add up all the k's.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.110
I have 1k plus 2k is 3k.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.360
So, 6k.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.450
8k.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540
So, I get 8k.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.500
And then I get 3 minus 5 is
minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.390
And if you multiply the 4
times the 63, if we just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.940
multiply both sides of this
equation by 4 you get

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.710
4 times 63 is 252.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.720
Let me think about that.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.250
4 times 60 is 240 plus 12.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.020
Yeah, 252.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.770
And then 8k would be-- add
1 to both sides-- 253.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.370
And so k is equal to
253 divided by 8.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.190
Let's see what that is.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.630
8 goes into 253-- 8 goes
into 25 three times.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.320
24.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.800
Bring down-- equals one time.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.270
1 times 8 is 8.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.550
You have a remainder of 5.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.440
So, it's 31 and 5/8 is k.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.270
And that is not one
of the choices.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.890
Let me see where I
made a mistake.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.600
So the average of k.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.630
2k plus 3, 3k minus
5, and 5k plus 1.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.470
That's four numbers, right?

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.070
What is the value of k?

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.870
All right, so I add up the four
numbers, and I divide by

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.130
4 and they should
be equal to 63.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.940
So, maybe I just made a mistake
in the simplification.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.070
So, I have k plus 2k is
3k, 3k plus 3k is 6k.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.350
Oh, 6k plus 5k is 11k.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.740
I don't know what I
was-- that's 11k.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.330
And then you have 3 minus 5
which is minus 2 plus 1.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.050
Minus 1.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.090
So, 11k minus 1.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.030
So, this is 11k.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.540
So, k is equal to 253 divided by
11, which is-- 11 goes into

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.040
253 two times.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.860
22, 33.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.844
Oh, that's nicer.

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:20.089
It goes in exactly 23 times
and that's choice D.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.630
Sorry for the error.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.490
Next question.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.930
187.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.930
If p is an integer, p is even.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.270
They're telling us q is odd.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.790
Which is the following must
be an odd integer?

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.140
OK, so they give us
a bunch of things.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.670
So, an even times an odd.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.620
Well, by definition, that's
going to be even.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.290
Why is that?

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.510
Well, you can view it as if you
multiply p times q, if p

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.510
is even that means that p is
divisible by 2, right?

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.770
So, if 2 is one of the factors
of p, it's definitely going to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.050
be one of the factors
of p times q.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.960
So, this one will not be odd.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.250
Let me think about it.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:15.400
If I add an even plus an odd,
that gives me an odd.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.340
So, let's see if any of
the choices are that.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.410
Let's see, p divided by q.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.680
An even divided by an odd does
not necessarily-- well, this

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.560
is an interesting one.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.040
2p plus q.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.250
That's choice c.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.445
Now if p is even-- well, it
doesn't matter whether p is

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:39.340
even or not, but 2p is actually

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.290
definitely going to be even.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.770
This is going to be even.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.040
And q, we already
know, is odd.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.950
So, this is an even
plus an odd.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.310
So, it's going to be odd.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.260
So, the choice is c.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.700
And we could even prove
it a little bit.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.860
If you say that p is equal
to 2 times some number k.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.060
Right?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.320
We don't know what that is.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.140
We say that q is equal to 2
times some number, I don't

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.910
know, m plus 1, then what
does this simplify to?

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.860
This simplifies to 2 times p,
which is 2 times some number

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.230
k-- we don't know what k is--
plus q which is 2 times some

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.390
number m plus 1.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.490
Some integer m.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.450
So, this becomes 4 times some
number k, plus 2 times some

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.390
number m, plus 1.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.360
Well, 4 times some number k,
that's the same thing as 2

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.690
times some other number n.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.880
You know it's 2 times some other
integer where n is twice

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.690
what k is, right?

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.200
Plus 2m plus 1.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.510
And this is the same thing
as 2 times n plus m-- and

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.640
remember, n, m k, these are all
just integers-- plus 1.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.750
And so, if n and m are integers,
then we could say,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.720
well, that's just equal to 2
times some other integer--

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.780
let's call it l-- plus 1.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.880
And this would be
an odd number.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.710
Because this is even.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.925
And then you're adding
1 to an even number.

00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:03.120
But you didn't have
to do that.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.530
You just had to recognize
that an odd plus an even

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.100
is equal to an odd.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.070
Choice c.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.940
Next problem.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.800
188.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.810
Drum x is 1/2 full of oil.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.020
So x is 1/2 full.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.590
And drum y, which has twice
the capacity of

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.410
drum x, is 2/3 full.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:39.067
So y is 2/3 full and has
two times x capacity.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:47.270
If all of the oil in drum x is
poured into drum y, then drum

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.580
y will be filled to what
fraction of its capacity?

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.790
OK.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.250
So if x is 1/2 full.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:04.620
So x is equal to 1/2 of its--
well, let me think of the best

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.810
way to write this
algebraically.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:12.600
x is 1/2 full and y
is twice as big.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.100
So, if you poured all of this
1/2 into y, it would

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.580
contribute to 1/4
of y's capacity.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.690
I guess another way, we could
say capacity of x is equal to

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.325
1/2 the capacity of y.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.909
So, if we were to say 1/2 the
capacity of x, if we were to

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.100
multiply both sides of this by
1/2, that's equal to 1/4 the

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.570
capacity of y.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.080
So, this 1/2, that's equal to
1/2 the capacity of x which is

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.400
equal to 1/4 the
capacity of y.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.540
So, if we add 1/4 of the
capacity of y to 2/3 of the

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.950
capacity of y-- that's 2/3 full,
that's another way of

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.230
saying 2/3 times the capacity
of y-- what do we get?

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.300
We get 1/4 plus 2/3 which is
equal to-- get a common

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:12.570
denominator 12--
3/4 plus 8/12.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.170
3/12 plus 8/12, that's 2/3.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.300
You get 11/12.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.270
So, y would be 11/12 full
of its capacity.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.840
So, that is choice C.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:32.565
Problem 189.

00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:41.720
If x is greater than 0,
x/50 plus x/25 is what

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.220
percentage of x?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.040
So, you get a common
denominator.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.525
This is equal to over 50.

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.255
x/50 is x/50.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:53.770
x/25 is 2x over 50.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:00.150
So, that is equal to 3x over
50 which is the same

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.520
thing as 3/50 x.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.170
And that's the same thing as--
since we want it as a fraction

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.340
of 100, since we want to do a
percentage-- that's the same

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.290
thing as if you multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:17.890
by 2, you get 6 over 100 x which
is equal to .06x which

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.600
is equal to 6% of x.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.450
And that's choice A.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.740
Anyway.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.540
See you in the next video.
