00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.520
Science asks big challenging questions about
the nature of the universe.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.490
Answering these questions often requires collaboration
across scientific disciplines and national

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.490
borders.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.410
But what happens when countries are isolated,
at war, or just don’t get along… what

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.550
do scientists do then?

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.010
In some areas of science it’s impossible
to do research without collaborating with

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.069
another country.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:28.310
The United Nations Educational, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization (or UNESCO) reported

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.840
that in 2015 an average of 1 in 4 published
scientific papers listed some form of collaboration

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.110
with foreign scientists, and that number continues
to grow.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.730
For instance, the high altitude, lack of atmosphere
and dry conditions in certain parts of Chile

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.510
make it one of the best places on EARTH to
view activity in outer space.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.900
This is one reason that it is estimated by
2020, 70% of the global infrastructure for

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.400
astronomical observation will be located in
Chile.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.120
With the rest of the world’s astronomers
dependent on their facilities for sensitive

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.030
measurements good relations are critical if
research in astronomy is to advance.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.219
But consider what happens if countries have
a challenging political relationship.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.010
US relations with Cuba for instance have been
famously strained since the 1960’s.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.119
While exchange of scientific information was
never expressly forbidden, US embargos on

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.100
everything from travel to trade between the
two countries has made it difficult for Cuban

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.939
scientists to access instrumentation and equipment
that scientists outside the country take for

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.939
granted.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.590
This is because modern reagents and scientific
equipment are often manufactured in, or contain

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.990
parts, from the United States which exempts
them from sale to Cuba.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.249
Even with these challenges, Cuba is a superstar
of science.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.889
They were the first country to receive validation
from the World Health Organization for eliminating

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:51.630
mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and their
lung cancer vaccine was an early success for

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.490
cancer immunotherapy.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.349
These innovations made formalized scientific
collaboration between the US and Cuba politically

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.939
more attractive and in 2014 the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and the Cuban

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.890
Academy of Sciences signed a historic agreement
to “seek opportunities for sustained cooperation.”

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.790
In order for them to fulfill that promise,
the two countries had to agree to work together

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.690
outside of the laboratory, and this newfound
scientific relationship coincided with a general

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.450
easing restrictions between the US and Cuba,
including a relaxation of travel restrictions

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.420
and a historic visit to Havana by President
Obama himself.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.260
But of course, 2016 feels like a long time
ago, and the current US administration doesn’t

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.000
have the same approach to collaboration.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.220
So it remains to be seen if these agreements
are allowed to continue.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.550
Where the public may perceive hostility, scientific
collaboration still continues… because scientists

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
find greater value in, well, science.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.980
In other parts of the world, international
collaborations like the Human Genome Project

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.650
and the particle accelerator SESAME in the
Middle East (which includes unfriendly countries

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.670
like Iran, Pakistan, and Israel) are pushing
humanity’s knowledge of the universe forward

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.400
and creating havens of cooperation in a time
of increasing nationalism.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.540
When it comes to highly visible, international
“moon shot” projects like CERN’s Large

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.161
Hadron Collider or the International Space
Station-- a project reliant on cooperation

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:18.510
between Russia, the United States and others
-- the whole world is watching.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.790
The sheer scale of investment puts these massive
collaborations in a delicate diplomatic position

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.820
that can make them critical points of de-escalation
and compromise in otherwise gridlocked negotiations.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.240
They can also inspire us to acknowledge that
we’re all just bunch of humans stuck on

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.850
a rock racing around the sun at 67,000 mph
(108K km/h).

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.480
And in the words of Louis Pasteur: “Science
knows no country, because knowledge belongs

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.380
to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates
the world.”

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.900
As another example, we’re working on a deep
space gateway with Russia, go here to learn

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.250
more and don’t forget to subscribe for more
science in your day!

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.340
Did you know that during the cold war, The
US and USSR were working together for science?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.660
When the Soviet Union's Cosmos 936 mission
launched in 1977, seven U.S. biological experiments

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.719
were onboard.
