00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.100
No one ever said Disney movies were only made
for kids, and it seems that with so much of

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.660
the adult humor slipped in, the filmmakers
are keenly aware of how broad of an audience

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.090
their films receive.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.759
Children may be savvier with each generation
with the help of social media and web sites

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.359
that sneak through the parental blocks, but
some adult humor still goes over the head

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.500
of most kids.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.400
There are some kid’s movies that only insinuate
something naughty while others are anything

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400
but subtle.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.450
&nbsp;Here are 10 Dirty Jokes Hidden in Famous
Disney Movies.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.620
Beauty and the Beast
Sometimes Disney does not have to make a single

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.200
joke to be dirty but creates an entire character
that seems a bit too adult for young minds

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
to fathom.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.620
Babette is a French feather duster and an
oddly sexy character when considering she

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.050
is a household cleaning tool.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.930
Luckily, the end of the film shows that being
attracted to Babette is not without merit

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.840
as the human version is quite a catch.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.899
However, she is still animated so it is not
a wholly rational attraction.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.719
Beyond illustrating a provocative French maid
duster which is clearly a reference to the

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.140
sexual fantasy of a scantily clad maid with
a saucy accent, she also has a physical relationship

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.930
with French candlestick Lumiere.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.020
Their sensual exchanges are much funnier to
the older crowd.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560
One disturbing moment in the film shows a
man plucking the feathers from Babette’s

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
lower half.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.150
Since her feathers are her skirt while she’s
a duster, the man gets a little too aggressive

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.440
and handsy for a kid’s movie.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.580
&nbsp;So while the presence of Babette is an amusing
joke, the treatment of her is occasionally

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.740
alarming.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.330
Hercules Greek tragedy and Disney do not seem
like the most logical pairing so it was a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.090
bit mind boggling when Disney’s Hercules
references the play, Oedipus Rex.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.420
To be fair, the character of Hercules is the
son of Gods in Greek Mythology, so mentioning

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.020
the play almost makes sense.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.790
In the film, Hercules speaks with his love
interest Meg, where he brings up the tragic

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.150
play of Oedipus the King by saying “That
play, the Oedipus thing.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.860
Man, I thought I had problems”.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.610
It is a brilliant joke for those aware of
the Oedipus story and considering the many

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.662
other allusions to Oedipus in the animated
film including the journey Hercules makes

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:58.750
to Thebes which is the same place Oedipus
is king, the film certainly has layers.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.329
Even though the film is a tale of characters
from Greek mythology, noting a play in which

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.990
the main character murders his father, marries
his own mother and then gouges his eyes out

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840
at the end, is not kid’s stuff.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.220
The shocking reference is one of the slyest
dirty jokes in Disney films as it is only

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.980
inappropriate for those who know the story
and only the most inquisitive kids would ponder

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.510
the meaning of such a wisecrack

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.230
Toy Story
Toy Story was the first Pixar film thus beginning

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.790
the long tradition of films for children that
are often loved by adults just as much.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.480
In the film, through a series of unfortunate
actions Buzz and Woody end up in the home

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.430
of neighbor miscreant Sid.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.620
Sid uses his toys for demented experiments
including taking them apart and attaching

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.790
random pieces of toys and other items found
in the home to create a whole other horrific

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.790
object.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.940
Sid has problems, or perhaps he is a burgeoning
found-art genius who isn’t appreciated in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.940
his own time.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.260
One of his pieces is a pair of Barbie or similar
doll, legs with the torso of a hook.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.720
It certainly is a strange creation but it
also is a literal hooker.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.280
The Pixar animators were probably pretty proud
of themselves for being both clever and a

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.660
bit too on-the-nose with their design and
word play.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.300
Muppets Treasure Island
The Muppets have always been more than just

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.489
foam and fleece.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.129
Even though they are puppets and usually keep
their material family friendly, everyone can

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.650
enjoy Kermit and the gang.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.900
Muppet Treasure Island was not released by
Disney but it was their production.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.030
The film is rated G which suggests that it
is perfectly fine for general audiences and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.030
since there is nothing overtly sexual or offensive,
the MPAA rating is acceptable.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.220
Leave it to Miss Piggy to be the naughty one
with this dirty joke.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.069
After Kermit returns from sea, Miss Piggy
apprises him of what she has been up to while

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.830
he was gone which includes fraternizing with
other men.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.560
It all still seems innocent enough as she
is a young and vibrant porcine around town

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.800
and deserves the company of men and does not
specify the activities.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.120
However, things are cleared up once Piggy,
and Kermit, run into Long John Silver, and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.540
Piggy emphasizes the word “Long” to which
Kermit asks “Him too?”

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.379
The joke both assures audiences that Miss
Piggy was not keeping things platonic with

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.370
her gentlemen callers and it also gives audiences
too much information about what is hiding

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.430
under the pirate’s trousers.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.730
Inside Out
Inside Out is a sweet family film about growing

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.040
up and had plenty adults bawling like children.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.650
The actual children were probably not nearly
as touched by the exploration and pain of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.650
adolescence.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.510
As the many emotions who hang out inside the
mind of a young girl, characters such as disgust,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.939
anger, and sadness spend plenty of time together.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.250
Just like any work friends, the characters
get into a lot of discussions that may not

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.320
be directly related to the task at hand.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.550
One of these moments is when Fear asks whether
the sound they heard came from a bear to which

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.880
Disgust informs him that bears do not live
in San Francisco.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.040
Anger notes that he saw a big hairy guy who
he thought was a bear.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.440
A bear is a common term used in the LGBTQ
culture for a certain type of burly, and typically

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.590
hairy, gay man and considering the film’s
location of San Francisco, this is obviously

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.710
a wink to the community.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.440
The dirty joke in Inside Out is not scandalous,
nor is it particularly dirty but it is a fairly

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.900
adult reference.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.780
101 Dalmatian
Live action adaptations of cartoons or animated

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.410
films can sometimes feel bizarre.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.910
When audiences have grown accustomed to the
animated classic, any actors or sets may seem

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.910
surreal.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.890
Disney’s 1996 live action version of their
1961 perennial favorite stars Glenn Close

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.690
who gives an entirely new generation of children
nightmares as the puppy-killing-all-in-the-name-of-fashion,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.690
Cruella De vil.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.530
There are a few humorous jokes that somehow
made it past the censors such as one puppy-napper

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.990
telling another that taxidermied animals give
him a shrinky winky making audiences rest

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.900
easy that the dog nappers are not complete
weirdos who get their jollies from stuffed

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.900
roadkill.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.150
However, 101 Dalmatians dirtiest joke deserves
a spot on our list as it concerns bestiality.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.410
After Roger and Anita share their exciting
news of expecting a new baby, Cruella De Vil

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.590
does not say much.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.020
When they let her know that they are expecting
puppies, De Vil responds “Well, you’ve

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.400
been a busy boy, haven’t you?”

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.090
While it is obvious that the puppies are the
work of Pongo and Perdy, Disney managed to

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.770
fit in a truly filthy and disturbing joke
in a children’s flick.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.330
The Avengers
The next dirty joke is so hidden you would

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.590
need a British slang to English dictionary
to even catch it.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.351
Since The Avengers is rated PG-13, it can
get away with a lot more than some of the

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.880
other movies on this list.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.800
However, even with its more mature audience,
not every insult can be so blatant.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.270
After the Avengers team captures bad guy Loki,
he can be seen seething with hatred which

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.780
is directed toward Black Widow.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.569
He mumbles to himself about how the Avengers
are failures and provides a few more forms

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:08.569
of mockery.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.930
One term he uses for Ms. &nbsp;Romanoff is a “Mewling
quim” which may not immediately activate

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.389
any alarm bells.

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.640
For those who may not know, quim is a word
in British slang for female genitals.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.190
Loki is basically calling Black Widow a whining…
well, you know.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.050
So while Loki‘s “See you next Tuesday”
slam is not exactly a joke in itself, the

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.130
sneaky way in which Joss Whedon slipped the
forbidden word for PG-13 audiences, is hilarious.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.280
Toy Story 3
Since the Toy Story franchise is rife with

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.169
innuendo, it seems impossible to narrow down
the dirty jokes.

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.150
While Buzz Lightyear’s excitement in Toy
Story 2 displayed by his erecting wings is

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.180
a solid example of Disney’s naughty immaturity,
we don’t want to forget the one that may

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.040
be overlooked in Toy Story 3 but not because
of its subtlety which it severely lacks.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.400
In Toy story 3, Andy has grown up and moves
away to college.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.160
Since he has no use for his toys, they end
up as donations in a local day care.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.880
As the toys begin to interact with the other
toys that have been there for years, Barbie

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.229
meets her dream man, Ken.

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.380
As the two walk toward each other, the attraction
is palpable.in part because the scene is in

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.200
slow motion with the song “Dreamweaver”
playing in the background but mostly because

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200
it is Barbie and Ken, Mattel’s royal couple.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.460
As the two give each other compliments, Barbie
says “Nice ascot”.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.310
Sure, Ken is wearing an ascot but we suspect
Barbie’s emphasis on the “as” was no

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.960
accident and was certainly admiring Ken’s
derriere.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.550
Cars 2
The newer films made by Disney seem to only

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.990
be dirty for those who are aware of modern
terminology.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.040
One example of this is an event that takes
place in Cars 2.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.190
The beat up old cars are having a party.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.330
The cars in question are in the style of Pinto
and Pacers which are well known for being

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.330
lemons.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.400
The fact that all of these cars are together
while also using lemons as their centerpieces

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.970
is what many would consider cute and even
funny.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.560
However, for those who grew up with the internet,
the term lemon party is something completely

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560
different.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.569
Deep in the dark underbelly of the internet,
you may find that a lemon party is not exactly

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.229
a squeaky clean Disney event.

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.949
We won’t spell it out for you but if you
are curious, you can search for it yourself

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:59.720
but please be sure to keep the safe search
on and whatever you do, do not look at images.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.250
Zootopia
Disney’s 2016 smash success, Zootopia is

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.889
beloved by critics and audiences for its endearing
story of a smart and motivated rabbit reaching

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:11.170
her goal of being the first bunny police officer
in the big city of Zootopia.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.889
The bunny, Judy Hopps is laughed at for her
big dreams since she is an animal of prey

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.960
and bunnies are not known for being tough.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.009
She is tough though and never says quit.

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:22.900
Although she makes it through the police academy,
she is given the dull and unglamorous job

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.900
of meter maid.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.660
Judy knows giving animals tickets for petty
crimes is beneath her as she has the fire

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.500
in her to stop real crime.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.709
Since she puts everything she’s got in everything
she does, she is dedicated to doling out tickets

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:34.709
too.

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:37.580
Zootopia is definitely appropriate for the
kids and it teaches them useful lessons about

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.900
acceptance and working hard to achieve what
you want, but it also gets a prime dirty joke

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.229
in there for good measure.

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:47.180
While adding up the fines for Nick, the sly
fox, Judy recounts all of the fines together

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.100
and states, “I might be just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying”.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.839
The look on Nick’s face says everything.

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.860
It is a naughty joke for such a nice bunny.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.080
So there you have it, 10 Dirty Jokes Hidden
in Disney Movies.
