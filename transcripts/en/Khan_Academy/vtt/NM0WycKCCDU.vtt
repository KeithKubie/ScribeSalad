00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.034
Sal: What I want to do
in this video is start

00:00:02.034 --> 00:00:04.434
with mass composition and
see if we can figure out

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:06.767
the empirical formula of
the molecule that we're

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.533
dealing with based on
the mass composition.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.034
Let's say that we have a bag
and we're able to measure that

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:21.433
this bag is 73 percent, it's
73 percent mercury and it is,

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:26.533
the remainder of the
bag, 27 percent chlorine.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:30.500
Based just on this can we
figure out the likely empirical

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.633
formula for the molecule
that we have in that bag?

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.367
I encourage you to pause the video and try

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.866
to see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.033
Well one way to think about it

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:43.633
is let's just assume a number.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.166
This is all the information we have,

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.966
let's just assume we have 100 grams of it.

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.166
We could assume a thousand
grams or 10,000 grams

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.367
or 57 grams, but I'll pick
100 grams because it will

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:56.533
make the numbers easy to
work with in our head.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.433
Let's just assume, let me make it

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.167
clear that I'm assuming this.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:06.233
I'm going to assume that I
have 100 grams of this molecule

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.800
that is 73 percent mercury
and 27 percent chlorine.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.700
If I assume that that means
that the 73 percent that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.966
is mercury is going to be
73 grams and the 27 percent

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:24.000
that is chlorine is going
to be 27 grams of chlorine.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.266
Let me make it clear this is
mercury and this is chlorine.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.100
Now I just need to think about,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.166
well how many moles of
mercury is 73 grams and

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.733
how many moles of chlorine is 27 grams.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.300
To do that I'll look up the
periodic table right here.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.166
I have the atomic weight
which is the weighted average

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.900
of the atomic masses
that's found in nature.

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:53.734
The atomic weight here
for mercury is 200.59.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.734
That means, let me write
this right over here.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:04.900
One mole of, one mole of mercury is,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.066
we could say is 200.59
grams, 200.59 grams.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.400
Similarly we could look up the
atomic weight for chlorine.

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:20.300
Chlorine right over here, 35.453.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.433
We could say one mole of chlorine,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.833
and once again this is a
weighted average of all

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:29.766
of the isotopes of chlorine
as found in nature.

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:32.066
I guess we'll just go with that number.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.367
One mole of chlorine is going to

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:44.667
be 35.453, 35.453, 35.453 grams.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.100
Given this information right over here how

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.234
many moles of mercury is this, roughly,

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:51.233
and how many moles of
chlorine is this, roughly?

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:55.048
I say roughly because getting
an empirical formula from

00:02:55.048 --> 00:02:59.100
measurements of mass composition
is going to be necessarily

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.767
a messy affair, it's not
going to come out completely,

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.966
the numbers aren't going to
work out completely exact,

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.966
so that's why I said roughly.

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.633
So how many moles is this?

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:16.900
This is going to be 73
over 200.59 of a mole.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.166
If a mole is 200.59 we have
73, this is the fraction

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:25.043
of a mole that we have, moles of mercury.

00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:28.366
Remember, moles are just a
number, Avogadro's number

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:31.740
of something, but let's
just figure out what it is.

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:45.101
If we take 73 divided by 200.59
we get .36, I'll just say

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:53.233
0.364, and once again this
is, so approximately 0.364.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:58.066
That's how many moles
of mercury that we have.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.900
We can do the same thing for chlorine.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.333
This is going to be 27 over
35.453 moles of chlorine,

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:11.500
which is approximately equal
to, get our calculator out.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:25.433
27 divided by 35.453 is equal
to .76, I'll just say two.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:37.000
So 0.762 moles of chlorine.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.500
What's going to be the ratio
of mercury to chlorine?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.700
Or I guess we could say since chlorine,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.940
there's more of that, chlorine to mercury.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.900
Remember, this is just a number.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.833
When I say 0.762 moles, this is just 0.762

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:52.234
times Avogadro's number of chlorine atoms.

00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:57.567
This is 0.364 times Avogadro's
number of mercury atoms.

00:04:57.567 --> 00:05:00.700
We can literally think
of this as the ratio.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.033
This is a certain number of moles,

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.501
this is another number of moles.

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:04.900
Well what's the ratio, let's see.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.966
What's the ratio of chlorine to mercury?

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:08.900
Well you can eyeball
it, it looks like it's

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.766
roughly two to one, and
you can verify that if

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:17.633
you take that number and
you divide it by .3639,

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:19.433
and once again I'm just going
to get the rough approximate.

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.567
You can see it's pretty close to two.

00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:24.900
So when you see something like this the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.234
simplest explanation is often the best.

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:29.433
Okay, there probably will be
some measuring error right

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:32.633
over here, but you can say
that it looks like roughly,

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.433
this is what I'm talking about when you're

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:35.966
trying to find the empirical formula for

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:38.566
mass composition it tends
to be a rough science.

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:41.500
You can say roughly the ratio of

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.701
chlorine to mercury is two to one.

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.700
You have two chlorines for every mercury.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.233
And because of that you can say

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:55.767
this is likely to be, so likely,

00:05:55.767 --> 00:06:00.567
for every mercury you have

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:04.622
two chlorines, you have two chlorines.

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:07.500
Based on these measurements
right over here it's

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.066
very likely that you have
mercury two chloride.

00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:15.166
The reason why it's called
mercury two chloride is because,

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.100
well I won't go into too
much detail right over

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.100
here but chlorine is
highly electronegative,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.033
it's an oxidizing agent,
it likes to take other

00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:25.768
people's electrons or hog
other people electrons.

00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.900
In this case it's hogging, since each

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.900
of the chlorine likes to hog one electron,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.100
this case two chlorines are
going to hog two electrons,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.725
so it's hogging two
electrons from the mercury.

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:43.700
When you lose electrons
or when your electrons

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.301
are being hogged you're being oxidized,

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.900
so the oxidation state on
mercury right over here is two.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.300
Two of its electrons are being hogged,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.033
one by each of the two chlorines.

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:57.433
This is mercury two chloride, where the

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:01.766
two is the oxidation state of the mercury.

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.500
This is what we likely have.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.100
The ratio, we have two chlorines

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.466
for every one mercury, roughly.
