[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:08.560
ELLIE POWERS: Hey everybody.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.670
So I'm Ellie Powers from
the Google Play team.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.110
And thanks so much for cutting
your lunch a little bit

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.340
short to make it back here.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.510
When I was 13 years old
and I was in middle school,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.650
we read this book.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.150
It was called "Lakota
Woman," and it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.450
was this really powerful
story of a woman who

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.630
grew up in a Native American
reservation in South Dakota.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.270
The place looked like this,
a really beautiful place.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.795
But her story was completely
different from mine.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:35.420
She went through all
sorts of struggles

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.990
that I'd never heard about.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.330
And we read this book as
part of our larger unit

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.150
that we were doing on
Native American history.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.860
And in order to
graduate seventh grade,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.690
we had to complete a massive
independent research project.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.030
I'd never done anything
like it before.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.230
And after reading
her story I said,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.850
I have to do my presentation
on Native American religious

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.680
freedom and oppression
in the United States

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.240
in the second half of the 1900s.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.370
Because I was 13-year-old,
and I guess that's just what

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.150
made sense to me at the time.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.780
So I went into the library.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.090
I had procrastinated
a bit, I do admit.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.610
So I tried to find books
that talked about the topic

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.840
that I wanted to write about.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.110
And I really wanted to write
about individual stories

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.950
of people who had
experienced oppression

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.700
and had had struggles in
terms of being able to express

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.153
their religious beliefs.

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:26.416
And it wasn't so surprising,
looking back on it,

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:27.790
that I couldn't
find these books.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.820
Because the information
was either too new, or it

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.640
was too controversial
to be published.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.340
But luckily, I grew
up in Silicon Valley.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.620
So even though my life
was a little bit weird,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.750
it meant that I had some
tools that I could access

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.530
that helped me do
a little bit more

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.670
than I could have done
with my local library.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.810
I want to introduce
you to my SPARCstation.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.070
Anyone remember this computer?

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.360
This was the first
computer that I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850
had that could
access the Internet,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.900
and it was back
in the early '90s.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.490
And my family had
a Sun SPARCstation

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.190
that looked almost
exactly like this.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.550
And this computer
was so awesome.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.330
Not only did it
have a CD-ROM drive,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.070
it also had a color screen.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.229
It didn't have Firefox,
because that didn't exist.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.220
But it had a three button mouse.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.620
You can't even
buy those anymore.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.780
I mean, three buttons.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.500
That's 50% more efficient than
most mice on the market today.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.440
And best of all, my
SPARCstation had a modem.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.320
And I was one of
the first people

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.300
I knew who could
connect to the Internet.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.970
The Internet wasn't amazing
back then like it is today,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.270
and you couldn't do a lot.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.400
But this was my first
chance to find information

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.970
that wasn't available
in my local library,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.720
and to reach out to people who I
would have never met otherwise.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.480
So when I was trying
to write my report

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.820
and I couldn't find
any books, at first

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.050
I thought I was
completely out of luck.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.725
But then I realized that
my SPARCstation had Mosaic.

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:52.325
Do you remember Mosaic?

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.410
Do you remember these
dark gray backgrounds?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.000
You remember them,
I can see that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.870
Do you remember the blue
links, and when you clicked

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.110
on them they turned purple?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.440
I mean, that was awesome, right?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.610
And I found Mosaic.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.430
I could cruise
around a little bit.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.152
And then, if you didn't have
Mosaic, maybe you had Gopher.

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:09.110
Do you remember Gopher?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.109
It was like a lot of
folders, and you could just

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.276
go from one folder, the
next folder, another folder.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.108
And sometimes you could
find images and text

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:17.450
in those folders, and send
your folders to your friends,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.630
and tell them which
folders were the best.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.030
This was really cool.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.820
And it was through
these tools that I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.060
stumbled onto something amazing
that solved all of my problems.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.450
It was called NATCHAT,
Native American Chat.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.080
And basically this is where
historians and other people

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.610
interested in Native
American issues

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.820
would go to talk
about anything related

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.510
to Native American culture.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.990
So I started hanging
out in NATCHAT.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.460
I got completely immersed
in a whole new world

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.480
that I had never
even heard of before.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.570
I got all the information
that I needed for my project.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.240
I interacted with new
people who had nothing to do

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.050
with my regular everyday life.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.290
And I wrote my report.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.330
Not only did I write
my report, but I

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.990
included all this
information I'd

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.900
learned from people that no one
in my school had learned about.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.990
And I felt that I was able
to educate not only myself,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.090
but also my teachers
and other students.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.540
I felt so powerful.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.557
And I said, this is great.

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.140
I've accomplished
something important,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.959
and I want everyone else to
have the same experience.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.480
So, of course--
remember, I was 13--

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.830
I taught my little siblings
how to use the computer.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.090
I wanted them to have
that feeling too.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.210
And that was cool, but
that wasn't enough either.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.470
I wanted everyone to have
this great experience,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.520
this feeling of connectedness.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.147
And I thought, yup, sooner
or later, everyone's

00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:38.230
going to have their own
SPARCstation just like me,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.120
and this is going to be awesome.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.907
But looking back, this
was never going to happen.

00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:45.740
It wasn't going to be
possible that everyone

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.490
could have a SPARCstation.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.630
If you look at the technology
that we have today,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.360
it's so different from
that SPARCstation.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.930
Let's do a couple comparisons.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.060
So this SPARCstation, with its
awesome three button mouse,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.540
thousands of dollars.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.320
An Android One phone, which
is basically a supercomputer

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.720
in comparison, less than $100.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.690
Obviously a huge benefit.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.544
Do you guys remember
learning touch typing?

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:10.960
Mavis Beacon, and
you had to learn

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.670
how to press all those little
buttons in the right order?

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.900
That was actually hard,
looking back on it.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.959
And today we have touch
screens and sensors.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.500
They're so simple
that you don't even

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.041
have to teach young
kids how to start

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.460
using a phone or a tablet.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.980
They just figure it out.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.440
Back then, you had
your big SPARCstation

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.370
stuck on your desk.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.240
There were tons of
wires coming out of it.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.320
If the power ever went out,
you lost all your work.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.790
But today, you can connect
anywhere in the world.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.060
You can charge a phone
wherever you can.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.630
It's so much better.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.460
And this is great, because
back in the day only

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.940
a couple of super nerds could
connect to the Internet,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.780
and I didn't think
that was fair.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.170
I wanted all super nerds
to connect to the Internet.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.300
In fact, I wanted everybody
to connect to the Internet.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.010
And so this ability
to give people

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.710
the same powerful feeling
of connectedness and access

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.030
to information is actually
why I'm at Google.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.510
I'm really excited to be
here because Google's mission

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.060
to organize the
world's information

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.980
and make it
universally accessible

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.390
is so deeply tied to
what's important to me,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.000
and what has made a
difference in my own life.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.590
And so what Google
Play is, is it's

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.330
what happens when
we've connected now,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.130
literally, a billion people.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.595
And we've given them access
to a connected catalog

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:21.300
of experiences.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.930
And that catalog, and those
connected experiences,

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.400
are made possible by
developers like all of you.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.100
And so now here we are, at
this special moment in history.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.050
Developers can
have a huge impact

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.360
on both local and
global problems,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.020
because everyone's
connected now.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.060
And a lot of that
is through Android.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.970
So I want to tell you a story
of some of these developers.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.300
Our first story takes
us to Sao Paulo, Brazil.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.099
And "Emprego Ligado" means
"jobs online" in Portuguese.

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.640
We actually have a
couple people here

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.314
from the Emprego Ligado team
today, which is pretty awesome.

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:54.730
And they're proud
to say that they

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.680
have made the number
one blue collar jobs

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.890
service in all of Brazil.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.070
So let's learn a little bit more
about why this is important.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.170
So Sao Paulo is home to 11.8
million people, and the worst

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.020
traffic jams in the world,
according to Time Magazine.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.550
So Emprego Ligado
saw this common pain

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.290
point, this commute time in
Sao Paulo, it's just painful.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.990
I mean, three hours.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.869
That is a long time to spend
commuting every single day.

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.410
And the most common
way to get around

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.826
there is actually
on a public bus.

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:30.120
There's about 16,000
buses in Sao Paulo.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.780
These buses are
often overcrowded.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.520
It can be hard to get a seat.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.370
And three hours a
day is a long time

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.444
to spend your life sitting on
a bus, or standing on a bus.

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:40.860
And so this is
some of the traffic

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.800
that you'll be spending
your time sitting through.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.591
Luckily, it's a beautiful
city, and it even

00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.710
has some cool murals to look at.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.810
But I mean, that's just
a lot of your life.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.210
And so Emprego Ligado
had a key insight.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.010
Let's say we compare two people.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.717
One person has this crazy
three hour daily commute.

00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:58.550
Another person has a
more reasonable commute

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.109
of around one hour per day.

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:01.650
So if you do the
math, that basically

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.566
it means that the person
with the long commute

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.950
is wasting 20 business days
of their life commuting.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.790
That's time when they're
not economically productive,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.860
they can't earn money,
they can't spend time

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.780
with their family,
and it's creating

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.320
a huge financial and
psychological impact on them.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.330
So Emprego Ligado was
founded back in 2012

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.170
by three college friends
who are incredibly

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.870
passionate about
Latin America and went

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.790
to live and work there.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.540
Not only did they
see this problem,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.740
that people were spending
a lot of time commuting,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.870
and that that wasn't very
fun-- and actually, that

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.750
was leading to the
traffic problems

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.200
in the big cities of Brazil
getting worse and worse.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.950
But also, employees had
an extremely inefficient

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.824
recruiting process.

00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:42.990
And it was hard for them
to find the right employees

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.610
for their companies.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.590
So the job market was
really broken, actually.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.730
Job seekers had
no way to find out

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.420
about new jobs that
were available.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.690
So, if you had a
job, you would just

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.470
stick it out, until
maybe you happened

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.470
to hear about something.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.040
Maybe your friend tells you.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.850
But until then, you were stuck.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.750
And employers were
really struggling too.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.990
They needed to find people
with the right experience.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.660
And the commute time was the
top reason that a lot of people

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.230
left jobs.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.530
There was a survey,
actually, that 37%

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.630
of people who were earning
a kind of low to middle wage

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.580
in the region, said
that they had actually

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.480
left a job due just to traffic.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.660
No other reason,
just their commute.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.420
And so imagine, if you had 37%
of your workforce potentially

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.200
leaving their job
at your company,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.190
and you'd have to replace
them, just because

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.660
of the commuting situation.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.615
I mean, that's tough.

00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:34.240
And so they calculated
that-- let's say

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.310
we have a company with
about 100,000 employees.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.240
So you could be losing
up to $80 million

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.090
a year due to employee turnover,
because of these retention

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.176
and recruitment difficulties.

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:46.800
But not only did they
see this problem.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.780
They also saw an opportunity
to increase transparency

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.255
in the job market.

00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:53.630
So they looked at
the job market.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.560
And these are the most
common jobs in Brazil.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.330
So you have, you could be
a waiter in a restaurant,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.350
maybe you drive a truck,
maybe you're a contractor,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.160
maybe you work as an
assistant in a shop.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.880
And in fact, these
types of jobs represent

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.800
85% of the entire
Brazilian workforce.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.100
And so they decided to focus
on these types of jobs.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.270
And these not only were
the most popular jobs,

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.865
but also here the information
transparency was the poorest.

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:22.240
So this was really
an opportunity

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.990
to have a hugely broad impact.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.520
Often you'd find
out a worker could

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.680
have had a similar job in
their local neighborhood,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.570
but they just had
no way to find it.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.180
Imagine how frustrating
that would be.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.760
So let's talk about
the type of person

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.560
who Emprego Ligado
is able to help.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.830
So Fernanda, if we drew her
as an Android-ified cartoon,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.170
would look like this.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.590
And so she's got
a cool pink suit.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.930
And she'd been unemployed for
about three and a half weeks

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.860
when she signed up
for Emprego Ligado.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.180
And this time had been
really stressful for her.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.920
She had a family
who depended on her,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.680
and they needed her support.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.639
And she also used to
have a long commute.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.180
And with a city full
of supermarkets,

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.513
you'd think it should be easy
for her to find a new job.

00:11:04.513 --> 00:11:08.380
But unfortunately, she
hadn't had any luck.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.140
So when Emprego Ligado
got started in 2012,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.700
they built a full
featured job search system

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.660
using just text messaging.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.110
So think about the last
text message that you sent.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.080
Maybe it was like, LOL,
OMG, or a couple of emoji.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.020
Now imagine that you are
using the same system

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.420
to find qualified
workers meaningful jobs

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.690
in their local area.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.620
So this is a big
usability challenge

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.870
that they managed to overcome.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.286
So I want to walk
you through what

00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:37.090
Fernanda did with the system.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.410
So first, she
enters her location.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.090
Then she says that she wants
to work in a supermarket.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.124
She specifies her
desired salary,

00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:45.540
and then she starts
getting a list

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.984
of jobs matching her criteria.

00:11:46.984 --> 00:11:49.150
On average these jobs are
about four kilometers away

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.950
from her home, so it's
a big improvement.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.420
Then she can
schedule an interview

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.960
or share each different
job with a friend.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.805
She confirms her interview,
she is good to go.

00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:01.180
And Emprego Ligado had started
getting some great results

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.800
from their SMS-only service.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.590
But you can see that
this process isn't

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.220
quite as interactive or as easy
to use as you might want to be.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.500
So they saw another trend.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.290
Android was starting to take
off in Brazil, big time.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.560
And so they saw that this
was an opportunity for them

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.150
to build a much more
engaging experience.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.320
So the app launched
in September 2014,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.760
with all the same goals
as the SMS service,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.660
but it's a lot more fun to use.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.230
And they saw that Android
users were actually a lot more

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.850
engaged with the service, too.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.840
They were, in fact, applying
to about eight times more jobs

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.120
than the average person
on the SMS service.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.590
And the jobs they
apply for tended

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.305
to require more
technical skills, too.

00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:40.430
They also saw that the
people using the Android app

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.030
were actually much younger on
average than the people using

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.492
the SMS-only service.

00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:46.700
And that's pretty exciting,
because in Brazil there's

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.630
actually a very popular
national apprenticeship program.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.962
That's a real big on-ramp
for a lot of young Brazilians

00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:53.920
to find a meaningful
career that will take them

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.340
far in their lives.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.800
And now they're doing this with
Emprego Ligado to help them.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.480
So far, they've had
a significant impact.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.750
They've had over a million
users through both their SMS

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.580
and their Android app services.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.370
And they've been able to
match about 8 million jobs

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.360
to their users search criteria.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.290
And think about what that
would do if that was you.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.909
If your commute time got
reduced by that much,

00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:19.450
not only would you
feel more relaxed,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.914
you'd have time
with your family.

00:13:20.914 --> 00:13:22.830
But maybe you could even
walk or bike to work,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.660
and that would have a big
impact on your health too.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.259
And then it also had a
big impact on employers.

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:30.800
We talked earlier
about the struggles

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.671
that employers would
have with recruitment.

00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:35.170
And now it's really helped them
reduce their training costs,

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.000
because they're able
to find employees who

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.920
have more relevant experience.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.760
And because the commute
times are better,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.800
they're no longer losing so many
employees due to the traffic

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.110
problems and the transit time.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.910
And so this is
how Emprego Ligado

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.370
is using their disruptive
job matching algorithms

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.250
to save millions of dollars
for Brazilian companies

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.930
every year on retention
and employee recruitment.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.402
And Emprego Ligado
actually makes

00:13:59.402 --> 00:14:00.610
money providing this service.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.780
That's pretty awesome.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.310
And this has allowed them
to expand their own team.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.902
They've now grown to team 40,
and 36 of them are Brazilians.

00:14:07.902 --> 00:14:09.360
They get interviewed
on the TV news

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.040
regularly about how they're
helping the traffic problem.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.260
They're actually taking
crowded buses off the roads.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.360
So let's go back to Fernanda.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.790
So with Emprego Ligado, she was
able to find a new job really

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.427
quickly.

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:24.760
And it was a job that she was
really well qualified for.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.750
And it was much
closer to her home.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.660
So with this extra time
she was able to save,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.570
she could spend more
time with her family,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.070
and really had an
improved quality of life.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.180
So here we have
how Emprego Ligado

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.270
is making the Brazilian
job market work better

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.510
for everybody.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.400
They're increasing access to
information for both employees

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.085
and employers.

00:14:43.085 --> 00:14:45.210
Now we're going to move to
a totally different part

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.420
of the world, and we're
going to talk about Flipkart

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.120
in Bangalore, India.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.740
So has anyone here
used the Flipkart app?

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.430
Yeah?

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.540
Fantastic.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.409
Well, if you haven't
tried it before,

00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:57.700
I'll tell you a little bit
more about what you can buy.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.950
You could get basically
any type of product.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.020
You could get a lamp
for your living room,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.232
you could get a refrigerator,
you could get some new clothes.

00:15:05.232 --> 00:15:07.440
And actually, when I was
cruising around the Flipkart

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.340
app, I learned about
a new type of product

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.930
I'd never even heard of
before-- bike sleeves.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.390
Does any one know these?

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.130
Yeah?

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.080
These are awesome.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.500
So if you've never
heard of them,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.374
they're something that
you wear on your arms.

00:15:19.374 --> 00:15:20.900
They're kind of
like leg warmers,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.350
but you wear them when you're
riding your motorcycle.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.670
And if you want to--
you know, you're more

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.760
a minimalist person, you
can choose a basic color

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.805
like black or white.

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:29.680
And then if you want to
go a little bit wild,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.630
you can choose these tattoo
printed bike sleeves over here

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.500
on the right.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.760
And the reason that
Flipkart sells bike sleeves

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.090
is that in India, motorcycles
are an extremely popular way

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.250
to get around.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.560
Today we're seeing that in
India about two million cars,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.014
every month, are sold, but
about 12 million motorcycles.

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.930
So having the right set
of products that meets

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.310
the market's needs is really
key to Flipkart's growth.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.990
And their growth
has been enormous.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.530
As of March this year, they're
moving about $4 billion

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.730
of merchandise
annually, and they're

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.940
expecting it to double
by the end of the year.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.990
So where's this
growth coming from?

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.390
It's coming from mobile.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:10.570
And the online shopping market
in India is growing huge.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.610
In 2016 there's
going to be about 100

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.820
million online shoppers,
and the market's

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.250
going to grow by about 50%
for the next four years.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:23.061
It's going to get up to
about $16 billion in 2018.

00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:25.560
And this was all made possible
because of the massive growth

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.990
of smartphones.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.680
So next year in India the
number of smartphone users

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.750
is actually going to be bigger
than the entire population

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.390
of the United States.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.730
This is huge.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.770
And in India mobile
has gotten so popular

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.364
that Flipkart's focusing
more and more on apps.

00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:44.780
They're making so
much more money.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.690
In fact, their Android app
has about 1.5x higher order

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.880
frequency compared
to the desktop web.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.290
90% of their mobile
traffic is on Android.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.490
And so they've taken
the next logical step.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.400
They shut down their
mobile website.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.680
And they said, hey,
just go get our app.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.060
And their sister site,
Myntra, which is actually

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.092
owned by Flipkart, took
it one step further,

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.800
and on May first this
year, they actually

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.180
shut down their
desktop website too.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.131
You just go there and
it says, get our app.

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:13.089
And we're seeing a lot
of similar announcements

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.240
across all sorts of
online retailers in India,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.484
because of this massive
growth in mobile.

00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:20.900
So one of the reasons that
Flipkart has been so successful

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.880
is they know how to
market to people there.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.650
They know how to make
the right things.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.890
But they also know how to make
sense of logistical problems

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.310
and how to solve them in a
local way that makes sense.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.265
So I found out about this
group of people recently.

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:34.640
It's a whole
community of people,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.912
and here's what they do.

00:17:35.912 --> 00:17:37.370
If you're an office
worker, they go

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.610
to your house in the morning,
they pick up a hot cooked lunch

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.570
that someone in your
house has made for you,

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.690
they deliver it to your desk
hot just in time for lunch.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.950
You eat your lunch, and then
they take your lunch box

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.154
back home for you.

00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:50.570
And they're called
the dabbawalas,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.650
and they've been doing
this for about 120 years.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.850
In Mumbai, there's
about 5,000 dabbawalas,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.040
and they deliver about
200,000 lunches per day.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.710
It's amazing.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.220
And Flipkart recently
announced that they're

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.845
going to be working
with the dabbawalas

00:18:03.845 --> 00:18:07.519
to do last mile delivery in
some of India's biggest cities.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.060
And the reason they
wanted to do this

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.690
is that the dabbawalas
are basically awesome.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.660
They deliver tons of packages
with nearly zero errors.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.860
In fact, Harvard Business
School did a 2010 case study,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.280
and they compared the
accuracy of the dabbawalas

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.780
to the Six Sigma process.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.420
And they said,
yup, it's basically

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.700
meeting that same level of
reliability and service.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.920
And so we're seeing
here how Flipkart

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.320
is combining new technologies
with local market insights

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.000
to create a new market,
a new e-commerce market,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.490
in one of the world's
biggest economies.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.210
So next we're going
to go to Europe.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.040
We're going to go to BlaBlaCar.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.730
And if you haven't
tried them yet,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.834
you should the next
time you're in Europe,

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.500
or one of many other places that
we're going to talk about soon.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.740
They're the most successful long
distance ride sharing service.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.350
So when you sign
up for BlaBlaCar,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.420
you have to describe yourself.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.440
OK.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.300
Anyone else in the
audience a Bla?

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.716
If you don't know
what that means,

00:19:00.716 --> 00:19:02.810
it means you don't like
to talk in the car.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.014
Just don't talk to me.

00:19:04.014 --> 00:19:05.430
Maybe you're like
me, and you like

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.160
to talk a little bit,
but not the whole time.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.120
And then we probably all
know some in our life

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.130
who we'd call a
BlaBlaBla, and that's

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.020
someone who just talks non-stop.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.570
So why is this important?

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.820
Well, if you are running a
hugely successful long distance

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.550
ride sharing service
where the average trip is

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.630
about 200 miles, you're
going to quickly learn

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.650
that if you stick a
Bla and a BlaBlaBla

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.160
together in a car
for 200 miles, you

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.886
are going to have two
very unhappy customers.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.730
But, if you have this
algorithm and you

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.230
know what questions
to ask, you'll

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.220
know that you can just stick
two BlaBlaBlas together,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.760
and maybe you've built
a lifelong friendship.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.300
So let's talk about how
BlaBlaCar works with one

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.950
of its most popular routes.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.240
Let's say that I'm a driver.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.250
I have my Renault.
I live in Paris

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.940
and I'm going to go back to
my hometown of Rennes, where

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.754
I grew up.

00:20:00.754 --> 00:20:02.170
Maybe it's for the
holidays, maybe

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.485
I'm just making an
impromptu visit to a friend.

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:07.110
And I'm actually going to spend
a lot of money on gas and tolls

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.870
to get there.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.940
It's going to be a long drive.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.450
And in fact, the trip may be
so expensive that I can't even

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.510
go as often as I'd like to.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.570
So I can just launch
the BlaBlaCar app,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.630
and it'll match me with other
people going the same way.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.390
I don't actually make
money doing this,

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.920
but I can offset all of
my costs of gas and tolls.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.130
And I can sell the other
three seats in my Renault

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.040
to three other people who
are going on the same trip.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.790
So this is a much
cheaper alternative.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.350
So a train ticket would cost
about three times as much.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.020
A plane ticket would cost
about six times as much.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.700
And if you've ever
had the experience

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.140
of buying a train or
plane ticket at absolutely

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.220
that last minute,
when it's so critical,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.400
you know that those
costs could be way more.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.090
So it's a good option to have.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.367
And this is the BlaBlaCar team.

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:55.950
They're headquartered in Paris
and it sounds like a really fun

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:56.942
place to work.

00:20:56.942 --> 00:20:58.650
One of my favorite
programs I heard about

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.810
is called the BlaBla swap.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.380
So they have offices all
over the globe because they

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.470
reach so many users.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.630
And if you do a BlaBla
swap, what you can do

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.440
is go work in another
company's office for week.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.190
And this helps, not
only you to have fun,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:17.260
but also to exchange ideas and
best practices between offices.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.050
So BlaBlaCar has made
massive expansions recently.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.190
They're now reaching
about two million people

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.640
every single month.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.620
They have about 20
million members,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.750
and they're reaching
19 different countries.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.090
So they're all over Europe,
but also in Turkey, Russia,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.856
and most recently,
Mexico and India as well.

00:21:35.856 --> 00:21:37.980
And here are the benefits
that BlaBlaCar can bring.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.950
So we talked about the
money savings before,

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.250
and that's great.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.470
But it also helps
with the environment.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.690
And it helps with
traffic problems as well.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.920
The average BlaBlaCar
actually has 2.8 people,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.910
up from a typical
average in Europe

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.360
of about 1.7 people per car.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.950
And BlaBlaCar's had Android
apps for a long time,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.859
since back in 2010.

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.650
And they found that
their mobile experience

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.792
means people can book rides
easily at the very last minute.

00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:06.500
And because more than
half of their users

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.530
are actually on Android,
they've invested a lot

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.030
in making some great
Android experiences.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.755
So they made an
Android Wear app here.

00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:15.950
It allows you to see when
someone is trying to link up

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.550
with you to arrange a ride.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.080
And they did a material
design refresh of their app

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.940
recently as well.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.106
It's gotten some
great user feedback.

00:22:23.106 --> 00:22:25.230
They're also going to add
a new feature soon called

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.679
Meet My Co-Rider.

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.220
So this is a neat
feature where it'll

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.359
allow co-riders to temporarily
share their locations.

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:33.650
So this way they can see each
other as dots on the map,

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.530
and it makes it a lot easier to
try to meet up with somebody.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.710
So the CEO of BlaBlaCar says
that people join because they

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.610
want to save money.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.794
That makes sense,
that's a logical reason.

00:22:43.794 --> 00:22:45.460
They want to travel
more often, and they

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.450
don't want to spend too much.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.534
But they keep using it,
not because of the money,

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.950
but because it
allows them to make

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.127
social connections that they
never would have had before.

00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:56.210
I thought that BlaBlaCar
was going to be basically

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.200
just college students.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.700
Right?

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.540
That's kind of who
you'd expect to take it.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.580
And there are some
college students.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.010
But if you look at
their demographics,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.468
they're actually
reaching all sorts

00:23:03.468 --> 00:23:05.270
of different age brackets.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.130
Typically, actually,
it's the older drivers

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.550
who have the cars, and the
younger riders who pay to ride.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.350
And so it's an
interesting way to create

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.240
these different
intergenerational connections

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.420
that never would have
actually happened before.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.450
So when you use
BlaBlaCar, you save money.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.450
And you usually get
to know somebody,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.040
and you get a good story.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.890
So I want to tell
you one of these.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.200
So there was a guy
who had just retired.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.800
He used to have a big car
to drive around his son, who

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.010
did a lot of sports and
had a lot of sports gear

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.770
that he needed to carry around.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.230
When his son went off to
school he retired, and said,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.230
I want to spend more time in
Saint-Malo sailing my boat.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.470
Sounds great.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.320
But unfortunately,
he realized that that

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.570
was going to be really
expensive and difficult for him

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.670
to afford.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.780
So he discovered that BlaBlaCar
would allow him to share rides

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.169
with different people.

00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.960
And that was great.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.802
He got to do a lot more sailing.

00:23:53.802 --> 00:23:55.510
But over time, he
realized the thing that

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.220
contributed most to having
an enjoyable retirement

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.850
was not more time on his boat.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.630
But he created two new
social networks, one in Paris

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.500
and one in Saint-Malo
with all the people

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.730
he met using BlaBlaCar.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.990
So this is how BlaBlaCar
is connecting the world.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.800
They're making travel
more affordable,

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.810
and creating new social
connections because

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.230
of information being able to
share easily between people.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.190
So next up we have Dexcom.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.360
They're here too,
today, which is great.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.200
And they're making some of the
world's most advanced blood

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.049
glucose monitoring technology.

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:28.840
And their focused on
improving human health

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.270
through innovation.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.500
So every time I look at
these stats on the screen,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.740
I get a little bit depressed.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.290
I've looked at them a few times.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.750
29 million Americans have
been diagnosed with diabetes.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.800
And when we say
diagnosed, that means

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.650
that there's a lot more people
who have diabetes but are not

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.040
diagnosed, or people who
are pre-diabetic and will

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.890
become diagnosed soon.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.430
But even still, that 29 million
is 9.3% of the population.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.640
And worse, 200,000 of those
people are under age 20.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.610
It's also led to a
ridiculous amount of cost

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.420
in terms of lost wages and
medical expenses in the US.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.740
So if you don't have diabetes
yet you should be happy.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.530
Because it's a lot of work.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.620
I have a few friends
who have diabetes,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.245
and when they're
going through a period

00:25:16.245 --> 00:25:18.820
where their diabetes is
getting difficult to control,

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.330
they have to test their
blood sugar all the time,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.430
and that could mean
before meals, a few times

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.420
after a meal, before
and after exercise,

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.080
in the middle of the night,
any time they don't feel well.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.455
And they have to make sure
that their blood sugar doesn't

00:25:33.455 --> 00:25:36.470
get too high, and it
doesn't get too low either.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.220
And then the information
that you get back

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.750
from a typical blood glucose
test is not very useful.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.840
What does 95 mean?

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.000
What's going to happen
a half hour from now?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.210
How do I know if 95 means that
I should eat some candy now,

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.090
because my blood sugar's
about to go too low,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.881
or I should take some
insulin, because it's

00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:54.410
about to go too high?

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.720
And one patient described this
to Dexcom as basically this.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.480
It's like I'm driving down
a winding road at night,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.490
and I only turn on the
headlights occasionally.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.290
That is scary, when your
life could depend on this.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.970
So the Dexcom team thought
that there must be a better way

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.700
to be able to deal with this.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.350
So they've created this
continuous glucose monitor.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.960
And you wear it on your
body, as you can see here.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.180
So instead of pricking your
finger a few times every day,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.769
you just get this
continuous graph.

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.060
Basically it does the equivalent
of checking your blood

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.294
sugar every five
minutes, and it gives you

00:26:28.294 --> 00:26:30.460
the full picture of how
your blood sugar is reacting

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.800
in terms of, you know,
you eat something,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.070
does it go up and down?

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.590
You go and do some
exercise, how does it react?

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.850
And this makes it easier
to monitor your diabetes

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.070
and keep it under control.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.560
So does anyone here have anyone
in their family with diabetes?

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.101
Maybe a friend?

00:26:46.101 --> 00:26:46.600
Yeah?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.141
A few people.

00:26:47.141 --> 00:26:47.970
I do.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.200
And so this can be
a scary experience

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.810
that you have to manage,
especially if that person who

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.520
has diabetes is a child.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.126
So Dexcom, next week-- we're
very excited about this--

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:01.000
they're going to be
launching their companion

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.990
app on Google Play.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.410
So the whole idea
here is that a parent

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.220
could use this app on
their Android phone

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.830
to check on their
child's blood sugar.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.490
And they can even get alerts
if that blood sugar goes out

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.066
of the safe range.

00:27:12.066 --> 00:27:13.440
And this is great
because parents

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.060
don't have to buy
a separate device,

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.070
or carry it around with them.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.030
They can just use their
existing Android phone

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.110
to stay on top of
their kids health.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.190
And finally, we're
incredibly excited

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.910
about a special
integration that Dexcom

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.630
is doing with Android
Wear's latest technology.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.430
So we now have something
on Android Wear

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.010
called direct connect.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.840
And the whole idea here is that
you can connect your Dexcom

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.020
monitor to your Android Wear
device, without your phone.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.720
So, why is this really cool?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.430
So imagine that you're a kid in
school and you have diabetes.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.805
And you need to be checking
your blood sugar all the time

00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:46.690
to make sure that you stay safe.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.460
And you know before, you'd
have to look at your monitor

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.180
all the time.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.180
Imagine being a kid and
you're pulling something

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.264
out your pocket that looks
like this all the time.

00:27:54.264 --> 00:27:56.388
Other kids are probably
going to be looking at you,

00:27:56.388 --> 00:27:58.010
and you may or
may not want that.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.320
Or you could have it
connect to your phone.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.610
And that's definitely
better, and you're pulling

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.859
your phone out of your pocket.

00:28:02.859 --> 00:28:05.080
That's a bit better, but
it's kind of a hassle.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.040
Maybe the teacher's wondering
if you're texting people.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.540
Right?

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.710
So you want to have
something that's more subtle.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.930
And the best option
here is to just have

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.251
it go directly to your watch.

00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:14.750
So you can just
glance at your watch

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.400
as though you were
checking the time.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.899
And you can see if your blood
sugar is staying within range.

00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:20.144
That's really awesome.

00:28:20.144 --> 00:28:21.560
And it can allow
kids to do things

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.300
that they might have felt a
little scared doing before.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.790
Like, if you have a
waterproof Android Wear watch,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.740
you can now use that to check
your blood sugar in the pool,

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.791
without even getting out.

00:28:30.791 --> 00:28:31.290
Right?

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:31.870
Wouldn't that be great?

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.250
You could just go swimming.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.400
And this can be really
critical, because exercise

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.983
can be actually one
of the things that

00:28:36.983 --> 00:28:39.677
can very quickly push your blood
sugar out of the safe range.

00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:41.260
Or imagine that
you're playing soccer,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.885
and you can just
check your watch again

00:28:42.885 --> 00:28:45.570
without having to try
to take some big phone

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.696
or monitor, and try to clip it
into your clothes somewhere.

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:50.070
It really gives
a lot of freedom.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.580
Or let's say that you
have a really young child.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.230
Maybe that child
might misplace things.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.730
Right?

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.519
We all lost things as a kid.

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:58.060
And so if you just
give them a watch,

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.774
and they can clip
it onto their wrist,

00:28:59.774 --> 00:29:01.690
then they don't have to
worry about misplacing

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.890
something expensive.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.560
So this is a glimpse of
what's being possible.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.080
And Dexcom is creating all
these great new accessible and

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.450
flexible experiences
that make it a lot more

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.585
convenient and a lot
more discreet to keep

00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:15.960
an eye on your
blood sugar and be

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.680
able to monitor diabetes
and manage it well,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.480
using your smartphone
or your watch,

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.097
whatever works well for you.

00:29:22.097 --> 00:29:23.930
And they've actually
been able to expand now

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.410
to 39 countries globally,
including the US, India,

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.797
Europe, and also South America.

00:29:29.797 --> 00:29:31.380
And this is saving
families a good bit

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.364
of money, because if you already
have an Android, or Android

00:29:34.364 --> 00:29:36.780
Wear device, you don't need
to buy something else in order

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.330
to do this monitoring.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.330
And you know, Dexcom has made
a huge amount of innovation

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.130
here to be able to use
new technologies to make

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.960
critical health data
available, and accessible,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.010
and shareable as you
want at any time.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.530
So before we talk
about our next app,

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.960
we're going to
have a little quiz.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.700
So does anyone know
which film industry makes

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.937
the most movies every year?

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.620
Bollywood.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.180
I heard someone say Bollywood.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.900
OK.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.820
Yep.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.700
You get an A, it's Bollywood.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.050
OK, so where is
Hollywood in this list?

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.730
Any guesses?

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.550
Three.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.490
OK.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:21.060
Another A. So who
is in number two?

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.350
Hollywood, Bollywood,
and who's in the middle?

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.350
OK.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.130
It's actually Nollywood.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.720
That's the Nigerian
film industry.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.630
And not only are they number two
in terms of the number of films

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.960
made, they're also
number three globally

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.980
in terms of the revenue
in their film industry.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.410
And so we're going to talk
about an app called Afrinolly

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.570
based in Lagos, Nigeria, which
is a mobile entertainment app.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.260
So Nollywood makes about
1,000 movies per year,

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.007
and they have a pretty low
average production cost.

00:30:56.007 --> 00:30:58.090
And they've grown so popular
that they've actually

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.620
become the second largest
employer in all of Nigeria.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.300
And so directors
recently have been

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.590
focused on making even higher
quality production value films,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.110
using new technology to have
very high resolution video

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:14.037
and audio, and producing
great experiences.

00:31:14.037 --> 00:31:15.370
So what doesn't make sense here?

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.970
We have 173 million
people in Nigeria,

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.250
and we have 50 movie theaters.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.390
So how does that even work?

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.890
Right?

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.410
What's going on?

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.840
And what we learned is
that the Nigeria movie

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.390
culture is based around DVDs.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.670
And this can work really well.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.630
You go to a city
or town in Nigeria,

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.450
there's often stores and
even people in the streets

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.580
selling DVDs.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.640
And it's basically great.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.570
Until DVD making technology
got way cheap, maybe

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.680
even too cheap.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.090
And the problem now is that
there's a serious problem

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.740
with piracy of Nollywood DVDs.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.176
So if you're a
filmmaker in Nigeria,

00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:55.800
you can actually have
a serious problem

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.790
in terms of making money
to be able to create

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.950
more great films.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.950
So the makers of Nollywood
saw this problem.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.240
But again, they also
saw an opportunity.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.220
Because there was a new trend
also happening in Nigeria.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.910
And yep, it's the
mobile phones again.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.430
Almost every adult in
Nigeria has a mobile phone,

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.880
and smartphones are
growing really quickly too.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.510
They're also seeing a lot higher
rates of mobile data access,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.760
and a lot of adults in Nigeria
also get great WiFi service

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.290
when they're at work, too.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.980
So this meant a new way
for Nollywood directors

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.700
to distribute their films
to all of their fans.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.920
And so it's also easier
for Nollywood films

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.070
to reach the global
fanbase more quickly.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.720
So people in Nigeria
are obviously

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.650
fans, but also people
all over Africa,

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:42.360
and Brazil is also a huge
market for Nollywood films too.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.280
So Afrinolly won the
Android Developer Challenge

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.730
four years ago, in 2011.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.640
And the founders got
the idea for their app

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.370
because they saw some data
on the top Google searches

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.550
all over Africa.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.490
And a lot of them were searches
about Nollywood movies.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.470
But at the time, there was
no IMDb for African cinema,

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.640
there really wasn't
anywhere to send people.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.290
So they decided to
create something,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.860
and they built Afrinolly to
make this information broadly

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.940
available.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.510
So they won the big
prize here, $25,000,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.740
and they decided to invest
that money in marketing

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.440
the new Afrinolly app.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.510
And today Afrinolly is
basically your typical startup.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.860
They started with a
handful of people, now

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.950
they have a team of 12.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.180
They're all based
in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.940
And their technical team, five
people there on the right,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.270
are responsible for building
the Afrinolly app, as well

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.670
as all of the technical services
that Afrinolly works with.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.900
So we said that Afrinolly
started out as a place

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.580
to read about the latest
Nollywood news and gossip,

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.800
but now their app has over
four million downloads,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.310
and Android is their
fastest growing platform.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.310
And this has been building
on the massive growth

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.230
of Android in Nigeria
and the rest of Africa.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.310
So of course, the set of
features that they offer

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.510
have grown, too.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.100
In addition to
news, you can also

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.510
watch the latest Nollywood
trailers and other video

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.550
content.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.350
And now they're about
to take the next step.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.120
We mentioned before
the piracy problem,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.330
and how they want to
help people make money

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.760
so that they can
make more films.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.600
So they're going to
be able to let people

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.690
by full-length movies
within the Afrinolly app.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.500
This is going to create a new
revenue stream for filmmakers,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.429
and people can either
stream these movies

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.060
or download them, at
work, maybe on the WiFi,

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.685
and then watch them
at home offline.

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:23.560
So they had this app,
and they wondered well,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.159
let's say that--
what if we imagine

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.969
a world where most
of the movie viewing

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.000
happened on mobile phones.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.389
What would be the best sort
of content format for that?

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.650
And they thought
about short films.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.860
And that was cool, because
a lot of young directors

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.940
make short films as well.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.030
It's a great way for
people to get started.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.460
But the problem is, there wasn't
a well established framework

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.810
in the customer's mind to
actually be able to make money

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.300
on short films.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.130
So they started a
short film competition,

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.170
and they now giveaway $100,000
worth of prizes every year.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.460
In the first year they
got 500 submissions

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.040
from African filmmakers
in 14 different countries.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.290
And then the Ford
Foundation actually

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.860
gave them a grant
to train and mentor

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.600
young filmmakers who had
been part of the short film

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.665
competition.

00:35:05.665 --> 00:35:07.040
And they ended up
making a series

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.582
of films designed to drive
social change in West Africa.

00:35:10.582 --> 00:35:12.040
And these films
are now distributed

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.260
through the Afrinolly app.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:21.510
So, maybe we can
try to load this.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.550
We have no slide.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.800
Hey.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.900
All right, all right.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.240
I'm going to describe
what's on the slide.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.110
So what we're seeing
in our mind's eye

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.450
is something called
the Afrinolly space.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.490
So it's really cool.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:40.780
You get to see video studios--
we're going to go back.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.840
All right, we're
going to go back.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.210
So you get to see video studios.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.640
You get to see lots
of places to work.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.570
You get a high
tech editing space,

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.670
where you can use a high
bandwidth connection and a lot

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.240
of advanced video equipment.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.940
And you know, they're able
to basically give filmmakers

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.800
a place to be creative.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.480
And so they're
going to start doing

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.970
something new in the
Afrinolly space this year.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.420
They're actually going
to start teaching coding.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.540
They're going to give a coding
class to a bunch of high school

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.123
students, and they're actually
going to teach more than coding

00:36:14.123 --> 00:36:14.690
to them, too.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.240
They're going to be able to
learn how to do filmmaking,

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.500
how to do cinematography,
screenwriting, and more.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.160
And so they're hoping that
a lot of these young people

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.860
will be able to create
high quality films,

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.760
not only when they're
teenagers, but actually

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.220
going to pursue careers in
the film industry in Nigeria.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.420
So that's how Afrinolly
is using mobile technology

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.044
to be able to connect
film fans with filmmakers

00:36:37.044 --> 00:36:38.460
in a new way that
would never have

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.940
been possible before
a few years ago.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.110
So now we're going to
talk about Aviro Health.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.610
I'm happy that their
slide got to be

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.193
on the screen for a
little bit longer,

00:36:46.193 --> 00:36:48.080
because they're pretty awesome.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.660
So-- whoa.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.580
All right.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.950
So they built an app,
and the whole idea

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.340
is that it's able to give nurses
up-to-date decision support

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.950
to prescribe the right
anti-viral drugs for HIV

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.050
patients.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.500
And they've been working with
a developer called Mobile

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.219
Kinetics based in Romania.

00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:07.760
And they're also
working on a new app

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.240
to be able to connect
nurses with experts

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.730
to consult on the most complex
HIV cases that they have.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:15.920
All right.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.650
Everyone cross your fingers.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.780
Think good thoughts.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.939
Hey, fantastic.

00:37:22.939 --> 00:37:25.230
Has anyone here tried DuoLingo
to learn a new language?

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.700
I've tried it, to brush
up on my rusty French.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.780
Fantastic.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.740
So it is now used by 95 million
people to learn a language,

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.390
completely for free.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.910
And learning a language
can be really fun.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.130
But it can do so much more.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.690
Learning a new language can
also break down barriers

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.350
and increase social
mobility for people.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.640
I learned, talking to their
CEO, that there's actually

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.680
a billion people
globally who are

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.920
learning English to
be able to get a job

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.110
and improve their life.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:58.050
So DuoLingo's going to be able
to help them get to that goal.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.900
And education, we've
seen, is a lot better

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.860
when we have students, teachers,
and parents all connected

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.240
and on the same page.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.100
And Remind has made
a new app that's

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.630
been able to connect 35% of
all US K through 12 teachers

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.100
with their students and parents
to have engaging conversations.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.280
RunKeeper and LoseIt have
used new Google Fit technology

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.010
to create a
personalized work out.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.711
They can measure
which doughnut you ate

00:38:21.711 --> 00:38:23.460
and then tell you
exactly how far you have

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.070
to run to burn it back off.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.820
And Go-Jek in Indonesia
has made a service

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.480
that's now the
fastest way around--

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.790
to get around Jakarta or other
Indonesian service cities.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.650
They have over 3,000
registered drivers today.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.460
We also have Mango Health.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.520
We have Jumia.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.500
We have Best Fiends,
raising money for malaria.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.430
We have WeVideo.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.770
And I could go on for
basically the rest of the day,

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.600
talking about all the
different developers

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.650
that we have here who
are trying to have

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.180
a positive impact on the world.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.580
So today's 13-year-olds don't
have a SPARCstation, right?

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.500
They have this, they have
access to this thing.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.420
And they grew up thinking
it's normal to have

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.140
an app like Mango
Health that reminds you

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.910
to take a critical medication.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.365
Or an app like
Go-Jek, that means

00:39:09.365 --> 00:39:11.740
that when you go to Indonesia
you can summon a motorcycle

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.620
taxi like that.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.280
And they're starting to do some
pretty cool stuff with that.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.540
I think back to my
13-year-old self,

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.990
my SPARCstation, my blue links.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.610
And I wrote a paper.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.230
But these kids are doing
so much more than that.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.070
Here are three teenage
siblings in Georgia.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.310
So their parents worked
in corporate America

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.880
and managed software developers.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.530
They saw all the benefits that
these software developers were

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.800
getting by having those
skills, and always encouraged

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.580
their kids to study
computer science,

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.400
even from an early age.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.710
And as many of you know,
the world where we live,

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.970
it's not perfect.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.610
And recently in the
US we've had a lot

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.050
of concerns around law
enforcement and civil rights.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:56.190
So these teenagers, in response,
decided to build an app.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.800
Because that's what we do today.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.910
And they're enabling
people to understand

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.000
what their rights are.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And they're also able to
share their experiences

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.840
with law enforcement, both
positive and negative.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.120
The experience here is
to improve transparency

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.390
in the whole process, and
to give a voice to people

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.020
who didn't have one before.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.830
So in case you're
wondering, this app

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.680
now has an average rating of
4.5 stars, and tens of thousands

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.070
of installs.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.060
These young developers have shed
light on an important issue,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.080
and it's really powerful.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.100
So when I was 13, I
wanted more people

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.850
to have access to
information so that they

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.187
could empower themselves
and their communities.

00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:33.020
And I can't wait to see
what the world looks

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.960
like when these teenagers
here are up on this stage

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.670
telling their story.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.570
Thank you.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.920
[APPLAUSE]
