Julie Nkodo:
I'm Julie Nkodo. I'm a junior, and I'm artistic director of BAC.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.570 position:83%
Lucy Fang:
I'm Lucy Fang. I'm also a junior and director of BAC.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.680 position:98%
Julie Nkodo:
BAC is the Black Arts Dance Company, and we're primarily a hip hop company today.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.350 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
The two biggest events we have are our semester shows, one in the fall one in the spring.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.850 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
And these are the shows that each of our members choreographs a piece and the entire production

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.730
Lucy Fang:
is run by our group.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.789 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
Our spring show was called "Beast Mode." "Beast mode" just basically means going really hard

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.929 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
on something or doing something really well. And it applies to all situations in life.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.280 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
The first real step is choreography proposals. That is the first company rehearsal of the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.640 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
year, the first meeting where everyone gets together. Dancers who have a piece idea in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.880 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
mind will propose four 8-counts by performing it in front of the entire group. After everyone

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.170 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
proposes then the artistic director, who is Julie, she gets together with her assistant

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.030 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
artistic director and they try to select a variety that will help the show be diverse

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.280
Lucy Fang:
and stimulating.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.270 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
Each piece takes about eight hours to learn. So you break that into four two-hour rehearsals

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.200 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
and we learn each piece in one week. So you will just have four rehearsals throughout

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.390 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
the week. Then up until the show, every Saturday at company rehearsal you perform that piece again

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.030 position:63%
Lucy Fang:
just to ensure that you won't forget it.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.680 position:98%
Julie Nkodo:
Hell Week is really stressful just because every choreographer needs a cleaning and spacing in Frist.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.720 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
And what that means is that they need to clean the little details of their

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.770 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
piece in a studio, and then they need to go to Frist and have a rehearsal on the stage

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.060
Julie Nkodo:
just to space out the formations.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.739 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
One of the things that actually takes a lot of work is costumes. People are just like,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.959 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
"Oh, they look nice on stage," but there is a lot of work that goes behind that. And our

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.400 position:98%
Julie Nkodo:
costume chairs -- Marvah and Lauren Brown -- they've been ordering costumes pretty much

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.989 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
since the pieces have been selected -- so, they are contacting each choreographer to

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.989 position:98%
Julie Nkodo:
figure out what their theme is and trying to find costumes for each dancer on a budget.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.599 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
And we really appreciated our lighting designer and operator this semester.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.530
Julie Nkodo:
Oh, he was amazing.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.629 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
Both our lighting designer Lehman Garrison and our operator Dave Holtz, they were absolutely

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.629 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
wonderful in their ability to pick up the lighting cues and listen to the music and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.150 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
just be really able to tell where certain cues are supposed to go off.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.030 position:97%
Lucy Fang:
When you're in the moment, you want to go full out. And it doesn't matter how many

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.159 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
run-throughs, or how tired you are from the day, how little sleep you've been getting

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.209 position:98%
Lucy Fang:
because it's Hell Week. It just really becomes you expressing yourself, having fun on the

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.000 position:77%
Lucy Fang:
stage, and really conveying that to the audience.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.799 position:98%
Julie Nkodo:
I love hip-hop. I can just listen to it all day. And the way that I express that love

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:25.000 position:97%
Julie Nkodo:
is through dance. And it is just like, dancing is everything. It has made my Princeton experience.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.090
