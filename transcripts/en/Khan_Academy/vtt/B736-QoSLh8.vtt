00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.182
- [Narrator] In the last few videos

00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:04.349
we talked about the Greco Persian wars

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:08.899
or we could say the
Persian invasion of Greece.

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.750
And in the first wave, the
first Persian invasion,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.298
the Athenians were able
to stop them at Marathon.

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:16.979
And then in the second Persian invasion

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:19.679
led by Xerxes they were able to route

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.750
the Persian navy at Salamis

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.629
and eventually get rid of
the Persians all together

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.462
at Plataea in 479 BCE.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.550
So at that point the Greeks,
especially the city-states,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.670
the powerful city-states
of Sparta and Athens,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.039
they're fighting on the same side.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.339
But as we'll see in this video

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.890
this all starts to break down

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.880
and they will eventually
be at war with each other

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.401
and a very ugly war.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.369
You know a lot of times when
we think about these things

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:52.950
thousands of years later it
might seem somewhat romantic,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.110
the stuff of stories and adventures,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.987
but these things are ugly,
people are getting killed,

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:01.159
people are getting tortured,
civilians are dying,

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.259
whole cities are being destroyed.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.139
Now whenever we talk about history

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:07.141
it's very important to think about

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:08.801
where your story is coming from

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.733
and you should always
have a nice dose of doubt

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.472
on what were the motivations
of the person who wrote it

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.630
or how much can they
really know about things.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.623
And when we talked about
the Persian invasions

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:21.381
of Greece, or the Greco-Persian wars,

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.383
that was coming to us from
someone who is often known

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:27.079
as the father of history,

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.173
I guess that's a very
Greco-centric perspective,

00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:33.374
but that is Herodutus.

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:35.452
And now we're going to
start getting our accounts

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:38.406
from someone who wrote the famous history

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:41.573
of the Peloponnesian War
and that is Thucydides.

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:42.853
And they're so closely linked,

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:44.072
especially because they're giving history

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:47.343
of essentially this fifth century BCE

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:50.092
that this is actually a
double bust of the two,

00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:51.981
Herodutus and Thucydides.

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:53.061
So once again a lot of the story

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:57.144
that I'm about to tell,
is coming via Thucydides.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.584
So as soon as the Persians are,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.910
they've been defeated, they leave.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.564
You might remember that the Athenians

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:11.000
had to escape to Salamis,
that's where you also had

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.663
the naval route of the Persian navy,

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:16.272
and so the Athenians decide hey let's move

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:17.952
back to Athens.

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:20.562
And in deciding to move back to Athens,

00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:23.610
right over there, they
say okay well we want

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.223
to build a wall around
Athens in case anyone else

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:29.162
wants to invade us.

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:31.522
And you might say okay maybe
they are somewhat concerned

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.444
about the Persians, but
you could also argue

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.583
that they are somewhat
concerned about the Spartans

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:39.750
who are famous for having
this very powerful army.

00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.743
And so they start the construction

00:02:42.743 --> 00:02:45.962
on what's often called the long wall

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:48.052
and it's a way for them to have access

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:51.071
to the sea and to protect their city

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.723
in the event of a siege.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.681
Now if you take the other side,

00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:58.270
if you think about what's going on

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.122
in the minds of the Spartans,

00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:03.631
they are thinking okay
you know for a long time

00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:06.634
we were really the dominant military power

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:10.082
but what we've just seen
with the Greco-Persian wars

00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:13.351
is this Athenian navy
is actually quite strong

00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:15.083
and in some ways, in fact in a lot of ways

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:16.761
you can argue that they are the ones

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:20.070
that were able to beat off
the Persians at Salamis.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.172
That the navy was essential there.

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:25.323
So Sparta's feeling a
little bit threatened.

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:26.879
And in particular they don't like the idea

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.062
of this wall because here you
have the city-state Athens

00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:33.621
with this very strong navy,
now they're building a wall.

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:34.892
Sparta says hey if they have a wall

00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:37.350
it's going to be very hard
for us if they don't do

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.793
what, you know, if they start
exerting too much influence,

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:44.571
it's going to be hard for
us to take down Athens.

00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:48.446
They instead suggest hey Athens
why don't you build a wall

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:51.352
at the Isthmus of
Corinth, right over here.

00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:53.561
You might notice the geography of Greece.

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.311
You have this little, I
guess you could call it

00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:57.741
this little strip of land that connects

00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:59.633
the mainland I guess you could say,

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:03.300
to this peninsula, this
very large peninsula

00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:07.142
which is called Peloponnese,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:08.692
which is where Sparta is.

00:04:08.692 --> 00:04:09.821
And you could imagine that this is

00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:11.281
a very strategic location.

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.542
Anyone who wants to
conquer the Peloponnese

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:18.081
by land is going to have
to go through there.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:19.842
The Athenians are of
course no, we care about

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.780
protecting ourselves and so they start

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.092
to build this wall to protect themselves

00:04:26.092 --> 00:04:29.270
which the Spartans already
are not so happy about.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.581
Now the other thing that the Athenians do,

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.480
they continue to build
up their naval power.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.681
They see hey this is a very useful thing.

00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:39.241
They start connecting
with a bunch of allies

00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:41.092
around the Aegean, some on islands,

00:04:41.092 --> 00:04:44.425
some on the coast of Anatolia over here.

00:04:45.803 --> 00:04:47.742
And they meet on this island of Delos

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:48.992
which you can't see here.

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:51.231
It's a very small island.

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.398
And they all agree to
contribute their shared navies

00:04:56.232 --> 00:05:00.512
and to contribute money
in order to continue

00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:02.481
to fight off the Persians
wherever they are.

00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:04.360
You know these Persians
did this injustice to us.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.370
Now let's go on the offensive.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.662
And they form what is
called the Delian League.

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:12.552
Now once again Sparta is
not so happy about this

00:05:12.552 --> 00:05:14.233
because more and more it becomes clear

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.343
that this Delian League, Athens isn't just

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:18.543
a participant in the Delian League,

00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:20.613
Athens is starting to
run the Delian League.

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:23.500
And when people try to drop
out of the Delian League

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.823
over time Athens starts to exert itself.

00:05:25.823 --> 00:05:27.201
So the Delian League is really starting

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:31.418
more and more and more
into an Athenian empire.

00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:34.057
So once again Athens proved itself,

00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:37.237
its navy proved itself to be
very powerful in this war.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:38.729
Sparta's getting insecure.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.426
Athens doesn't listen to
Sparta about this wall

00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:43.478
and decides to start building it.

00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:45.620
Sparta's feeling even more insecure.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.160
Athens is starting to
create this Delian League

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.869
which is really an Athenian empire,

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.497
even more insecure.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:55.664
And it kind of gets a little
bit more intense in 464.

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:58.857
So there are some accounts that Sparta

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:01.418
around this time was already planning

00:06:01.418 --> 00:06:03.668
to invade Athens.

00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:06.010
To say hey these folks
are getting too powerful,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.708
let's just put them in their place.

00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:10.068
But at around that time, in 464,

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:13.235
you have a major earthquake in Sparta.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:18.749
And so it demolishes
large parts of the city.

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.937
And when that earthquake happens,

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:23.437
the Spartan Helots who I guess

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.908
the best way you can view
them, they are slaves

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:28.938
and I encourage you to
read more about them.

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:30.980
They were treated horribly.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.080
And in Sparta the accounts
are that there were seven

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.968
of these Helots, of these
slaves, for every Spartan.

00:06:36.968 --> 00:06:39.289
And so the Helots start a revolt

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.808
and Sparta goes to the other city-states

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:44.860
of Greece and says help
us put down this revolt

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.889
that happened right after our earthquake.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.888
And so Athens agrees.

00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:52.471
They send 4,000 citizen
soldiers to Sparta.

00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:56.137
The citizen soldiers are famous Hoplites

00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:57.909
to help put down the revolt.

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.707
But once again Sparta is feeling insecure.

00:07:00.707 --> 00:07:03.929
They say hey why did
they send these soldiers.

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:06.258
Maybe they say they want
to put down this rebellion,

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.798
but we Sparta we're at kind
of a fairly vulnerable state

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:11.830
right here, what if they
Athenians took the side

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.997
of the Helots.

00:07:14.248 --> 00:07:17.609
Well then they might be
able to take over Sparta.

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:21.330
So they send the Athenian Hoplites back.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.078
They said you know we
don't need your help.

00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:26.029
And so you can imagine the Athenians now

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.539
are starting to take significant offense

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.570
to how the Spartans are treating them.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.537
And then you fast
forward a little bit more

00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:37.287
to 459 BCE and you have
two allies of Sparta,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.128
Megara and Corinth and they're right

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:43.778
in this very strategic location,

00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:46.039
that little land, that land connection

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:47.887
that land bridge between the mainland

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:51.478
and the Peloponnese and there is a dispute

00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:53.338
between these two allies of Sparta,

00:07:53.338 --> 00:07:55.149
between Corinth and Megara.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:57.648
And Athens decides to intervene

00:07:57.648 --> 00:08:00.458
and form an alliance with Megara.

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.829
Well you can imagine
you know this insecurity

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:04.707
has been building up in Sparta

00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:07.290
for at this point over a decade

00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:09.958
and so it all comes to head

00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.835
and they start having skirmishes

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:13.859
and they start essentially going

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.447
to war with each other.

00:08:15.447 --> 00:08:16.918
They have these sporadic skirmishes

00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:19.086
over the next 15 years.

00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:21.157
And this period right over here

00:08:21.157 --> 00:08:25.074
from roughly 460 or 459,
for the next 15 years,

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:29.657
this is often referred to as
the First Peloponnesian War

00:08:29.657 --> 00:08:31.219
because once again you have Sparta

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.437
and its allies starting to get into

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.837
all of these skirmishes
with Athens and its allies.

00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:37.987
But this isn't the Peloponnesian War.

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:39.736
The Peloponnesian War is going to come

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:42.826
a little bit about 15 years later.

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:44.686
The first Peloponnesian
War that we were just

00:08:44.686 --> 00:08:46.857
talking about, that eventually ends

00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:49.618
what's called a 30 years
peace, peace treaty

00:08:49.618 --> 00:08:51.098
which only lasts for 15 years.

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.417
But the whole time the Athenians,

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:55.066
their navy is growing more powerful,

00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:56.767
they keep getting in each others way

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:59.068
and annoying each other and
so the Peloponnesian War

00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:00.917
which we'll talk about in more detail

00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:04.750
will occur at the end
of the fifth century BCE

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:09.947
and it will conclude with
Sparta being victorious.

00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:12.605
But in the process most of Greece

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:14.438
is significantly hurt.

00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:19.418
And all of the city-states or
the significant city-states

00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:21.998
of Greece are significantly weakened.

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:24.614
And so that sets things up for

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:27.781
the fourth century BCE where it leaves

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.646
the city-states of Greece vulnerable

00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:36.456
to attack from the north,
in particular Macedonia.

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:39.868
And we'll see that actually
several videos in the future.
