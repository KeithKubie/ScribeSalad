00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:02.993
- [Instructor] So in the last
video we were talking about

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:06.576
the system of labor in
the Chesapeake area,

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.081
surrounding the Chesapeake Bay,

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:14.135
in the early English colonies in America.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.520
And one thing that seemed
a little bit strange there

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.687
was that even though the first
ship with enslaved Africans

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:24.891
arrived in Virginia in 1619,

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:31.992
slavery wasn't actually
the dominant form of labor

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:37.335
in Virginia until much
later, in the late 1600s.

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:42.971
In fact, the vast majority
of laborers in Virginia

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:46.992
were in fact white indentured servants.

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:51.705
And these indentured servants
would come from England,

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:55.607
and the planter that
they proposed to work for

00:00:55.607 --> 00:01:00.083
would pay their passage
across the Atlantic.

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.314
And in exchange the servant would

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:05.220
agree to work for that planter

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.314
for a period of three to seven years.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:09.901
And this is an example of what

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.450
one of these indentures
might have looked like.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.605
It's in old-timey writing,
so it's a little hard to see,

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.672
but here you can see
that there's three years

00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:21.211
is the amount of time
that this person promises.

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.194
This is from Pennsylvania.

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:25.701
Kinda gives you a good sense
of how someone would say,

00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:28.857
"Alright I'm gonna work for
this person for this long,

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:31.171
"in exchange for my passage,

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.090
"and it's a contract."

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.700
And this was a pretty
good deal for planters

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.392
because for every person that they

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:40.266
brought over from England,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.583
they got another 50 acres of land,

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:45.011
meaning that if you had
the money to bring over

00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:46.509
quite a few servants,

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.850
you could expand your
landholdings very fast.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.952
And the other good thing about this,

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:53.974
at least in terms of the planters

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:56.295
was that these indentured servants

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:58.962
had a pretty high rate of death.

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:04.755
It was not healthy to live in
this swampy area of Virginia.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.863
So quite frequently, planters
didn't actually have to

00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:09.748
make good on their promise

00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:12.121
to set these indentured servants up

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.099
with some land of their
own, some tools to work it,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.023
because they didn't survive
through their indenture.

00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:21.405
So if this system of indentured servitude,

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:25.621
and the headright system
that gave planters more land

00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:27.920
for bringing over more servants,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.131
was working out so well for them,

00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.199
why did African slavery become

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.366
the dominant form of labor

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:39.536
in Virginia, starting about 1700?

00:02:41.507 --> 00:02:44.665
Now when we think about
tobacco cultivation,

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.315
and later, cotton cultivation,

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.809
in the American south
before the Civil War,

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.311
what we think of is
enslaved African laborers.

00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.633
And indeed, by the year 1700,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:59.800
about 15% of the population
living in Virginia

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:02.436
was enslaved Africans,

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:06.347
going from just a handful at
the beginning of the century.

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:09.816
So what caused this incredible transition

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:13.273
in not only labor, but also racism,

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:15.663
to happen in early America?

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:17.972
Well there's one major
event that historians

00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:22.663
tend to point to as a turning
point in American slavery.

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:26.830
And that is the rebellion led
by Nathaniel Bacon in 1676.

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.422
So let's talk a little
bit more about that.

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:33.984
So to understand Bacon's rebellion,

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:35.951
we have to backtrack a little bit,

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.022
and talk about the
development of political power

00:03:39.022 --> 00:03:41.022
and tobacco in Virginia.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.092
So in 1619, the Virginia
Company established

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.975
the first government in Virginia.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.058
It was called the House of Burgesses.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:55.791
And this is really important
because it is, in effect,

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:59.958
the first at least
semi-democratic form of government

00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:04.132
in the new world.

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:06.858
In a way, it's kind of like a parliament

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:09.806
that was set up for Virginia

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.339
so that they could debate local issues.

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.196
And it's going to be
the House of Burgesses

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:17.049
and its later House of Delegates

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.986
that ends up leading the charge
for the American Revolution

00:04:20.986 --> 00:04:23.636
more than a century later than this.

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:25.453
But as we think about the
way that political power

00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:27.228
was distributed in Virginia,

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:30.422
you can guess who might have a lot of say

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:31.895
in the House of Burgesses,

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:34.727
and these are the tobacco planters.

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:37.496
So the government of Virginia,

00:04:37.496 --> 00:04:41.936
although it is a democracy
of these land-owning men,

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:45.958
is still got most of the
power at the very top.

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.659
'Cause as we talked
about in the last video,

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.958
the power system in Virginia looked like

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.017
a handful of planters at the top,

00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:55.850
a very small number of

00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.841
free white farmers

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.145
who had their own land, but
nothing like the gigantic

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:09.641
tracts of tobacco plantations
that the planters had,

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.474
then a whole lot of white
indentured servants,

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:18.315
who have very little political power,

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:23.493
since they are at basically
the mercy of the planters.

00:05:23.493 --> 00:05:27.326
And then, just a tiny
handful of black slaves.

00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.583
And in this time period,
white indentured servants

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:36.750
and black slaves, black free
people, also a tiny number,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.106
didn't have that much difference

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:43.272
when it came to political rights.

00:05:43.272 --> 00:05:46.015
In fact, white indentured
servants frequently complained

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:49.434
that they felt that slaves
were treated better than them.

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:54.352
Which may have been the case,
because they were worth more.

00:05:54.352 --> 00:05:56.616
Remember they were worth
hundreds of pounds,

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:58.514
whereas white indentured servants

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:02.580
cost just a couple of pounds
to come over, frequently died,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.680
so they were less of an
investment than slaves.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.436
The other important factor here

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:10.660
is just what it takes to grow tobacco.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.981
Tobacco is a labor-intensive
crop, we know,

00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.903
but it's also kind of a
crop that is extremely hard

00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:18.527
on the soil.

00:06:18.527 --> 00:06:20.796
It depletes the soil fast.

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:25.773
Which means that there is a
constant need for new soil.

00:06:25.773 --> 00:06:28.443
And when you're coming from the coast,

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:31.040
here's our Atlantic Ocean over here,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.138
and this is Virginia,

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:37.055
and our Jamestown colony
along the River James,

00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:41.441
more and more planters, as they come over,

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.438
remember we have this headright system,

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:47.455
we have a system that says
that if indentured servants

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:50.264
finish out the terms of their indenture,

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.937
they get land of their own,

00:06:51.937 --> 00:06:56.104
means there is constant pressure
to add more and more land

00:06:57.378 --> 00:07:00.521
so you can farm more and more tobacco.

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:04.688
And you start going farther
and farther into the interior.

00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:06.667
So what does this mean?

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:10.834
It means that land becomes
relatively scarce pretty fast.

00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:16.874
And it also means that as white settlers

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:20.313
continue to move west toward
the Appalachian mountains,

00:07:20.313 --> 00:07:21.866
which are over here,

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:23.720
I hope you enjoy this beautiful map,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.654
it's certainly a work of art,

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:30.608
they are running up against
more and more anger and conflict

00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:32.634
with Native Americans who are living

00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:37.526
in between the coast and
the Appalachian mountains.

00:07:37.526 --> 00:07:41.466
And now it's definitely in the interest of

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:45.186
the House of Burgesses, the
government here at Jamestown,

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:47.942
to make sure that there
is as little conflict

00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:49.928
with Native Americans as possible.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.463
Remember we had these wars of
extinction with the Powhatans.

00:07:53.463 --> 00:07:55.711
That wasn't a fun time for anyone.

00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:57.259
And so the House of Burgesses,

00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:01.265
which is now somewhat responsible
to the King of England,

00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:03.904
since he acquired it
from the Virginia Company

00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:06.071
as a royal colony in 1624,

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.529
they have a relatively friendly attitude

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:12.302
toward the Native Americans.

00:08:12.302 --> 00:08:14.006
They're hoping to avoid conflict.

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:15.839
And so their governor,

00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:18.902
Governor William Berkeley,

00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:25.099
spelled Berkeley but pronounced
Barkley, I don't know why.

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:28.550
He refuses to take on
another war of extinction

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.493
against the Native Americans,

00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:34.610
which makes a lot of white
servants and white freeman

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.327
pretty angry.

00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:38.679
It's the late 1600s now,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.063
and more and more of
these indentured servants

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.832
are living to finish out
their terms of indenture.

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:49.335
They have now built up some
immunity to these diseases

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:52.854
that have killed so many
other people in Virginia.

00:08:52.854 --> 00:08:55.733
And they're finding it
really hard to make a living

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:58.983
because the planters don't want to give

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.791
quite so many rights, quite so many perks,

00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.601
to people who live out their indentures.

00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:06.951
Remember this was a good deal for planters

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:11.415
when these white servants
never actually survived

00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:14.618
to make good on the promises of land.

00:09:14.618 --> 00:09:17.999
And now that they are, planters
don't want to extend them

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.057
things like a promise of land,

00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:22.866
because land is already scarce.

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:25.966
So when servants are
finishing up their indentures,

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:29.503
they're finding it
difficult to make a living.

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:31.891
They often have to continue to work

00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.396
for the planter they
had been indentured to

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:36.891
for very small wages,

00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:38.375
they don't have land of their own,

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.874
they can't get started.

00:09:39.874 --> 00:09:44.180
And this is a world composed
almost entirely of men,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.722
so they can't even find women to marry.

00:09:46.722 --> 00:09:49.217
And I think if there's
anything we've learned

00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:51.175
from U.S. history,

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.249
it's that you never want

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:57.416
a whole lot of unemployed,
angry, young men hanging about,

00:09:59.243 --> 00:10:01.892
because young men with a
lot of time on their hands

00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:03.417
get up to trouble.

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:04.880
And one young man in particular

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.734
was this fellow here, Nathaniel Bacon,

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:13.384
who was incensed at
Governor Berkeley's refusal

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:16.213
to take a harsher stance against

00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:17.815
the Native Americans on the west,

00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:20.235
where all of these white farmers

00:10:20.235 --> 00:10:22.213
wished that they could settle.

00:10:22.213 --> 00:10:25.300
And so he gets up a militia,

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.300
full of young white men,

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:31.685
and also African American men,

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:35.136
to actually go after the Native Americans.

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:39.303
So this is a biracial raid
force for Native Americans,

00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:43.741
and they raid Native American villages,

00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:47.850
and kill many Native
Americans living in the area,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.112
and Governor Berkeley wants them to stop.

00:10:50.112 --> 00:10:53.794
And instead of stopping,
they marched to Jamestown,

00:10:53.794 --> 00:10:58.293
the capital of Virginia,
and set it on fire.

00:10:58.293 --> 00:11:00.043
So this is a group of

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.869
landless white men,

00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:06.235
landless African American men,

00:11:06.235 --> 00:11:08.318
who have rebelled against

00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:11.857
the government of Virginia.

00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:15.435
These are my flames,
the House of Burgesses.

00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:16.937
They run Berkeley out of town.

00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:20.562
And it's hard to know where
this would have ended,

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:23.645
because Nathaniel Bacon himself died.

00:11:24.492 --> 00:11:26.256
And he died of illness,

00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:29.554
like many other Virginians
in this time period,

00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:33.368
so the rebellion kind of petered
out without his leadership.

00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.641
But clearly this was a really scary moment

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:37.251
for the House of Burgesses,

00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:40.857
and for the leaders and
planters in Virginia.

00:11:40.857 --> 00:11:41.962
And they started to think,

00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:45.206
alright well maybe this
indentured servitude thing

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:46.780
isn't working out so well,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.494
because once these indentures are up,

00:11:49.494 --> 00:11:53.498
we've got this whole set
of landless free whites

00:11:53.498 --> 00:11:56.375
who technically have the
rights of Englishmen,

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:58.606
but we have little work for them,

00:11:58.606 --> 00:12:00.274
we have little land for them,

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:03.859
and it's going to end up
with constant rebellion.

00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:07.869
So maybe we should think about
a different source of labor.

00:12:07.869 --> 00:12:10.726
One that will never get its freedom.

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:12.738
And it just so happened that there were

00:12:12.738 --> 00:12:15.089
many such laborers for sale

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:17.157
on the coast of west Africa.

00:12:17.157 --> 00:12:19.528
And we'll talk more about
that in the next video.
