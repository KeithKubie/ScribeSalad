NICK BUTCHER: Good afternoon,
and welcome to the Android

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.240
Developers' Office Hours.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.800
It's 2:00 PM here in London, so
it's your regular dose of

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.810
all things Android
development.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.990
So, here in London, my
name is Nick Butcher,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.710
and I'm joined by--

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.470
MATT GAUNT: Matt Gaunt.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.230
Hi.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.010
NICK BUTCHER: An international
show

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.860
coming to you from Jordan.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.580
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, G-Jordan
over here, where it's 5:00 PM,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.640
believe it or not.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.410
Richard Hyndman, as usual.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.290
What's up?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.346
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.490
I'm on the stage at the G-Jordan
event, actually,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.440
because it was the only
room that was free.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.334
So I'm in somewhat
a large room.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:35.588
There's absolutely no-one
here at all.

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:38.520
NICK BUTCHER: So have you
tracked down the only ethernet

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.400
cable in the conference
or something.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.770
RICH HYNDMAN: The only ethernet
in this building.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.440
It seems to be holding
out so far.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.310
AL SUTTON: So it sounds like a
challenge-- how many people

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.740
can we get in that room by
the end of the Hangout?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.020
RICH HYNDMAN: Send them in.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.715
And this is G-Jordan Advanced,
one step up from previous

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.050
years, where now you have to
actually be good to come in.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.930
MATT GAUNT: What's it
gonna be next year?

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.610
It's gonna be, like,
[? super ?]

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.710
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.510
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.440
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No,
advanced class.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.450
NICK BUTCHER: OK, and it looks
like we have some regular

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.420
listeners, joiners, viewers,
whatever you want to call

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.925
yourselves.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:06.405
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.270
Al, we've not seen you
for a few weeks.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.310
How are you?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.900
AL SUTTON: Good, thanks.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.740
It's good to be back.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.380
And I've got December back in my
events, so I'm a happy man.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.075
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, good man.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.160
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.140
NICK BUTCHER: And do you have
any [INAUDIBLE] hardware you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.120
could show us?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.890
AL SUTTON: I have a little
circuit board sitting below my

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.830
monitor, but I don't think
I can show it to you yet.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.550
NICK BUTCHER: Aw.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.040
AL SUTTON: It's a
prototype one.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.540
But they're--

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.490
NICK BUTCHER: Tease.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.020
AL SUTTON: All of the lucky
people who are going to get

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.800
dev kits, they're all shipping
out by the 28th of December.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.380
So it should be arriving as
a New Year's present.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.500
NICK BUTCHER: Just saying,
that actually

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.390
happens to be my birthday.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.710
I didn't [INAUDIBLE],
but you know.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.800
AL SUTTON: I'll put
you on the list.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.900
I think you'll be
number 68,700.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.230
NICK BUTCHER: There's
no birthday boost?

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.500
Oh, OK.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.810
AL SUTTON: I'll swap
it for the next

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.870
generation of Nexus phone.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.410
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, you
got your Nexus 4.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.180
NICK BUTCHER: Hello?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.550
Is that Yossi?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.440
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I asked Al if
he got his Nexus 4 phone.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.229
AL SUTTON: No, I haven't got
hold of one yet, but I believe

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.840
there's one winging
its way to me.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.520
So by Christmas, I will
be a happy person.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.010
NICK BUTCHER: You got your order
in yesterday when they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.030
went back on sale.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.920
AL SUTTON: Yeah.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.320
I was lucky and got in, and
with the one- to two-week

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.790
delivery time.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.230
NICK BUTCHER: Seemed to go a
little bit smoother yesterday

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.650
than the first time around.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.080
AL SUTTON: There were a few
errors, but I mean, that's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.110
what happens when you get
thousands of people pouncing

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.350
after the latest hot hardware.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.070
So yeah, I don't think I've seen
anyone who tried to order

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.400
one who got an absolute blank
wall or mysterious things like

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.160
stuff disappearing from
their basket.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.430
So it all looked a lot better
than last time.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.340
NICK BUTCHER: You got
one, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.310
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I ordered
one [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.760
presents galore.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.430
So yeah.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.730
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.520
A few more regular joiners.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.830
Johan, how are you doing?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.664
JOHAN PELGRIM: I'm fine.

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:55.170
How are you?

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.065
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, yeah,
very good, very good.

00:02:57.065 --> 00:03:00.000
Johan, of course, from the
world-famous Dutch Android

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.220
user group.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.640
We just came back from there two
weeks ago today, I guess.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.680
We were there, weren't we?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.280
Doing the live show from
Amsterdam, and a wonderful

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.950
event it was as well.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.390
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah, it was good
fun for our second year.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.510
Hopefully bigger and better next
year, so we're already

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.350
thinking about that.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.960
So it's good.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.055
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:17.990
Who else we got there?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.650
Mr. Christopher Banes.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.340
CHRIS BANES: Hi, guys.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.940
NICK BUTCHER: How
are you doing?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.723
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, good.

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:22.410
Thanks.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.150
NICK BUTCHER: Still
not working?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.460
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, you
could say that.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.800
It's not quite that easy.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.130
MATT GAUNT: Very generous
of you.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.190
AL SUTTON: There's a spot for
you in games consoles if you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.730
want it, Chris.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.740
Just come and have a chat.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.860
NICK BUTCHER: And who else
do we have on the call?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.250
I keep saying on the call,
like it's some

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.410
corporate VC thing.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.125
Who else is hanging out?

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.360
We got Giuseppe there as well.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.490
And how are you doing?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.370
Ready to ask his Bluetooth
question, I'm sure.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.690
And Matthew, I don't think--

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.580
is Matthew there?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.460
Have you got a camera
or a microphone?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.710
Can you say hello?

00:04:04.782 --> 00:04:07.736
No, OK.

00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:08.550
All right, then.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.550
So as usual, we're here to talk
about all things Android

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.960
development.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.690
We're not here to talk about
any future unannounced,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.820
unreleased products and stuff
that we don't know anything

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.070
about, because we can make up
dates but we just don't know.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.055
So there's no point in asking
us that kind of stuff.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:24.940
But yeah, while we're here, is
anyone in the Hangout, live in

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.540
the Hangout, got any development
questions?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Giuseppe
needs muting.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
Let's get him.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.230
I thought we should kick
off with the map

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.060
fragment, of course.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.540
NICK BUTCHER: Why don't you give
us a quick summary, Rich?

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Came to Google
Play services on Monday.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.110
Google Play services making it
backwards-compatible with all

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.030
devices from--

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.980
NICK BUTCHER: 2.2.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.120
RICH HYNDMAN: 2.2, which is
absolutely excellent.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.150
They have to have OpenGL, too.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.370
But I think every 2.2-upwards
device has OpenGL.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.980
NICK BUTCHER: 90.8% of the
devices in the market.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.630
RICH HYNDMAN: That must be all
the 2.2s upwards, right?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.230
There must be--

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.990
NICK BUTCHER: Don't know.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.810
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.940
I can guarantee that it supports
100% of the devices

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.963
that it supports.

00:05:11.963 --> 00:05:14.230
How's that?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.200
So yes--

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.690
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Sounds
good to me.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.910
RICH HYNDMAN: Really not too
hard to implement at all.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.830
You can just add the map
fragment in and you get all

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.790
the powerful capabilities of
Google Maps inside your

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.005
Android application.

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:26.900
It's all vector-based, finally,
so none of those

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.090
bitmap downloads that caches
to the external memory.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.330
You can have the satellite
imagery.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.720
You can have traffic data.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.120
You can do animations.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960
You can give the camera a new
location and tell it to

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.160
animate to it, or a
new zoom level.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.590
single line of code,
awesome stuff.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.780
And the most complicated
bit is just getting

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.940
your maps API key.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.840
And to be honest, once you've
done that once,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.845
it's not too bad.

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:53.630
Just go to the API's console
and turn on Google Maps API

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.260
version [? 2 ?] for Android in
services, and then you can

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.800
create your own new Android
application, and off you go.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.050
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.260
NICK BUTCHER: Awesome.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.090
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.170
NICK BUTCHER: So has anyone been
waiting for a map, update

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.790
to MapView maybe?

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.022
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yes.

00:06:08.022 --> 00:06:09.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Doesn't
everybody?

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.873
I think it was one of the
biggest [INAUDIBLE] we've had

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:12.122
for a while.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.960
And it's been baking for a
while, so we're quite excited

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.470
to be able to talk about
this, finally.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.450
Anyone here taken a look
at the new APIs?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.540
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Just
started yesterday.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.960
But hopefully until the end of
the week, I'll have a mock-up

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.080
to show some features I
wanted to implement.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.980
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.184
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Maybe I'll
open source it.

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:33.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.100
But it's quite a nice little
demo app, isn't there, that

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.700
comes with it, Rich?

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.146
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.630
NICK BUTCHER: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.050
all the different APIs.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.720
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely,
yeah.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.940
There's some samples that come
with it in the Google Play

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.290
Services Samples folder in your
SDK once you download

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.720
your Google Play services.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.160
Actually, there seems
to be another update

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.445
to it today as well.

00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:52.620
Whilst I was doing the slide
onstage today, I said, all you

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.410
need is Google Play Services
version 2 and show them in the

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.656
SDK manager and it increments
it to version 3.

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:58.660
I don't know why that was in
there, but maybe there's been

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.120
a bug fix already.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.990
So make sure you're using the
latest version of Google Play

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.080
Services, and you can
get yourselves

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.870
a support map fragment.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.476
NICK BUTCHER: Wonderful.

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:09.850
RICH HYNDMAN: It's epic.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.190
I think every app that I write
over the next, even Ultimate

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.310
Stopwatch, is going to have
a MapView in just because.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.476
make this time, I don't know.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:21.270
I love it.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.585
OK, so we can carry on now.

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:23.495
I just wanted to get that out.

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:24.800
We can go into the normal
Hangout stuff.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.530
Does anybody else in the Hangout
have a question?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.910
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah, I
do have a question.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.180
I've already posted it
in the moderator.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.870
When I use the Spotify app,
every list view has a spinner

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.120
on the right.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.800
And when I click that,
a subview folds down.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.960
And [INAUDIBLE] question maybe,
is that an acceptable

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.920
UI pattern?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:03.290
Or are you maybe suggesting to
go for a popout or whatever?

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.620
And the second question maybe
is how to best do that.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.950
NICK BUTCHER: When do you
see this in Spotify?

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:17.130
JOHAN PELGRIM: It's just any
list, if you look on the right

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.056
and you click on the
screen there.

00:08:18.056 --> 00:08:19.890
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, OK, that
kind of spinner,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.840
the dropdown thing.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.090
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:30.180
I think it's really cool to fold
out additional stuff for

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.789
every song or album
or whatever.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:38.100
So my question is how
to best achieve

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.039
that kind of animation.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:45.760
Do I add an extra few groups
holding that particular

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.520
sub-display in every list
item, make it few, or

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.890
visibility gone and then animate
it when I click it?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.155
Or do I add an extra few
[? types ?] to the adapter?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.540
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
so I don't know.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.905
I'd add it to each individual
child item.

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:10.310
But I'd do it as a ViewStub.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.500
So it's only inflated and
actually in memory when you

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.670
need it, and then it
just animates.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.125
The only way you can get the
animation is by doing the new

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.160
animation framework, though.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.610
So what would happen is, as soon
as you go visible on the

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.930
item, you'll get a big gap
appear, and then it'll just

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.670
come [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.360
So you'll only get that nice
slide-in motion with the new

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.800
animation APIs.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.640
JOHAN PELGRIM: And is that

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.140
backwards-compatible then, Chris?

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.295
NICK BUTCHER: In no way.

00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:39.718
JOHAN PELGRIM: No way, OK.

00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:43.246
NICK BUTCHER: So Spotify must
be doing something funky,

00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:45.530
because it obviously works
on other platforms.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.240
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yes.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.690
CHRIS BANES: It will still work,
but whether it's exactly

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.570
the same user experience.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.030
NICK BUTCHER: No, I'm saying,
so they get the nice

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.660
slide-down transition, right?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.790
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yes.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.260
CHRIS BANES: But even on devices
before Gingerbread?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.050
NICK BUTCHER: I don't
know if I have any.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.840
CHRIS BANES: I mean, so that
might be using [INAUDIBLE] old

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.053
Androids on that.

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:12.900
So they get a similar
experience, but

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.920
not quite the same.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.300
NICK BUTCHER: Possibly.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.710
I've invited Marcus, the
developer of the Spotify app,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.980
to the Hangout to see the
main development.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.250
But he hasn't joined yet.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.296
We'll see if he pops in.

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:25.700
But yeah, I think those
are good suggestions.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.822
Yeah, so the new animation
API you're talking

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:28.730
about, Chris, is the--

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.014
[MUSIC JINGLE]

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:30.442
NICK BUTCHER: Whoa.

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:31.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.980
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah. it
was a [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.516
so sorry about that.

00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:38.110
NICK BUTCHER: It's all right.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.740
Yeah, the API you're talking
about, Chris, is the enable

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.770
animate layout transitions,
isn't it?

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.550
What's it called?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.040
I can't remember
the name of it.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.300
CHRIS BANES: No.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.500
It's just the animations.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but you
have to turn it on, right?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.800
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.050
and all the rest of it.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.470
Because layout transitions are
when you [INAUDIBLE] actually

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.600
add and remove views, if
I remember rightly.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.165
And whereas if you use the
old-style animation API, and

00:11:11.165 --> 00:11:15.050
so a very tight flip
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.300
And you'll get different
experiences with sort of the

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.550
Honeycomb animation APIs.

00:11:23.588 --> 00:11:25.440
JOHAN PELGRIM: OK.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.590
So basically, in short, if
I understood correctly, a

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.060
ViewStub in the row layouts, and
only inflated when I need

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.020
it, and then animate with
the new animation APIs.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.400
CHRIS BANES: Sounds
good to me.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.110
JOHAN PELGRIM: And if the
Spotify developer pops in,

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.280
Nick, he might have a
pre-Gingerbread solution.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.730
OK.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.980
Thanks, guys.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.476
MALE SPEAKER: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:25.194
NICK BUTCHER: Aha,
and we're back.

00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:27.122
What did we miss?

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:29.750
I didn't miss you guys.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.350
Maybe that's what it's like
when we drop out from the

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.860
London office.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.090
Your picture stays there.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:33.860
Nobody even knows you've gone.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.190
It's just like [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.680
It's good to see this from
the other side of

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.630
the camera for once.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.900
NICK BUTCHER: It just looks like
we just stopped talking

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.780
for a while and just--

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.370
RICH HYNDMAN: You're just
listening quite intently to

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.240
the answer provided by Chris.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.980
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe
we'll do that.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.100
If we don't know the answer
to something--

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Good work.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.100
NICK BUTCHER: But I was talking
about, Chris, isn't

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.600
that the new change you're
talking about?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.140
Because for a little while in
the API, there's been you can

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.440
animate additions to
list view, right?

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.530
So every new item would
animate gracefully

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.470
[? rather than ?] just a pair.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.630
But when you're actually
animating the bounds of an

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.750
item list view, there's a new
changing animation which you

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.870
have to turn on explicitly,
right?

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.430
CHRIS BANES: Cant' remember.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.050
I don't know.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.030
I haven't really
messed with it.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.026
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:18.242
Well, that's what I
thought it was.

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:19.320
MATT GAUNT: So, Johan,
when you--

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.820
JOHAN PELGRIM: Writing
it down.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.080
MATT GAUNT: [? --try ?] to
do this, just let us

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.920
know what you find.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.170
JOHAN PELGRIM: Sure.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.380
MATT GAUNT: That'd
be quite cool.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.760
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.480
NICK BUTCHER: So also, you
talked about it from the UX

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.350
point of view as well.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.430
It's a slight abuse of it.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.530
Like, I think the little
right-hand triangle dropdown

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.040
is pretty strongly tied, like
you say, to the spinner idea.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.010
Like, the idea is that you push
this and you have this

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.490
fixed concept of what's
gonna happen.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.850
You're gonna have this kind
of dropdown list come out.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.570
So it's kind of a
riff on that.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.500
I actually think it's OK.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.890
It's kind of similar
to what the Google

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.160
Music application does.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.912
So in [? stricter ?] terms, I
guess it's not the right kind

00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:54.470
of affordance to show what's
going to happen.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.820
But I think it's an
OK validation.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.370
I think it's quite cool.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.120
JOHAN PELGRIM: Yeah, OK.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.370
Thanks.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.060
NICK BUTCHER: Any other
questions for the Hangout?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.980
AL SUTTON: I'm just wondering
how many people saw Romain

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.960
Guy's performance analysis.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.460
That was a really cool post that
he put up, of [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.710
took it apart and showed
all the overlays

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:19.850
and stuff like that.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.290
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.450
Has anyone else played around
with the Show Overdraw

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.700
developer option with
their own apps yet?

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.120
AL SUTTON: I haven't, but I
didn't even realize it was

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.660
there until I read his post.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.750
It's absolutely awesome.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.970
NICK BUTCHER: I posted
about it weeks ago.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.590
RICH HYNDMAN: It's epic.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.760
Somebody here at G-Jordan is
running it all the time on

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.360
their device.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.450
I was quite amused to actually
see them use it

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.190
live all the time.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.960
NICK BUTCHER: I ran it for
a couple of days on

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.730
every single app.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.160
It's weird.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.430
It's a bit matrix-y at first.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.890
Like, all you can see
is red, blue, green.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.285
After a while, it's just blond,
brunette [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.030
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, there's a
really nice thing, though.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.520
For the slide-in draws, the
different slide-in draw

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.440
libraries, some of them
are leaving the

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.490
draw behind the view.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.430
So as the view list scrolls,
you can still see the draw

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.620
behind it if you have the
overdraws turned on.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.466
And some of them, as soon as you
slide it and it goes off

00:15:05.466 --> 00:15:06.990
the screen, are replacing it
with a ViewStub and it

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.960
disappears.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.930
And these ones, obviously,
aren't impacting the list view

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.430
scrolling performance, but
the ones that leave it

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.680
behind the list are.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.380
So we tried three or
four libraries out

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.000
to see which ones--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.040
guess what Google+ does?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.140
Hey.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.390
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.210
YouTube, it disappears as soon
as the draw closes, and then

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.814
it adds the layout back in as
it starts working again.

00:15:28.814 --> 00:15:30.260
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes, it's a good
trick when you're using other

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.120
people's libraries to see how
efficient they've been by

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.345
turning on overdraws.

00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:38.490
NICK BUTCHER: And has anyone
else tried tracer for OpenGL

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:38.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.150
yet?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.560
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I did it.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.750
NICK BUTCHER: It's pretty
cool, right?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.580
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, It's pretty
convenient to follow

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.151
all the tracing overdraws.

00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:48.960
NICK BUTCHER: So for those of
who don't know what is it,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.500
it's basically a tool which lets
you kind of go through

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.590
each frame that you're
rendering, step by step of

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.030
rendering operation, in
this article which

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.460
Al was talking about.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.515
Romain Guy takes a look at
a Twitter application.

00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:04.300
And you can step through each
drawing command, basically.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.780
So you can see that he's
drawing a full-screen

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.020
background and then drawing
another completely opaque

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.050
background right on top of it,
and then I think a third,

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.890
actually, on top of that.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.230
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.140
NICK BUTCHER: So I mean, those
are just completely wasted

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.000
time spent drawing and memory
being copied up to the GPU and

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.640
all this kind of stuff.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.620
So you can just get rid of a
couple of those calls and just

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.070
gain a little bit of extra
rendering time for each frame,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.842
so you can hit your 60 frames
per second [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:26.842 --> 00:16:28.050
performance.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.270
It's a really cool tool to
understand exactly what your

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.420
app's doing.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.000
Check it out.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.580
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I think it
was just a really nice

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.430
walk-through of all
the tools as well.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.632
Like, it's one of those things
where you can easily open them

00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:39.820
and then just get blindsided
by so much information.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.750
So it was kind of nice the way
he kind of explains what he

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.017
looks for when he's doing it,
as well as what you can kind

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:47.150
of see from it as well.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.190
So yeah, it's definitely worth
checking out, because I've

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.390
definitely needed those sort
of things before, just gone

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:51.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.510
too much.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.310
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so I think,
Yossi, you posted a

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.330
link to it, for those watching
the video later.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.860
Check out curious//creature.org,
and--

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.975
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Here,
I'll post it on the

00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:03.380
Hangout on Google+ also.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.319
NICK BUTCHER: Oh cool.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.069
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.369
RICH HYNDMAN: So I guess we
should stop Giuseppe from

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.135
having to wait any longer.

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:14.380
He's been waiting for an answer
to his question for two

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.586
or three weeks.

00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:17.514
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes.

00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:19.442
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.442 --> 00:17:21.850
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yeah, but
before you started to answer

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:27.020
my question, I would like
to make my [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.030
public congratulations to Yossi
for a great job in data

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.280
application.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.170
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.714
Alfredo's making
too much noise.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: What is it?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.125
RICH HYNDMAN: Carry
on, Giuseppe.

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:47.320
Sorry.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.390
Alfredo joined, and he had some
feedback on his speakers.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.770
We've just muted him, and
you can carry on.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.920
Why were you congratulating
Yossi publicly.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.760
Sorry.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.370
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes, because
they had an interview

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.390
on the TV, and they--

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.670
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, we were
on CBS yesterday in the San

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.250
Francisco Bay Area, and
also reviewed by CNET.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.190
[? JOHAN PELGRIM: [INAUDIBLE].
?]

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.460
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yeah, that is
very good, because usually

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:26.085
the TV don't speak too much
about Android [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:26.840
NICK BUTCHER: Very cool.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.710
Good for you guys.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.180
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Thanks.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.070
NICK BUTCHER: Congrats.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.890
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: So
where is my answer?

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.320
RICH HYNDMAN: OK,
I'll jump in.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.790
Do you want the short version
or the really short version?

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.015
It's not good news.

00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:41.330
So I've been looking into it.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.010
There's only three Bluetooth
profiles that we enable you to

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.720
interact with directly.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.050
And [? OPEX, ?] object file
exchange isn't one of them.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.590
So the file exchange is provided
at a Bluetooth stack

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.110
level, and other devices can
inquire to see if your device

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.470
supports it.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.420
And if it does, the file
is handled and stored.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.340
There's no way of interacting
or interrupting that process

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.930
inside Android without--

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.030
yeah, from an external
application that you don't

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.100
own, sending a Bluetooth
file through [? OPEX ?]

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.430
to your application, it's
handled by the device.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.580
So you can have it inside your
application, that you detect

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.110
Bluetooth devices and that you
make a serial transfer.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.030
But if you want someone to be
able to do share via Bluetooth

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.430
and do an object exchange
file transfer into your

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.280
application, then this isn't
supported at the moment.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:31.700
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: OK.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.480
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
interrupt this.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.060
It's a system-level thing.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.420
The only ones you can play
with are [? HUDP ?]

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.070
and [? health ?]

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.340
and headset.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.650
That's three profiles that
your application

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.490
can interact with.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.850
But the other profiles that
Bluetooth provides--

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.600
networking, file exchange,
things like that--

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.010
don't have APIs.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.930
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Frankly
speaking, after longer

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.270
research, I am [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.290
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.310
yeah.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.550
Sorry.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.502
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Thank
you very much.

00:20:00.502 --> 00:20:00.980
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, good.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.780
I think we need to welcome
Alfredo into the Hangout, at

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.410
Politecnico di Milano.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.870
Hey, guys.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.620
We muted you.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.630
so if you'd like to say
hello, you can unmute.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.710
Maybe Alfredo there can--

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.174
ALFREDO MORRESI: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:20:14.174 --> 00:20:15.150
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.126
He's here.

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:17.650
ALFREDO MORRESI: [INAUDIBLE]
hi, guys.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.370
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.085
ALFREDO MORRESI: Hey.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:20.650
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.000
ALFREDO MORRESI: We are here
in the Google office in

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.425
Milano, together with some
guys from the university,

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:27.702
Politecnico of Milano.

00:20:27.702 --> 00:20:34.270
And this is our first tentative
to run Hangout with

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.000
the university.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.350
It's a new kind of initiative.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.860
Today, we had some questions
from the guys, so if you want,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.810
I can leave the part to them.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.723
So please.

00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:48.810
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.740
Welcome, first of all.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.330
Welcome, all of you.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.420
Thank you for joining us.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.830
Let's take one question from
you guys to start with.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.410
Then we'll take one for the
moderator, and then we'll come

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.190
back to the floor again,
see who has questions.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.110
So who'd like to ask
a question from

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.360
Politecnico di Milano?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.260
Google Office, as you say.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.645
ALFREDO MORRESI: So does
someone want to start?

00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:08.983
Please, go.

00:21:08.983 --> 00:21:10.366
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:15.473
I have some questions about the
Google Cloud Messaging,

00:21:15.473 --> 00:21:20.680
about how can we use it to send
[INAUDIBLE] notification

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:27.570
and how we can manage when the
user is not online, and how

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.910
can we [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.050
the notification and send a
huge notification about

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.170
something that the user doesn't
receive when he or she

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.420
is offline?

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.260
MATT GAUNT: Who wants
to take that one?

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.040
NICK BUTCHER: Go on, Rich.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.090
RICH HYNDMAN: So Google Cloud
Messaging, I assume you've

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.700
looked into the documentation,
the initial documentation,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.180
which says how it works.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.650
You build it into your
application, and then your

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.300
application registers with your
server to say that this

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.160
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.740
And then your server sends
notifications to our server

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.760
when you want to send push
messages to the handset.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.870
So anything outside of that
flow, you would have to

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.450
implement yourselves.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.310
If you want to know if the
handset is online or not--

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.985
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes,
[? sir. ?]

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:21.235
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.290
RICH HYNDMAN: I mean, the
notifications will get sent to

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.180
your application regardless of
whether your application's

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.910
open or not.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.980
But if the handset's not online,
it's very hard for you

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.610
to detect the situation, because
you can't necessarily

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.420
tell your servers that the
handset's not online, because

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.410
it's not online.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.380
It doesn't have a connection.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.350
So the only thing that we have
in our toolbox that really

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.250
helps with this is you can send
the message, and when the

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.110
handset comes back online,
it will receive it.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.670
But you can also set the time
to live for the message.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.360
So you could say, this
message is only valid

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.080
for the next 10 minutes.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.960
And if the handset doesn't come
back online in the next

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.880
10 minutes, then your message
will be discarded.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.430
And then you can try sending
another one later on.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.300
But you won't know.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.110
I mean, it's going to be very
hard for you to tell whether

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.500
the handset's online or not,
unless you're keeping an open

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.300
connection to the server, and
when that connection stops,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.210
you can assume it's offline.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.070
But we wouldn't recommend that,
because that's just

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.410
going to drain the battery of
the device very quickly.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.620
Al's just posted the GCM
docs as well for us.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.700
But yeah, GCM, you can
now have up to

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.500
four-kilobyte payload.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.860
So you can send some data
along with the message.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.920
You can message up to 1,000
users at once, now that we

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.700
have these new JSON
file formats.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.030
And I don't really
have a perfect

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.560
solution for your scenario.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.930
Can you explain more about
what you're doing?

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, I'm
developing the application

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.700
about the [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.650
And they need to receive a
notification where the

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.390
[INAUDIBLE] is [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.622
Italy or in a particular
zone [? over Italy. ?]

00:23:57.622 --> 00:24:01.221
And we [INAUDIBLE] push
notification, they can receive

00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:04.737
the notification about the
particular zone, or the

00:24:04.737 --> 00:24:07.870
particular [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.510
RICH HYNDMAN: I would be tempted
to ignore the case

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.610
that they're offline and
just send it anyway.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.320
And as soon as their phone comes
online, they'll receive

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.920
the notification that this
bird has been seen.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.560
Hopefully they're online and
they can catch it at the right

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.370
time to maybe go and
see the bird.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because if they
are offline and then they

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.780
came online, they receive
a lot of notifications.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:32.592
I want to delete all the old
notification and send only one

00:24:32.592 --> 00:24:36.260
about all the updates that
they have missed.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.230
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, in which case
what you want to do is

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.930
just use your notifications to
say that there's an update

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.160
waiting for them.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.850
So even if they receive
10, we'll bundle

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.640
them together anyway.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.900
But even if they receive 10, all
that the application knows

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.450
is that there's some new
information for them to read.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.950
And then the application goes
to your server and finds all

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.290
the updates.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.266
NICK BUTCHER: Or there's the
collapse key, right?

00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:59.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.340
NICK BUTCHER: So you can set a
collapse key, which means,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.450
while reading through the docs,
it's used to collapse a

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.500
group of messages.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.060
So it's for exactly this case,
when a device is offline.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.480
It'll just get the last
one from that group.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.830
RICH HYNDMAN: But the important
thing is that all

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.770
those messages would have
contained [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.580
So you don't actually want
to lose any data.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.260
So if the only data you're
sending is the fact that

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.185
there's been an update, then
you can collapse all those

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.220
anyway and just--

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.370
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.150
RICH HYNDMAN: --get the phone
to hit your servers to find

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.530
out what the update is.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.270
NICK BUTCHER: Indeed.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:26.945
RICH HYNDMAN: OK?

00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:28.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.380
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, thanks
very much.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.650
OK, let's move on to
a question from

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.760
the moderator then.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.060
One of you guys in London
have a moderator open?

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.640
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.040
MATT GAUNT: God, you're
organized.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.050
NICK BUTCHER: But it's
just refreshing.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.580
Great.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.820
Any live questions while
we're waiting?

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.920
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah,
I have one.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.766
NICK BUTCHER: Go, Yossi.

00:25:48.766 --> 00:25:50.460
Go.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:57.310
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Image filtering,
the render script,

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.910
as I saw, a render script
was deprecated in 4.2.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.125
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:04.360
CHRIS BANES: Only the display
render script.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.600
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.980
So basically any suggestions on
how to apply filtering to

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:17.086
images [INAUDIBLE]
render script?

00:26:17.086 --> 00:26:20.670
[INAUDIBLE] deprecated
that part.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.520
NICK BUTCHER: No, filter
script's not deprecated.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.205
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Really?

00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:25.740
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, only
the kind of OpenGL

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.570
drawing tool kit.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.950
The actual image processing
stuff, that's

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.840
very alive and kicking.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.310
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Oh, OK, because
I didn't really get into it

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.215
very much, just started to--

00:26:37.215 --> 00:26:39.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, no, it's
definitely still live.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.420
If you look at filter script,
it's like a subset of the

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.770
entire render script
specifically aimed at doing

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.650
image processing.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.100
So that's definitely something
that's being

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.680
actively worked on.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.090
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.950
And that should be
still alive--

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.500
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it was
just updated in 4.2.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.490
I don't know the best places
to look at examples.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.690
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, Al just
posted the link on chat.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.500
Thanks, Al.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:03.820
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.790
Render script compute.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.260
Render script examples
are always a

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.140
little bit tricky, right?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.760
And render script
documentation.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.010
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.800
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that was a
great talk at Google I/O by

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.060
Jeff Sharkey called Doing More
With Less, I think, where he

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.590
gave a good example of using
render script for doing--

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.690
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah,
I've been there.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.780
I saw it also live.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.760
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, OK.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.840
YOSSI ELKRIEF: That's what
started my intrigue to looking

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.610
more into it.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.430
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.710
Interesting, this device here,
the Nexus 10 as well is the

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.280
first device to have hardware
support for render script

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.630
built into the GPU chip as well,
so it's phenomenally

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.950
fast through that kind of
operation on this device.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.680
So hopefully [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.680
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Cool.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
Thanks.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360
NICK BUTCHER: OK, let's take a
question from the moderator,

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.385
one which Matt hopefully
knows the answer to.

00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:56.640
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.860
NICK BUTCHER: So Damien
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.690
says, is there a way to form an
intent so that if the app

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.990
is not installed, it'll
go to the Play store?

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.330
So he knows about you can,
in advance, use Package

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.860
[? Manager ?] to say, is there
a app for this intent.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.160
But he's saying he's actually
flinging the

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.950
intent to a Google TV.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.000
So he said he can't
do that two-stage

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.900
check and then launch.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.840
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, this isn't an
ideal way of doing it, with

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.840
trying to work on something
different that will hopefully

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.140
allow the assistant to basically
go, this isn't

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.340
installed, and then it'll give
you a kickback that says, no,

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.370
it's not installed, or actually
just go straight to

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.790
the Play Store and say we
already know what you're

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.290
trying to do, so we'll go and
grab the app for you.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.600
At the moment, the [INAUDIBLE]
library doesn't support that.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.760
So it's kind of a bit of an odd
situation, where you can

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.660
only just ask the user where
it's got installed.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.270
Or yeah, I'm not
entirely sure.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.940
I think the best solution that
I can come up with is try and

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.010
launch the application, and
then try and have some

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.100
communication with it, [? by ?]
your own proprietary

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.870
sort of solution.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.420
Because when you use [INAUDIBLE]
protocol, you can

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.450
get the IP address of the Google
TV, so try and connect

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.310
through it through that.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:03.280
And then if you can't do that
because your app isn't there,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.350
then try and install it.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.940
But there's not a really
nice solution for it.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.250
I think we've kind of catered
towards the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.990
you've got both apps
installed.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.020
Or if you've got one APK, then
it kind of simplifies things a

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.360
bit, but not much.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.230
So short answer, there's no nice
solution at the moment,

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.222
but we're working on it.

00:29:21.222 --> 00:29:22.980
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.660
OK Cool.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.370
Do you want to go back to
another live question?

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.430
Anyone in the room, or back
to the Milan office?

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.860
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, I
have a question.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.910
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:39.920
MALE SPEAKER: I wanted to know
if our GPS model works for

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:47.530
I want to know if a user,
when I [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:55.420
model, it computes my position
every instance or every

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.680
interval of time.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:03.850
Or it is used only when I
call an app that uses.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:05.440
For example, when I
open Google Maps,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.860
it computes my position.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.790
When Google Maps is not open,
GPS continues to work.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.495
So it is in a [? freezing ?]
state.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.920
NICK BUTCHER: So I guess the
easy answer is the GPS is only

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.870
fired up when an application
asks for the GPS provider.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.990
So it's not going to be running
when an application is

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.810
in the background, unless
background status or something

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:32.150
is [? calling the ?]

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.080
GPS.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.360
Does that make sense?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.520
MALE SPEAKER: OK, but this
is for [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:48.510
because I think that
[? some users ?], when wanted

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:53.280
to save power, turned
off the GPS.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:59.500
And my app used GPS a lot.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.620
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:04.176 --> 00:31:06.910
MATT GAUNT: So how do you get
around it when the GPS is

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.160
switched off?

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.420
Can you access the
[? cross-location? ?]

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:12.690
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.970
So you won't be able
to get [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.220
GPS lock if the user's turned
off the GPS setting.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.290
That's exactly right.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.575
This is why you kind
of want to be able

00:31:18.575 --> 00:31:19.490
to handle that case.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.270
And you can use either the
criteria object, [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.483
when you're querying the
location manager, you can pass

00:31:24.483 --> 00:31:28.390
it a bunch of criteria which
describe the kind of fix

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.590
you're looking for and the
accuracy you're looking for.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.690
And it'll give you
the best thing.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.540
Or you can actually tell it you
want a GPS provider, in

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.420
which case it's just not gonna
work because it's turned off.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.465
So yeah, the best advice is
always to kind of start from

00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:45.220
the most coarse fix and
then wait while

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.860
it gets better fixes.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.180
As always, we tend to point
people towards-- there's an

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.830
awesome couple of blog posts by
Reto Meier on our Android

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.390
Developer's blog called Location
Best Practices, where

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.390
he open sources a bunch of code
which walks you through

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.150
exactly the right
way to do this.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.210
Or a couple of people have
taken all this code and

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.760
open-sourced it in a couple
of library projects.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.180
So if you look at one called
Novocation on GitHub.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.050
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, that's the
one from [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.680
And then there's the little
fluffy [INAUDIBLE] one.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:10.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.770
MATT GAUNT: I can't remember
what it's called.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.260
NICK BUTCHER: So there's a
couple of libraries which will

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.570
just do the right thing,
so it'll do

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.420
exactly what you want.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.800
They'll give you the course
location first and then

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.040
they'll on updating with better
and better location

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.430
updates as they get them.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.210
So if the user has turned off
the GPS provider, you may

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.130
still get a pretty good fix
from the course location

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.500
provider, which is going to use
things like cell towers

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.576
and Wi-Fi hotspots to
triangulate you.

00:32:35.576 --> 00:32:39.135
MATT GAUNT: So I think Al's put
in Reto Meier's blog post,

00:32:39.135 --> 00:32:41.865
the link to Novocation
library.

00:32:41.865 --> 00:32:44.800
I'm sure he's busy finding the
third link as we speak.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.050
AL SUTTON: Yeah.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.770
YOSSI ELKRIEF: At least you
use Google to search.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.650
NICK BUTCHER: Does that answer
your question at all?

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.210
Or am I missing the point?

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:03.500
MALE SPEAKER: I don't think
you did, and I didn't

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.085
understand.

00:33:05.085 --> 00:33:06.450
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.350
MALE SPEAKER: Ah, yes,
yes, but can

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.830
I ask another question?

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.450
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.450
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:21.420
If I want, for example, to
enable Wi-Fi or GPS, can I

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.200
turn [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.150
my model without asking
the user?

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.320
I [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.880
my [? money ?], because
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.220
I [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.490
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, there's
a way to do

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.320
Wi-Fi, but not for GPS.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.660
But I wouldn't advise you
to just [INAUDIBLE] turn

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.940
Wi-Fi on and off.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.600
That's the kind of behavior
which users tend to not like,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.635
when you're kind of changing
these system-wide settings,

00:33:46.635 --> 00:33:50.140
unless you explicitly have
a Wi-Fi toggle button.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.940
And in that case, that's
not so bad.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.590
But if you're just [INAUDIBLE]
in the background, changing

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.760
the settings, I probably
wouldn't do that.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.870
The [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.410
is to, if you look at something
like Google Maps,

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.920
it'll say you got Wi-Fi
off for a better fix,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.450
and turn Wi-Fi on.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.270
And if you click the thing,
it doesn't turn Wi-Fi on.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.330
It sends you to the Wi-Fi screen
where the user can turn

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.520
it on, so the user still
feels in control.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.600
While you do have technically
the ability, given that you

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.090
asked the right permission to
turn Wi-Fi on and off, I

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.929
wouldn't advise it.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.992
I would probably prompt the user
and say, hey, why don't

00:34:22.992 --> 00:34:26.340
you turn on Wi-Fi to obtain
a better fix.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.110
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thanks.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.304
ALFREDO MORRESI: Yes, if I can
add something to these

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:36.569
questions, it's also better
to ask the user to turn on

00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:39.530
manually Wi-Fi, because you
don't know the context in

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.311
which Wi-Fi is in.

00:34:41.311 --> 00:34:44.780
Maybe it's in a public place,
in a home, a coffee

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.050
So you don't know if the user
needs to configure the Wi-Fi,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.139
so just [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.420
to [INAUDIBLE] a stable
connection.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.810
MALE SPEAKER: And what
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:58.810
ALFREDO MORRESI: GPS
is the same.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.710
But GPS is different, because
you can ask to the people, to

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.900
the person, if you can bring
[INAUDIBLE] to the GPS setting

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.468
and then manually
activate GPS.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.085
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Can
I ask a question?

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:21.335
Giuseppe.

00:35:23.122 --> 00:35:25.960
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, go for it.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.460
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Thanks.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.725
I have a work service that
sends unlicensed

00:35:32.725 --> 00:35:35.710
email to the user.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.750
I would like to know if there's
any chance to reduce

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:45.260
that my application to make
possible to open an attachment

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.850
in that email automatically?

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:53.270
I mean, can I register some MIME
type or some extension

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.070
type to make possible from the
Gmail application, for

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.340
example, to open the attachment
through my

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.160
application?

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.623
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:09.155
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
Very good answer.

00:36:09.155 --> 00:36:10.520
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE] you
activity, you can have an

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.670
intent filter, which will
activate on URLs.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.400
So for example, we use
it inside YouTube.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.726
So all youtube.coms, when you
click on the link, opens

00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:22.520
inside the YouTube
application.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.750
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes, which
this works when there is some

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.060
link or some URL, but
not in attachment.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.480
I tried it already.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.460
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, but you have
to put a link or a URL.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.540
This is the only way that I know
of, is context for a link

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.340
or a URL like this, that the
application will get launched

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.286
from another application.

00:36:40.286 --> 00:36:42.190
NICK BUTCHER: But you can also
say you handle a certain

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.870
extension type as well?

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:47.010
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
Yeah [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.520
MATT GAUNT: You say you can
support a specific MIME type

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.090
and then you just need
to make sure the--

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:51.516
yeah.

00:36:51.516 --> 00:36:54.490
Would it be just the file
extension that would do that?

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.470
Or would you need to set
the file MIME type?

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, you can
just do the MIME type.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.940
But then every time an image/png
is offered, it'll

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.940
offer up to your application
to open it.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.820
Maybe you could have your own
MIME types, [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.470
[? pro/image ?]

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:13.160
and then set the MIME type
of this in the email.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.840
You could try that.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.682
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you can
control with both ends, then

00:37:15.682 --> 00:37:16.680
yeah, definitely
you can do it.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.750
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, if you
have the email and the

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.400
application.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.590
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yeah, because
I think that the

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.430
filter is not working
on the extensions.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.660
It's working on the MIME type.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.340
So you mean that I must send it
from the server, the file

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.830
with the MIME type already
there, right?

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.580
MATT GAUNT: I would've
thought so.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.870
RICH HYNDMAN: I would play
around with that.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.740
I'm not quite sure.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.240
Inside an email, when you embed
an attachment, you can

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.400
specify the MIME type, right?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.170
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Because I
created the file at runtime,

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.420
so probably I can create
my own MIME type.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.660
MATT GAUNT: I'd have a play.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.980
I think the difficulty might
be if the email client then

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.280
tries to guess what
the MIME type is

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.730
regardless of you've been.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.880
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: That is
another problem, yeah.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.110
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I think it
definitely feels like it

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.620
should be possible, but you need
to play around with it to

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.170
find the exact way to do it.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.060
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: If there is
any idea or any suggestions,

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.590
can I have some link ,
somewhere to look?

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.540
AL SUTTON: It's down in the
right-hand side of the chat.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.450
I've put a link to where you can
find the MIME type section

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.280
of a data tag that you can put
it in a intent filter.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.920
And if you register for the
action of view , you should be

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.540
able to get your application
fired up when anyone tries to

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.834
view anything with
that MIME type.

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:43.680
CHRIS BANES: I'm pretty sure the
email application will try

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.140
and guess the MIME
type, though.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.840
So it won't give you
a full MIME type.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.890
It'll be a wildcard type.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.485
So you'll have, like, audio
slash star or asterisk,

00:38:54.485 --> 00:38:57.360
because it'll try and guess
and it won't really know.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.790
So I don't know.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.460
It depends what type of
file you're sending

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.710
and trying to open.

00:39:04.535 --> 00:39:06.710
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Tried already
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.410
type or with the extension with
the MIME, tried to use

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.110
all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.550
that are out there in
the documentation.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.820
But [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.135
attachments.

00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:16.910
I'm [? sure. ?]

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.750
MATT GAUNT: What extension
is your attachment?

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:22.160
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: I just put
an extension like txt, and

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:28.300
also the same I cannot open from
txt, simple txt files.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.000
I started to try to do it with
my own extension, like LIC or

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.720
LWM, something like that.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.120
Then I found it possible.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.110
Then I tried to txt, text file,
but no way to register

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.960
my application with the
[INAUDIBLE] open attachment.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.670
Yeah, I can just go to some link
with the MIME type, et

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.265
cetera, and the application
would not be

00:39:49.265 --> 00:39:50.510
[? needed ?], for sure.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:54.280
But the attachment, this is not
working at all, I'm sure.

00:39:57.262 --> 00:39:59.780
AL SUTTON: Have you tried using
path [? pattern ?] for

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.350
your extension type.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.550
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes,
attempted to.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.870
AL SUTTON: Yeah?

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.870
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yes.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.441
I have an intent filter that
this long one kilometer now.

00:40:10.355 --> 00:40:16.352
I have tried it with the
asterisk// and the backslash,

00:40:16.352 --> 00:40:19.730
anything, all the patterns.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.220
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.240
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: [INAUDIBLE]
a question for

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.776
next week again, OK.

00:40:25.776 --> 00:40:28.322
NICK BUTCHER: So what about
[INAUDIBLE] because you're in

00:40:28.322 --> 00:40:28.765
control of the other side
of it, what about

00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:31.860
doing it with the URL?

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.820
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: WIth URL?

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.570
Just link the user to click
on some link [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.292
you mean?

00:40:36.292 --> 00:40:37.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.150
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Yeah, that
really is a workaround, yes.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:43.050
I was just looking if I can open
the attachment directly.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.260
AL SUTTON: Because you can
append parameters to a URL, so

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.300
you can pass all of the
information you were putting

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.090
in your file in that URL.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.312
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:40:51.312 --> 00:40:54.200
It would just get delivered to
your app in the intent, the

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.940
launching intent.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.190
You'll be able to get the data
filled with the launching

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.461
intent and grab the
activation code or

00:40:58.461 --> 00:41:01.260
whatever it is from there.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.050
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Do you mean
that to store the file on

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.650
somewhere, on the server,
and to make the user

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.210
download it, no?

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:09.580
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.620
I was suggesting, instead of a
file, why don't you create a

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.390
URL which includes the
activation code, or whatever

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.880
the license file is, containing
in the URL itself

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.940
as a parameter.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.890
AL SUTTON: I put an example
in the chat.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.590
NICK BUTCHER: Sorry?

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.420
AL SUTTON: I put an example in
the chat of the kind of thing

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.560
I think you're meaning.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.660
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.780
AL SUTTON: So you basically get
passed that long number at

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.814
the end into your app.

00:41:34.814 --> 00:41:36.280
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Al,
do you mean in the

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.610
[INAUDIBLE].server.com?

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.900
AL SUTTON: Yeah, that's right.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.130
ALFREDO MORRESI: It's not
working, that link.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.720
AL SUTTON: It won't do.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.980
If you construct the URL
so that you've got your

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.180
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.716
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: Oh, sorry.

00:41:47.716 --> 00:41:49.590
I was thinking that is a link.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.876
OK, sorry.

00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:51.900
Please continue.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.820
Sorry.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.790
AL SUTTON: No worries.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.850
YOSSI ELKRIEF: So basically,
I found something on Stack

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.910
Overflow for all the
intent filters.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:09.470
And the first link is
a bit way, way, way

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.640
more than you need.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:18.190
And the second one I just
posted, the intent filters for

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.010
email attachments or
file browsers.

00:42:26.908 --> 00:42:27.450
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
Thanks, Yossi.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.820
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Also
the link is here.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.080
Just a second.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.020
Just searching for, registering
my app to open

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.685
email attachments.

00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:43.010
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
Second link?

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.456
YOSSI ELKRIEF: The
last link, yeah.

00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:46.420
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI:
Thanks, Yossi.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.370
Thank you very much.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:47.970
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.410
NICK BUTCHER: So what do you
think that we're missing then?

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:51.766
Because that looks like exactly
what we're talking

00:42:51.766 --> 00:42:51.960
about, right?

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.340
Using the--

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.580
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, the
attachment, but I think what

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.075
you missed was the view
default pattern.

00:43:01.075 --> 00:43:02.700
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, the
category default.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.950
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:43:05.792 --> 00:43:09.660
Default for email and so on.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.330
NICK BUTCHER: So give that
a try, Giuseppe.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:12.460
And if that's not--

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.240
GIUSEPPE PORCELLI: I will.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.080
Thank you very much,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.840
Thank you very much.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.250
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Also thanks to
Al, because his link was the

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.390
trigger to my search.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.950
AL SUTTON: Hey, no problem.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.650
It might be worth putting the
kilometer-long intent filter

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.010
on Stack Overflow somewhere
as well so we can all pick

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.240
through it.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.340
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, both of
them are Stack Overflow links.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.480
So basically, you can check them
out, also post them on

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.390
the G+ page for developers.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.400
MATT GAUNT: Cheers, Yossi.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.112
NICK BUTCHER: Excellent.

00:43:46.112 --> 00:43:46.544
MATT GAUNT: Cool.

00:43:46.544 --> 00:43:48.440
Shall we go for another
moderated question?

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.010
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.300
Cool.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.820
All right then, Rich,
you still there?

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.620
Because we gotta cover the
new map view questions.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.040
I know you've been playing
around with it.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.750
So Shane in Wisconsin asks, with
the new v2 of maps, is it

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.060
possible to get styled maps,
like the JavaScript API?

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.940
I saw there's an API for a URL
tile provider, where you can

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.400
provide your own tiles, but I
don't know if you could use

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.660
that with Google's JavaScript
Styled Maps.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.990
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Didn't try it,
but I saw that you can do a 3D

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.060
map and everything
on the fragment.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.020
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so
basically, what is quite cool

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.510
is that we do open up the
whole tile-rendering

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.390
architecture, so if you can
supply your own tiles, then

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.720
you can plug that into the
Google Maps engine and get the

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.645
whole two-fingered panning,
rotating,

00:44:34.645 --> 00:44:36.500
in-and-out type behavior.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.850
But do you know if you
can plug in, like, a

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.200
JavaScript API URL?

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.350
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE] our
APIs just allow you to create

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:50.010
your tile provider, so that when
we ask for a tile for a

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.330
certain location, you
can provide an

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.420
overlay for that tile.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.860
And we also have a URL tile
provider, so that you can do

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.490
that direct from the internet
as well the URL format.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.360
But we don't have the JavaScript
API for the maps on

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.000
Android, as far as I
know at the moment.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.920
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
no, I get that.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.370
But he's asking, can that URL
for the URL tile provider be a

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.510
Google Maps-- is it compatible
with the Google Maps

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:09.220
JavaScript API?

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.070
Can you send it to us?

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.910
RICH HYNDMAN: That's
a good question.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.380
You should try and link
that back around.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.890
I've not seen anything in the
documentation that suggests

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.270
It just says that URL tile
provider's a partial

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.540
implementation of tile provider
that requires a URL

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.980
that points to an image.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.980
If you can somehow [INAUDIBLE]
that so that when--

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.070
it's going to call get tile
URL with a longitude,

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:34.290
latitude, and zoom level.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.050
If you can translate that into
something that's using our

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.195
JavaScript API, then, yeah,
there's no reason why it

00:45:39.195 --> 00:45:39.950
wouldn't work.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.570
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah,
the short is we don't

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.400
know, but it sounds--

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.690
we haven't tried this yet.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:48.675
NICK BUTCHER: The longer answer
is, either try it, I

00:45:48.675 --> 00:45:52.350
think, like Rich says, just
construct a URL which calls it

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.700
from the JavaScript [INAUDIBLE]
maps provider, or

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.590
perhaps go to--

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.110
I think [INAUDIBLE] holds a
similar Office Hours to this.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.872
now he's been quite involved
with it, with the direction of

00:46:00.872 --> 00:46:01.280
the products.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.410
So if you look for the
GO Office Hours, or

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.960
@developers.google.com/live and
try those guys, they may

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.210
have a better idea than us.

00:46:13.546 --> 00:46:14.540
Cool.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.890
Any other questions live?

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.550
Should we go back to Milan?

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.970
MALE SPEAKER: I do
have a question.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:29.250
I just started developing
Android for just over a month.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.700
And my question is very broad.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.290
Is there a recommended
development pattern, design

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.030
pattern for Android apps?

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:45.780
For example, I'm used to
developing in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.120
like the amount that you
control [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.500
pattern.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.328
Is there a suggested pattern
for Android?

00:46:55.328 --> 00:46:56.720
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE],
Matt.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.450
MATT GAUNT: So yeah.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:01.250
I mean, there are kind of set
ways of making life a lot

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.600
easier in the Android
platform.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.870
So when you create your first
hello world sample, you'll

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.373
start noting that we create
values, files, select strings,

00:47:09.373 --> 00:47:10.280
dimensions.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.030
We have certain ways of
distributing images, so you

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.970
pick the right size to the
right screen density.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.050
So you kind of want to stick
with things like

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:19.260
that as best you can.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.700
But ultimately you also get to
a point where you are capable

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.590
of having the model view
controller structure as much

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.575
as you want to put in place.

00:47:26.575 --> 00:47:29.815
But I'd strongly recommend that
as you start looking at

00:47:29.815 --> 00:47:31.870
the documentation, we talk about
things like activity,

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:36.513
life cycles, fragment life
cycles, services, and it's one

00:47:36.513 --> 00:47:38.030
of those things where you
definitely want to stick with

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.556
all of those rather than just
kind of saying, well, I know

00:47:40.556 --> 00:47:42.600
how to do this in Java,
because a lot of those

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.280
suggestions are for
good reasons.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.700
And they let are there generally
to make your life a

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.430
lot, lot easier by sticking
with the platform.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:54.050
So yeah, it's a very open-ended
question, but I'd

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.120
say that if you look at the
really basic documentation on

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.290
activities, that's a really nice
place to start, as well

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.760
as resources.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.115
That would be kind
of my suggestion.

00:48:03.115 --> 00:48:05.320
There's obviously the
Android Academy.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.970
I'm sure there's some awesome
tutorials for that kind of

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:07.560
stuff as well.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.840
NICK BUTCHER: And training,
Android training.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.754
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:14.810
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, guys,
can I add something?

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:19.680
To me, what I'm facing is that
I see activities strongly

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.010
associated with their views.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:29.780
And so it's like eve data, for
example, the key value store

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.500
that is offered by Android,
one of the versions is

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.550
attached to the activity
itself.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:46.620
So to me, it seems as if each
activity is separate, and then

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.680
it's like you're designing
each activity by itself.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:49:00.390
So that's what I'm feeling, is
that the user interface is

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.046
shaping the way the app
is being designed.

00:49:05.046 --> 00:49:08.290
I don't know if that
was clear or not.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.910
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.910
AL SUTTON: I think we've lost
London again, which is why

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:21.980
they're not answering.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.459
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:25.459 --> 00:49:27.540
AL SUTTON: Either that or
they're doing a very good job

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.296
of sitting still.

00:49:29.296 --> 00:49:30.250
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh,
look at that.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:30.660
They are, aren't they?

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.380
I'm supposed to take over
when that happens.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.590
I was answering email.

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:34.840
Sorry.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.700
Did someone who knows the
answer in the Hangout--

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.860
AL SUTTON: Yeah, I can take
it if you want, Rich.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.790
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.590
AL SUTTON: It used to be the
case that activities were

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:50.710
closely tied to the user
interface, so you'd stick with

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.310
one particular layout for each
activity, but frank--

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:03.250
user interface elements in and
out a lot more easily.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.330
So if you're looking at
supporting older devices, so

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:10.470
pre-Android 3.0, so before
tablets and things like that,

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:14.830
you can focus on using
an activity with

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.840
a fixed user interface.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.430
But if you want to support a
more modern look and look more

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.330
up to date, it's worth using
fragments and having a look

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.590
into fragment tutorials,
and look at the Android

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.950
compatibility libraries, which
would provide you with those

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.660
features on earlier
devices as well.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.150
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.820
AL SUTTON: No problem.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.120
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks, Al.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.610
Are you guys back
in London now?

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.535
MATT GAUNT: Just about.

00:50:41.535 --> 00:50:43.185
NICK BUTCHER: Hey, yeah,
we rejoined.

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:47.680
Seems like you got a better
internet connection in Jordan

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.130
than we do in London.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.170
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's
not bad at all.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.606
It's pretty epic.

00:50:51.606 --> 00:50:54.330
I do have a room which
seats 1,000 people

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.090
all to myself, though.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.000
I assume the Wi-Fi in here
is pretty damn good.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.870
NICK BUTCHER: And a beautiful
backdrop.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.990
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm well lit.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.070
Moderator, maybe?

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:06.450
NICK BUTCHER: Moderator.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:09.040
Chris in London says, if playing
with NFC tags and

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.650
using NFC rights on the Galaxy
Nexus, all works great, but

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.290
when opening a URL, only Opera
is listed as the chooser, even

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.170
though I have other browsers
installed.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.870
Any idea why?

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:20.775
Links from Gmail get the
full browser list.

00:51:20.775 --> 00:51:22.816
Thanks.

00:51:22.816 --> 00:51:24.710
MATT GAUNT: So I guess it
depends on the URL opening

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.904
from the NFC chip.

00:51:26.904 --> 00:51:29.285
Is there anything
weird about it?

00:51:29.285 --> 00:51:33.610
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I would
inspect the URL, the NFC tag

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:36.650
and look at what format the
chip's in, the URL's in,

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.030
because that sounds crazy.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.110
I think there's a problem
with the NFC tag there.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:42.800
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.716
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:51:44.716 --> 00:51:46.910
NICK BUTCHER: It's interesting
that Opera seemed to recognize

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.550
it but the other
browsers don't.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.790
I mean, I guess you could
always [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.200
their registering [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.570
and see what they're looking for
and see why that wouldn't

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:57.670
work for other people.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.090
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, we need
a little bit more

00:51:59.090 --> 00:51:59.870
information on that.

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:02.520
If you can grab the logs, see
what intents being fired or

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.710
anything, or if you know any
more details about the tag or

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.770
the MIME types, we could
look into it.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.900
But there's not quite enough
information to figure out

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.005
what's going on with that one.

00:52:15.005 --> 00:52:16.255
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.190
Any other live questions?

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.095
We should carry on.

00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:23.070
CHRIS BANES: Was that the
NFC tag question?

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:23.560
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.037
CHRIS BANES: I missed it.

00:52:26.037 --> 00:52:30.710
You only really receive NFC
intent if you register your

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:35.150
manifest through the intent
tag found intent, is it?

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.380
So I'm guessing only Opera's
actually added

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.002
that to their manifest.

00:52:39.002 --> 00:52:40.460
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.800
NICK BUTCHER: But then the tag
reader's actually reading the

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.610
tag, and then it's gonna just do
an open on the data of it.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:49.110
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.740
RICH HYNDMAN: No, it doesn't
say that, actually.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.490
It says he's using NFC writer
to write the NFC tag.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.100
And then the Opera
is listed when he

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.110
tries to open it again.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.820
NICK BUTCHER: Well, I know I
have nothing special installed

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.880
and I can launch URLs
straight from this.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:08.196
So it sounds like his MIME
type's a bit funky.

00:53:08.196 --> 00:53:10.700
Yeah, what tag are
you writing?

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.530
Not just any tag.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:13.560
Tell us a bit more about the
NFC tag you're writing.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.530
MATT GAUNT: One interesting
question that I've not really

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:25.520
considered how to do before on
the Google+ post, which was

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.440
someone's essentially, in their
layout, they've got a

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.410
view [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:32.210
[? field parent ?]

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.890
or wrap content.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:36.080
And essentially, when they start
going to landscape, they

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.320
want to use a fixed dimension,
to 100 dps, say, that they're

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.540
putting in a dimensions file.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.110
Now, what they'd like to do
is, on a phone, just then

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:47.190
switch back to match parent
or wrap content.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.170
Now, I understand how I'd do
that in code, but I never

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:53.970
thought how you'd do that
for a dimensions file.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:57.442
Anyone have any experience
trying to do that?

00:53:57.442 --> 00:53:59.675
YOSSI ELKRIEF: [INAUDIBLE]
a dimensions file to--

00:53:59.675 --> 00:54:01.514
MATT GAUNT: Wrap content
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:01.514 --> 00:54:04.920
Could you just set it to
minus 1 or minus 2?

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.210
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, you
can set it to minus

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.813
1 or minus 2, but--

00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:09.790
MATT GAUNT: But then that
would get screwed

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:11.040
up along the way.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.330
Yeah, that's a weird
one that I've not

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.280
really thought of before.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.595
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
in code maybe, on

00:54:19.595 --> 00:54:20.055
configuration change.

00:54:20.055 --> 00:54:22.780
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, on code,
it's configuration change.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:29.120
But on XML, so you basically
must override on configuration

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.930
change on both ways.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.060
NICK BUTCHER: Either that, or
you could just extract that

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.300
part of the layout into an
include and then have

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.120
different layouts for
layout-land and layout-port,

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.490
and the include will put
it in the right one.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.430
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.780
But basically, he mentions
a phone and a

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.335
tablet, or just a phone?

00:54:49.335 --> 00:54:51.040
MATT GAUNT: No, he's
talking about doing

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.110
a phone and a tablet.

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:52.970
So what he's doing at the
moment is to have

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:54.910
two separate layouts.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.810
Whether he's doing includes
or not, I don't know.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.490
But I think, yeah, he was just
wondering whether that was

00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.074
possible or not.

00:54:59.074 --> 00:55:01.150
And it sounds a bit it's not.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:04.270
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I did it
once a couple months ago.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.740
I did XML with minus
1 and minus 2.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.830
And it worked, but
it's not a good

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.090
convention, I think, for--

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:12.600
MATT GAUNT: No, it
sounds a bit--

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.392
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:14.392 --> 00:55:19.610
values v11 and put a REST XML
file in there, values v11

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:24.450
landscape, or whatever format
you-- oh no, values.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.620
MATT GAUNT: What about styles?

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.910
Yeah, value--

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.423
RICH HYNDMAN: Values land?

00:55:28.423 --> 00:55:29.673
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.390
YOSSI ELKRIEF: You can
do layout-land or--

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.840
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.510
NICK BUTCHER: No, but you could
have values land and

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.550
values folder and have
a different style

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:42.375
in your styles XML.

00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:43.850
MATT GAUNT: And then you
could do the match

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.410
parent or wrap content.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:47.750
NICK BUTCHER: Which can define
the layout, width, and height.

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.050
MATT GAUNT: There you go, boom.

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:49.560
Nailed it.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:50.540
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah,
that's better.

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.790
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.800
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE],
the styles.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.330
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:00.870
So you're gonna keep working
on [INAUDIBLE] now Facebook

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.160
are doing the same thing?

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.865
CHRIS BANES: I don't
know, probably not.

00:56:06.865 --> 00:56:09.390
Mine is bugs, so it's probably
feature-complete.

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.620
There's not anything else I want
to put to it, so I'm just

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:17.020
gonna leave it to
just be there.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.960
So yeah, I mean, it was
only supposed to

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.540
be something I wanted.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.590
It was a feature I wanted.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:23.795
So it's just--

00:56:23.795 --> 00:56:25.890
NICK BUTCHER: I didn't know,
it's their version that only

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.430
syncs when you open
the app, right?

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.190
Rather than just anytime you
take a photo, which is

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.970
interesting.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.635
CHRIS BANES: Does it? don't
know, I haven't

00:56:32.635 --> 00:56:33.520
even looked at it.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:33.810
NICK BUTCHER: I didn't
look at it.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.468
I just read the [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:36.468 --> 00:56:38.340
CHRIS BANES: It's made for
backup, though, isn't it

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.270
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.220
It's more for backup photos.

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.330
That's what they're trying to
push [INAUDIBLE] rather than--

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.770
RICH HYNDMAN: That reminds me as
well, one of the potential

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.100
solutions to Giuseppe's problem,
which doesn't work

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.650
very well, was just to monitor
the Bluetooth files directory

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:55.710
for whenever a Bluetooth file
is dropped in there.

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:57.660
Basically, it'd be doing
something similar by

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.060
monitoring the images
directory.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.750
That's what suddenly triggered
it in my mind.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.410
I know the Bluetooth files
directory is slightly

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.850
different on different handsets,
but it's always

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:05.220
under the SD card.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.930
You can get an external
directory and add

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.510
Bluetooth to it.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.620
So Giuseppe potentially could
just look through new files

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:14.240
appearing in the Bluetooth
files directory and then

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:14.880
process them.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.684
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:17.260
service open.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hm.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.410
Yeah, it's one of those
broadcast receivers

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:23.252
that needs a service.

00:57:23.252 --> 00:57:26.112
It can't be registered
dynamically.

00:57:26.112 --> 00:57:27.110
That's a shame.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:27.920
I didn't know that.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.700
OK, screw that.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.786
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:31.786 --> 00:57:32.840
It was just an idea.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.280
Just skip it.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.220
NICK BUTCHER: OK, we got
one minute left.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.410
We've got an interesting
question that's coming through

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:40.170
on the G+ thread, where
[INAUDIBLE] asks, can we

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:44.605
configure a sync adapter
to sync only on Wi-Fi?

00:57:44.605 --> 00:57:46.040
Has anyone done this before?

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.420
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, you can
just check your telephony

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.670
manager [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.310
NICK BUTCHER: That's one
approach, right.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.480
So when the sync kicks in, just
check is Wi-Fi, and only

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.276
continue [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:04.310
CHRIS: Well, just queue yourself
up to the next time

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:07.130
you cancel Wi-Fi, just
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.590
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, basically,
but you have also a

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:11.022
setting on--

00:58:11.022 --> 00:58:12.272
just a second.

00:58:18.958 --> 00:58:20.978
CHRIS: Is there a setting
on sync adapter?

00:58:20.978 --> 00:58:22.292
I can't remember that one.

00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:23.450
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:27.230
That's what I wanted to check.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.480
RICH HYNDMAN: It's funny.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.720
The guys in London, come 5
o'clock, they just leave.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.900
That's really rude.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.580
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, they have
two minutes left, no?

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.560
They just punch a clock
and run away.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.370
RICH HYNDMAN: That's amazing.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.804
5 o'clock, boom.

00:58:45.804 --> 00:58:47.920
AL SUTTON: Are you still
on your own, Rich?

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.600
RICH HYNDMAN: Am I sorry?

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.160
AL SUTTON: Are you still on
your own, or have we lured

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.510
anyone into join you?

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.170
RICH HYNDMAN: There's a
technician who keeps changing

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:57.050
the lights, and that's
just about it.

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:59.420
The problem is the session's
running all afternoon, so

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.670
there's people that--

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:24.970
--digging through the
Android Developer

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:25.600
documentation, right?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.946
RICH HYNDMAN: It's like he's
digging through his own mind.

00:59:30.946 --> 00:59:31.570

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:33.060
represented on the internet.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.710
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I know I had
another approach for dealing

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.090
without checking is
Wi-Fi on, or--

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:41.850
NICK BUTCHER: So I was going to
say, why don't you register

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:46.050
a broadcast receiver for
the Wi-Fi state change.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.610
And when it gets turned off,
then you use package manager

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:50.490
to turn off your sync adapter.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:55.690
And when Wi-Fi goes on,
you re-enable it.

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:57.550
Because that way, you're not
having to wake up, oh, Wi-Fi's

00:59:57.550 --> 01:00:01.590
off, go back to sleep and
consume resources.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:03.270
CHRIS BANES: True, but the
amount of time Wi-Fi goes on

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:05.810
and off, is it worth it?

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.740
I don't know.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.938
It depends how often you sync.

01:00:09.938 --> 01:00:10.770
Because if you're syncing--

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:11.580
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
worth it to me.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.430
So I mean, whilst
I'm at home--

01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:16.615
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically when
the system sends all the

01:00:16.615 --> 01:00:20.380
adapters the broadcast, because
if one sync adapter--

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:30.750
that's what Reto also had a
demo about how to use the

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:33.170
broadband and the connectivity
in a more efficient

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.660
way on 3G and stuff.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.700
So basically when--

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.990
NICK BUTCHER: The Big
Cookie approach.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.510
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:46.930
You basically smooch
on a different

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:50.420
adapter's sync event.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.223
RICH HYNDMAN: Smooch.

01:00:51.223 --> 01:00:54.400
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, you
smooch internet.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.620
CHRIS BANES: Smooching
with adapters.
