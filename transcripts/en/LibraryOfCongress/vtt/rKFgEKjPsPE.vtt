&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Good morning.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.680
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: I am so
impressed with how you guys came

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.710

quiet and such good listeners.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.010
So, thank you for that.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.210
So, I'm Leanne Potter.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.120
I direct educational outreach
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.890
and I have five things I
get to say this morning.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.380
Do you guys ever, when you
have to remember five things,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.130
do you have any special
ways of remembering?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.430
What do you do?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.040
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible audience response]

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.340
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Yeah, I could do that.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.180
Yeah, if I could sing
I would do it that way.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.680
But no, you don't want that.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.260
So, what I tend to do is, I tend
to put initials next to what I--

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.410
that was bad, I won't
do that again--

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.690
I put initials next
to what I have to say.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630
Do you see those letters up there?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.930
Read my letters.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.750

Is that a word?

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.960
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.260

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.100
&gt;&gt; W.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.400
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: It was
another W. You are good.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.700
You're good at this.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.000
See, this is, you're going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.300
to remember things
like I remember things.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.600
I like that.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.900
So, my next letter was W and
this time it's our welcome

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.080
and it's our welcome to
our very special author,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.690
and guess what letter her
last name starts with?

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.990
&gt;&gt; A W.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.290
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: W, so
it was really convenient.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.810
So, Emily come on up here.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.640
I'm going to tell you guys
about Emily, our author.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.440
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Hi guys.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.140
[ Applause ]

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.440
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Got close.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.740
That's great.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.720
Alright, so this is the book
that Emily's going to talk about,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.970
but I want to tell you a
little bit about Emily first.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.370
You know how you guys are
in third and fourth grade?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.510
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Okay so if
Emily, Emily still goes to school.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.870
Okay Emily has been going
to school for a long time

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.240
because she really likes
school and if we were

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.150
to say what grade Emily was
in, Emily's like in grade 22.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.450
Seriously.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.710
So, she finished high
school, she went to college,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.740
she studied art history, she
studied architecture and now,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.390
she must like the letter
A, because she's studying--

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.690
&gt;&gt; Author.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.990
&gt;&gt; You guys are good.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.250
I didn't even think of that.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.820
She's an author but she
is studying archaeology,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.010
she is studying anthropology
and archaeology

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.900
and she's going to
tell you about that.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.730 position:56%
She's also been very interested in a
country in West Africa called Ghana.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.300
Do any of you know
where Ghana is located?

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.470
I want to say, I taught geography
for a long time and I want

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.220
to show you a really cool trick.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.680
So, I want you guys to take your
left hand and sort of drop it down

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.020
and try to bend your
knuckle at your thumb.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.420
That's it you got it.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.750
Okay so when you do that to your
hand, your hand sort of looks

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.360
like the continent of Africa.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.090
Okay, isn't that cool?

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.690
So, if you look at, oh yeah
it sort of does, that's cool,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.780
my left-hand sore it looks like
Africa and if you look right

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.540
where your knuckle is
where you try to bend it,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.600
that's where Ghana is located.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.240
So, the next time you look at
a map of Africa you'll know

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.860
that Ghana is located
right where your knuckle is

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.200
if your hand were the
continent of Africa.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.500
Does that work for you?

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.360
Okay, I got a lot of weird ways
to remember things, but anyway,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.590 position:56%
so we're going to learn a little
bit about Ghana in West Africa today

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.530
and we are so happy that you
are here with us and I'm going

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.660
to hand my microphone over to you
and thank you boys and girls again

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.750
for being such good visitors to the
Library of Congress this morning.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.110
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
And I think actually,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.650
I don't even need a microphone.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.480
I actually have a built-in
microphone today.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.870
Exactly, so thank you so much
for that generous introduction.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.870
Thank you so much to the Library
of Congress for having me,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.120
thank you to the Bab of Book
Awards Organizational Committee

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.960 position:56%
and everyone else who helped make
this happen, I really appreciate it.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.100
It's so wonderful to be
here with all of you today.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.840
So, in English, my name
is Emily, but did you know

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.650
that I also have a Ghanaian name?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.950
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.500
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yeah, so it
begins with H. Can anyone guess?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.800
&gt;&gt; [Children answering
in unison] Happy.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.400
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Close,
I actually have a friend

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.720
in Ghana whose name is Happy,
but this is another name.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.020
This is an Arabic name.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.840
It's Habiba, yes has anyone
heard of that name before?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.140
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.900
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: So,
in Arabic it means beloved

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.290
or someone who's very
loving or caring okay.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.290
So, and then I also want to
teach you another word in Hausa

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.830
so the community that I worked
with and the students that I worked

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.020
with in Ghana to create this
book, they speak the language

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.640
of Hausa has anyone ever
heard of that before?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.940
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.730
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Okay, I do
speak it a little bit and I wanted

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.730
to start today by teaching you
a word in Hausa that begins

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.620
with S. [Inaudible
children guessing] close,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.970
close so it's sannu
[phonetic spelling].

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:02.680
Okay so I'll say it and then
you could repeat after me.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.980
sannu.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.280
&gt;&gt; Sannu.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.080
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Can
anyone guess what that means?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.150
[ Inaudible children guessing ]

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.200
Close. I mean, it's a greeting.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.400
What's the first greeting
you might say to somebody?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.700
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.820
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Hello, exactly sannu.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.520
So, when I say sannu to you, you
respond, and you say, yowah sannu.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.060
&gt;&gt; Yowha sannu.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.040
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Okay, so
I'll say sannu, and you say,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.390
&gt;&gt; Yowha sannu.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.040
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Perfect,
so now whenever you meet,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.310
if you get a chance to meet any
of these students from Ghana,

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.120
you can say, I'll say sannu,
and you can say to them,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.810
&gt;&gt; Yowha sannu.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.650
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Wow that's awesome.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.890
That is great okay, so my name is
Emily Habiba and I have a, yes,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:56.760
I have gone to, I don't
know, I'm in grade 22.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.860
Something like and I have a
background in architecture

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.000
and I'm a designer and an
illustrator and a writer

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.790
and right now I'm in a program,
it's a PHD program on anthropology.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.170
Does anyone know what
anthropology is?

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.470
&gt;&gt; No.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.390
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: So, it's
the study of cultures and humans

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.780
and how we experience the world.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.770
So, my job is to get to
know how other people think

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.650
and how they see the world
and so for me, writing

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.390
and illustrating children's stories
has been a really wonderful way

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.290
to do that because it's a way
of understanding local issues

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.460
and connecting with mostly students
like you guys over in Ghana.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.920 position:56%
So, I've been doing this since 2002,
and yeah, long, long, long, time ago

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.100
and started working and writing
and illustrating children's stories

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.660
with students there and
then I just keep going back.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.960
I can't get enough.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.790
I love the kids and I love
drawing and writing with them and,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.420
so we've been putting together a
number of workshops over the years

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.980
and one of the outcomes

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.170
of the workshops was creating this
book called Gizo-Gizo which I want

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.470
to talk to you about today.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:09.660 position:56%
So, Gizo-Gizo, you guys are going to
get to know another word in Hausa.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.520
Do you know what that might mean?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.820
&gt;&gt; Gizo.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.240
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: What do you
what do you think Gizo-Gizo means?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.540
&gt;&gt; Spider.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.840
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yes, exactly.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:28.090
So, it means spider in the language
of Hausa okay and so the origins

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.320
of this story came out of me, so
I was talking to a lot of adults

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.870
and I was trying to understand
what the issues were about water.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.230
So how to collect water, how to
store water, how to clean water

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.480
in these communities and I'll show
you some pictures in a little bit.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.340 position:56%
And you know, I was like, but I want
to know what the kids think and,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.740
so I went to a school and
I asked all of the kids.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.200
I said, what are some
of the issues here?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.590
And one little boy raised his
hand and he said, you know,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.540
my family hasn't had any
clean water for over two weeks

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.310
because a mining company up
in the North had polluted all

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.340
of the water all the
way down to his village.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.830 position:56%
So, they had no clean water and they
had to walk for miles to be able

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.130
to get clean water to drink.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.710
And then all of a sudden,
another kid raised their hand

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.460
and they said oh, the same
thing here my family too.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.860
We haven't had any
clean water for so long

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.570
and then another child raised
his hand and said the same thing

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.560
and then before I knew it,
all of the kids were talking

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.180
about this and, so we decided
to write and illustrative story

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.540
to be able to tell the
adults, what was going on

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.010
and to hopefully find
a way to fix it.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.090
So, this story is fictional
but based upon real issues

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.630
and real local concerns
that the kids had.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.640
So, it's a way that
the kids could kind

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.670
of give voice to their concerns.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.520
So, you can also, you guys
can also think about, okay,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.630
like what are some, what are some
things that I'm frustrated with?

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.060
Or that I really love that might
translate into some kind of story?

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.270
Okay, so I'm going to read it in
a little bit but first I just want

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.770
to show you some pictures
of Ghana okay.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.570
Does anybody have any
questions so far?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:14.740
Okay so, we know where Africa is?

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.390
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yeah, I'm just
going to point it out just in case.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.130
So again, the left hand.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.430
&gt;&gt; It's right there!

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.730
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yeah.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.520
Okay so now we're a
little bit closer.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.820
[Inaudible audience comments] yep

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.580
so here's the left upside-down
left hand, again right?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.510
And Ghana is right here okay?

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.110
So, it's the yellow
country right here.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.160
So, there's a big coastline and
where this story takes place,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.900
it's in a town called
Cape Coast Ghana

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.370
and it's right along the coast.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:58.070
So, what might you think would be
in a story if it's along the coast?

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.270
Yeah?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.570
&gt;&gt; Water.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.870
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Water, okay
great yeah so there might be water

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.450
in this story and you might be able
to tell that too from the cover.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.260
&gt;&gt; It might be spider webs.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.910
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: There might
be spider webs, absolutely.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:19.730
&gt;&gt; I think it will be water because
of how close it is to the water.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.030
&gt;&gt; I think it [children
speaking all at once]

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:26.940
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yeah so here
we go, oh you know about fufu.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.810
I think spider really likes fufu.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.140
We'll get to that.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:37.720
Okay, so this is a picture of
Cape Coast from the tallest,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.470
tallest hill looking down at the
city, looking out across the ocean,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.280
and so you can see
another big church there

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.010
and there's a big slave
castle along the coast too.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.570
But you can see that these are some

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.780
of the houses that
the people live in.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.290
And here we're along
the coast, right?

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.470
So, there are a lot
of fishing boats.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.770
&gt;&gt; Why are their boats like that?

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.470
They don't sail?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.800
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: And then this,
so the full name of the book is,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.010
Gizo-Gizo a Tale from
the Zongo Lagoon.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.140
So, this is actually the lagoon
that they were writing about.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.250
It's pretty amazing right and
so you can see it's pretty.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.350
What does that picture
look like to you?

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.650
&gt;&gt; Dirty water.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.950
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Yeah, a little dirty.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.250
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] recycle.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.750
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yeah,
so there's some bottles there

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.040
at the bottom and the water doesn't
look particularly clean right?

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.290
So, we're going to learn about
that in the story as well.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.180
And then this is a
photograph of a mine.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.580
So, you can keep this in your
mind as we read the story as well.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.940
So, Gizo-Gizo ends up
running a gold mine.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.570
&gt;&gt; So you go under and
[inaudible] and dig out gold?

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.070
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Some of them
are in tunnels and some of them are

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.880
above ground, they're all
different kinds of mines.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.040
And so, this is the
community that I work with

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.440
and it's called a Zongo community
and its primarily Muslim.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.150 position:56%
So, you can see these are the houses
that the students that I worked

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.560 position:56%
with on the book, that they live in.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.060
And there's their mosque that they
go to every Friday for prayer.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.240
And then water is also really
important in their religion,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.160
so they wash, and they
pray five times a day

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.930
and they use these kettles.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.370
So, they fill the kettles up
with water and then they wash.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:35.150
Here's the little girl drinking
water, she helped on the book.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.090
This is another picture,
so you can see

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.500
that they have open sewers
rather than pipes, okay.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.810
And then this, guess what this.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.110
&gt;&gt; A bathroom?

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.410
&gt;&gt; A school?

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.830
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yes,
so their school is outside,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.460
and they actually string up
little tents, little canopies

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.100
and then they work under
those canopies in the shade.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.050
So, when we wrote and
illustrated this book right here

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.940
and this is us working on the book.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.960
[Inaudible children speaking
in unison] yeah that's me.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.480
This is, [inaudible] yeah,
I've been there many times.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.360
So that's me this is my friend
Catherine who helped on the book,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.690
this is one of the teachers.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.200
His name is Owl who says
hello to all of you today

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.930
and these are some of the students.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.690
These are the kids
working on the story.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.340
&gt;&gt; How old are the children?

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.680
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
So, the children,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.030
it's a huge age range can you guess
by looking at these photographs?

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.330
&gt;&gt; Four.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.630
&gt;&gt; Eight.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.930
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Four, good to what?

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.230
&gt;&gt; Six and five.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.020
Emily Williamson: Six and five.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.320
&gt;&gt; Eight.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.190
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Eight, so
the oldest child was sixteen

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.730
who was working on this story.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.930
So, it was wonderful because the
younger children helped a lot

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.480
with the illustrations and
then the older kids tended

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.060
to enjoy the writing and,
so we worked together

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.380
and created this book
collaboratively.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.320 position:56%
So, there's some people, some of the
students like to work individually,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.250
some just like to put their,
that's basically the equivalent

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.070
of their clipboard okay except
they can write directly on it.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.530
So, he happens to be
balancing it on his head.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.080
Some pictures of the students.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.240
Everyone's very focused.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.210
So, one thing I want to do at the
end of today's presentation is

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.650
to give you guys the opportunity
to also do a little bit of drawing

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.970
and to help us think
about a new story.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.810
Okay, so I want to stop with
this one right now and I want

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.530
to read you the story and
then after I'm done reading,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.010
what I would like to do
is a short art activity.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:05.790
So, combining drawing and
writing about a character okay?

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.160
So, when I'm reading the story,
you can think about a character

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.280
that you might be interested
in drawing and writing about,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.710
that maybe Gizo-Gizo meets okay?

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.870
Yeah so first though I'd
like to read the story.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:26.950
Okay. Gizo-Gizo, a tale
from the Zongo Lagoon.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.510
Okay, here's your opportunity
to learn a little more Hausa.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.320
You ready?

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.750
So, I'm going to say it.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:44.190
So, when I'm about to start a
story, I say Ga ta nan ga ta nanku.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:50.410
And then, whoever's listening to
the story they say, tazo mujita.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.800
&gt;&gt; [In unison] Tazo mujita.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.560
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Exactly,
saying we are all ears,

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.080
we're listening closely okay.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:01.720
So, when I say ga ta nan ga ta
nanku, you say tazo mujita, okay?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.020
Ready we'll try it, okay ready?

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.250
Ga ta nan ga ta nanku,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.550
&gt;&gt; [In unison] Tazo mujita.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.670
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
I can't hear you.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.810
Ga ta nan ga ta nanku.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.110
&gt;&gt; [In unison] Tazo mujita.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.410
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Okay, Gizo-Gizo,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.710
a Tale from the Zango Lagoon.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:26.520
Not so very long ago many
animals lived in the Zango Lagoon.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.330 position:56%
Fish bask in the clear clean waters,

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.590
frogs sang in the tall green
grasses, lizards scurried up

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.610
and down the trunks of
the leafy Moringa trees.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:43.340
And down by the watery edge of
the peaceful lagoon that flowed

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.810
into the sea lived
three best friends.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.480
Crab, Tortoise and Spider.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.460
A fisherman by trade, Crab
was generous and hard-working.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.190 position:56%
He spent most of his time at the
bottom of the lagoon with his family

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.950
or hauling fish into his canoe.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.960
Tortoise was wise and very patient.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.610
Animals came to him for advice
and to buy the medicines he made

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.140
from the healing roots and leaves.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:19.240
Unlike the other two,
Spider was lazy and selfish.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.570
When he wasn't lounging around
in his favorite Moringa tree

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.290
overlooking the lagoon he
was mining for gold upstream

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.830
and dreamt of being rich.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:33.200
Despite their differences,
Crab, Tortoise

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.260
and Spider ate dinner together
every day at high tide.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.640
Crab caught the fish,
Tortoise blessed the kenkey

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.540
and Spider ate greedily.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:49.560
One day after dinner, instead
of throwing his rubbish

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.680
into the dustbin, Spider
tossed his kenkey leaves

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.030
and plantain peels
right into the lagoon.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.890
A boogie Crab pleaded using
the Hausa name for friend.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.760
You must respect the lagoon,
it belongs to all of us.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.980
Bagh Spider balked, a little
rubbish is no big deal.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.840
I own a mining business,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.530
someday when I am rich,
I will buy this place.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.640
I can do whatever I want.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.550
Rainy season came, and
Spider's bad habits grew worse.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.270
He tossed his used water
sachets, empty mineral bottles,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.880
and old rancid milk
right into the lagoon.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.330
The water turned green and soupy
and no longer flowed into the sea.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.940
The tall grasses were filthy

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.370
and smelly the banks
were muddy and bare.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.970
Piles of garbage were everywhere.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.790
Gizo-Gizo Crab begged, you
must respect the lagoon.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.500
It belongs to all of us.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.250
Ha! Spider bragged, my
mining business is booming.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.810
A little rubbish is no big deal.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.450
Someday when I am rich,
I will buy this place.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.840
I can do whatever I want.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.710
Dry season came, and Spiders
habits grew even worse!

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.150
His huge new factory
polluted the lagoon

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.930
with chemicals, oil, and waste.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.970
The animals got sick, fish
groaned with empty stomachs,

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.970
frogs winced from sore throats,
lizards moaned from aching legs.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.500
They all went to Tortoise and
asked for healing roots and leaves.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.740
There was very little left.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.510
Tortoise boiled the last of the
boozobo [phonetic spelling] flowers

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.020
to settle the fishes upset
stomachs, he pounded the last

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.680
of the Moringa leaves to
relieve the lizards aching legs.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.350
He mixed the last of his
salt with clean water

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.970
to soothe the frog's sore throats.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:02.000
Crab shook his head sadly and said,
this has gone on far too long.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.510
We must talk some sense
into Spider's head.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.120
The next day Crab and Tortoise
invited Spider to dinner.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.660
His favorite meal of
fried fish and kenkay.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.080
Look, he wrote a letter.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.150
Dear Gizo-Gizo, you are invited
for fried fish and kenkay

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.910
for Saturday at high tide.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.060
Crab and tortoise.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.020 position:56%
Spider sat down at the table and ate
greedily without so much as a glance

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.950
at his friends who
didn't eat one bite.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.580
Little did Spider know, that
Crab had caught the fish

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.080
from the polluted Zango Lagoon
and that the kenkey was rotten.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.180
Soon, Spider grew very ill.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.570
His legs ache so badly he couldn't
climb down from his Moringa tree,

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.590
he tried to call two Tortoise for
help, but his throat was too sore.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.580
He moaned and groaned
from his upset stomach.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.970
Oh, what did I do?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.090
Spider cried, I have
ruined our lagoon.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.850
Crab and Tortoise smiled.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.450
Perhaps Spider had
learned his lesson.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.790
Gizo-Gizo, said Crab, there is only
one thing to do, you must clean

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.560
up the lagoon and never
dump rubbish into it.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.530
Tortoise nodded wisely and added,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.970
you must respect the lagoon
it belongs to all of us.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.520
When Spider finally felt better,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.510
he set to work busily
cleaning the lagoon.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.290
He turned his mining business
into a place that cleaned water.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.750
He collected rubbish from the
high grasses and removed the piles

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.970
of garbage from the basis
of the Moringa trees.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.060
After many, many days of hard work,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.950
fish basked at the
clear, clean waters.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.380
Frog sang and the tall
green grasses.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.550
Lizard scurried up and down the
trunks of the leafy Moringa trees.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.780
Life was peaceful once
again in the Zango Lagoon.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.380
So, Crab, Tortoise and Spider
enjoyed a dinner of fried fish

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.880
and kenkay together at high tide.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.790
Crab caught the fish,
Tortoise blessed the meal

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.250
and Spider made an announcement.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.250
I've learned my lesson, said
Spider to his old friends,

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:18.000 position:56%
as my great-great grandfather used
to say, the lagoons water is sacred,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.720
it belongs to no one and
everyone at the same time.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.770
It takes only one day to destroy it
and many, many days to restore it.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.760
We must keep it clean
every single day.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.450
And then they end the story saying,

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.900
crun coos [phonetic
spelling] also in Hausa.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.200
Do you want to say it?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.500
Crun coos.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.800
&gt;&gt; [In unison] Crun coos.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.100
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Perfect.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.110
So that is the story and
I just want to say again

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.110
that this was a collaborative
effort.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:48.410
So, that means that the students,
all of the students in Ghana worked

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.950
with me to do all of
these illustrations

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.000
and all of the writing.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.660
So, we worked, we put our heads
together and created this story.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:02.400
[inaudible audience question]
The students in Ghana, so a lot,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.020
one student might have drawn
this house and another student

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.710
for example might have
drawn this fish

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.020
and then I helped put it together
and compose it on the page.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.350
And so all of the students they
can recognize the different pieces

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.040
that they drew in the book.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.370
Isn't that neat?

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.390
So that's a good transition and I
thought that we could take maybe 10

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.010
or 15 minutes thinking about,

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.200
so there are three main
elements of the story.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.500
Does anyone know what the
three main elements are?

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.960
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] the
tortoise and the Spider.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.510
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Yes, okay great.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.600
So, in this particular story,
the Spider, the Tortoise

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.890
and the Crab are the
main characters, right?

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.290
So, one element of a story
is creating characters.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.950
Yep, you have another?

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.490
&gt;&gt; The main idea.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.790
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: The main idea,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.540
right okay the theme
of the story, right?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.840
What the story is about.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.460
So, this one is about
water and it's about mining

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.870
and keeping a lagoon clean.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.620
&gt;&gt; It's about taking
care of the water.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.710
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: It's about
taking care of the water exactly.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.010
So that's another piece
of the story.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.000
So, it's the action and
the theme are interrelated.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.990
So, we have character,
we have action and theme,

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.310
and then what is the third one?

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.660
&gt;&gt; Teamwork.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.510
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Teamwork,
yes in this story this was a team,

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.100
this was a collaborative effort.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.590
We worked as a team to create this
story and so then the third one

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.210
that I'm thinking of
that is also important

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.240
to the story, is the place, right?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.540
In which it happened.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.090
So, the setting, exactly and so

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.840
since we don't have
too much time today,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.010
I thought we could
focus on a character.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.490
So, I thought it would be fun, I
think we could pass the clipboards

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.000
around and if I could
actually have one

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.140
as a reference that
would be terrific.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.790
Thank you.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:04.170
Okay, so what we're thinking
when I was talking with students

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.080
in Ghana this past summer,

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.880
we thought it would be really
interesting to create a news story

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.990
about Gizo-Gizo, one
where he goes on a trip.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:18.560
So, he's going to go on a journey
and I thought it would be fun

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.600
if we could think about characters

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.040
that Gizo-Gizo might
meet along his journey.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.650
Who has an idea of a character

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.750
that Gizo-Gizo might
meet along a journey?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.950
&gt;&gt; Another spider.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Another spider,

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.200
okay who else might he
meet on his journey?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.280
&gt;&gt; Another Crab.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.580
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Another crab.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.920
&gt;&gt; A bird.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.860
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: A bird, okay.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.160
&gt;&gt; A fish.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.820
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: A fish, great.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.540
&gt;&gt; A human [inaudible] a wolf.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.570
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: A wolf, okay
so in addition to thinking either

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.110
about an animal or a
person, think about what kind

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.760
of personality they might have.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.180
Are they a nice person?

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.150
Are they a lazy person or animal?

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.450
What kind?

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.750
Are they stubborn?

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.050
Are they clever?

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.350
Are they wise?

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.170
And what that might mean.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.060
So I'd like you to write
your name at the top,

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.750
and then if you have any questions
that you want to ask a student

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.920
in Ghana, I left you a little
space there so if there's something

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.650
that you want to share about
your character or anything,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.810
any kind of question that you have
about the story, I will do my best

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.470
to get answers for you so you can
talk to the students in Ghana.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:38.030
And then in the center of the page,
you can draw your character okay.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.530
And I'm going to pass around
some examples of characters

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.210
that other students in Ghana have
drawn and then in these bubbles

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.580
around the character that you draw,
you can describe it using words

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.170
or if you'd rather just draw in
these bubbles you can do that too.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.180
So, here it says my
character looks like,

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.410
so you could just add some words

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.310
that describe what your
character looks like.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:06.150 position:56%
My character likes to say, so maybe
your character has a specific phrase

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.340
he or she likes to say, like son
ooh [phonetic spelling] who knows?

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.060
It could be an English or in
Hausa or in another language.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.080
My character's personalities,
you can describe that.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.180
My character thinks about, so what
is your character dream about?

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.480
What do they like to do?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.820
So, you can fill these in
however you like and if you'd

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.060
like to just draw in the
center that's fine too.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.730
I just want this to be a
fun exercise and then I want

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:35.310 position:56%
to take your drawings with me to
Ghana and share them with kids there

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.070
and I'm hoping that maybe all
together we can create a story.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.580
What do you think about that?

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.020
Yeah, do you have a question?

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.380
&gt;&gt; Did you write that book?

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.080
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: I did, with
students in Ghana it was teamwork.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.380
What do you think?

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.850
Anyone else have any question?

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:06.260
[Inaudible comments]

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.690
So, I'm going to just pass around
so you can see, I'm going to kind

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.260
of lay these out actually,
not for you to copy

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.970
but just to get some ideas.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.340
These are some drawings
that the kids have done.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.440
I don't know, what
do you think it is?

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.610
I think they made it up
in their imagination.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.520
So, it doesn't have to be a real
animal either it can be something

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.920
you make up, anything you like.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.950
So, these are just to
give you some ideas.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.340
Yeah, sure that would be great.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.470
If anyone wants to talk through
a character idea I'm happy

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.870
to walk around and help.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.620
These are some personalities, so
you can just, if they're helpful,

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.920
you can think about them.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.060
Oh, you want it?

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.570
I think someone else has it.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.600
I think Sasha's coming.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.900
[Inaudible question] So this
is a, [inaudible question] yes,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.900
so this is in Hausa
and this is an English.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:04.720
So, this character feels
anxious and this is wise, evil.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.360
Just to give you some ideas.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.480
Do you have an idea?

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.860
My character looks like a Crab.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.810
Nice that's great.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.460
Do you want to draw the crab?

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.920
Do you have a name for your crab?

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.430
&gt;&gt; The Good Crab.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.630
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Is it
a female or a male crab?

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.930
Okay.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.400
&gt;&gt; Dami.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.700
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Dami?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.640
I like that, that's
a beautiful name.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.980
You could even put that
on there if you want too.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.280
Where does your character live?

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.100
&gt;&gt; She lives in New York.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.930
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Oh
cool, you want to add that?

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.230
That's great.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.590
I love your crab.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.170
Nice, beautiful.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:28.500
Oh, that's great, Cutie Pie.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.110
My character has pink
and blue hair, long hair.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.590
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.970
What is your character's
name and where do they live?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.300
&gt;&gt; Oh wow!

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.080
Great. Nice.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.390
I love this.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.470
Yeah so what is this crab like?

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:05.770
Is he nice?

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.070
Is he mean?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.370
Is he clever?

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.670
Is he shy?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:17.930
So sometimes these are helpful too.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:23.300
Oh look, so this one
jealous, is he jealous?

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.600
Maybe not, nope.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.900
&gt;&gt; He's nice.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.800
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: He's
nice, yeah so how is he nice?

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.140
What does he like to
do that makes him nice?

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.730
[Inaudible response] Yeah,
that's good, that's good.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:38.120
So maybe he does things
to help his friends.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:46.030
So, everybody, I think
it's time to wrap up.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:50.880
But before we turn them
in, does anyone want

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.630
to share their character?

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.930
Let's do three shares.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.950
I think we have time for three.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.830
So, you could just tell us a
little bit about your character.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.590
&gt;&gt; My character is a
cheetah caterpillar

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.160
and he like to say rich and he.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.690
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Wow
wonderful, fantastic.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.530
Anyone else?

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:19.810
&gt;&gt; My character is a
unicorn and she want to fly.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:24.220
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Great, okay.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.650
&gt;&gt; My character is a
butterfly and she is kind

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.490
as she wants to be more kind.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:39.190
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Wonderful
alright okay let's do two more.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:48.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My character is a girl and she's
smart, intelligent, she's beautiful,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.350
and she's warm-hearted inside.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.810
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Great, okay one more.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.500
&gt;&gt; My character is about
a little boy who is rich.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, great thank you so much.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:06.440
So, we'll collect the clipboards
and I'm going to make sure that all

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.250
of the students in Ghana get
to see these amazing characters

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.670
that you created, and I think
we should all stay in touch

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.510
and hopefully we can create a
collaborative story together.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.300
So now I think I just
wanted to open it up to,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.040
if you all have any
questions for me?

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.650
Or if you have questions for the
kids and I can write them down

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.950
and ask them when I see them next.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.830
I'm going to be going
back there next summer.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.710
You're done?

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.090
Perfect, thank you.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.910
&gt;&gt; How many students are there?

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.620
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: That is
a great question, so every,

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:57.010
I have been doing this for many,
many years and I started in 2012

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:04.610 position:56%
and we had about thirty students and
then it went up to about forty-five.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:10.480
In 2014 and last year, we started
a very large educational program

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.450
with many kids in the
capital city called Accra

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.970
and we had almost a
hundred students.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.260
&gt;&gt; What's like, your type
of books, like does it have,

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:31.070
like a meant to it like for
their characters to change it,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:35.600
the kind of the middle
and the ends of the story?

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.150
Or is there like different
ways you make it?

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:44.740
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Would
you mind rephrasing or,

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.840
so did the character
change throughout the story?

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.850
&gt;&gt; Like how their emotions changed
when he thought he could rule it

00:38:55.850 --> 00:39:01.950
but then he figures out
that he needs to take care

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.250
to make it a better place.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.720
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Exactly, exactly, so,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.450
so much about stories is
about character development

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.060
and characters changing
right and learning a lesson

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.180
or learning something
about themselves.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.690
And so, in this story, Gizo-Gizo
changed throughout the course

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.490
of the story, right?

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.430
Exactly.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.320
&gt;&gt; What do they eat?

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.650
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
What do they eat?

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.330
That is a great question.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.120
So, in Ghana there
are all kinds of food.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.950
I think I heard one
student say before the name

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.250
of a food called fufu.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.350
Does anyone know what fufu is?

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.970
&gt;&gt; Fufu is something
that comes from Africa.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.920
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Yes, it's
a food that comes from Africa,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.770
does anyone know what fufu is?

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.070
&gt;&gt; Potatoes or [inaudible]

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.370
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: So,

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.670
&gt;&gt; I eat it.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.970
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
You eat it okay?

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.440
So fufu it's kind of
like this big ball of,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.680
it almost looks like pizza dough.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.850
But it's made of something called
cassava which is like a yam

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.590 position:56%
or like a particular kind of like a
potato, but dry and then they mix it

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.260
with something called plantain,
which is kind of like a banana

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.310
and they pound it and they pound
it forever and then it turns

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:24.910 position:56%
into a big ball of basically kind of
dough and then you eat it with soup.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.630
It's very delicious and very heavy.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:35.010
&gt;&gt; She doesn't pound it, she
just like, use something,

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.790
she makes it in the oven,
she mixes it in the oven.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.160
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Oh wow,
I need to learn from your mom.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:47.700
That's great, so fufu is a very,
very popular food and if you speak

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:58.240
to almost any Guiana and they will
say that fufu is their favorite.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.580
[Laughter] Yes, jollof
rice also very popular

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.350
which is a spicy rice
with vegetables in it.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:13.220
&gt;&gt; What's the food that
you mentioned in your book?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.260
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: So,
the food that I mentioned

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:22.270
in the book is called kenkay
and it's fermented corn,

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:28.440 position:56%
and then they wrap it in a corn
leaf or in a, sorry, in a palm leaf.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.530
And they often will sell them
in huge piles along the side

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.310
of the road and you can just
kind of peel it open and eat it.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.990
So, they don't even use plastic
bags or anything or any kind

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.290
of plastic to keep it safe.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.590
They just use palm leaves.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.450
Anyone else?

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.880
&gt;&gt; Are there any beaches in Ghana?

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.870
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: There are,
there are a lot of beaches.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:58.770
So, she asked if there any beaches
in Ghana and yes there are a lot

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.520
of really beautiful beaches.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.740
The shores are also quite
rocky in a lot of areas

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.150
and the tide is very strong,

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.330
so you need to be careful
when you go swimming.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.840
I have only been swimming
once in Ghana

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.140
but yes there are gorgeous beaches.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.170
&gt;&gt; Anyone else?

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.500
&gt;&gt; What are beaches?

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.280
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
What are beaches?

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.790
Who knows what a beach is?

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:31.290
So, it's a sandy edge
along a coastline.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and salt water.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a whole ocean.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.180
&gt;&gt; An ocean with sand.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.920
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: An
ocean with sand, yeah.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.420
So, in Hausa, the word
for beach is bakin teku

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:53.970
which means the mouth of the ocean.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.700
Anyone else?

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:04.840
&gt;&gt; Are beaches in Ghana
the same as beaches in DC?

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:14.200
Is the beach the same
as in Maryland?

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.120
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: The
beaches are very similar yes.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.040 position:56%
So, the question was are the beaches

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.590
in Ghana similar to
those in Maryland?

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.900
Yes, I think they are.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.200
They're very similar.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.030
And they're both on
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.440
They kind of face each other it
would be a long way to get from one

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:37.350
to the other but, they're
very similar.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:44.000
&gt;&gt; Is the beaches colder
in Maryland?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.600
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
Oh, is the water colder?

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.130
&gt;&gt; The water.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.690
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: So, the water
is probably a little bit warmer

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:58.340
than in Maryland but it's
because, so the weather is very,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.760
very tropical and very,
very humid in Ghana.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.530
&gt;&gt; Are the waves bigger there?

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.340
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Wow so many
questions about the beaches.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.420
[Laughter] I think we
all want to go swimming.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:21.050
You know, in some areas the waves
are very, very big and because it's

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:26.820
so rocky, the waves hit the
rocks and bounce off the rocks

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.680
and go really high into the air.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:39.140
So, it can also be a
little bit dangerous.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.510
&gt;&gt; Is Ghana [inaudible]

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:42.810
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Is?

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.110
&gt;&gt; Is Ghana big?

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:45.410
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Is Ghana big?

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.260
So, let's see, so I'm
trying to think.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:53.430
So, in a car if you were driving
from the beach all the way

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.410
up to the north of
Ghana, it's probably going

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:59.130
to take you about 20 hours.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:05.300
So, it's almost like driving from
here up to northern New Hampshire.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.640
&gt;&gt; If you walk, what happens?

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.130
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson:
One more question.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.430
Okay one more.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:14.220
We have time for one more question.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.550
&gt;&gt; If you walk over
there how much hours?

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.120
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Oh my
gosh, we better start now.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.320
[Laughter] and I'm not
sure we could walk there.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.300
I think we would need
to build a boat first.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.190
Okay, thank you so much everybody.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.500
So, who remembers how
to say hello in Hausa?

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.260
So, if I say, sannu
you say, yowah sannu.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:41.330
So, and then in Hausa, to say,
if I want to say thank you

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.880
to all of you, I say na gode.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.180
&gt;&gt; Na gode

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.480
&gt;&gt; Emily Williamson: Na gode.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.380
So, thank you so much.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.680
Na gode.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.980
&gt;&gt; Na gode.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:04.150
[ Applause ]

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
