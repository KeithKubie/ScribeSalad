00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.040
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So did you know that in the 60s and 70s

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
when the astronauts went to the moon in the Saturn 5 rocket, they actually

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
left experiments on the surface of the moon? In fact there's one that's still there today

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
and it's still operating. We're still getting data out of it. But before I explain that,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.130
I kind of need to go to the bathroom.
[Toilet Flush]

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.180
Alright. Here where I went to grad school we shared this building with NASA, which is interesting because every time I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.220
go wash my hands after using the bathroom, I think about the moon. Check this out.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.260
On one wall we have a mirror, and on the other wall we have a mirror and they're lined up.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.300
Now all this makes for some pretty interesting fun stuff, but what I want to talk about today

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.350
is right here. Look at that. No matter where you go in the room,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.370
you always see the camera lens right in the corner of the mirror. This has pretty

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.390
serious implications for NASA science on the moon. Now it's so important

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.410
that I've asked Henry from MinutePhysics to explain it to you. Let's check it out.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.440
(Henry) A corner reflector like this one is an ingenious and beautifully

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.490
simple device. It takes advantage of the fact that a mirror mirrors one dimension

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
of the world. If you have a second mirror, you can reverse back to how you started.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.550
But if the second mirror is at 90 degrees to the first, now when you mirror back,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.550
the world will have rotated 180 degrees. So if you send a beam of light

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.570
into a corner reflector, regardless of what direction you send it in or what direction the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.620
corner reflector is oriented, it'll come back rotated 180 degrees into a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.650
parallel return path to its source.
(Destin) If you look here at the top of the camera you can see that my name

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.680
is mirrored. But if I bring it over here to the side in the corner,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.700
look at that. You can read it. You can probably see it a little bit better with my shirt.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.710
Can't read it.. Now you can. That's because you're seeing a reflection of a reflection.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.720
But look at this. If I look back at the corner and then I tilt the camera up,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.750
I'm no longer aligned. I can't see the lens any more. Now that tells me that I'm not

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.770
in a true return path like he tried to explain to me.
(Henry) That's because those mirrors are

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.810
only reflecting in the two horizontal directions. There's no mirror reflecting back to you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.860
in the vertical direction. If you have a third mirror at a right angle, everything will

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.870
be mirrored, reversed, and mirrored again, so your name will be backwards.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.900
But at least now you can move your camera or eyes around however you want,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.930
and as long as you can still see all three mirrors, you'll see a reflection of yourself

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.960
in the middle. Mathematically, if you want to reverse a vector, you need to reverse each of its components,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.990
and so you need three mirrors to get full retroreflection in 3D.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.010
One mirror for each dimension.
(Destin) Oh. This is just like the reflectors on the road.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
If you look real close at this one that my wife hit with the lawn mower you can see that they're actually

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.040
just little bitty corner reflectors.
(Henry) Exactly! But those are imperfect.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
On purpose, because a high precision corner reflector would bounce the light back

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.090
to your car's headlights and not your eyes.
(Destin) Ohh! Well I just happen to have

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.110
an array of high precision corner reflectors here with me in Germany. And what's that?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.750
It's Johan, the laser guy from the Netherlands. You remember him right?

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.150
This corner reflector is so precise,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.160
I can set it here on this bridge, go all the way up river to the next bridge,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.980
hit it with a laser and I'll still get a reflection, even though it's snowing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.190
Check it out. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.200
What are you doing Johan?!

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.210
(Johan) I'm warming up my laser.
(Destin) [laughs] Alright.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.260
And ah.. Why are you doing that?
- To get it to the right temperature.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.290
Because it's very temperature sensitive.
- Oh OK. Alright can you ping

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.300
the reflector? There it is. Clearly you're

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.320
getting a return. That's what? Like 500 meters away would you say?
- 350

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.320
- How do you know that?
- I counted steps. [laugh]

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.360
- OK so here's the question. If Johan is able to get a really good reflection

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.380
at 350 metres away, in the snow, with a hand-held laser

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.420
that he's having to blow on to keep alive, then what are we able to do if we put

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.450
a high precision laser reflector on the moon. In fact,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.470
that's what Apollo did. What was it, Apollo what?
- 11, 14 and 15.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.490
- Apollo 11, 14 and 15. They put retro-reflectors on the moon

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.040
and we're still using it for experiments to this day.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.570
(Henry) Right. Experiments like monitoring the distance to the moon. If you count how long it takes a photon

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
to get to the moon and back, you can just multiply by the speed of light, divide by two

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.630
and figure out the distance to the moon, within centimeters.
(Destin) Exactly Henry.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.640
So if you shoot the moon with a laser...

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.690
2.56 seconds later, divided by two, 1.28 light

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.220
seconds to the moon. So if you do the math that ends up to about... this far from the Earth.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.770
(Henry) Anyway, this is useful for understanding the detailed nuances of the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.810
moon's rotation and orbit, measuring movement of tectonic plates here on earth,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.840
and even testing the fundamental principles of general relativity.
(Destin) Corner reflectors are not

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.870
just used in optics, you can also use it for any type of reflected electromagnetic radiation.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.910
Here, in Frankfurt Germany, there's a bridge with long

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.940
posts coming off the big pylons there under the bridge. We've got a big boat

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.990
about to go under the bridge. So if you look at the very end, there's corner reflectors. Only they're not

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.010
mirrors, they're just metal. He's using a radar to guide

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.040
off of those corner reflectors so he doesn't hit the bridge. It's basically

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.050
a passive lighthouse, only it's not light, it's radar.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.100
(Henry) Cool! So corner reflectors are like a lighthouse that tells you its distance,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.110
except better because they don't need their own source of power. That's why they were a good experiment to leave

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.120
on the moon. Actually, the Apollo astronauts left other junk on the moon too.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.130
Come over to my channel, MinutePhysics, and I'll tell you all about it.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.160
[Music]

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.200
That's how the Apollo guys went to the bathroom, in the command module.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.220
How'd they do it on the lunar module?
(Henry) Imagine it's fairly similar.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.230
They probably left it on the moon though. Do you realise there might be..
- There might be poop on the moon. We gotta think this through! [laugh]

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.250
I didn't even think about that. We always talk about the other

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.310
stuff that they sent.
(Henry) Did they leave their poop on the moon? [laughs]

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.350
I imagine they must have, because like why would you bring that back?
- When I go hiking I try to find the perfect

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.360
spot. That guy has won that game. [laugh]

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.400
(Henry) The most distant porta-john. [laugh] The most distant porta-john is the

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.410
on the lunar landers on the moon.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.410
