00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.390
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Hello, and
welcome to the third episode

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.170
of our show about games.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.190
My is Bruno Oliveira, and I work
on the Android Developer

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.190
Relations team.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.850
TODD KERPELMAN: I am Todd
Kerpelman, and I am on the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.780
Play Games Developer
Relations team.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.630
And this is episode three of
"Game On!", our sort-of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.850
every-couple-of-weekly
show about all

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.190
things games related.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.490
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And you're
probably wondering where

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070
episodes one and two went.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.780
And this is what we're
going to talk about.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.770
TODD KERPELMAN: This brings
us right into

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.680
our news and updates.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.050
And we'll start with--

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.280
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: --we actually
changed our name.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.970
TODD KERPELMAN: We
have a name.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.740
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: We used to be
"The Google Play Game Show,"

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.440
and now we've changed to "Game
On!" Actually, that font looks

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.680
a little too modern
for my tastes.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.430
Why don't we try something
more retro, like 8-bits?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.880
Ah, that's much better.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.740
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
a little better.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.140
So you'll notice we added
the lens flares in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.310
just for you gamers.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.565
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Absolutely.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:54.910
TODD KERPELMAN: We know
you love lens flares.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.080
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And we have some
news on the iOS front.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.820
Is that right?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.310
TODD KERPELMAN: That's right.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.500
On the iOS front, the big news
is, we just released an update

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.300
to the iOS SDK.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.810
Version 1.1 is officially
available.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.310
The biggest improvement that
you will probably notice is

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.950
that we have a new look for
the Achievement and the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.210
Leaderboard widgets.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.750
It's a little more of a modern
look, going with the aesthetic

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.840
of iOS moving forward.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.890
So you'll probably notice
that right away.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.070
We also have a number
of performance

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.050
improvements under the hood.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.820
We've greatly improved
the caching

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.150
for leaderboard scores.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.580
If, for instance, your user
switches back and forth

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.860
between daily, weekly, and
all-time leaderboard scores,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.440
that will be much faster.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.470
We do a better job
of batching and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.820
submitting leaderboard scores.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.890
If the user plays a bunch
offline, then comes back

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130
online, all of their leaderboard
scores, all their

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.790
score submissions, will be
submitted in one nice little

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.290
batch instead of, say, multiple
score submissions.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.190
So that'll be nice.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.040
That'll be a lot
more efficient.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.790
We have exposed that
call as well.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.040
If you want to, for instance,
submit a couple of scores to a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.950
couple of leaderboards all at
once, we now have a call

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.500
available for you to basically
batch all those up and make

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.090
those in one network call.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.010
Which is really nice.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.580
It saves on battery
and performance

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.890
and all of that stuff.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.730
We've also made a number of
bug fixes and enhancements

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.170
and, in general, performance
improvements under the hood.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.820
And so we encourage you
to check it out.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.230
I do want to let you know about
a couple of gotchas.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.220
First, there are two new
frameworks that are required

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280
by this new library,
specifically,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.370
CoreText.framework and
QuartzCore.framework.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.820
So if you haven't included
those in your

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.440
project, you'll need to.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.180
Also, with this new library,
you're going to need a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.760
deployment target of
iOS 6.0 or greater.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.470
Chances are you're probably
already doing

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.260
that with your game.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.360
But if not, you are going to
need to change your deployment

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.610
target if you're using
this new library.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.060
And so this library is available
from our site at

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.000
developers.googl
e.com/games/services.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.510
And then look for the Downloads
link on the left.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.850
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And now, for
those of you who like tracking

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.480
bugs, and especially if you
like a public way to track

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.490
bugs, we have--

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.010
ta-da!--

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.760
a public bug tracker.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.170
So if you've got a bug or a
feature to request, then you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.680
can access that URL right
there, code.google.com/

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.930
p/play-games-platform.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.600
TODD KERPELMAN: This is also
available from our Games page.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.880
If you look on the left, of
there's now a link to, I

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.350
believe, Public Bug Tracker.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.970
So if you notice any issues
with a game, or you have

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.590
requests, or anything
else, feel free

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.400
to submit them there.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.720
I can't guarantee that we will
reply to every bug, but I can

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.960
guarantee we'll at least
look at them.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.470
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Absolutely.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.370
And make sure to post only the
bugs that have to do with the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.380
platform there.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.750
If you find a bug in the
samples, then the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.710
right place is GitHub.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.470
And you go to GitHub,
and GitHub has

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.830
its own issues system.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.930
TODD KERPELMAN: And if you find
a bug with a game, you're

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.590
still probably better off
contacting the game developer.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.290
We can't debug every game.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.580
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: We didn't
make every game.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.070
TODD KERPELMAN: No.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.700
So with that out of the way,
let's move into this week's

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.350
topic, which is Cloud Save.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.240
And so Cloud Save is
a great feature.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.700
I think this service
is a little

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.620
under-utilized right now.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.950
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Absolutely.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.750
It's missing on so many games.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.280
I've lost count how many times
I've played a game and wished

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.780
it had Cloud Save.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.510
Especially if you change
devices, and then you have to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.320
lose all of your progress.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.150
TODD KERPELMAN: I suppose Google
employees might have

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.390
more devices than your
typical consumer.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.410
But even now, you're starting to
see consumers with a lot of

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.420
devices in the household.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.240
Right?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.900
Maybe they've got more
than one phone.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.020
Maybe they've got a phone
and a tablet.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.440
And they switch back and
forth between them.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.800
And it would be great for your
users if they could keep their

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.920
progress between one device
and the next.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.620
If they suddenly go from playing
your game on their

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.390
phone to opening up your game
on the tablet, and they

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.920
realize that they have to start
over again all the way

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.960
from level one, they're probably
just not going to

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.890
play your game on that device.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.210
And maybe suddenly they decide
they've lost interest in it.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.640
They're not playing
your game anymore.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.480
They're not seeing ads.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.060
They're not buying
in-game items.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.670
They're not telling their
friends about it.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.830
And it's bad for your users,
and it's bad for you, too.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.870
So we really encourage you
to look into Cloud Save.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.340
It's really just designed to
do one thing, and one thing

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.210
only, and that's sync your
users' progress from one

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.240
device to the next.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.120
And so, with that big preamble
out of the way,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.180
let's go into a demo.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.640
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Actually, before
we go into the demo,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.960
it's important to notice that
Cloud Save is actually

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.990
cross-platform.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.360
So you can even have, again, if
your game runs on Android

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.730
and iOS, you can save your state
on Android, and then

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.200
pick up the same state where
you left off on iOS, or

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.260
vice-versa.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.530
So that's good for households
that have, like, one iPad, and

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.386
then one Android, and
one iPhone, and

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.320
then another Android.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.920
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is very true.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.260
I mean, that's starting to
become a common situation.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.690
Households will have Android
phones and iPads, or they'll

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.830
have a Nexus 7 and an iPhone.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.070
And being able to play your
game and continue progress

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.260
between those devices would
really be fantastic.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.040
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And if your game
also works on the web,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.610
you can also share that
state on the web.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.280
So that's pretty handy.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.950
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is very true.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.780
So with that in mind, we're
going to be demoing Samurai

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.960
vs. Zombies Defense 2-- this
is by Google Mobile--

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.780
partly because it's a pretty
good example of Cloud Save.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.650
And also because--

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.430
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And also
because it has

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.820
samurais and zombies.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.500
TODD KERPELMAN: And zombies.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.270
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Nothing at
all wrong with that.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.870
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.960
It's a pretty fun game.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.040
So with that, this is the game
right now running on--

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.205
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: So this
is a Galaxy Nexus.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:42.320
TODD KERPELMAN: My Galaxy
Nexus phone.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.840
And I would love to show you
more of the game, but we're

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.680
limited in time.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.250
So I'm just going to do
something real quick here.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.400
I'm going to start
the game up.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.610
And the game starts me
in a storefront.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.750
And so I think--

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.970
oop.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.130
Do I want to download
this game?

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.210
Eh, not right now.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.050
But thanks for asking.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.430
All right.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.810
So you'll notice I have
about 920 of these

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.180
little silver coins.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.010
I'm going to use them to
upgrade this hero here,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.490
Kunoichi, from level
one to level two.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.054
So, yes, let's upgrade
her health.

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.862
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:22.320
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.560
She's been upgraded.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.850
Now I'm going to go back
to the main menu.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.590
And the game does save to
the Cloud automatically.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.830
However, because we're in a demo
situation, I'm going to

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.820
manually force a save.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.510
So it's going to say, OK, I'm
going to save to the Cloud

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.560
next chance I have.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.195
And hopefully, it's doing
that right now.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:44.690
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.300
Now let's switch to our tablet
and see if that worked.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.340
TODD KERPELMAN: All right so
I'm on the Nexus 10 now.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.760
And I'm just going to force a
Cloud Load here by going into

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.510
the Cloud Load menu.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.810
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Notice that
normally this would happen

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.350
automatically.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.900
We're just forcing it so that
we can actually do this in a

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.380
demo time frame instead
of sitting around

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.550
waiting for it to upload.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.070
But normally the user would
not have to do this.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.290
So now we're loading
the game again.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.830
So remember that Todd upgraded
the character

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.150
on the Galaxy Nexus.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.670
So what we should see when the
game loads is that the

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.570
character is going
to be upgraded.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.464
So we should see a higher-level
character than we

00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:16.630
had before.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.050
TODD KERPELMAN: Should
see that.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.410
Fingers crossed.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.070
Let's see here.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.410
I'm going to start.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.710
And look at that!

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.570
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And
there we go.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.490
So it's the same level,
level three.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.720
You were level three
before, right?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.210
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, yeah.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.060
Or, I guess, level two.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.870
That option is to upgrade
to level three.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.370
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Oh, yeah.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.180
That's true.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.080
TODD KERPELMAN: Point being,
my progress is carried over

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.169
from one device to the next.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.429
And now I can keep playing on
the Nexus 10, which actually

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:39.530
has a much better framerate.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.580
So this is a better platform
to play on anyway.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.470
So I'm just going to take this
with me after the show.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.960
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Perfect.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
TODD KERPELMAN: So there we go.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.920
All right.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.760
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: So, conflict
management.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.830
So Cloud Save is pretty
convenient.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.890
It can save and it can load.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.120
But then imagine what happens
if two devices try to save

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.220
conflicting states at the
same time to the Cloud?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.970
So I'm playing here on my
tablet, and then I upgrade my

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.100
character to level two.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.580
And then on my phone, I upgrade
the same character to

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.570
level four without syncing
up the changes.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.020
What's going to happen
is what's called

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.940
a Cloud Save conflict.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.520
So you need to think about those
Cloud Save conflicts and

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.450
then handle them in a way that
makes sense for your app.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.890
So if you want to take a look,
that link over there is a link

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.120
to a white paper that we wrote
that talks about many

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.110
strategies to handle Cloud Save
conflicts, and how to

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.820
make that in a way that makes
sense, and that--

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.570
and this is especially
important-- in a way that

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.320
doesn't lose any progress
for the user.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.620
TODD KERPELMAN: Right.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:40.180
So it's a pretty in-depth
bit of reading.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.570
My takeaway, if you just want
some general advice, is when

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.350
you're trying to resolve to
Cloud Saves, resolve these two

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.980
states in isolation.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.430
Don't assume, based on the local
user's game state or

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.900
anything, you know more
than what you get from

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.960
the Cloud Save data.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.290
Just because it gets a little
tricky, but due to, sometimes,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.510
the way that we give you these
two states to resolve, they

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.510
might not be, actually, in the
time frame you expect.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:16.280
So, long story short, try and
resolve these two states as if

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.870
this is the only
date you have.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.500
And just try and forget about
the rest of the world when

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.390
you're doing that.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.940
And I suppose there's a
couple ways you can

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.830
look at this problem.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.560
One way is, if you want to be
clever, do it Bruno's way,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.560
which would be--

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.140
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: You can look at
the two states and see if

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.890
there's a clever way in which
you can merge them together,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.480
instead of just picking
one or the other.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.710
Sometimes it might just
make sense to

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.540
pick one or the other.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.445
But sometimes, if you notice
that they have discrepancies,

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:48.890
it might make sense to merge
them intelligently together.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.830
So this is what, for instance,
our sample, Collect All The

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.930
Stars, does.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.140
Which is, for instance, if you
unlock a few levels on one

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.230
device, and then unlock a
different set of levels on a

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.290
different device, then what it
does, is it actually combines

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.780
those two saves into one.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.520
It doesn't choose one.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.220
It doesn't choose the other.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.000
But it actually combines them
into a single save that has

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.950
all of those levels unlocked.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.830
TODD KERPELMAN: And if you think
about a lot of games--

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.040
Cut The Rope, Angry Birds,
Where's My Water, Where's My

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.950
Mickey, which is awesome--

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.930
if you think about the way those
games work, in general,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.990
you have stars on every level,
and you have high scores on

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.780
each level.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.880
And that can be pretty safely
unioned between two

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.520
conflicting sets of data.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.100
If you have two stars on level
1.4 on this device, and three

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.600
stars on level 1.4 on this other
device, that's something

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.150
you can very easily merge just
by saying, let's take the

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.700
greater number of stars.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.740
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Stars may be an
easy case, but be careful

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.980
about stuff like virtual
currency, because it can get

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.310
into hard-to-predict problems.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.020
So more details about that
in the white paper.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.320
TODD KERPELMAN: And then, of
course, if you don't want to

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.440
be clever, just ask the user.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.280
Say, hey, you know what,
we found these two

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.150
sets of Cloud data.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.850
This one looks like it was
saved on July 30 on this

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.130
device, and this one looks like
it was saved on August 1

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.700
at this time on this device.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.580
You're at level four with a
thief on this one, and you're

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.520
at level five with a paladin
on this device.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.470
Which one do you really want?

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.100
Ask the user.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.210
Bring up the dialogue.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.170
Chances are the user will know
which one they want.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.980
And go with what they pick.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.200
So if you want more information,
check the Docs.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.610
You probably knew we were
going to say that,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.090
but there's the link.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.260
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Becuase we
say that on every show.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.850
TODD KERPELMAN: We kind of do.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.680
But go to the Docs.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.280
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: We really
love our Docs.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.000
TODD KERPELMAN: We spend
a lot of time on them.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.550
You should read them.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.010
We have a link to Cloud Save
there on general concepts.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.490
You can read up more about it.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.150
Read Bruno's white paper.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.490
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And then, of
course, if you want some real

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.760
excitement, you can try our
sample app, which is Collect

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.460
All The Stars.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.010
TODD KERPELMAN: And we have
versions for Collect All The

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.600
Stars on Android,
iOS, and web.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.820
So you can see what it looks
like saving one state on one

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.940
device and another state on
another completely different

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.110
device, and watching your
progress carry over.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.830
It's pretty magical.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.210
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: And it's a
very challenging game.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.250
TODD KERPELMAN: It is.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.280
So yeah.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.360
That too.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.850
So I think that pretty much
wraps it up for episode three

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.280
of "Game On!" We'll be back
in a couple weeks

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.110
with episode four.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.390
We'll probably keep
the same title.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.143
So just start searching
for it.

00:13:19.143 --> 00:13:19.830
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.460
So thanks everybody, and
see you next time.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.710
TODD KERPELMAN: Thanks,
video audience.
