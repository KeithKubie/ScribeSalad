00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.720
Quantum computers promise to one day dominate
their classical counterparts like the computers

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.829
we use today.

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.000
But classical computers will not go gentle
into that good night.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.830
They’re fighting inevitable quantum supremacy,
and they’re using some tricks they’ve

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.990
picked up thanks to quantum computers.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.360
You’re probably familiar with how classical
computers work, information is broken up into

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.020
bits, which are represented by 1s and 0s.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
Quantum computers, on the other hand, could
leverage quantum phenomenon to make themselves

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.550
exponentially more powerful.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.070
We’ve got a whole video here that explains
the fundamentals.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.730
There are certain tasks that quantum computers
would ideally be suited to.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.480
Things like predicting how a molecule in a
pharmaceutical will interact with the human

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.480
body.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.510
This behavior depends on the observation of
a molecule’s electrons, which obey the laws

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.060
of quantum physics.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.540
If you were to simulate them using a computer
that also behaves according to quantum mechanics,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.410
you could get an answer much faster than if
you tried to make a classical computer figure

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.510
it out.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
Using a classical computer to simulate quantum
phenomenon is like using a spoon to tunnel

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.410
through a mountain.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.170
It’s not really the right tool for the job,
and even if it does work it’s going to take

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.170
forever.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.119
You’d also need an ungodly amount of spoons.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.409
But what classical computers lack in quantum-ness,
programmers can make up for with cleverness.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.479
With mathematical techniques, some problems
that look rooted in quantum processes could

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.290
be be “de-quantized” and simulated efficiently
with classical computers.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.539
It’s not really clear why some algorithms
are easy to rearrange and simulate classically

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.999
while others aren’t, though it appears that
the less entanglement is part of the problem,

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.889
the more likely it is that computer scientists
can manipulate it and run it efficiently on

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.560
a classical computer.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.729
Sometimes though research into quantum computing
can lead to breakthroughs for their classical

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.729
counterparts.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.889
In fact one problem that was thought uniquely
suited to quantum computers was recently shown

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.680
to be solvable with classical computers as
well.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.780
The problem was known as the recommendation
system problem, and you are intimately familiar

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.780
with it.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860
If you watch a lot of videos on YouTube, YouTube
wants to figure out what you and people with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.029
similar tastes will want to watch next.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:03.020
You may have noticed YouTube is terrible at
this.Seriously I watched one makeup tutorial

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.090
just to see what all the fuss was about, and
now all I’m seeing is Jeffree Star in my

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.090
feed.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.090
Not that I’m complaining.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.720
Classical algorithms just aren’t good at
taking all the data about what videos that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.890
viewers like have in common and quickly suggesting
other similar videos.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.950
That is, until June of 2018.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.379
A student at UT Austin demonstrated that a
classical algorithm could compete with a quantum

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.230
one, and serve you better video recommendations.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.670
He created a fast classical algorithm.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.879
To go back to that YouTube example, you can
think of the data arranged in a giant grid,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.989
where videos are listed along one axis, and
users listed down the side.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.200
The promise of a quantum algorithm is that
it can recognize preference patterns and generate

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.560
recommendations to fill in the blanks in the
matrix faster than a classic algorithm.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.400
But the UT student found a way to tackle the
recommendation problem with a classical algorithm

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.250
that ran in polylogarithmic time, an exponential
speed up!

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.469
Essentially he drew inspiration from a quantum
algorithm to design a classic one, and it

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.469
worked.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.659
It still has to pass peer review so don’t
expect your recommendations to get better

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.109
any time soon.

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.299
But the irony is he was originally tasked
with proving that the quantum solution was

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.549
definitely superior.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.359
He tried to show that no classical solution
could keep up, but found one that did and

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.909
ended up advancing classical computing instead.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.239
Quantum computers still have a long way to
go before they can claim quantum supremacy.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.799
Scientists will have to figure out how to
make unstable qubits last longer to reduce

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.829
the noise and error rates of the machines
of today.

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.900
We’ll also have to get better at controlling
qubits and designing the quantum architecture

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.920
of the chip.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.909
Even so, unless we develop room temperature
superconductors, quantum computers are going

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.939
to have to be kept in ultra cold environments
to function.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.969
That means that classical computers aren’t
going anywhere anytime soon, but they may

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.750
get better thanks to competition from their
quantum rivals.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.989
In the quantum realm, I can exist with AND
without a beard.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.019
I know this is confusing.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.989
