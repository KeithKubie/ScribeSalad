00:00:01.957 --> 00:00:03.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd
like to introduce to you

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.230
today our speaker
today, Chester Santos.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.290
Chester is the winner of
2008 USA National Memory

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.360
Championship.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.400
He's been giving memory
workshops in the Bay Area,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.480
and I attended one of them.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.940
I used to think that
memorizing things is so boring

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.180
and it might even
stifle my creativity.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.380
However, after
attending the workshop,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.490
I realized that it would
actually improve my creativity

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.220
because it uses both
my left brain and right

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.550
brain, plus more.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.230
And I'll let Chester
explain to you some more.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.740
Please welcome Chester Santos.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.517
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:48.600
CHESTER SANTOS: Thank you.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.700
Thank you for the
introduction, [? Petula ?].

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.720
Thanks, everyone, for
have me here today.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.110
I like to start all
of my presentations

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.530
out with a couple of
quick demonstrations.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.550
I tried to meet people
as they walked in,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.820
although it was harder
because a lot of people

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.280
just flooded in right after
12-- more difficult than I'm

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.060
used to.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.270
If you remember meeting
me, if I shook your hand,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.450
gave you my name and
you gave me your name,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.620
if you remember that
happening, please stand up.

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:31.500
OK, this might be tough,
might be a little tough.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.320
We'll see how I do.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.440
If I manage to give your
name correctly from memory,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.040
please have a seat.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:51.550
So Jared, Antonio, Kay, Alex,
Jeanie, Shao, Hendrick, Erin.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.870
OK, so far so good.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.529
Tiffany.

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:58.820
AUDIENCE: No, I'm just kidding.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.690
CHESTER SANTOS: OK.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.830
You did scare me.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.330
Nick.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.530
CHESTER SANTOS: Oh,
cover your name.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.780
Cover your name tag.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.514
Cover your badge.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:25.290
Charles, Laura, Philippe, Tracy,
Surgen, Alex, Evon, Preveen,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:46.622
Kevin, Ben, Triv, Alex, Grant,
Zen, Jade, Andre, Evan--

00:02:46.622 --> 00:02:47.330
AUDIENCE: Evonne.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.810
CHESTER SANTOS: Sorry, Evonne.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.080
I memorized it as Evan.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.820
Sorry, my bad.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.320
Evonne.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.290
Beta, Olea.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.515
Correct?

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:00.015
Thank you.

00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:02.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:07.460
CHESTER SANTOS: Thank you.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.750
So really, that's just
come with training.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.440
I will do one more
demonstration here with numbers.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.660
So Antonio, can you give
me a single digit from zero

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.394
through nine?

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:24.060
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.060
CHESTER SANTOS: Seven.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.560
OK.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.451
So hopefully everyone
can see that.

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:33.950
It has to be on
this side, because I

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.520
think the live stream is
only picking up this area.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.950
That's why I put it over here.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.087
OK, so a single digit
from zero through nine?

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:40.670
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.503
CHESTER SANTOS: Two.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.565
A single digit from
zero through nine.

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:49.190
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.065
CHESTER SANTOS: Four.

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:55.960

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.630
Where we at?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.430
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.263
CHESTER SANTOS: Two.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.360
Is this a lot of numbers?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.605
You want to do some-- I
guess we can do-- Go ahead.

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:51.230
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.317
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:56.150
CHESTER SANTOS: Two.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.220
Is this a lot of
numbers, or does it

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.950
look like a lot of numbers?

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.928
OK.

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:07.428
Thank you.

00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.392
Let's see if I remember that.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.340
All right.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.120
Let me know if I
make any mistakes.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.200
Let me know if I make
any mistakes here.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:20.310
I think it's going to be 7, 2,
4, 0, 9, 3, 4, 6, 1, 1, 7, 3,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:40.370
8, 2, 6, 5, 9, 8, 5, 4, 8, 5,
5, 7, 6, 1, 3, and 2, 0, 3.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.193
Was I right?

00:08:41.193 --> 00:08:41.776
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:46.249
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:48.790
CHESTER SANTOS: Let me attempt
to repeat that number sequence

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.140
backwards.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.760
Let's see if I can do it.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.810
So this would be going from
right to left, bottom to top.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.090
Backwards, that number
sequence I believe

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:23.890
is 3, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7, 5, 5,
8, 4, 5, 8, 9, 5, 6, 2, 8, 3, 7,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:34.245
1, 1, 6, 4, 3, 9, 0, and then
it was 4, 2, 7 backwards.

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:34.745
Right?

00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:35.590
Was I right?

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.300
Just a couple of
quick demonstrations

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.820
there to show you it's
possible with just a little bit

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.220
of memory training.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.140
So in winning the United States
National Memory Championship,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.830
I actually memorized
the exact order

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.330
of a shuffled deck
of playing cards,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.350
all 52 cards in order in
less than two minutes.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.320
I memorized a 132-digit
sequence of computer generated

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.030
random digits,
forwards and backwards

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.120
in about five minutes.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.500
I represented the United
States in the World Memory

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.750
Championship where I memorized
a 1,000-digit sequence and 10

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.960
separate shuffle decks of
playing cards in one hour.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.020
I actually starred in an
episode of PBS's "NOVA Science."

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.960
That particular
episode was entitled,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.950
"How Smart Can We Get?"

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.000
And during that
episode, I actually

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.120
demonstrated on a stage
in New York City-- in 2012

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.600
is when I did it--
I demonstrated

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.830
perfect recall of the entire
United States Congress,

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.230
both the House and the
Senate, everyone's first name,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.190
last name, state, district
number, political party,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.030
all congressional committees
on which they serve,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.280
special positions held
within those committees,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.830
and held within
Congress in general.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.800
It was more than
4,000 pieces of data

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.290
that I had to have random access
to in my head like a computer.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.090
I realize that those
all seem like it

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.200
extraordinary feats of memory.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.370
But in fact, it's all
just come with training.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.570
Training with techniques that
make the most efficient use

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.340
of the brain to encode
information so that

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.600
makes it much easier to
retrieve that information

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.200
when you need it later on.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.910
Really, everyone sitting
in this room today

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.750
is capable of doing absolutely
extraordinary things

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.470
with your memory.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.290
You just need to learn
the right techniques

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.590
and practice a little bit.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.150
My presentation will
we interactive today.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.120
I will have you go through
some exercises that

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.490
may seem a bit silly or
unusual at certain points,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.990
but just bear with me,
because I promise you

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.360
that what I ask
you to do is going

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.530
to help you with your memory.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.620
It's going to make
it much easier

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.200
for you to remember things.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.530
So everyone, please close
your eyes at this point.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.650
We will start with a warm up
visualization exercise here.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.020
You're simply going
to do your best

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.540
to visualize what
I describe to you.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.620
Just do your best to
see what I describe

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.740
to you happening in your mind.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.890
I want for you to
picture yourself

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.120
in your current residence,
wherever you're currently

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.730
living.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.270
You are in the living room
area of your residence.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.060
And you see there
standing behind podiums,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.920
looking as if they are
about to engage in a debate,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.930
you see Barack Obama
and Mitt Romney.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.840
You thought the debates
were long over in 2012,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.590
but another one's
actually about to happen

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.260
in the middle of
your living room.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.890
And although this strikes
you as pretty unusual,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.960
rather than ask
any questions, you

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.035
decide to simply hang back
and observe what's going on.

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:49.360
So they begin to debate
there-- just watch this unfold.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.510
You see that the
debate is becoming

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.430
more and more heated
between the two politicians,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.840
and at one point, you can
see Romney become very upset.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.860
He's visibly upset at
something that Obama says,

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:07.410
so he reaches behind his
podium to pull out a pie.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.900
He takes this pie and
he throws it at Obama

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.340
and it hits Obama
square in the face.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.630
Obama has pie splattered
all over his face.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.510
Obama is not happy
about this at all.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.650
So he reaches behind his
podium now, believe it or not,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.840
to also pull out a pie.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.643
He takes it, he
throws it at Romney

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:33.420
and it hits Romney
square in the face.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.760
What started it out as a
debate has, at this point,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.600
turned into a
full-blown pie fight.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.860
And the politicians
are continuously

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.180
throwing pies at each other.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.695
Pie is flying everywhere.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.135
Just see this in your mind
to the best of your ability.

00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:55.010
The imagery doesn't need
to be crystal clear,

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.690
but just see it as best you can.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.700
You are, at this point,
primarily experiencing

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.690
visual images.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.640
You're seeing imagery
running through your mind.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.860
What I'd like you
to do now is attempt

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.570
to involve even more senses.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.600
As you experience this scenario
happening in your mind,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.370
imagine that you cannot
only see it happening,

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.420
imagine that you can hear
it happening as well.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.220
Imagine that you can hear that
pie flying through the air.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.963
You can hear the pie as it
splatters on the politicians.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.060
Imagine now that you can
eat even smell the pie.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.970
Just do your best to imagine
what that pie might smell like.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.910
Take it a step further now.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.230
Imagine that you walk up
to one of the politicians

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.080
and you actually take some
of the pie off of their face.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.700
You feel in your hands--
maybe it feels sort of sticky.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.600
Go ahead now and even put
some of that pie in your mouth

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.850
and taste the pie.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:15.200
Hopefully, you are tasting some
pie there that's pretty good.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.550
Although, some people tell
me it tastes like politician

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.315
at this point.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.550
OK, go ahead and open
up your eyes everyone.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.130
Pretty easy, right?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.790
Pretty easy exercise
to complete.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.330
Some people find that
to be a fun exercise.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.500
But what does it have to do
with improving your memory?

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.800
In fact, it has a
lot to do with it.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.780
If you were able to complete
that simple exercise,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.020
and I'm sure you all
were, then you actually

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.090
have the ability to
remember anything

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.230
at all that you would ever want
to remember, quickly, easily,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.380
and with tremendous accuracy.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.800
Here are some reasons why.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.190
Reason number one.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.400
I had you there exercise
your visualization ability.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.080
And your visual memory
is incredibly powerful.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.090
An example that I often cite in
my speeches and presentations

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.220
that I now give
all over the world

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.410
is a situation that
we've all experienced

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.820
at some point in our life,
where you may see someone

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.220
that you could
have met years ago.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.360
You could have met
them years in the past.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.610
Oftentimes, as soon as you
see that person's face,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.270
you remember their
face, you know

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.080
that you've met them
somewhere before,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.560
but no matter how
hard you try, you

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.940
can't seem to remember the name.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.060
That is a very
common experience.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.460
Something else that
happens to us pretty often.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.492
Let's say you go to
a party, and you're

00:16:43.492 --> 00:16:45.950
at the party with one of your
friends-- one of your friends

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.040
accompanies you to the party,
and your both there meeting

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.760
a lot of new people
while mingling.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.710
Two weeks after the party, your
friend that attended with you

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.540
is describing someone to you
that you both met at the party.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.500
Your friend says, you know,
that attorney that we met.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.200
He's also a member
of the tennis club.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.960
Given that little bit of
description, a lot of times you

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.660
both can easily
pull up a picture

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.000
in your mind of that guy's face.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.410
But a lot of times,
neither one of you

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.990
can remember what the name was.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.440
That is also a very
common experience.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.680
Why do those two things
that I just described,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.800
why do they happen
to us so often?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.750
It's because when we
are meeting people,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.900
we actually see their
face with our eyes, right.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.470
The face is recorded
into our visual memory,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.300
but at no point are
we seeing the name.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.440
That's why it's much more
difficult to remember names.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.992
Toward the end of
my presentation

00:17:46.992 --> 00:17:48.700
today, I'm going to
talk to you about how

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.160
you can picture names, how
you can see them in your mind

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.360
so that you're better
able to remember them.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.610
That's how a lot of times
I will open presentations

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.410
with naming hundreds of
people in an audience

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.570
after hearing each
name one time.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.230
It's because I'm
picturing the names

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.252
and seeing them in my mind.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.210
Again, I'll talk about
that later, but for now,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.320
note the power of
your visual memory.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.720
If you can see it,
you can remember it.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.290
Second thing to take away
from the exercise with Romney

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.970
and Obama is that I had you
involve additional senses

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.930
from there.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.670
As you involve more and more
senses in the encoding process

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.540
when trying to commit
information to memory,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.910
you're actually activating more
and more areas of your brain.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.440
And your building more and
more connections in your mind

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.750
to the information so it makes
it much easier to retrieve it

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.470
when you need it later on.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.310
When I starred in that
episode of "NOVA Science,"

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.620
I performed some pretty
crazy feats of memory,

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.380
and then I trained the host
of the show, David Pogue who

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.480
is also a "New York Times"
tech columnist and "CBS News"

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.980
correspondent.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.990
You guys have probably
all heard of David Pogue,

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.280
I would imagine, in
the tech industry.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.530
I trained him in ways
to improve his memory,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.340
and he was soon performing
extraordinary feats of memory

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.930
as well.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.860
Afterwards, a neuroscientist
appeared on the show,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.590
and they talked about how it
was I was able to pull off

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.620
those feats of memory, and how
David Pogue was able to do it

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.571
with just a little
bit of training.

00:19:16.571 --> 00:19:18.820
And they confirmed that it's
because with these memory

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.340
techniques that I've
mastered over the years,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.420
and that you'll learn a
little bit about today,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.300
we are actually recruiting
extra areas of our brain

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.450
to help us with our memory.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.190
Areas of the brain that are not
normally involved with memory.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.960
We are recruiting
those extra areas

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.200
to help us so it makes it much
easier to remember anything

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.580
that you would want to remember.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.720
And part of this is learning
to utilize more senses

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.200
during the encoding
process to activate

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.980
these extra areas of your brain.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.750
Third and final
thing to take away

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.170
from the exercise
with Romney and Obama

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.990
is that I had you imagine
something happening that

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.660
is strange, unusual,
out of the ordinary.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.584
You would not expect
to see that happening

00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:05.000
in the middle of
your living room.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.670
And I had you do
that because I want

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.400
you to learn to take advantage
of the psychological aspect

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.320
to your memory.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.980
And that is, we tend to
remember things with little

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.580
to no effort, things that happen
that catch us by surprise, that

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:23.430
are strange, unusual,
extraordinary in some way.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.260
If this were to actually happen
right now at this moment,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.920
if an elephant were to come
crashing through the back door

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.160
there right now, through
that doorway, that

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.630
came crashing into this room,
and it started spraying water

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.090
all over everyone in
here with its trunk,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.000
you might remember that
for the rest of your life

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.080
and always tell that story.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.100
And you wouldn't
have to do anything

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.210
to commit that to memory.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.760
It would just be stuck there.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.020
Scientists don't
even fully understand

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.850
how this works in the brain.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.770
How some things
will just instantly

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.920
transfer into your
long-term memory.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.120
However, we do
understand that there

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.770
is this aspect to our
memory and that our minds do

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.360
work in this way.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.320
And we can actually
take advantage of that

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.880
and apply it to things
that would be useful

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.010
for us to remember.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.750
Things that would help us
out in school, in our career,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.610
in our personal life.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.910
When you combine those three
principles-- visualization,

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.240
utilizing additional
senses from there,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.820
and then you also use your
creativity and your imagination

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.940
to make what you are
seeing and experiencing

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.330
crazy, unusual, extraordinary,
when you combine those three

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.525
principles, it becomes very
easy to remember anything

00:21:37.525 --> 00:21:41.030
at all that you would
ever want to remember.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.810
We are now going to
put this into practice.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.000
Without writing anything down,
without writing this down,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.350
you were all going to commit
to memory the following

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.920
random list of words.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:02.820
The word list is monkey, iron,
rope, tight, house, paper,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:10.800
shoe, worm, envelope, pencil,
river, rock, tree, cheese,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.840
and quarter.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.570
That's the random list of words.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.420
Grant, did you want to
give it a try there?

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.610
Was that look of confidence
you were giving me?

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.770
Actually, I was just kidding.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.810
I wouldn't expect you to have
that committed to memory yet.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.960
Oftentimes, when I recite
that list of words,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.660
I get looks from
people in the audience,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.620
people are looking at me as if,
come on, man, are you serious?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.194
Like there's no way I'm going
to be able to remember that,

00:22:34.194 --> 00:22:36.110
not unless you give me
a lot of time to do it.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.410
But in fact, you are all
going to have that entire list

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.930
of words committed to memory,
forwards and backwards, in just

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.420
three to four minutes.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.740
And even next week, without
any further review, even

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.440
next week, you will still know
it forwards and backwards.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.250
How you are going to
do this is once again

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.030
you will simply listen to
what I describe to you,

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.080
and you will see and experience
it happening in your mind,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.070
just as you did with the opening
exercise with the politicians.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.620
If you come at this
more as a fun exercise

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.920
in using your creativity
and your imagination,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.647
rather than coming at this as
a difficult memory exercise,

00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:18.230
then the remembering
is actually going

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.970
to come very easily
and very naturally.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.020
So just have fun with this, OK?

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.470
The first word was monkey.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.510
So I want for you all to see
a monkey in your mind, OK?

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.400
This monkey is dancing around.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.060
It's making monkey noises.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.570
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.150
Whatever a monkey
would sound like.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.780
I'm working on the
monkey impression.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.603
One day it'll be decent.

00:23:40.603 --> 00:23:44.150
But for now, the point here
is to see and experience

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.840
this monkey.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.230
The monkey now picks
up a giant iron,

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.060
because that was
the second word.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.800
So I want for you to see
this monkey dancing around

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.330
with the iron.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.830
And the iron starts
to fall, but a rope

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.700
attaches itself to the iron.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.400
And maybe you feel the rope.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.730
Maybe it feels sort of rough.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.230
You look up the rope and you see
that the other end of the rope

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.580
is attached to a
kite, and the kite

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.780
is flying around in the air.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.110
It's flying around in the air.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.310
Maybe you reach up to
try and touch that kite,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.690
but it's just out of your reach.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.850
Kite was the next word.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.870
This kite you see now crashes
in to the side of a house.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.680
Really see it smash into
the side of a house,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.170
because the next word was house.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.790
Picture that.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.180
This house is completely
covered in paper.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.675
It's completely
covered in paper.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.630
A shoe appears out
of nowhere now,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.616
and it's starts to walk
all over that paper.

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:00.240
Maybe it's messing
up the paper as it's

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.820
walking on it, that shoe.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.820
This shoe smells
pretty badly, so you

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.550
decide to investigate
and see why.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.080
You look inside of
the shoe and you

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.010
see a little worm crawling
around inside of that shoe.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.095
Really see that worm.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:25.340
The worm jumps out of the
shoe and into an envelope.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.825
Really see it go
into the envelope.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.980
A pencil appears
out of nowhere now,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.700
and it starts to write
all over the envelope.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.650
See that pencil frantically
writing all over the envelope,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.590
pencil.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.800
The pencil now
jumps into a river,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.250
and there's a huge splash
for some reason when

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.790
that little pencil
hits the river.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.090
The river, you notice, is
crashing up against a rock.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.710
It's crashing up against a rock.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.130
The rock flies out of the
river and into a tree.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.095
Really see it smash
into the tree.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.760
And this tree, for some strange
reason, is growing cheese.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.880
Bet you've never
seen that before.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.780
The tree is growing cheese.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.980
And out of each piece of
cheese shoots a quarter.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.490
A quarter shoots out of
each piece of cheese.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.210
The last word was quarter.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.740
I am going to go through
this again, but very quickly

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.250
this time.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.880
And your job is to simply
replay through this story

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.230
that you've created
in your mind.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:51.130
So we had the monkey was
dancing around within an iron.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.390
The rope attached itself.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.700
The other end of the rope
was attached to that kite.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.360
The kite crashed into the house.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.090
The house was covered in paper.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.340
The shoe walked
all over the paper.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.020
Inside of the shoe was the worm.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.980
The worm jumped
into the envelope.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.760
The pencil wrote
on the envelope.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.110
The pencil jumped
into the river.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.900
The river was crashing
into the rock.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.430
The rock flew into the tree.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.840
The tree was growing cheese.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.020
And out of each piece of
cheese shot a quarter.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.110
So you should be able
now to recite to me

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.500
that entire random list
of words by simply going

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.390
through the story in
your mind and recalling

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.680
each major object
that you encounter.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.570
We're going to do
this as a group.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.020
I want for you all to yell
out these random words,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.070
yell them out loud,
on my cue, starting

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.600
with the first word
which was monkey.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:57.380
AUDIENCE: Monkey, iron, rope,
kite, house, paper, shoe, worm,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:04.079
envelope, pencil, river,
rock, tree, cheese, quarter.

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.620
CHESTER SANTOS:
Great job, excellent.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.710
Give yourselves a
round of applause.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.126
Give yourself a
round of applause.

00:28:08.126 --> 00:28:10.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.250
Nice job there.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.260
A volunteer from the audience
to stand up and recite those

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.170
to me, all of them.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.500
Antonio, go ahead.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.460
AUDIENCE: Monkey, iron, rope,
kite, house, paper, shoe, worm,

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.334
envelope, paper, river,
rock, tree, cheese, quarter.

00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:28.750
CHESTER SANTOS:
So after envelope,

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.610
what's after envelope?

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.720
AUDIENCE: Pencil.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.130
CHESTER SANTOS: You got it.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:33.630
Good job.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.236
Great job.

00:28:34.236 --> 00:28:34.736
Great job.

00:28:34.736 --> 00:28:35.670
Great job.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.170
Excellent.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.740
Great job.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.910
Somebody wants to
recite-- somebody's

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.420
anxious to recite
these backwards I know.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.150
Erin, go ahead.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.062
AUDIENCE: I'll try.

00:28:45.062 --> 00:28:54.626
Quarter, cheese, tree, rock,
river, pencil, envelope, worm,

00:28:54.626 --> 00:29:00.587
shoe, paper, house,
kite, rope, iron, monkey.

00:29:00.587 --> 00:29:01.670
CHESTER SANTOS: Great job.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.711
Give a round of applause.

00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:05.020
Nice job.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.700
Nice job.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.340
Great job.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.290
So that technique that
you've learned there

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.130
is called the story method.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.020
It is a very powerful way
to go about committing

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.070
to memory random
pieces of information.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:23.160
It's just one of many tools that
memory champions use in order

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.760
to perform extraordinary
feats of memory.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.970
Again, it's just about
using the right technique

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.320
and practicing a little
bit with those techniques.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.530
That's how we're able to pull
off these extraordinary memory

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:36.030
feats.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.170
If you practice with the story
method and similar techniques,

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.840
over time you will
notice many benefits.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.970
Benefit number one, your memory
is going to improve over time.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.770
But this is only assuming that
after this presentation today,

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.590
you go out there
and you start to use

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.520
these types of techniques
to force yourself

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.490
to commit more and more things
to memory and recall them.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.360
If you do that,
your memory is going

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.810
to get better because the
brain is very trainable.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.470
Our brains are very trainable.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.570
The more you force your brain
to perform a particular function

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.830
over and over again, the
more it signals to your brain

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.590
that that's something important
for you to be able to do,

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.300
so it will make itself
better at doing it.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.360
The opposite,
however, is also true.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.614
If you never have your brain
perform a particular function,

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:26.280
you're basically
signaling to your brain

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.238
that that's something
not too important for you

00:30:28.238 --> 00:30:30.230
to be able to do,
so it makes sense

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.520
that you will start to lose
that ability over time.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.360
We are all born with
extraordinary memory ability.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.480
We are born with our
brains like sponges.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.880
We need this ability to
quickly acquire and learn

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.590
new information in order
to be able to survive.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.230
We reinforce throughout
all of our early years

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.150
that learning and memory
is important by engaging

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.570
in schooling, in preschool,
kindergarten, elementary

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.910
school, junior high,
high school, college,

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.240
grad school for some people.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.400
Throughout all of those
years you were constantly

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.160
challenged to learn
tons of information

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.820
from a wide variety of areas.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.910
You're constantly tested on
your recall of that information

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.550
for quizzes, exams,
to write papers.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.412
They say when you
first start a new job

00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:13.620
it's a lot of the same thing.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.050
You have to learn
a lot of new things

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.520
and recall them in order
to do your job properly.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.005
But then what happens is
we tend to enter this 20,

00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:23.770
30+ year period where,
for the most part,

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.830
you just start to do the same
things day in and day out.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.080
Everything just
becomes a routine.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.332
You are no longer nearly as
challenged to learn as much

00:31:32.332 --> 00:31:34.290
and recall as much as
you were earlier in life.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.770
The bottom line is we tend
to use our memory much less

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.340
later in life than we
do earlier in life.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.690
So this is a large part of
the reason why your memory

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.400
ability starts to
decline as you get older.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.840
It's because as your aging,
you are separating yourself

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.530
more and more from those early
years where you were constantly

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.320
using your memory.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.220
The good aspect to this,
the positive aspect

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.670
is that if you make it a
point to exercise your memory,

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.880
actually use it,
it can stay strong

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.410
and actually even get
better, really, at any age.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.280
Some people don't believe
me when I tell them this.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.720
They're stuck on this idea
that someone later in years

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.650
is going to have a memory worse
than someone earlier in years.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.410
They think that's
just the way it is.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.880
So I like to talk about when
I competed in the World Memory

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.840
Championship, so I represented
the United States in the World

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.780
Memory Championship in
the Middle East in 2008.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.090
I competed against
the guy-- when

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.090
I represented the US--
I competed against a guy

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.830
from Malaysia who, at the
time, was in his late 60s,

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.100
so more than 30
years older than me.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.469
And he absolutely destroyed
me in the World Memory

00:32:41.469 --> 00:32:42.010
Championship.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.840
I was nowhere close to that guy.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.640
He actually memorized
an entire dictionary.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.000
And they would call
out any page number

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.855
in the dictionary
and the row number,

00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:55.980
and within a few seconds
he could tell you the word

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.810
there and its definition.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.400
He can also do the reverse.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.435
If you said chair, he
would think about it

00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:03.810
for a few seconds,
say oh, chair.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.580
I think that's on
page 875, row three,

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.400
and he was right
every single time.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.640
His name is Dr. Yip Swee Chooi.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.940
He's known as the
walking dictionary.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.500
He's from Malaysia.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.590
But it just goes to
show that really you

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:23.260
can have a razor sharp memory
ability really at any age,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.390
even after retirement age, 65,
usually the age people retire.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.580
You can still have
awesome memory ability,

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.425
but he's always
working on his memory.

00:33:31.425 --> 00:33:33.680
He's constantly training it.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.090
That's why it stays very sharp.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.010
So memory ability.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.220
One benefit.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.180
You are also going to improve
your visualization ability

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.950
with this type of training.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.430
You will notice
that you are going

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.600
to be able to create
these images in your mind

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.450
much more quickly,
and you will be

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.770
able to see the imagery in
your mind much more clearly.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.370
Visualization ability
has been linked

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.790
to more than just memory.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.570
In fact, it's been linked
to overall intelligence.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:04.250
If you can visualize the complex
relationships between things,

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.576
it helps to give you a
better understanding.

00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:07.950
Visualization
ability's something

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.409
very important to develop.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.050
You will develop it with
this type of training.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.320
This is also great exercise
in creativity and imagination.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.360
Coming up with these creative
and imaginative stories.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.355
In addition, this is a very
good workout for your brain.

00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:25.900
And all of the
research is showing

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.570
that we should try to
exercise our brains as much as

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.350
possible throughout
our lifetimes.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.190
The research is
showing that if you

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.830
are destined to develop
Alzheimer's or another form

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.110
of dementia down the road,
with current research

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.969
they have no clue how to
prevent that from happening.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.860
But what they do believe is that
by engaging in rigorous brain

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.870
exercise, you can
build up what they're

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.159
calling a cognitive reserve.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.949
So that's the
terminology that you

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.356
would find in the research,
cognitive reserve.

00:34:53.356 --> 00:34:55.230
But basically, what this
means is building up

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.960
extra brain muscle.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.490
And if you do develop
Alzheimer's, another form

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.400
of dementia down the
road, the disease

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.000
will first have to eat away
at that extra brain muscle

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.080
before it starts to
affect your everyday life.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.455
So what they're
saying is you can

00:35:08.455 --> 00:35:10.210
gain more years
of mental clarity

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.690
that you would not have had
otherwise without this reserve.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:19.460
So that's another benefit
of this type of training.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.150
In terms of applications, in
just a very short presentation

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.010
like this, random words
is the easiest thing

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.790
to go with because it just gives
you an idea of how this all

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.700
works, and you get a
sense of how powerful

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.320
these techniques really are.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.520
But I want to impress upon
you the fact that really,

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.610
these memory techniques can be
applied to committing to memory

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.720
anything at all that you
would want to remember.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.480
You can easily give a speech
or a presentation from memory

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.070
without looking at notes.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.750
You can commit to memory
important business related

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.140
facts and figures.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.790
If you can meet with
clients or get up

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.860
in front of your colleagues
and give a presentation all

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.360
from memory, with everything
at your mental fingertips,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.440
you are much more
impressive and you

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.090
seem like much more of an
expert in your particular field,

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.085
as opposed to
someone that's just

00:36:06.085 --> 00:36:07.710
reading the PowerPoints
the whole time,

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.930
or just reading their
notes the whole time.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.390
In addition, the bottom
line is that we perceive

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:17.060
people with great memory ability
as being more intelligent.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.026
That's the perception.

00:36:19.026 --> 00:36:21.650
So you can help to give off that
perception with memory skills.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.270
So that's another benefit.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.670
You can build up a vocabulary in
a foreign language very quickly

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.610
and easily using these
types of memory techniques.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.300
Any type of exam that
involves a memorization

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.590
of a lot of terminology,
concepts, you

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.500
can easily ace
those types of exams

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.470
with these memory techniques.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.510
There are really
limitless applications,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.430
but I'm going to close
my presentation today

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.860
with my most popular topic
and that is remembering names

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.380
and faces, because this
is applicable, really,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.200
in any career.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.110
Definitely applicable to
everyone's personal life.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.290
I like to quote the
famous book, "How

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.910
To Win Friends and
Influence People."

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.180
In that book it was written
that the sweetest sound

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.550
to a person in any language is
the sound of their own name.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.540
And also, that everyone's
favorite subject is themself.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.500
So in fact, by remembering
people's names and other things

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.490
about them, you can
build better business

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.630
and personal relationships.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.150
The most important
thing of all to remember

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.160
is the person's name.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.220
It's about building a
rapport with someone.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.380
If you meet someone at an
event and the next time

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.670
you see him you can say
hey, John, how are you?

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.120
How is your wife Nancy?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.830
How was your last round of golf?

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.140
What that person
is feeling, even

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.690
if it may be on a
subconscious level, is it

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.190
they must be pretty
important to you

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.820
if you can remember their name
and those things about them.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.090
And that, in turn, makes them
want to get to know you better.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.450
OK, so this strengthens
relationships.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.400
The most important
thing is the name.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.480
The opposite is also true.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.310
If you're not remembering
people's names,

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.976
or maybe even worse,
you're calling them

00:37:52.976 --> 00:37:55.640
by the wrong name,
what they are feeling

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.090
is that they must not be
very important to you,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.550
and this can be very
detrimental to business

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.090
and personal relationships.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.620
So how do you get
better at doing this?

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.830
Four simple steps.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.640
First, independent of memory
techniques, and then I'll

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.170
get into a visual-based
memory technique after that.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.080
Step number one.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.140
From this day forward, get
into the habit, whenever

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.150
you are introduced to
someone, make it a point

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.860
to repeat the name right away
and shake the hand if you can.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.940
So if you're introduced
to someone named Jared,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.721
shake his hand.

00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:26.720
Nice to meet you, Jared.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.844
Pleased to meet you, Jared.

00:38:27.844 --> 00:38:29.080
Just get into that habit.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.967
That forces you to pay
attention for at least one

00:38:31.967 --> 00:38:34.550
to two seconds in order for you
to be able to repeat the name.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.761
A lot of times we're not
remembering people's names

00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:38.510
because when they're
giving us their name,

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.220
we're just not paying any
attention to begin with.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.620
So get into that habit.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.880
Repeat the name, shake the hand.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.530
Eventually it will just
become second nature to you.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.980
Step number two.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.700
Early on in your
interaction with the person,

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.260
ask them a question
using their name.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.880
So Jared, how long have
you been with Google?

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.800
Jared, how long have
you known Chester?

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.850
How do you know Chester, Jared?

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.539
Use the name early on in your
interaction with the person.

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:07.080
That's really going
to help that name

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.700
stick much better in
your mind and prevent it

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.350
from just going in one
ear and out the other ear.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.990
Step number three.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.220
Take a few seconds
or less to think

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.220
of a connection between the
name and anything at all

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.150
that you already know.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.360
And I would just go
with the first thing

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.401
that pops into your head.

00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:29.230
Today it was Jared from Subway.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.340
I don't-- that's the
first one, sorry.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.590
That's the first thing that
popped into my head today.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.890
AUDIENCE: I used to use the
jewelry store, but that's OK.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:36.681
CHESTER SANTOS: OK.

00:39:36.681 --> 00:39:39.140
Whatever, just think
of a connection

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.944
between the person's
name and anything at all

00:39:41.944 --> 00:39:42.860
that you already know.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.484
It could even actually
be that you just

00:39:44.484 --> 00:39:47.950
have a friend or family member
that also has that same name.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.150
It's really going to help you to
remember that name much better.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.330
Step number four.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.360
Whenever you leave the
party, the meeting,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.340
whatever type of
function it may be,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:02.932
make it a point to say goodbye
to people using their name.

00:40:02.932 --> 00:40:05.140
Great meeting, hope to see
you again sometime, Jared.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:05.973
Something like that.

00:40:05.973 --> 00:40:09.060
That's going to go a long way
towards helping you to remember

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.750
those names the next
time you see people.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:13.820
Those four steps alone
are going to help

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.080
you a lot in terms
of remembering names.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.250
If you combine them with
a visual-based technique

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.770
that I'll now briefly go
over, you will definitely

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.670
be remembering more names
than you ever have before.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.050
You might not be 100%.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.820
Even I'm not 100%.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.580
But if you can remember 80+% of
the people that you're meeting,

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.550
this is really going to pay
huge dividends in your career

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.980
and in your personal life.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.280
Visual-based technique.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.340
When you are introduced
to someone, ask yourself,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.130
how does this person
in some way, any way,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.580
look unique to you?

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.010
It could be a particular
facial feature

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.530
or it could be something
about their look overall.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.680
And you want to exaggerate
that in your mind, whatever

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.670
it may be.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.640
Next, you will use your
creativity and imagination

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.570
to come up with an image
that will in some way

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:05.160
remind you of the name, and you
will mentally link that image

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.990
to the unique thing
about the person.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.360
A lot of times these might
not be flattering things--

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.901
you're not going to
be telling people

00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:15.830
how you're remembering
their name, OK.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.260
This is all going on
inside of your head.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.490
They're not going to know
what you're thinking,

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:20.330
they're just going
to know that you're

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.760
able to call them by their
name and they will really

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.760
appreciate that fact.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.492
I will quickly give you an
example of how this works.

00:41:28.492 --> 00:41:30.450
I will give you the
example that I gave on CNN.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:33.040
So I was interviewed on
CNN's "American Morning,"

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.740
and asked to give
tips for their viewers

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.440
on how to better remember names.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.080
They seemed to find this
example pretty humorous.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.230
No offense to anyone
in here named John.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.730
I didn't meet anyone
named John yet,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.540
but-- So it obviously
doesn't apply to you

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.010
because I haven't even met you.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.980
But I said that if I
meet a particular John,

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.460
and this particular
John that I'm meeting,

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:57.840
has ears that to me look like
they're on the large side,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.590
I would exaggerate those as
being gigantic Dumbo-like ears,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.630
swinging from the
side of his head.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.060
And since the
name's John, I might

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.630
put a toilet bowl
flushing in each ear,

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.930
as in going to the john.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.320
The news anchors, they
couldn't stop laughing.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.830
And then actually, that clip
also made it on VH1's best week

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.210
ever afterward.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.620
If you take five seconds to
picture an image like that,

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.290
it's really going to stick
very well in your minds.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.350
The next time you see
the guy, instantly you're

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.040
going to know that
his name is John.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.150
I know it sounds
a little unusual,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:44.030
but it's very powerful, and
anyone can get very good

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.030
at doing this with just
a little bit of practice.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.580
[APPLAUSE]
