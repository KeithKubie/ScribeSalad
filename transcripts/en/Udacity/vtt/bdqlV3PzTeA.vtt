00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.600
If you have an algebraic expression
like three X plus two and

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.850
you are given a value for X.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.790
You can replace X with the value you
are given everywhere that you see X.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.900
After you substitute in the number
follow the order of operations to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.550
evaluate the expression.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500
Evaluate means to find a value for

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.376
an expression by substituting
a value n for your variable.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:33.330
Try evaluating 3x+2 using these values
of x, enter your answers in the boxes.
