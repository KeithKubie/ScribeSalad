00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:18.019
Since 1937, the Tomb of 
the Unknowns has famously never once been

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.449
left unattended with there always being at
least one guard present to keep vigil.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.050
The highly coveted position of Tomb Sentinel
is only meted out to truly exceptional soldiers,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.030
all of whom must prove their dedication and
mettle through a series of grueling and somewhat

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.340
unusual tests.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.760
For starters, to even be considered for the
position of Sentinel, a given soldier must

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
be a member of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment,
who are colloquially and rather aptly known

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.210
as the “Old Guard” due to being the oldest
currently serving unit in the US military,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.090
with the unit’s history stretching all the
way back to 1784.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.940
Because the Old Guard is tasked with the solemn
duty of handling some of the most sensitive

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.460
and delicate obligations the Army has to attend
to, such as welcoming foreign dignitaries

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.060
to the country and escorting the coffins of
fallen soldiers during military funerals,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.140
it invariably only recruits the best and brightest
soldiers it can find.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.741
Along with possessing a flawless record, any
soldier hoping to be recruited by the Old

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:21.610
Guard must be in excellent physical condition,
be in the top percentile of military aptitude

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.520
tests and possess a number of “intangible
traits” the military doesn’t bother to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.909
define in any source we could find.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.369
On top of this, soldiers must also have “proportionate
weight and build” to their height, limiting

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.310
the post to only the very finest physical
specimens the Army has to offer.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.810
This is because the members of the Old Guard
in many of their ceremonial duties are supposed

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.000
to represent the entire army to the outside
world.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.680
After becoming a member of the Old Guard,
a soldier can, if they so choose, apply to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.840
be a Tomb Sentinel via the Sergeant of the
Guard by simply knocking on the door to his

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.260
or her office and stating interest.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.159
While this is rather simple, to be considered
and score an interview, a soldier has to have

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.130
distinguished themselves from the rest of
the Old Guard with their dedication and conduct,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.830
as well as possess the aforementioned unmistakably
“soldierly appearance”, the exact meaning

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
of which isn’t abundantly clear.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.830
After this the soldier will then be given
a two week trial period where they will be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.830
given basic instruction on the history of
the Tomb and Arlington National Cemetery (both

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.830
of which are extremely interesting, see: Who
is Buried in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.830
and The Fascinating Origin of Arlington National
Cemetery).

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.870
They are also tutored in the expectations
placed upon Sentinels and their general duties

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.120
and given a crash course in how to maintain
their uniform (which is much harder than you

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.500
might think as we’ll get to in a moment).

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.410
At the end of the trial, the soldier will
be given a test on each one of these points

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.820
which they’re expected to pass with only
a 5% margin of error.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.110
If they fail any test, they will no longer
be considered for guard duty.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.760
Any soldier able to pass this trial period
will then be handed over to a seasoned Tomb

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.670
Sentinel for a year of additional training.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.690
Under the tutelage of the experienced Sentinel
the soldier is expected to, among other things,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.250
learn 17 pages of additional detailed history
about the Tomb and cemetery which they are

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.890
expected to recite back on command perfectly
and put in written form including all relevant

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.260
punctuation, with only a few mistakes allowed.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.090
Furthermore, trainee Tomb Guards aren’t
allowed to laugh or even smile while they’re

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.650
on duty (even in the guard house) and are
expected to hold themselves in the most respectful

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.360
manner possible at all times due to the close
proximity of said Tomb Guards’ quarters

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.810
to the Tomb itself.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.370
According to an interview Sentinel Andrew
Selga gave to the Washington Post, during

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.260
their training period, trainees are also told
that they’re not allowed to acknowledge

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.910
the existence of furniture while on duty,
even if that means walking straight through

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.910
a chair.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.700
This is of course used as a way to get trainees
used to ignoring pain of fatigue, as well

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.960
as outside influences, while remaining stoic
in most every situation.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.430
Then you have uniforms.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.560
The basic uniform of a Tomb Sentinel consists
of a heavy wool uniform that weighs in excess

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.430
of 10 pounds on its own, an M14 rifle outfitted
with a custom stock, heavy boots with metal

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.620
inserts to assist in making that signature
“click” sound everyone loves so much and

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.230
a host of smaller adornments like belts, holsters
and a pair of sunglasses to help shield a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.310
guard’s eyes from glare.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.090
It’s noted that trainee guards will sometimes
spend in excess of 10-12 hours per day just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.900
cleaning and preparing their uniform to get
it to the exacting standards of their superiors

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.940
who themselves will spend about 6-8 hours
cleaning and pressing their own uniforms,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.810
despite their extensive experience in the
task.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.280
As part of this preparation, the badges, buttons
and medals on the uniform must also be accurately

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.680
placed to within “1/64th of an inch”.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.400
The uniform standards for the Tomb Guard are
so legendarily strict that to pass the test

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.660
to become a fully fledged member of the unit,
trainees will be asked to present themselves

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.600
in uniform whereupon they are marked on 100
individual points by a superior.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.780
Prospective guards are allowed only two minor
infractions during this test (so must achieve

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.940
98% or greater).

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.150
In keeping with the ideal that the Tomb Guards
must always strive to be better, nobody has

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.230
ever been given a perfect score.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.300
For the most part, the uniform of Tomb guards
remains pretty much unchanged throughout the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.210
year, with the only real changes occurring
in winter, when the guards are permitted to

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.780
wear seasonal appropriate hats and gloves
if they so choose.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.400
For anyone curious about what would happen
in the very likely event a guard turned up

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.821
for his or her shift and felt that it was
too cold or hot for the uniform, according

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:26.860
to the aforementioned Sentinel Andrew Selga
they’d simply be told to “suck it up”.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.730
Not that many guards would complain; in fact,
most guards with this duty consider it an

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.960
honor to be tasked with guarding the tomb
during the most extreme bouts of weather,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.120
which probably explains why the tomb has remained
under guard during extreme heat, snow, hail,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.530
rain and the occasional hurricane.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.460
In the most extreme weather, such as during
the relatively recent Hurricane Sandy, they

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.750
are allowed to stand watch in a small enclosure
known as “the box”, made of cloth with

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.800
an open front, but for no more than two hour
intervals before resuming their march.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.120
In that particular storm, one Sgt. Shane Vincent
volunteered to take an entire 24 hour shift,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.990
though occasionally his fellow guards joined
him for support.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.020
If and only if a trainee is considered ready,
they will be given the honor of conducting

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.270
a “walk”, which basically entails what
a fully fledged guard would do, only it is

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.190
conducted at night, away from the prying eyes
of the public and under strict supervision.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.690
In accordance with tradition, a walk consists
of the following:

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.250
While on duty the sentinel crosses a 63-foot
rubber surfaced walkway in exactly 21 steps.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.490
He then faces the Tomb for 21 seconds, turns
again, and pauses an additional 21 seconds

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.440
before retracing his steps.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.560
The cadence of the march and placement of
feet is strictly graded and the number 21

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.250
is of paramount important to a successful
walk as it is symbolic of a “21 gun salute”.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.610
(See: Why Do They Use 21 Guns in the 21 Gun
Salute?)

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.510
After a walk duty is completed, the guard
will then be relieved of his or her position

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.680
with an elaborate changing of the guard ceremony,
which occurs every one hour in the winter

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.480
and every half hour in the summer and proceeds
as follows:

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.210
a relief commander salutes the tomb and announces
the change.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.370
‘Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention
please.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.200
I am (name and rank) of the 3rd Infantry Regiment,
United States Army, commander of the relief,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.480
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.570
The ceremony you are about to witness, is
the Changing of the Guard.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.419
In keeping with the dignity of this ceremony,
it is requested that everyone remain silent,

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:23.419
and standing.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:24.419
Thank you.’

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.139
He inspects the oncoming Soldier and his weapon
(depending on whether he wears cold-weather

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.060
gloves, which prohibit a complete weapon inspection),
then he and the new Soldier meet the retiring

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.630
sentinel in front of the tomb and all three
salute the unknowns.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.790
‘Pass on your orders,’ the relief commander,
who is the only Soldier entitled to wear rank

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:46.150
insignia, directs the relieved sentinel, according
to the tomb’s standard operating procedures.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.680
The relieved sentinel then tells his replacement:
‘Post and orders remain as directed.’

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.220
‘Orders acknowledged,’ the new sentinel
replies before beginning his patrol.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.590
This ceremony is mostly for show, and only
really occurs during the cemetery’s open

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.590
hours.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.420
However, just because there’s nobody around
at night when the cemetery is closed doesn’t

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.780
mean the theatrics stop.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.960
Long after the gates to Arlington close, even
in the wee hours of the morning, guards and

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.080
sentinels never stop watching over the tomb
and continue their walking along that 63 feet

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.630
of rubber with incredible precision.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.430
In accordance with tradition, nobody who guards
the tomb wears anything that would denote

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.430
rank, so that nobody outranks the unknowns.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.100
However, after a year of constant drills and
training and if they’re able to pass a series

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.270
of tests that demand nothing short of perfection,
a trainee will be promoted to tomb guard and

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.710
given a Tomb Guard Identification Badge.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.529
After receiving this badge, if they have served
in this capacity for nine months without being

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.270
removed from the post for some infraction,
they are allowed to wear it for the rest of

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.260
their military career and officially gain
the title of “Sentinel” rather than just

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.330
“Guard”; although if they ever stop achieving
the rigorous standards set for one of these

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.620
guards, they may be removed from this duty.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.890
The testing in this way never stops, nor does
their training both for this ceremonial duty

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.180
and keeping up with actual combat and tactical
training, which generally takes place in their

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.690
off time; you see, the Old Guard isn’t just
in charge of these ceremonial posts, but also

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:14.570
charged with protecting Washington D.C. and
being the official escort to the President.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.900
Though Sentinels and guards are almost entirely
silent during walks, they are permitted to

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.820
momentarily abstain from their duties to confront
members of the public they believe are acting

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.570
in a disrespectful manner or anyone who attempts
to approach the tomb.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.290
However, as one guard noted, people dropping
water bottles or the like that roll towards

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.120
the tomb (with the person often scrambling
to grab it and return behind the line) is

00:09:35.120 --> 00:10:05.600
a regular occurrence and if seemingly accidental
the guard is likely to ignore it.
