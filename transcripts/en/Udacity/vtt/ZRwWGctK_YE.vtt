00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's see. Again, we have our right triangle, which we love so much.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have an adjacent side to our angle and a hypotenuse.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Adjacent and hypotenuse SOH-CAH-TOA--CAH. Cosine and adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay, the cosine of that angle α is equal to the adjacent side, 400,000,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
over this L. Okay. Well, let's solve for L.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We find that L = 400,000 divided by the cosine α, which we said was 89.853 degrees.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This gives an answer of about 156,000,000 km.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Boy, that's a lot of zeros.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Take a second to pat yourself on the back.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can now calculate astronomical sizes and distances--the sun, the earth, the moon,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the distance from the earth to the sun and the earth to the moon.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
These are all things that you now know how to calculate. That's very impressive.
