00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.700
 With hurricanes and the refugee crisis 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.120
 And the real possibility of nuclear war. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.340
 Sometimes we may feel like the end is close. But what are the biggest risks 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.400
 Facing humanity, is there anything we can do to stop it? 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
 Experts from around the world are studying at the Global Challenges Foundation 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.895
 In Stockholm and the Center for the Study of Existential Risk 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.040
 At the University of Cambridge this question annually 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.895
 Using scientific research. Some risks lie 

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:25.865
 Millions of years in the future, like a gamma-ray burst 

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.455
 Caused by a star explosion would destroy 

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.435
 Ozone layer or even expansion or 

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:34.295
 The collapse of the whole universe. Represent our sun 

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.035
 Another danger is closer to us and it will become a red giant over time 

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.175
 To swallow the entire planet 

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:43.375
 But this will not happen for another 5 billion years. 

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.125
 What is near is an asteroid so large 

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.155
 Causing an estimated global catastrophe to occur 

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:52.205
 Every 120,000 years. While there are no expectations 

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.175
 For the direction of an asteroid to Earth soon, the existing data is incomplete 

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.075
 Despite global efforts 

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.315
 To search the sky. If that happens 

00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:03.415
 It may cause global cooling such as the Ice Age. 

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.345
 However, smaller asteroids can also cause significant impact 

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:09.205
 On both natural and human systems. 

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:12.415
 A closer prospect is the volcano 

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:15.415
 The destruction in Pompeii caused by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was launched around 

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:18.195
 4 cubic kilometers of sediment but may launch a massive volcano 

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.185
 More than 500 cubic kilometers. 

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.085
 What causes concern about this probabilities around the world is 

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.975
 An ash cloud that would obscure the sun, which would cause the world to cool 

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:30.085
 And disruption of agriculture. Another outbreak occurred known 

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.995
 About 25,000 years ago in New Zealand 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.025
 Researchers predict that eruptions will occur every 30,000 to 50,000 years. 

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.000
 Scientists are currently monitoring Mount Yellowstone 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.025
 In the United States as a potential outbreak site. But not 

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.835
 All the risks that threaten us are normal. Can be overcrowded 

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:47.305
 Can outweigh the Earth's ability to produce food 

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:50.165
 And other resources, and increases the risk of epidemics 

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.155
 Infectious due to high population densities, possibly through diseases created 

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:56.155
 Through bioengineering. However, the evidence indicates 

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.715
 Low fertility rates. 

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:01.535
 Will we witness the gradual extinction of humans? 

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.975
 Because of lack of births? Or will climate change overcome this concern? 

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.935
 A temperature rise of 3 Â° C is very important 

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:11.075
 With most Florida and Bangladesh underwater. 

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:14.255
 While many coastal cities will be flooded. In addition 

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.305
 Massive fire seasons will therefore become longer and cause greater damage 

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:20.265
 The devastating hurricanes, heat waves and lack of food will increase 

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.155
 And drought. All of this can affect and increase 

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:26.195
 Violence, with the suffering of States now 

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:29.675
 Of the water and climate conditions that will ultimately affect 

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.745
 On deteriorating economic conditions. Then there are 

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.805
 Nuclear war, tensions over North Korea has brought this conflict to 

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.765
 Pioneer. With more than 7,000 known warheads with Russia 

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:41.555
 The United States, and nuclear weapons within the United Kingdom, France 

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:44.585
 China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. 

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:47.005
 Represent the hour of resurrection you created 

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.015
 Journal of Atomic Scientists Probability 

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:52.935
 A man-made global disaster. Although the hour has recently included 

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:55.505
 Climate change and some other developments 

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.755
 Put humanity at risk, the importance lies on nuclear war. 

00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:02.075
 Since its inception in 1947, the farthest 

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.085
 We were from Midnight or Doomsday was in 1991 

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:08.205
 When it was midnight, it was only 17 minutes. 

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:11.375
 Today in 2017 indicates the hour 

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.245
 Midnight is only two and a half minutes, the second closest 

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:17.215
 What I've ever attached. So it can be a small nuclear war 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.700
 To create a nuclear winter that would cause global warming 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.655
 And damage to the ozone layer may create 

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.465
 Drought lasts for more than a decade. 

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.545
 The biggest threat ever is: researchers now believe 

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:32.695
 It's artificial intelligence. If growth continues 

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.565
 It became similar to industrial and agricultural revolutions 

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:38.445
 Experts predict the arrival of autonomous machinery to the stage of intelligence 

00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:40.795
 Approaching the level of human intelligence by 2075. 

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:44.845
 Even if they do not become malicious or evil 

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:48.035
 What happens if those programmed machines are killed in 

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:51.195
 Wrong hands? Or when an artificial intelligence programmer does something good 

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:53.825
 By a destructive means? 

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:56.875

 About how the rich are ready for the end of the world and 

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.865
 How to survive a nuclear war. This year has come to an end. Be patient! 

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.115
 good bye!
