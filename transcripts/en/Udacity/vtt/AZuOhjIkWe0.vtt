00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.807
And the classic example here is the Rorschach ink blot test, which you see

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:08.738
here, which is simply symmetrical ink blots. And, the job for the person is

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.962
just to look at that and tell the psychologist what he or she sees in that ink

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.530
blot.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.428
&gt;&gt; And after doing this for about 10-12 ink blots, a licensed psychologist can

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:20.706
interpret the results. They look for unconscious patterns, in the themes, that

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:25.200
a person gives them. For example, they might have a hostile, and agressive

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.310
theme, or a sexual theme, in all the ink blots.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.252
&gt;&gt; That's right. For example, a person who is depressed may see self destrucive,

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:37.974
or perhaps sad images. A person who is anxious may see something that causes

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:40.965
them excessive worry, or even fright.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.215
&gt;&gt; The problem with scoring projective tests, however, is that you need to find a

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:47.540
valid and reliable way to interpret the results.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.040
&gt;&gt; That's right. And so for reliable, we would have to have multiple judges giving

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.515
the same responses across time.

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:56.665
&gt;&gt; And for validity, say a psychologist found somebody with a hostile theme to

00:00:56.665 --> 00:01:01.572
their interpretations of the ink blot. They would have to have external

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:05.980
evidence, from friends, or family, or peers to confirm their hostility.
