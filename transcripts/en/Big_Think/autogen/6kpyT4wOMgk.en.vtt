you

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.300
you
 

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.790
you
[Music]

could you live in a simulation I think

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:07.570
could you live in a simulation I think
 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.360
could you live in a simulation I think
that is related first of all so the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370
that is related first of all so the
 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.579
that is related first of all so the
question what we mean by a simulation if

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:11.589
question what we mean by a simulation if
 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.529
question what we mean by a simulation if
the question is could we be living

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539
the question is could we be living
 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.289
the question is could we be living
inside of a computer program then my

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299
inside of a computer program then my
 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.380
inside of a computer program then my
answer would be of course yes it is the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390
answer would be of course yes it is the
 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.640
answer would be of course yes it is the
only thing that we get with some

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650
only thing that we get with some
 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.560
only thing that we get with some
certainty from the outside world is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570
certainty from the outside world is
 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.779
certainty from the outside world is
information and the only thing that we

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789
information and the only thing that we
 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.249
information and the only thing that we
find with certainty in this information

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259
find with certainty in this information
 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.769
find with certainty in this information
is regularity and for a system to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779
is regularity and for a system to
 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.810
is regularity and for a system to
produce regularity and information that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
produce regularity and information that
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.970
produce regularity and information that
is discernible differences that change

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980
is discernible differences that change
 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.069
is discernible differences that change
in a way that is somewhat not random and

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079
in a way that is somewhat not random and
 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.040
in a way that is somewhat not random and
somewhat predictable for this it needs

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050
somewhat predictable for this it needs
 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.200
somewhat predictable for this it needs
to compute so it's necessary and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210
to compute so it's necessary and
 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.700
to compute so it's necessary and
sufficient for the universe whatever

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710
sufficient for the universe whatever
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.920
sufficient for the universe whatever
else it does that it computes and you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930
else it does that it computes and you
 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.770
else it does that it computes and you
cannot really know what else does so in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780
cannot really know what else does so in
 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.229
cannot really know what else does so in
my view it's necessary and sufficient

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239
my view it's necessary and sufficient
 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.459
my view it's necessary and sufficient
that the universe is some kind of

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469
that the universe is some kind of
 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.290
that the universe is some kind of

science doesn't mean that we know what

kind of computational class the system

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719
kind of computational class the system
 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.660
kind of computational class the system
is in and there is I think a lot of

is in and there is I think a lot of
 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.990

kind of computational class universe

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470
kind of computational class universe
 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.350
kind of computational class universe
really is in what capabilities it has

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
really is in what capabilities it has
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.880
really is in what capabilities it has
what can compute and what it cannot

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890
what can compute and what it cannot
 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.090
what can compute and what it cannot
compute but still its computational in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100
compute but still its computational in
 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.600
compute but still its computational in
some sense

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
some sense
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.030
some sense
the question of whether we are living in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040
the question of whether we are living in
 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.320
the question of whether we are living in
a simulation is more related to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330
a simulation is more related to
 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.719
a simulation is more related to
something more narrow that is is this

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729
something more narrow that is is this
 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.450
something more narrow that is is this
computer program that you're living in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
computer program that you're living in
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.980
computer program that you're living in
intentionally created or is it just a

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
intentionally created or is it just a
 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.399
intentionally created or is it just a
natural occurrence and of course you

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409
natural occurrence and of course you
 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.020
natural occurrence and of course you
cannot really know this because no

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030
cannot really know this because no
 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.999
cannot really know this because no
feature in the world clearly points at

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009
feature in the world clearly points at
 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.670
feature in the world clearly points at
the thing being a simulation in the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680
the thing being a simulation in the
 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.200
the thing being a simulation in the
sense I don't see anything that would

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210
sense I don't see anything that would
 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.999
sense I don't see anything that would
convince me that we are in a simulation

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009
convince me that we are in a simulation
 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.340
convince me that we are in a simulation
but if it is one I don't think it's for

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350
but if it is one I don't think it's for
 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.370
but if it is one I don't think it's for
our benefit I don't think that all these

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380
our benefit I don't think that all these
 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.690
our benefit I don't think that all these
galaxies and stars and all the intricate

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
galaxies and stars and all the intricate
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.219
galaxies and stars and all the intricate
elementary particle structures that we

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229
elementary particle structures that we
 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.139
elementary particle structures that we
can observe in some sense and that are

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149
can observe in some sense and that are
 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.090
can observe in some sense and that are
not necessary for our experience as

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100
not necessary for our experience as
 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.389
not necessary for our experience as
primates on the planetary surface would

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399
primates on the planetary surface would
 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.100
primates on the planetary surface would
need to be painted on the telescopes and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110
need to be painted on the telescopes and
 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.350
need to be painted on the telescopes and
microscopes by the simulator so I don't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360
microscopes by the simulator so I don't
 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.510
microscopes by the simulator so I don't
think that these are smoke signals and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
think that these are smoke signals and
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.789
think that these are smoke signals and
we look into the sky and we see these

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
we look into the sky and we see these
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.580
we look into the sky and we see these
zillions of galaxies I do think that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
zillions of galaxies I do think that
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.469
zillions of galaxies I do think that
they if this is a simulation then there

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479
they if this is a simulation then there
 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.150
they if this is a simulation then there
would be an important feature of the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160
would be an important feature of the
 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.040
would be an important feature of the
simulation which means the simulation is

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050
simulation which means the simulation is
 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.840
simulation which means the simulation is
not there to create us the simulation is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850
not there to create us the simulation is
 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.860
not there to create us the simulation is
probably there to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
probably there to
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.589
probably there to
explore some aspects of hypothetical

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
explore some aspects of hypothetical
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.320
explore some aspects of hypothetical
physics and we are just a random side

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
physics and we are just a random side
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.900
physics and we are just a random side
effector an artifact of that detected

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910
effector an artifact of that detected
 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.630
effector an artifact of that detected
evolution is possible in this universe

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640
evolution is possible in this universe
 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.790
evolution is possible in this universe
so we could emerge in it I think it's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800
so we could emerge in it I think it's
 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.440
so we could emerge in it I think it's
very unlikely that we are in a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
very unlikely that we are in a
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.360
very unlikely that we are in a
simulation because if I would build a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
simulation because if I would build a
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.880
simulation because if I would build a
simulation of the universe I would make

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
simulation of the universe I would make
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.369
simulation of the universe I would make
a computer that it runs on irreversible

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379
a computer that it runs on irreversible
 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.580
a computer that it runs on irreversible
what that means is that the operations

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590
what that means is that the operations
 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.410
what that means is that the operations
that happen in that universe can delete

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
that happen in that universe can delete
 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.900
that happen in that universe can delete
bits it means that a state that we

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910
bits it means that a state that we
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.400
bits it means that a state that we
observe in the universe can have

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410
observe in the universe can have
 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.229
observe in the universe can have
multiple possible escapes that it comes

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239
multiple possible escapes that it comes
 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.080
multiple possible escapes that it comes
from and if you look at what we know

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
from and if you look at what we know
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.699
from and if you look at what we know
empirically in physics that doesn't seem

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709
empirically in physics that doesn't seem
 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.400
empirically in physics that doesn't seem
to be the case our universe seems to be

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410
to be the case our universe seems to be
 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.190
to be the case our universe seems to be
reversible and this means we cannot

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
reversible and this means we cannot
 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.589
reversible and this means we cannot
really delete bit if you cannot delete

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599
really delete bit if you cannot delete
 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.539
really delete bit if you cannot delete
bits it means that everything that we

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549
bits it means that everything that we
 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.119

like irreversible you know you'd

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129
like irreversible you know you'd
 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.619
like irreversible you know you'd
stabilize your body temperature you

stabilize your body temperature you
 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.330
stabilize your body temperature you
forget yesterday's body temperature in

forget yesterday's body temperature in
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.729
forget yesterday's body temperature in
your body it means that you have to do

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
your body it means that you have to do
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.890
your body it means that you have to do
these bits and sometimes all the things

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
these bits and sometimes all the things

irreversible in some sense they all need

irreversible in some sense they all need
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.509
irreversible in some sense they all need
to delete bits to keep their structure

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
to delete bits to keep their structure
 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.430
to delete bits to keep their structure

higher than the probability that you are
 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.140
higher than the probability that you are
in based reality but I think what this

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
in based reality but I think what this
 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.910
in based reality but I think what this
doesn't take into account is the level

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920
doesn't take into account is the level
 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.590
doesn't take into account is the level
of detail that you can achieve in such a

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.860
of detail that you can achieve in such a
simulation it seems that our universe

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870
simulation it seems that our universe
 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.620
simulation it seems that our universe
has an amazing amount of detail and to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630
has an amazing amount of detail and to
 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.770
has an amazing amount of detail and to
get this amount of detail in a subset of

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780
get this amount of detail in a subset of
 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.870
get this amount of detail in a subset of
this computer it's very hard because if

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880
this computer it's very hard because if
 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.700
this computer it's very hard because if
you build a computer here on this planet

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710
you build a computer here on this planet
 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.920
you build a computer here on this planet
it means you cannot simulate a big

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930
it means you cannot simulate a big
 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.570
it means you cannot simulate a big
universe in it you can only simulate

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580
universe in it you can only simulate
 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.270
universe in it you can only simulate
very very very small slow universe in it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280
very very very small slow universe in it
 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.210
very very very small slow universe in it
so every universe that you stack into

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220
so every universe that you stack into
 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.710
so every universe that you stack into
another universe is going to have many

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720
another universe is going to have many
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.830
another universe is going to have many
orders of magnitude less detail so I

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840
orders of magnitude less detail so I
 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.570
orders of magnitude less detail so I
think if you find yourself in a very

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580
think if you find yourself in a very
 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.700
think if you find yourself in a very
detailed universe that has many many

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710
detailed universe that has many many
 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.200
detailed universe that has many many
galaxies a much more detail than you

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210
galaxies a much more detail than you
 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.450
galaxies a much more detail than you
need to have intelligent life and

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460
need to have intelligent life and
 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.100
need to have intelligent life and
civilizations in it and so on is

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
civilizations in it and so on is
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.930
civilizations in it and so on is
unlikely going to going to be a

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940
unlikely going to going to be a
 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.000
unlikely going to going to be a
simulated universe created by a

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010
simulated universe created by a
 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.590
simulated universe created by a
civilization it's more likely that

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600
