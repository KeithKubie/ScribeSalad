00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:08.991
Alexios Komnenos,

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.371
Byzantine emperor,

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.046
led his army to meet the Scythian hordes

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.111
in battle.

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.271
For good luck,

00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.261
he carried one of the holiest relics

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.381
in Christendom:

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.751
the veil that had belonged

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:21.721
to the Virgin Mary.

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.031
Unfortunately, it didn’t help.

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.281
Not only was his army defeated,

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.491
but as they fled,

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:30.231
the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.629
To make matters worse, a strong wind

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.899
made the relic too heavy to carry,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.649
so he stashed it in some bushes

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.005
as he escaped.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.415
But even as he fled,

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:41.515
he managed to slay some Scythians

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.195
and rescue a few comrades.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:47.185
At least, this is how Alexios' daughter

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:49.035
Anna recounted the story,

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.775
writing nearly 60 years later.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.765
She spent the last decade of her long life

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:57.265
creating a 500-page history

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.145
of her father’s reign called The Alexiad.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.065
Written in Greek, the book was modeled

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.715
after ancient Greek epics

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.415
and historical writings.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.865
But Anna had a different, trickier task

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.055
than the writers in these traditions:

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:11.165
as a princess writing

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:12.625
about her own family,

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.215
she had to balance her loyalty to her kin

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.455
with her obligation

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:18.715
to portray events accurately,

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:21.155
navigating issues like Alexios’s

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.575
embarrassing stab to the buttocks.

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:25.755
A lifetime of study and participation

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:27.105
in her father’s government

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:30.105
prepared Anna for this undertaking.

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:32.632
Anna was born in 1083,

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:34.912
shortly after her father seized control

00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:36.312
of the Roman Empire

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:38.972
following a decade of brutal civil wars

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:40.522
and revolts.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:42.366
The empire was deep in decline

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.676
when he came to power,

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.616
and threatened from all sides:

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.666
by the Seljuk Turks in the East,

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.556
the Normans in the West,

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.876
and Scythian raiders to the north.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:53.916
Over the course of Anna’s childhood

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.046
and adolescence,

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:57.766
Alexios fought constant military campaigns

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.306
to secure the frontiers of his empire,

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.426
even striking up an uneasy alliance

00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:04.366
with the Crusaders.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.590
Meanwhile in Constantinople,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.670
Anna fought her own battle.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.690
She was expected to study subjects

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.770
considered proper

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.640
for a Byzantine princess,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.990
like courtly etiquette and the Bible,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.670
but preferred classical myth

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.960
and philosophy.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.483
To access this material, she had to learn

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:23.953
to read and speak Ancient Greek,

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:26.413
by studying secretly at night.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.933
Eventually her parents realized

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.223
how serious she was,

00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:31.403
and provided her with tutors.

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:32.933
Anna expanded her studies

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.193
to classical literature, rhetoric,

00:02:35.193 --> 00:02:38.093
history, philosophy, mathematics,

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:40.093
astronomy, and medicine.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.743
One scholar even complained

00:02:41.743 --> 00:02:42.993
that her constant requests

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:44.793
for more Aristotle commentaries

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.153
were wearing out his eyes.

00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:48.193
At age fifteen,

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.783
Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:52.283
to quell old conflicts

00:02:52.283 --> 00:02:53.363
between their families

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:55.793
and strengthen Alexios’s reign.

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:58.603
Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up

00:02:58.603 --> 00:03:00.813
sharing many intellectual interests,

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.123
hosting and debating

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:04.543
the leading scholars of the day.

00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:07.673
Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:09.063
began to pay off,

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:10.893
restoring many of the empire’s

00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:12.573
former territories.

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:13.983
As her father aged,

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.353
Anna and her husband helped her parents

00:03:16.353 --> 00:03:18.423
with their imperial duties.

00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:19.573
During this time,

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:21.163
Anna reportedly advocated for

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:22.813
just treatment of the people

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:25.233
in their disputes with the government.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.273
After Alexios’s death,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.673
Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne

00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:30.923
and Anna turned back

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.933
to philosophy and scholarship.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.783
Her husband had written a history

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.543
arguing that his grandfather

00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:38.183
would have made a better emperor

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:39.423
than Alexios,

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:41.333
but Anna disagreed.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.303
She began working on the Alexiad,

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:45.063
which made the case for her father's

00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:47.053
merits as emperor.

00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:49.482
Spanning the late 11th and early 12th

00:03:49.482 --> 00:03:51.332
centuries of Byzantine history,

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:52.652
the Alexiad recounts

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:55.742
the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign,

00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:58.712
and Anna’s own reactions to those events,

00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:00.612
like bursting into tears at the thought

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:03.592
of the deaths of her parents and husband.

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.792
She may have included 
these emotional passages

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.772
in hopes that they would make her writing

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:09.532
more palatable to a society

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:10.912
that believed women shouldn't

00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:13.512
write about battles and empires.

00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:15.214
While her loyalty to her father

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:17.064
was evident in her favorable account

00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:19.704
of his reign, she also included criticism

00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:22.284
and her opinions of events.

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:24.180
In the centuries after her death,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.910
Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.650
and remains an invaluable

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.800
eyewitness account

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.430
of Alexios’s reign today.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.920
And through her epic historical narrative,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.490
Anna Komnene secured

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.240
her own place in history.
