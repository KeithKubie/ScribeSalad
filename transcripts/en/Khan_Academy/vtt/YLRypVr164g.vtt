00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:01.281
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.609
naming ionic compounds.

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.557
So I have a formula for an
ionic compound right over here,

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:09.384
but how would I say this?

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.127
And if you get inspired, pause the video

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:14.028
and try to work it out on your own.

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.695
Well we could see that
it has some magnesium,

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.941
and it has some phosphorus,
and the convention is,

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.091
is the positive ion is written first.

00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:25.422
So if this follows the convention,

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:29.464
the magnesium is going to be our cation.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:32.667
And when you look at magnesium
in the periodic table

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.934
right over here it makes sense

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.831
that it is going to be the cation

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:40.998
because it is a group two
element, an alkaline earth metal,

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:46.020
and when those get ionized they
tend to lose two electrons.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.491
They have two electrons in
their outermost shell and so,

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:52.078
when they ionize they tend to lose those.

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:56.550
So magnesium when it
ionizes tends to be, let me,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.717
when magnesium ionizes, it
tends to magnesium two plus

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:06.502
and so this is probably each
of these three magnesium ions

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:09.376
are probably magnesium two pluses,

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:12.869
so we could if we want,
just to see what is going on

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.254
in this compound, we
could write it like this,

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:17.919
which isn't what you would typically see

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:21.117
but this is just to see
what the constituent ions

00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:23.514
of this compound actually are.

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:25.291
Now as I mentioned, the cation tends

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.811
to be written first so
that's the magnesium,

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.074
and the anion tends to be written second,

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:34.220
and that is the phosphorus here
if we follow the convention.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.672
So that's the phosphorus right over here,

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:41.287
and does it make sense that
phosphorus would be an anion?

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:44.001
Well phosphorus is out
on the right-hand side

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.220
of the periodic table right over here.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.028
In order for it to complete
its outermost shell,

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:52.611
it wants to gain one,
two, three electrons,

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:56.665
so when it ionizes it makes sense

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.933
that it gains those three electrons.

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:03.665
So that phosphorus becomes
phosphide, three minus,

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.997
and so these two
phosphoruses in this formula,

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.119
we could write like this.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.786
So we have two phosphide anions,

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:15.275
so we could just write it like this.

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.808
Now the whole reason why I wrote out

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:20.747
the constituent ions
like this is to make sure

00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:22.971
that it'll all end up being neutral.

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:25.733
The magnesiums, the three magnesium ions,

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.351
will have a collective six plus charge,

00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:31.688
and the two phosphides are going to have

00:02:31.688 --> 00:02:33.825
a collective six minus and so,

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.136
when you add the six
pluses and the six minus,

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:38.165
they are all going to cancel out.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.214
So let me write this, you have six plus,

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:43.958
and then you have six
minus, which once again,

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.179
makes us feel good that
we're understanding

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.118
this ionic compound well
because an ionic compound,

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.056
they didn't write any net charge here,

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.713
so this is going to be neutral.

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:57.317
The cations and the anions
are going to cancel out.

00:02:57.317 --> 00:03:00.293
But once again, what
do we call this thing?

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:03.340
Well the convention is, is we
just write the elemental name

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.276
or we say the elemental
name for the cation,

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.943
so this is going to be
magnesium, magnesium.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.077
And then we say, we say the
-ide version of the anion.

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.850
So this is phosphorus, we say phosphide,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.234
so this is going to be
magnesium phosphide.

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:24.458
And actually I don't
have to capitalize it,

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:28.541
so let me write it all
lowercase, magnesium . . .

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:31.275
Magnesium . . .

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:35.453
Phosphide, and you might be saying hey,

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:37.178
this doesn't have a lot
of information in it,

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:40.788
how do you, if someone just
told me magnesium phosphide,

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:42.732
how do I construct what I did,

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:44.887
what we originally started with?

00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:46.947
Well the answer is, you
would have to say okay,

00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:50.928
magnesium is our cation,
it's right over here,

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:54.782
it's a group two, it's going
to have a positive two charge

00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:58.387
when it ionizes, so
you would look at that,

00:03:58.387 --> 00:04:00.675
and you'd say okay, phosphide,

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:03.719
well that tends to have
a three minus charge

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.756
when it ionizes which we saw
over here, and then you'd say,

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:09.954
okay well what ratio would I have to have

00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:13.413
between these two things in
order for them to cancel out?

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:16.911
Well for every three of
these, of the magnesiums,

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:20.124
I have two phosphides, well
then they're going to cancel out

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:21.286
and so that's how you could go

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:24.251
from the name to the actual formula,

00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.863
which we will actually
do in the next video.
