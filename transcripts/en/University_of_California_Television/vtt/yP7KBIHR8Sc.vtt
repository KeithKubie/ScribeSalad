00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:08.540
(soft piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.863
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.820
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.703
of humans like you.

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.979
(soft electronic music)

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.600
- Humans eat meat more often,
and in greater quantities

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.570
than any other primate.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.650
And as we've already heard
today twice, meat consumption

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.280
is seen by many as one
of the defining features

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.223
of our species.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.380
And it's been linked to the evolution of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
our large brains, bipedal
locomotion, pair bonding,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.323
and other distinctly human traits.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.620
So therefore, it's critically
important to understand

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.633
what caused this dramatic dietary shift.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.620
So, to understand how and
why meat eating became

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.120
so prevalent in our
lineage, we need to know

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.920
something about the ancestral state.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.900
In other words, we need
to make inferences about

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.370
the behavior of the last
common ancestor of humans

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.620
and our closest living relatives.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.143
So I'm talking about this creature here.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.523
That lived in Africa four
to eight million years ago.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.610
So, as our closest living
relatives, and as specifically

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.790
as large-bodied, primarily
fruit-eating apes,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.600
chimpanzees and bonobos provide clues

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.320
about the behavior of
this last common ancestor.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.160
Of course, they're not
exact replicas or models

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.220
of the last common ancestor,
instead, they help us

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.870
to understand the ecological pressures

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.320
that this animal faced,
and in turn, can help us

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.543
understand what changed
in our lineage and why.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.207
Both chimpanzees and bonobos eat meat.

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:28.430
But chimpanzees do so more often.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.810
So, we know more about
the factors that affect

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.400
their hunting frequency, so that's why I'm

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.483
discussing chimpanzees today.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.870
A little bit of background
on chimpanzee biology,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.430
chimpanzee diet is dominated
by ripe fruit, figs,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.830
like these here, are
particularly important.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.910
The abundance and
distribution of ripe fruit

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.090
in chimp habitat affects
grouping and travel patterns

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.090
of the chimpanzees, which
as we will see, also affect

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.253
hunting behavior.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.450
In addition to a largely
fruit-based diet, chimpanzees

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.260
also eat leaves,
specifically young leaves,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.420
which are easier to digest,
and extract protein from.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.530
The flowers and stems,
as well as invertebrates

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.870
like termites and ants, and at some sites,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.900
they use tools to do so,
so here's a chimpanzee

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
at Gombe using a long blade
of grass to extract termites

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.203
from a termite mound.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.120
So, it should come as no
surprise to this audience

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.893
now, that chimpanzees also eat meat.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.150
But compared to humans, they
do so relatively rarely.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.200
So, this is a, and it's
actually really surprising

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.020
to find that there are
relatively few published data

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.950
on the proportion of
diet spent eating meat.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.990
So this is just a quick
and dirty breakdown

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.370
of diet from Gombe National Park, which is

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.660
where I work.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.120
And as you can see, the time spent feeding

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.270
is dominated by ripe
fruit and leaves, and meat

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.730
makes up about 4.3% of feeding time.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.543
Insects are about 3.2%.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.530
Compared to Kanyawara, which
is Richard Rangam's site,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.620
there, they spend less than
1% of their feeding time

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.100
eating meat, and at Mahale,
where they estimated it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.020
in terms of grams per day,
it's only about 45 grams,

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.933
so very very different to
what we see among humans.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.720
So, by far the most important prey species

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.620
for chimpanzees is the red colobus monkey.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.020
These guys weigh from
eight to ten kilograms,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.100
although at some sites, the
chimps target the young,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.640
the infants and the juveniles, which are

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.620
obviously much smaller.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.580
Red colobus are arboreal,
they live in trees.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.230
They rarely come down to the ground.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.790
And they live in large
groups, 50 or so individuals,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.560
and they fiercely defend themselves

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.743
against the chimpanzee hunters.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.065
So, when I say that they're the
most important prey species,

00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:12.300
you can see why.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.300
So, here are five major chimpanzee
long term research sites

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.420
and at all sites where red
colobus and chimpanzees

00:06:22.495 --> 00:06:26.980
coexist, red colobus are the
most frequent prey species,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.310
so you can see here, at Mahale,
Tai, Gombe and Kanyawara,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.280
it's about 80% of the
prey taken are red colobus

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.070
monkeys, and at Ngogo,
at least until recently,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.720
90% of the prey were red colobus, but this

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.170
has changed in recent years
because the chimpanzees

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.720
have decimated the red colobus population,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.803
which we may hear about
later from David Watts.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.620
So, which species make
up the other category,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.420
the little gray bars at
the top on that last graph?

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.180
Well, to some extent,
other arboreal monkeys, so

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.060
from left to right, red tailed
guenons, black and white

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.210
colobus monkeys and blue monkeys.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.630
And then also, they prey
upon small ungulates.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.313
Infant bush pigs, at the bottom left.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.210
Bush buck fawns, adult
duikers, which are small

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.330
forest antelopes, and then
small animals that hide

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.480
in tree holes, like this
galago here, and nestlings

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.460
and so on.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.133
So hunts of the latter,
particularly the bottom row here,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.830
don't really involve
pursuit in the same way

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.860
that hunts of arboreal
monkeys do, they're much more

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.850
of a quick grab as the
chimps come across them

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.850
as they're foraging.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.030
Now, hunting frequency
varies considerably within

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.030
and between sites, ranging
from as few as two kills

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.010
per year in Budongo forest
in Uganda, to as many

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.593
as 136 per year, at Ngogo, also in uganda.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.610
So, this variation
gives us the opportunity

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.650
to study the ecological
factors that affect

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.063
hunting decisions.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.310
So clearly, much of this
variation is gonna be driven

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.510
by what prey species are
available in the habitat.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.570
So, as we saw, red
colobus monkeys dominate

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.150
the prey profiles, at the
sites where they're present,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.800
so if they're not
available, we're gonna see

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.113
lower rates of hunting overall, obviously.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.660
So, we can see here,
at Fongoli and Budongo,

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.300
there are no red colobus
monkeys and their number

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.680
of prey per year killed
per year are quite low.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.000
However, we see also, there's considerable

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.760
variation in the sites where
red colobus are present.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.570
So there is additional
variation that's not explained

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.413
by the presence of red colobus monkeys.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.950
So, it's not just gonna be the presence of

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.880
a particular species
that's important, it's also

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.880
gonna be important how
dense the population is,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.230
how many there are in the habitat.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.810
And this is a particular
challenge that we face,

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.490
particularly when it
comes to the cryptic prey.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.540
So for example, these
galagos, they're small,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.660
solitary, nocturnal
primates that are active

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.530
at night, and they nest in tree cavities

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.830
during the day, really
hard to get a good sense

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.900
of how many there are in the habitat.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.550
So we're gonna hear in Jill
Pruetz's talk later today,

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.110
that these galagos are
eaten relatively frequently

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.120
at Fongoli, but this may simply be because

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.330
relative to other sites,
perhaps they're more common

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.863
there than they are elsewhere.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.970
There's also considerable
variation within sites

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.690
as well, so I'll use Kibali National Park

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.963
as an example here.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.730
Duiker, the small forest
antelope, they are frequently

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.640
seen at Ngogo, but only
rarely seen at Kanyawara,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.370
which is the chimpanzee
community in the same

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.750
exact forest.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.580
So, it's really challenging
to do so, but I think

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.770
we really need to have
some systematic comparison

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.300
of prey density, both within and between

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.003
study sites to fully
understand prey choice.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.240
So, with that in mind, what
other factors are going

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.610
to affect hunting frequency?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.810
So as a behavioral
ecologist, I think in terms

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.530
of the costs and the benefits of hunting,

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.110
the main costs are energy,
especially when hunting

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.840
arboreal monkeys, because
it takes a lot of effort

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.030
to climb trees quickly
and chase the monkeys.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.090
Time is important, mean
hunt duration at Gombe,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.580
Craig Stanford found, is about 28 minutes,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.310
so this opportunity cost.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.790
And then also injury,
from falling or from being

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.170
attacked by prey who clearly don't want

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.103
to be eaten.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.760
The benefits, as we
heard about from Alyssa,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.950
are clearer.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.150
Meat is always gonna be beneficial.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.470
Meat is a concentrated
source of easily accessible

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.513
macro and micronutrients.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.440
However, for chimps, it
seems unlikely that meat is

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.370
essential to their diet,
given that some communities

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.200
rarely hunt, and even
among communities that

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.030
do hunt frequently, there
are some individuals

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.623
who rarely get meat.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.200
So, they have other alternatives.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.410
Presumably, the insect
diet that they have to get

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.640
some of these nutrients,
although it's less efficient

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.350
than getting it from meat.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.350
So, therefore, we expect
chimpanzees to take advantage

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.810
of low cost opportunities to get meat.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.170
They can afford to be
picky because they don't

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.630
require it to survive,
but when they can get it,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.550
they'll take advantage of
those low cost opportunities.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.750
So, I'm proposing that
variation in factors

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.680
that affect hunting costs
should affect hunting frequency.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.610
So, what evidence do we
have that chimpanzees

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.963
are especially sensitive
to the costs of hunting?

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.990
First, theory predicts
that females should be more

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.700
risk-averse than males,
female reproductive success

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.440
is more closely tied to their
body condition, compared

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.700
to males, whose reproductive
success is determined

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.403
by the number of females
that they mate with.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.630
So, the cost of wasted
effort, wasted effort

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.590
on failed hunting, should
be greater for females

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.050
than for males.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.620
So this predicts, then, that
females should specialize

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.340
in prey, that are less costly to capture.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.340
So indeed, at Gombe, females
capture over 60%, you can see

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.950
in the gray bar on the
right-hand side, 60%

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.030
of the sedentary, passive prey items, like

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.140
fledglings and bush buck fawns, things

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.240
that don't fight back and
don't run away, compared

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.160
to only about 10% of the arboreal monkeys,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.290
which require a lot of effort to capture,

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.800
and they fight back.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.120
In between, we have
terrestrial aggressive prey,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.510
like bush buck, piglets,
who doesn't involve

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.200
climbing through the
trees, but they have very,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.370
very angry moms, who are, you do not want

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.203
to mess with.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.310
Okay, so at Gombe, females
specialize in these

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.283
sedentary, non-threatening prey.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.300
Females do, as we saw,
sometimes hunt red colobus,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.540
but when they're present at a hunt that's

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.110
already in progress, they're
less likely than males

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.423
to participate.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.070
So this again suggests
that they're particularly

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.390
sensitive to the costs of hunting.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.680
Also, there is less incentive
for females to hunt,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.130
because when they're
successful, most often,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.940
a male just comes and takes it away.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.190
So instead, females are more likely to sit

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.380
and watch from below, and
then beg for meat from

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.393
successful male hunters.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.350
At all sites, upon encountering
red colobus troupe,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.950
a hunt is more likely to occur if there

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.050
are many adult male
chimpanzees present in a party.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.530
The chimps have what we
call a fission fusion

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.180
social system, so if you
think of that oval as

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.040
one social group's range,
the entire social group

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.210
are never all together at
once, instead, they form

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.410
fluid sub-groups that change
in size and composition,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.760
in relation to food and
female availability.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.360
So, when I talk about the
number of male chimpanzees,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.190
I'm talking about the
number of male chimpanzees

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.930
in one of those sub-groups,
and as I said, the likelihood

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.840
of a hunt occurring upon
encountering red colobus monkeys

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.230
is proportional to the
number of males present

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.100
in that party.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.370
So, there is some debate
about why this is,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.160
it could be that when
there are more males there,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.653
there are more opportunities
to collaborate,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.430
and to coordinate one's actions.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.660
However, as my colleagues
and I have argued,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.810
we think there's a simpler
alternative that group hunting

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.520
simply arises as the cumulative effect

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.670
of independent actions,
the more hunters there are,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.580
the easier it is for one
individual to make a kill.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.460
Either way, hunting costs are lower

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.573
as more individuals hunt.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.950
So, large communities are
certainly going to have,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.750
they're more likely to form these large

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.000
hunting parties,
contributing to the overall

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.890
hunting frequency, so remember, this chart

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.960
that I showed earlier, with variation

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.370
in hunting frequency, within
sites where red colobus

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.720
are present, so some of this variation

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.640
is certainly going to be
due to community size.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.020
So, over the years when
these data were collected,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.450
there were 150 to 200 chimpanzees
in the Ngogo community.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.230
While Gombe, Mahale and
Kanyawara were all around 50.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.600
Okay, so it certainly seems as though

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.600
the large population size at
Ngogo had an important affect

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.683
on hunting frequency.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.970
Another factor is variation
in forest structure.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.960
So, this is a high res satellite image

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.430
of part of Gombe, and you
can see just by looking,

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.040
that the density and
continuity of the forest canopy

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.740
varies considerably within the range of

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.820
a single chimpanzee community.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.250
So we look in the valleys,
we see evergreen forest,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.940
which looks like this,
it's a continuous canopy,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.800
tall trees, it's really
costly for an individual

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.260
to hunt, lots of energy is
going to be spent climbing

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.500
and chasing, it's easier
for monkeys to escape,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.673
so hunts might take longer,
and be less likely to succeed.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.073
On the ridges, we see woodland habitat,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.960
which are characterized
by short trees that

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.660
are widely spaced, so
it's easy to trap monkeys

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.440
in one single tree, less
energy spent catching them.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.210
And as we expect from that,
we see that forest structure

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.800
does indeed have an effect
on both the probability

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.800
of hunting, in the darker
maroon bars, both at

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.203
Ngogo and Gombe.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.040
And also, affects the
probability that a hunt succeeds,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.923
as well.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.120
Finally, overall diet quality.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.460
Affects whether or not
chimpanzees will take on

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.130
the risk of hunting.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.370
So for example, Richard
and I showed at Kanyawara

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.100
that hunting is more
frequent during periods when

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.973
overall high quality fruit is available.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.080
And this result here, isn't
just because high quality

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.980
fruit enables the
formation of large parties

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.680
as it does at Gombe and
Ngogo, but once you take

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.443
that into account, we found that ...

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.150
The probability of a hunt
occurring was simply higher

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.260
after controlling for
group size during times

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.580
when there was high
quality fruit available.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.120
So a party of six males,
you can see there, hunts

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.030
twice as often as a party of six males in

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.590
high quality fruit seasons,
hunts twice as often

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.000
as a party of six males in
low-quality fruit seasons.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.860
We've argued that this
is because the costs

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.470
of a failed hunt are lower when there is

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.563
high quality food to fall back on.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.430
So, to conclude, there
is considerable variation

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.470
in hunting frequency
within and between sites.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.430
And this is because hunting
frequency is affected

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.653
by many ecological factors.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.171
Having to do with the
prey, having to do with

00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:12.171
the predators, and the
ecology of the site.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:17.510
So, if we agree that it's
logical to conclude that

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.620
the last common ancestor
was faced with similar

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.840
ecological pressures, and
would therefore have exhibited

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.060
similar patterns, how then do we explain

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.973
the increase in hunting
in the homonid lineage?

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.900
So I suggest that the
first step might have been

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.030
an increase in low cost
opportunities to capture prey,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.790
which could likely come as a
combination of many factors,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.780
but I would argue that
certainly prey availability

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.190
and habitat were key factors.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.784
Thank you very much.

00:19:50.784 --> 00:19:52.972
(audience applauds)

00:19:52.972 --> 00:19:54.860
- There are actually no
chimpanzees in this image,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.200
but I wanted to start
with it to remind you

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.410
as both of our previous
speakers very nicely

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.410
and eloquently told you,
humans are hyper-cooperative.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.500
And in addition to the many ways in which

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.890
we depend on cooperation,
including for the construction

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.300
of auditoriums like this,
we also have what I think

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.350
is compelling evidence for an increase

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.140
in meat consumption from
the paleo-archeological

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.470
record, starting by about
two million years ago

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.860
at for example, this
site of Kanjera south,

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.460
several sites in Kanjera
in western Kenya, where

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.410
there's good evidence for hunting of small

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.270
to medium size antelope at
about two million years,

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.540
and then later at Olduvai and other sites

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.080
in east Africa, further
evidence for an increase

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.910
in meat consumption, including that image

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.200
in the upper right
there, of a recreation of

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.200
presumably homo erectus,
butchering a very large

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.813
animal, in that case, probably
scavenged, not hunted,

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.640
and then we have
chimpanzees, and chimpanzees

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.980
are along with bonobos, the
closest living relatives

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.980
of humans, and they eat
more meat than any other

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.680
non-human primates.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.710
So, humans eat the most
meat of all primates,

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.103
but chimpanzees are our
second by quite a distance.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.180
And when they hunt, and
succeed, when they have meat,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.410
another resemblance to
humans is that they typically

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.890
engage in meat transfers.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.140
And I use that term rather
than, they share meat,

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.840
or food sharing, because
we might want to reserve

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.830
sharing for peaceful
exchanges of meat, but meat

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.083
is not always ...

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.140
Individuals who don't
have meat don't always

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.640
get it peacefully.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.790
There, this is, there are
various categorizations

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.450
of food transfers, and this is most of one

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.590
that Andreas Jaege and Karl von Scheich

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.050
used a few years ago, in
which they distinguished,

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.883
first of all,

00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:12.830
forced transfers, that involve aggression,

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.970
so meat theft, or prey theft.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.110
And then, a transfer that
happens, but it happens

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.520
passively, which is to say
that someone possesses meat

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.920
and someone else takes
some of it peacefully,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.920
or maybe with some minor
aggression and resistance,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.310
and some degree of
tolerance, varying degrees

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:39.130
of tolerance by the possessor,
and then there's what

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.600
they called reactive transfers,
that is, someone possesses

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.600
some meat, and someone
else requests or begs

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.790
for meat, and possessor
then makes it available

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.630
by something like that,
and then there's really

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.920
true, proactive sharing,
where someone has some meat

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.920
and of its own accord, offers
it to another individual.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.270
And here, you see a sequence of an attempt

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.060
at getting a passive transfer.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.570
This is an adult male chimpanzee at Ngogo

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.000
who is in possession
of about half an adult

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.460
female red colobus monkey,
and this is an adolescent male

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.730
who is hoping to get some of that meat,

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.840
and very patiently
sitting there like this,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.670
afraid actually to try to
touch it, he did get meat

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.180
eventually, and in fact,
eventually the adult male

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.573
handed him a piece of meat.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.860
Just to complicate matters
slightly, to simplify

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.710
matters slightly, I'm
just going to talk about

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:46.670
active and passive
sharing, so active sharing

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.390
or active transfers, the
possessor actually offers

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.920
meat to someone else,
and passive transfer,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.730
someone has meat and allows someone else

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.710
to take some, but then I'll
complicate things slightly

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.770
by talking also about
what I call co-feeding,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.770
where someone clearly controls some meat,

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.460
in this case, that male
controls half a blue monkey,

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.360
here, this male controls
an adult female red colobus

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.780
monkey, and there, that
male controls this yearling

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.780
red duiker, and as long
as they have firm control,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.600
they are comfortable letting others

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.690
take what they want, so make
contact with the carcass

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.350
or with the meat package,
even feed from it

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.230
directly or tear pieces
off, so long as they don't

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.053
try to take the entire thing.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.630
There have been a number,
I should say first of all,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.260
that when it does come to the question of

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.790
why `do chimpanzees hunt,
I think as Ian explained,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.410
they hunt because meat is good food.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.520
But, because meat is
nutritionally so valuable

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.960
that then opens possibilities for meat

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.663
to take on social importance.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:03.400
It may be that actually
transfers don't have

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.280
great social importance,
even though they involve

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.490
social interaction,
because what's going on

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.620
is that someone again,
has meat, they are trying

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.640
to eat it, and someone
else is trying to get some

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.640
of it and harassing them,
and the possessor can

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.590
improve usually his foraging efficiency,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.120
his ability to use the
meat, by simply giving in

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.670
to the pressure and allowing someone else

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.200
to take some of it.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.200
Also, there are diminishing
returns to someone

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.740
who has acquired the meat and perhaps has

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.170
a large amount of it, and
has already been feeding

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.960
on it for a while, when
someone else comes along

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.950
and asks for some of it.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.010
It's also possible,
though, that meat assumes

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.840
an important role via
exchanges, either meat for meat,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.710
so if one chimp has meat
now, today, and allows

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.970
someone else to have
some or even gives some,

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.710
to that other individual, then in return,

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.230
again, usually he will be able to get meat

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.730
in the future when they don't have some,

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.400
and the recipient does.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.870
And it's also possible
that they exchange meat

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.450
for other things, notably,
grooming, between males

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:21.450
especially, and also coalitionary
support between males,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.330
and then there is this
idea that males could

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.390
exchange meat for matings with females.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.870
And in that case, transfers
are, to some extent,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.770
actually contingent.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.410
They're made selectively
to certain partners

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.640
and then received in return, selectively,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.400
from certain partners.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.540
These are not mutually
exclusive possibilities,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.050
and in fact, based on what I see at Ngogo,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.430
I would say that sometimes,
individuals get meat

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:54.270
by harassing whoever has
it, and the chimpanzee

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.960
being harassed might
try to avoid the beggar,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.610
but eventually, just gives in, allows them

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.510
to have some meat, but
that does not rule out

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.420
the possibility that they
also use meat strategically

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.343
as a kind of social tool.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:14.730
Clearly, the recipients of
meat get nutritional benefits

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.700
from obtaining it.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.610
The question here is,
do the donors benefit

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.680
from allowing others to
have some of the meat,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.870
and if it's a question of tolerated theft

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.850
or harassment, the benefit
might again simply be

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.460
that I have some meat, and by allowing

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.590
someone else to take it,
I can now utilize what

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.520
I have more efficiently,
because I don't have

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.740
to deal with the harassment, and possibly

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.600
the risk that if I don't
allow them to have it,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.323
they'll try to steal all of it.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.710
When it comes to possible social benefits,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.350
again, the various
possibilities, reciprocity,

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:58.350
in meat transfers, so pairs of individuals

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.550
showing some balance in how often each can

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.250
get meat from the other
when the other has meat,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.273
also ...

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.150
Male chimpanzees resemble
humans in that males

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.220
differ from almost all
other mammals, in that

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.070
males form very strong
social bonds with each other.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.950
And they depend on each
other, they cooperate

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.450
in various ways, they also
spend extended periods

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.470
of time grooming with
each other and grooming

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.700
provides hygienic benefits, it also can

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.240
provide other health related benefits, via

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.023
its calming effects.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.700
In addition, males
sometimes form coalitions

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.440
with each other, to back
each other up in contests

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.370
with third parties, and when they do that

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:49.090
often enough and reciprocally,
we call them allies,

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.260
so here, for example, you
see two former alpha males

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.800
at Ngogo who were each
other's allies for a long

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.550
period of time, initially,
he backed him up

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.710
when he was alpha male,
and then when things

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.080
had switched, he ...

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.088
Weya backed up Bartok,
who had replaced him

00:29:06.088 --> 00:29:08.793
with one intervening male as alpha male.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.960
So, males need social partners in contexts

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.880
other than hunts or meat
sharing opportunities,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.950
and they need partners
for grooming, or certainly

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.460
can benefit from having partners

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.220
for coalitionary support,
and all the males

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.140
of a given community are
allies with each other

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.340
against outsiders, and relations between

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.020
neighboring chimpanzee
communities are intensely hostile,

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.993
which is a topic for another talk.

00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:42.840
Not all potential partners
are equally valuable,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.060
and we could expect that
male chimpanzee psychology

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.130
has been subject to
selection for tolerance

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.710
genderally, at least towards
familiar male chimpanzees,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.420
and for higher tolerance
towards valuable partners,

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.300
and that would then provide
a basis for selectively

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.340
transferring meat to valuable partners.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.100
It might sound a little
strange to talk about

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.630
male chimpanzees as being
tolerant, but again,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.150
compared to males in other
mammals other than humans,

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.133
they are.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.290
And this is an intriguing
indication that desperately

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.040
needs replication, that
there is something going on

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.070
socially, a paper by Rohan
Wittig and colleagues

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.540
that came out a few years
ago, in which they managed

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.040
to get a small number of urine samples

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.040
following meat transfer
events, and they did

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.170
assays for oxytocin,
which is a hormone that is

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:48.150
arguably involved in social
bonding, in reducing fear,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:52.960
in potentially promoting
cooperation in various ways,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.330
and they found that
oxytocin levels were higher

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.880
after meat transfers
than in other contexts

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.480
including even when
individuals had been grooming

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.030
with each other, or
than when they had been

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.420
feeding socially, that is,
in a group with other chimps,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.140
but no transfers of food,
and the authors here

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.440
proposed that sharing
of food, and this was

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.690
not just meat, in fact, they had few cases

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.310
of meat transfers, which
is one reason why this

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.620
needs replication.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.860
But, they proposed that sharing food

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.033
can provide a basis for cooperation.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.680
Alternatively, but not
mutually exclusively,

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.820
it could be that we find
that close social partners

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.210
get food from each other relatively often,

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.530
but it's just because
they're more comfortable

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.810
with each other, so someone is more likely

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.040
to approach a meat possessor if he already

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.410
is a close social partner,
and then via harassing

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.190
the partner or tolerated
theft, gets some meat

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.070
from them.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.840
If that's the case,
though, we wouldn't expect

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.430
to see variation in begging
success as a function

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.550
of partner value, nor would
we expect similar variation

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.280
in active sharing or in the amount of meat

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.010
that beggars inquire.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.920
So, I'm going to take us
now to Ngogo for a while,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.240
and Ngogo is one of several research sites

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.100
in Kibale National Park in western Uganda,

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.473
at three of which there are
chimpanzee research projects.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.250
And in Kibale National Park,
there are seven species

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.600
of diurnal primates, not
all of them shown here,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.980
and also small forest
antelope, like red duiker,

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.370
all of the animals in this image are prey

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.070
for chimpanzees, but as
Ian told you, mostly,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.483
they prey on red colobus monkeys.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.510
And this is results of
about 2,800 some bouts

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.770
of begging, that is one
individual trying to get meat

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.410
from someone else, and in most cases,

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.210
actually succeeding, in
great majority of cases,

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.290
although there's some
interesting variation,

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.940
for example, females are
less likely to get meat

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.170
from males, who are the major
possessors, than other males

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.470
are to get meat from them, and sometimes,

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.790
a transfer is made because
someone steals meat

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.763
from someone else, so theft.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.700
What stands, and in most
cases, it's passive transfer,

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.370
so that's what's been reported
for other chimpanzee sites,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.810
but one thing that
stands out here, is that

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.820
quite a few of the transfers
are active, that is,

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.970
someone offers meat to someone
else, and they could choose

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.363
not to do that.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.700
And when I looked at the
results of all the attempts

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.830
to get meat and then put
that together with data

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.530
for a given study period
on how much grooming

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.890
the possessor got from
whoever was begging for meat,

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.440
it turned out that the
likelihood of getting meat

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.720
went up as the amount of grooming that

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.760
the possessor was receiving,
from, not at the moment,

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.370
but in general, from the beggar, went up.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.090
So, more likely to transfer meat

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.513
to main grooming partners,
than to other males.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.610
And this doesn't look so
dramatic, but I'll make

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.490
a more dramatic point in a moment.

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:28.100
Males are also more likely
to allow their allies

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.290
to have meat than they are males who

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.373
are not currently their allies.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.430
Importantly, they're more
likely to give their allies meat

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.830
than they are to give other males meat.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.310
So, this is the big difference
here, active sharing

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.690
much more common between
males who are allies

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.663
of each other, than
between males who aren't.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.340
Also, males who groom
meat possessors a lot

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.530
are more likely to get large
shares of meat from them,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.450
and a large share is a fuzzy definition,

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.903
but a small share would be a small piece

00:35:07.903 --> 00:35:11.450
of a carcass, maybe just
a small scrap of meat.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.410
A large share would be
something like an entire limb

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.350
or half an adult female
red colobus monkey,

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.200
and actually transfer of large shares

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.550
is quite common at Ngogo,
again, they go more often

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.500
to top grooming partners
than to other males

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.100
who are not top grooming
partners, and they particularly

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.793
go to allies, so again,
this difference here,

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.110
fairly close to half of
the bouts with transfers

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.720
between allies involved one
male getting a large share

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.060
of meat from the other,
and it's a considerable

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.980
amount in other bouts
also, but not so common

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.933
between males who are not allies.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.380
Back to females, and there's
a lot more to be said

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.730
about females, I'll just briefly
cover this one hypothesis,

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.360
which has been called for better or worse,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.740
meat for sex, and I don't
have time to go into

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.530
the details of the chimpanzee
mating system here,

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.550
it's quite complicated,
but most mating takes place

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.730
in situations where a female
is sexually receptive,

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.400
and is with multiple males,
and has an opportunity

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.260
to mate with most or all
of them, and it doesn't

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.260
make any difference whether a
female is sexually receptive

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.020
when it comes to the
odds that she gets meat

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.500
from males.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.590
This is new data from
Ngogo, but it substantiates

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.170
what we've already said
about Ngogo, and what

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.220
Ian and colleagues have said about Gombe.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.793
So, just to tie together
a few things here.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.750
That, I think, makes it clear that data

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.850
from chimpanzees don't support arguments

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.590
that meat provisioning
formed part of homonid

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:03.050
male mating strategies, prior
to substantial increases

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.160
in hunting and meat
consumption and real dependence

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.340
on meat consumption for subsistence.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.290
More importantly, though, I
think that chimpanzee hunting

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.060
and meat sharing, despite
all of the differences

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.340
from human, some of which,
again, we heard about

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.350
earlier today, do tell
us, and probably have

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.750
something important to tell
us about the psychology

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.480
of tolerance and
cooperation that underlies

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.243
obligatory hyper-cooperation in humans.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.523
So, thank you.

00:37:35.485 --> 00:37:38.680
(audience applauds)

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.050
- I do study chimpanzees
in a savanna, and I'd like

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.880
to tell you a little bit
more about that site,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.300
because it does have a lot of importance

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.050
as far as the chimpanzees
hunting behavior goes,

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.377
and this map, I will show you, most of

00:37:51.377 --> 00:37:54.910
the long-term chimpanzee
study sites operating

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.730
today, not all of them, but
these sites, most of them

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.770
here have been ongoing
for at least ten years,

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.160
and in some cases, and
in the case of Gombe

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.330
and Mahale, more than 50 years, and so

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.320
most of you are probably
familiar with Jane Goodall

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.230
and at least the person,
but Gombe is the site

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.660
that she helped establish
that Ian talked about.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.950
I'm across the continent,
and I'm over in West Africa,

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.230
this is my site, the Fongoli study site.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.790
And I chose this site
because it is in a savanna,

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.790
and we think that our lineage
evolutionarily speaking,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.580
evolved in this type of
habitat, and so I'll show you

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.060
some images from the site.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.960
My underlying questions
have to do with how these

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.760
chimpanzees differ from
chimpanzees living in forests,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.470
like the chimps we've heard about before

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.120
at Ngogo and Gombe, and I
will cite Jim Moore here,

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.010
he's written a lot about using chimpanzees

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.550
as what we call a referential
model, and that is

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.320
comparing them to chimpanzees living in

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.100
a forested site, and
the assumption is that

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.320
the environment will have
effects on their behavior,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.610
and I did think this going in, I had ideas

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.860
about what the differences
might be, and the chimps

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.810
kind of went their own way and showed me

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.630
a lot more differences,
including hunting and so

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.433
I'll talk to you about that today.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.040
So I'm gonna talk about
three main questions.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.070
And I focus on the types
of hunting, or aspects

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.840
of the Fongoli chimpanzees
hunting that you don't

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.260
necessarily see at
other sites, or that are

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.323
very rare.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.860
And so, one of the things that we see here

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.300
commonly is that
chimpanzees hunt with tools,

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.090
and that's something that we use to define

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.160
our own species.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.290
It has been seen literally
a handful of times

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.960
at another site, in
Tanzania, but at Fongoli,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.820
chimpanzees do this quite
frequently, so we've seen

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.040
hundreds of cases now,
and I'll talk to you

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.720
more about that.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.530
So, one of the questions
that I'll touch on is why

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.823
hunt with tools in this
particular habitat?

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.940
Something else that is not really common

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.870
at other chimpanzee
sites, is that in fact,

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.270
regarding this particular type of hunting,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.900
females are more frequently
going to be those

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.330
hunting with tools, compared
to males, and as we heard,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.780
that's just not the case, in most other

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.783
chimpanzee study sites, so
I'll talk more about that.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.380
And then to follow up, with David's talk,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.760
I will talk about meat sharing, or, I use

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.750
the word sharing, and I'll talk about how

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.230
I define that, but I'll specifically talk

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.513
about how females dole out meat.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.110
And then finally, I'll
come back to this idea

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:41.150
about using chimpanzees as
a model, and what perhaps,

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.170
the Fongoli chimpanzees
I study can help us

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.460
say or think about in
terms of the evolution

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.883
of early homonid or bipedal ape hunting.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.810
So, these are some images
from my study site,

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.620
the Fongoli study site is
one of the hottest, driest,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.030
and most vegetatively open
sites that you see today.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.090
Where chimpanzees have
actually been habituated to

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.450
human presence, so this
took us quite a long time,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.580
it took us four years, I started in 2001.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.310
And we habituated males to our presence

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:19.380
by 2005, but I wasn't able to identify

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.470
all the chimpanzees in
the group until 2006.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.880
That's when we identified all the females.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.605
This is a view of my
pretty fancy camp there.

00:41:28.605 --> 00:41:30.720
And hopefully, that gives you some idea

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.240
of the vegetation, so
it's a woodland savanna,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.630
the dominant understory is grass.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.660
Thus, savanna.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.180
But you do have a large
proportion of the habitat

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.060
as woodlands, over half of
the habitat is woodland,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.550
and only a very small
portion is forest, about

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.010
3% of the habitat is
forest, and this is where

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.610
you find your water sources.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.440
This is really the chimpanzees'
most limiting resource

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.910
at Fongoli, is water.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.770
Temperatures are incredibly
hot, really hot for me,

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.120
even hot for chimps.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.650
So right now, we're, we
have the month of March

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.130
in Senegal is almost approaching the peak

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.650
of the dry season, so
temperatures are regularly

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.370
over 100 degrees.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.670
They may get up to 115 or so.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.780
During the rainy season, or
at least at the beginning

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.790
of the rainy season, you
find some relief, because

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.760
the trees will put out
leaves again, they lose

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.130
all their trees during the dry season.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.290
You have this lag, you
have hot temperatures,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.050
and then you have this
high humidity, which

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.590
is really fun and so, literally
the heat index in June

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.820
is around 120, 125.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.058
And that's when I take students out.

00:42:36.058 --> 00:42:39.570
(audience laughs)

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:41.920
So, a little bit about
the Fongoli study group.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.300
Within this particular
habitat, they have a very large

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.310
home range, 110
kilometers, which is one of

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.140
the largest, if not the
largest so far described.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.140
The community size is relatively small,

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.600
it's not the smallest
chimpanzee community studied,

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.260
but it's on the small
size, around 35 chimps,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.210
and importantly, we have a
sex ratio that is sort of

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.970
the opposite of what
you see at other sites,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.530
so we have more males than females,

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.740
that's usually not the case.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.120
And the data that I'm
gonna talk about today

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.753
stem from 2005 through to 2017.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.270
One other thing I'll say
about adult males versus

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.870
adult females, is because of the fact that

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.810
when I first got to Fongoli, I heard that

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.410
even though chimpanzees
are not eaten at the site,

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.230
and this is not within
a national park, this

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.570
is outside of a national
park, so you do have villages

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.950
in the area, anthropogenic
or human disturbance

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.330
accounts for about 5% of the habitat.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.810
You do have chimpanzees
living alongside people,

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.930
they're not habituated to
them, they're habituated

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.400
to us, so we're okay,
but other people are not.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.350
But in rare cases, you do have people that

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.310
will try to hunt a
chimpanzee in order to get

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.310
a female's infant for the pet trade.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.350
And we had that happen
one time in 17 years,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.840
and because of that,
I focus on adult males

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.630
as my focal subjects.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.350
The Fongoli community is often
together as one large group,

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.487
so I can collect data
on females, but they are

00:44:03.487 --> 00:44:05.230
more timid when they're by themselves

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.110
and I don't try to follow them when

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.190
they're by themselves.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.650
So I think I know a lot
about what is going on

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.060
with males, and I know some about what is

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.453
going on with females,
but perhaps not as much.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.360
So this pie chart gives you
an idea of the prey species

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.120
consumed by Fongoli
chimpanzees, both by males

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.660
and by females.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.930
And as Ian pointed out,
there are no colobus monkeys

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.970
in this particular
habitat, so it is a savanna

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:35.340
woodland habitat, colobus
monkeys don't occur here,

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.160
forest guenons like red tail monkeys

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.900
or other colobus monkeys, blue monkeys,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.070
do not occur here.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.980
Instead, you have savanna
species, like baboons,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.810
patas monkeys, vervets,
you have mongooses,

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.100
bushbucks, things like this, and then

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.240
on the very lower right,
you see the adorable

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.790
little bush baby, and Ian
introduced the galago as well.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.840
The galago is actually
the main prey species

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.290
of Fongoli chimpanzees.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.980
Both males and females,
and this is the animal

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.680
that they hunt with
tools, and I'll actually

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.310
hopefully show you some video of that

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.760
and talk more about that.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.550
So, the prey profile, if
you wanna call it that,

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.940
really reflects the
savanna type of habitat,

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.150
and it does also support,
as Ian pointed out,

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.933
or talked about, what is
called a risk-averse strategy.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.590
So, I'm just gonna show you some video,

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.873
and try to narrate it here.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.160
So this is tool assisted
hunting, what this image

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.950
is gonna show you, is
an adult female that's,

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.270
if you can't tell, that's
Farafa, she's an older female,

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.310
we estimate her age to be around 40,

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:42.393
she's one of the top female
hunters in the group.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.650
So, she is trying to get at these adorable

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.950
little bush babies that
try to sleep in cavities

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.940
during the day, until this rude chimpanzee

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.400
comes with a tool.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.020
That's an adult male,
that's Jumpkin, and he goes

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.720
about it a little bit differently.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.713
(audience laughs)

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.610
And so, even though
females hunt with tools

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.170
more than expected, I'll
talk a little bit more

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.610
about that next.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.862
Males do exhibit this type
of hunting behavior as well.

00:46:14.862 --> 00:46:17.500
(audience laughs)

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.542
I have to say, he's
usually better than that.

00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:20.650
(audience laughs)

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.659
They just caught him on a bad day.

00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:25.492
(audience laughs)

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.100
We'll let Jumpkin try one more time.

00:46:43.274 --> 00:46:46.107
(audience laughs)

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.820
If you didn't guess, he wasn't successful.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.870
In this particular bout.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.081
So, we're looking at a lot of
different aspects of this ...

00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:01.010
(audience laughs)

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.563
I almost feel bad showing that.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:05.350
We're looking at a lot
of different aspects

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.410
of this particular
behavior, and so this is

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.990
a juvenile female, Vivian,
that was her mother

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:14.680
that was hunting, and the juveniles start

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.740
this behavior when they're
about two years of age,

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.850
when they're still infants, and nursing,

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.623
but they don't learn really the proper ...

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.270
Tool length and that sort of thing, until

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.620
they get to be about four, so she gets

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.273
a little frustrated too.

00:47:28.273 --> 00:47:30.340
(audience laughs)

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.593
Alright, enough fun, I guess.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:37.820
So, in terms of our results so far ...

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.040
I apologize, because
in your abstract, I put

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.500
over 500, I was sure that
we would hit the 500 mark

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.520
this year, 499, I just can't believe it.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.730
(audience laughs)

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:50.660
But we have 499 hunting
records, those aren't

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.900
all successes, and that's
including adults and immatures,

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.390
we've only seen adolescent
and adult individuals

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.110
successful in this type
of hunting behavior.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.140
Like I said, infants begin to exhibit it,

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.940
and they do really good,
as far as making the tool,

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.040
but they don't make a proper tool until

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.030
they get to be a juvenile.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.240
So, we see about 32 hunts
per year on average,

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.230
when you take into account
that there are some days

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.680
that we can't be there,
the river's too high

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.690
or someone's sick, we think
that they probably hunt

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:18.870
at least 50 times a year.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:22.210
And again, most recent
analyses suggest that females

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.010
do hunt significantly more
than expected, with tools.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.260
Even though males also hunt.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.817
And we did analyses taking
into account not only

00:48:30.817 --> 00:48:33.800
the membership and the
community as a whole,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.810
but also the membership in
so-called hunting parties,

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.833
or parties that the chimpanzees
are in on those days.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.620
So, I wanna talk a little
bit more about just

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.840
the hunters themselves, and
this is a lot of color there,

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.860
but I wanted to show
you the top ten hunters

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.414
at Fongoli, and also, the
different types of foods

00:48:53.414 --> 00:48:58.414
or prey that they hunt,
and so you have two females

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.560
that are actually among
the top ten hunters

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.960
at Fongoli.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.495
Interestingly, I think, is
that both of those females

00:49:04.495 --> 00:49:07.660
are very high ranking, so
Tumbo there is currently

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.400
our alpha female, based
on these very stylized

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.060
pant grunt records.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.170
Sorry, vocalizations,
and we keep records of

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.480
these vocalizations, where
a subordinate individual

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.060
will pant grunt to a dominant individual.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.980
And Tumbo actually overtook
that alpha position

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.163
from Farafa there.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.540
About two years ago.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:30.520
And so, females actually do
hunt some in this community,

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.520
or at least, enough to be considered among

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.330
the top ten Fongoli
hunters, and also, I'd like

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:39.000
to point out that we
have a tie right now for

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.210
the very top hunter, and
one is the alpha male,

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:42.113
that's David.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.120
He is tied for the top
hunting position with Siberut,

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.970
and some of you will be
happy to know that Siberut,

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.190
who is pictured there, is
not only the oldest hunter

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.870
in the group, he's the
oldest male, but he's

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.093
also the lowest ranking male as well.

00:49:59.033 --> 00:50:00.240
And then, if you look at
female hunting behavior

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.600
in general, females,
almost all females hunt,

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.980
and almost all males hunt
as well, so they hunt

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.820
about what you would expect,
or at least their participation

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.040
in hunting overall is
what you would expect,

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.663
based on their membership
in the Fongoli community.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.903
I wanted to talk a little
bit about Fongoli hunting ...

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.750
In the context of female
hunting across study sites,

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.740
so Ian talked about that
some, and I've used data from

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:34.050
his work and others, to look
at Fongoli female hunting,

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:37.360
and in fact, there are
females elsewhere that also

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.190
engage in quite a bit of hunting, in fact,

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.020
females at Mahale hunt a
little more than females

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.880
at Fongoli, if you look at Fongoli female

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.680
hunting behavior overall,
and then when you look

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.680
at tool use, you see that Fongoli females

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.810
do hunt quite a bit, almost
half of the tool-assisted

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.890
hunting at Fongoli is
by females, and again,

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.560
remember that we have
fewer females at Fongoli,

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.750
we don't follow females
systematically like we do males,

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.990
and so one question as
to why females hunt,

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.700
is basically as David started out with,

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.880
it, you know, it's probably no surprise

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.810
that chimps gain a lot of
nutrition from hunting,

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.420
but I think perhaps the
more interesting question

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.130
is why females don't
hunt more at other sites.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:23.070
And Ian talked about some
of these issues as well,

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.260
that I'll pursue right now.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.203
And so, if you looked
at, for example, theft.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:32.030
There's not a lot of theft at Fongoli,

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.180
so when I use the word
share, I'm referring

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.790
to basically, the last
three categories, I think,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.680
that David talked about,
so active food transfer,

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.170
but not theft.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.270
Right, and passive food
transfer, etc., so I consider

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.570
theft to be a different
category, and at Fongoli,

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.450
we have very little theft.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.440
The only theft we've seen involves

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.770
two different alpha males.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:55.500
So very little theft.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.320
Whereas at other sites,
you do have quite a bit

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.983
of theft, and so, I believe as Ian said,

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.820
females don't have incentive
to hunt at some sites

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.120
at Fongoli, there definitely is incentive,

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.860
and not only females, but
this is a little video

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.950
of, again, that lower ranking male, so out

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.940
of 13 males, he's number
13, he's the oldest male,

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.220
that's Siberut, so he's
walking by a number

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.270
of adult males with
his bush buck fawn that

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.920
he's captured, and no
one makes any attempt

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.270
to take it from him.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.800
He had actually been eating on that fawn

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.840
for over an hour and he
had a number of individuals

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.220
sitting around, basically
begging, he didn't

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.700
share with them, and as he moves off,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.830
you'll see that there's another older male

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.793
that will follow him, and
this is his ally Bandit.

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.160
Where's Bandit?

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.860
There he is.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.780
Calmly following his buddy, Siberut out,

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.900
and so, he did end up sharing with Bandit,

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.900
so not only do you see some
sort of concept of, well,

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.300
I hate to say concept of ownership,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.360
but you see tolerance, so
tolerance of possession

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:10.090
of prey by dominant males of
these low ranking individuals,

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.130
females and also lower ranking males,

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.100
so I think that at
Fongoli, you actually have

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.780
the incentive to hunt,
it's one of the reasons

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.220
that you see so much hunting, at least

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.333
tool assisted hunting, in females.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.090
I wanted to show a slightly different way,

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:27.120
so these are the same top
ten hunters, but rather than

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.320
being expressed in the number of prey that

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:32.230
they've brought in, this
is the number of kilograms,

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.750
or estimated kilograms of meat, right,

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:36.870
and so you see that David has jumped up

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:38.620
to number one position there.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.170
It depends on what you
hunt, and almost everybody

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.280
hunts bush babies,
except K.L., we've never

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.800
seen him capture a bush
baby, but what's interesting

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.470
is you see that the
third top hunter there,

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.380
at least in terms of prey
captures, Lupin has fallen

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.000
quite low, because he
does seem to specialize

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.940
on bush babies.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.770
So the females really
didn't change positions

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.300
at all, they're still in
the top ten, but you do

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.240
see a lot of variation,
so that's something that

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.860
we're looking at now,
and so, I wanted to talk

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.750
just a little bit about
what females can provide

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.913
in terms of transfer or sharing.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:18.210
And we, so far this is still preliminary

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.410
to some degree, we've looked
at sharing or food transfer

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:23.550
by females, and again,
I'm considering David's

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.860
categories of active
transfer, passive transfer,

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.400
and scrounging, but tolerated scrounging,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.280
and I'm not considering
theft in this category.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.820
Females actually shared
with other individuals,

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.730
more often, they did with their offspring,

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:41.200
so that's something we're
exploring right now.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.100
And basically, I would argue that females,

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:49.570
as Rebecca has pointed
out, should be considered

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.470
as well, and finally, I'll
just move on to my last slide,

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.110
and leave you with a couple of thoughts.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:56.650
First of all, I think Travis Pickering

00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:00.730
said it probably better than
I can, so he actually thinks

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:04.490
that if you think about
the tool assisted hunting

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.340
at Fongoli, it perhaps can tell us

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.620
more about some of the
early homonid hunting

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.540
that went on compared to
the emotionally charged

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.120
hunting of chimpanzees, as he puts it.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.950
And I'll just end up
by saying, echoing what

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.960
Rebecca has said as well
about female humans,

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.970
is that just now, and I
think Richard mentioned this

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.770
as well, we're beginning
to understand more about

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.670
female chimpanzee hunting,
and that they also

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:32.080
play a part in this scenario.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.371
So thank you very much.

00:55:34.371 --> 00:55:37.371
(audience applauds)

00:55:40.228 --> 00:55:43.728
(upbeat electronic music)
