00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.750
CAMERON COLE RAHTZ: I
wanted my prep to be better

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.830
and I wanted my
ingredients to be better.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.000
I found myself wanting to
find those ingredients.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.470
I started out as a cook.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.059
I cooked here for years.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.100
Chef would always encourage
me to kind of explore

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.580
my curiosities.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.770
And my days off, I'd spend
a lot of time in the woods.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.940
They're just so difficult
to find sometimes.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.500
They blend with the leaves.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
They blend with
the woods, which I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.180
think is what like really makes
me love searching for them.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.410
It's like a modern day, like
kind of real adult treasure

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.769
hunting.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560
There's nothing like
the feeling of finding

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.570
a beautiful mushroom.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.230
These are the Allium triquetrum,
three-cornered leeks.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.500
I think these are the
best of both worlds

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.990
because they're A, delicious;
but B, they're invasive.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.580
These have, just in
this little patch

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.790
alone, they've
spread probably 50%

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.790
at least in the last few years.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.070
And they're outcompeting all
the native species, along

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.260
with other invasives.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.320
It's really hard to serve
something like this whole.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.360
Chef really prefers
them, obviously,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360
to be small because
it kind of lends

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.290
to the restaurant's cuisine a
bit more than the larger ones.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.830
CHRISTOPHER KOSTOW:
The abalone dish

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.990
that we're doing right now,
that features the wild onions,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.364
was actually sort of something
that one of my sous-chefs,

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.405
John Hong, who's a
very talented guy,

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:58.030
he really kind of
spearheaded that dish

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.940
in a earlier form last year.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.312
What it is is it uses
Rancho Gordo beans, which

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:05.500
are these amazing dry beans;
a lot of brown butter;

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.009
abalone that's cooked first
in seaweed and then roasted;

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.590
and then the wild onions,
which are quickly roasted.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.120
I don't know that we look at
what we're doing necessarily

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.381
as a forging endeavor, per se.

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.880
Yet there is a
certain element of it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.760
that involves going out into
the woods and getting stuff.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.560
It's about building up your
larder, your physical larder,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
but also building up your
wherewithal and your knowledge.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.640
CAMERON COLE RAHTZ: Chef and I
both always saw room for a role

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.300
like this.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.570
I found myself wanting to
find those ingredients.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.600
I wanted my ingredients
to be better.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.170
