00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.369
Here is a different function and I've labelled it g of x. Functions don't have

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:10.484
to always use the letter f. We often use the letter as f, g, and h, because it's

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:15.534
the convention for algebra. So using this function, I want you to find these

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.689
outputs g of 3, g of 0, g of negative 2, and g of 4. And be careful when

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.969
squaring your input.
