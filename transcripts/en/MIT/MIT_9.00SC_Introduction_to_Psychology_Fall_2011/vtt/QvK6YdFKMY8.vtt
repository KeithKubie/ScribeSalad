00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.670
PROFESSOR: Last time, we talked
about attention and the

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.990
idea that attention has
got some properties.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.270
We're very limited in what
we can focus on.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.580
We attend to less than
we might guess in our

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.620
environment.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.730
On the other hand, there are
channels of information that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.460
sneak into us unconsciously
or with minimal attention.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.030
And experimental research has
shown us what requires our

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290
focused attention to be noticed
and what can sneak in

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.290
through pathways, things like
features in our environment.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.480
And so I want to talk to you
today about two kinds of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.690
spectacular disorders of
attention in a higher level

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.390
vision and insight they
give us into the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.600
brain basis of attention.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720
And again, the message is how
much we construct by the rules

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.110
of our mind and brain
the environment that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.940
we see around us.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.890
So we'll talk about
blindsight.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.690
That's a great name, the
paradoxical state that people

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.580
are cortically blind, but they
kind of perceive some things.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.430
So we'll talk about that.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.570
What is it?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.380
What do we know about
its brain basis?

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.430
What system of unconscious
perception

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.030
might be in our brains?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.300
In these patients, it's their
only visual system.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.640
In you and I, it's something
in us, and we don't know

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.435
exactly what it's doing relative
to our conscious

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.420
visual system.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.100
But we have the same brain
system available to us.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.780
And then neglect, what it is,
its brain basis, and how it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.330
teaches us again how we
construct the world around us

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.960
to know what space we're in
and what's around us.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.000
So a reminder, and I think you
know this well by now that the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.830
world out there is divided into
a left and right visual

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.810
field as we look for it in the
middle, that the information

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.650
from the left visual field goes
through your brain and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.539
ends up shown in the right
primary visual cortex, from

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.060
the right visual field
into your left

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.230
primary visual cortex.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.850
But there's one other pathway
we haven't talked about very

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.730
much which goes to a structure
called the superior

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.060
colliculus.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.450
It's part of your midbrain.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.510
And it's the system we think
gives rise to the possibility

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.090
of sensation without
perception.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.230
That phrase, sensation without
perception, is a good one to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.420
describe blindsight.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.070
And we'll describe
it in a moment.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.080
So from your retina, where all
vision has to go through, a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.750
little bit of information--

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.730
a small number of fibers-- go
to part of your brain that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.450
controls your pupillary
reflexes, what makes your

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.270
pupils get wider or
smaller to see.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.720
90% of the fibers coming in, the
fibers come from your eye

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.010
and go through the lateral
geniculate or through the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.890
major system that you've heard
about from Melissa that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.230
connect to your primary
visual cortex.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.760
And then, there's one other
small visual pathway from your

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.520
retina to this superior
colliculus sometimes called a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.760
tectopulvinar system.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.580
So it's a small pathway from
your eyes in terms of the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.140
number of nerve fibers.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.350
And so people said, well, can we
say what's not done by the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.090
major visual pathway that goes
from the eye to the cortex?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.130
What's done by this other
small pathway?

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.090
And one of the ways they looked
at it originally all

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.710
the way back in 1881 was to
create in dogs bilateral

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.820
occipital lesions.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.900
So now, they're cortically
blind.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.390
They're not retinally blind.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.220
They're cortically blind.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.540
It's in the cortex.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.670
And what could these
animals do?

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.540
And they were very impressed.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.140
Although these animals didn't
recognize many things, they

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.760
could steer their way around
their environment.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.330
They wouldn't bump
into things.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.360
If you had a blindfold on or
if you were retinally blind

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.250
and weren't given any
opportunity to know your

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.870
environment, you would bump
into things, right?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.530
But these animals seemed to
steer their way around things

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.510
pretty well.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.970
And they can do some other very
simple tasks even though

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.190
they ought to have been
seeing nothing.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.640
So this is a suggestion in
animals that there's something

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.910
in the brains of primates that
gives you some information

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.570
that doesn't go through
your conscious cortex.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.640
And then, a number of patient
studies in patients with

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.510
naturally occurring injuries
have really shown us, given us

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.230
a chance to experiment on them
in a human and relate them to

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.000
human experience.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.550
So here's a patient who had a
large injury, a large bleed,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.410
in the right visual cortex.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.070
So because of this, this
patient, this man was blind in

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.550
the left visual field.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.860
This field was fine.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.580
This field was blind.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.770
Cortically blind.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.770
And the way that people figure
out in what way are you blind,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.590
what parts of the world do you
see and do you not see, is

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.610
they'll put you in front
of a computer monitor.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.350
And they'll turn on lights
in various locations.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.760
And they'll create a map like
this, which shows you where

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.370
you respond when a light comes
on and where you don't see it.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.440
So your job, basically you
just look in the middle.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.520
And you say, push a button
when a light comes on.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.080
So you're waiting.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.530
And a light comes on somewhere
on the monitor.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.610
So what this picture is showing
you is that the person

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.940
could respond when the lights
came on anywhere on the left

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.110
side, but never responded, never
said a light came on on

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.660
the right side.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.780
People call this perimetry.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.070
It's a standard neurological
test of visual difficulty.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.400
Here's a person whose injury
harms only a quadrant of their

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.970
visual field.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.410
So they never respond when a
light turns on in that quarter

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.090
of the world out there.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.840
But the other three quarters,
they respond to.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.500
So that's a way of testing
what do you do.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.470
And you're not asking them
anything sophisticated, just

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.060
did a light come on.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.980
Is that OK?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.480
So for this patient,
here's the mapping.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.650
This patient was fine in
the right visual field.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.540
This is one eye.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.980
This is the other eye.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.230
And terrible--

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.990
with a few spots a little bit
better-- because lesions

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.120
occurring naturally in people
are seldom perfect lesions.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.720
But you can see that all this
area that's dark are areas

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.260
that, when a light came on in
the left visual field, this

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.580
man never responded that
anything had turned on.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.140
There's nothing simpler,
right, than a light

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.600
turning on and off.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.110
He did not experience anything
turning on in that way in the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.170
left half of the world.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.512
So they noticed as they gave
this test that even though he

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:21.490
was saying, I don't see
anything, nothing's happening,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.690
that when they flash something
in that cortically blind

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.290
field, he would move his eyes
in that direction as if

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.290
something in his mind
and brain felt

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.075
something had happened.

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:34.340
Not only something happened, but
roughly where it happened.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.480
But that information was
not available to

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.250
his conscious mind.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.280
He's never pushing a button
that he says he saw it.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.380
He always says nothing.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.740
I'm waiting for something
to come on.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.960
And if it comes on in his
good field, he responds.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.020
Does that make sense, OK?

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.860
But something seemed to do it.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.920
And when they found that it was
better than chance in the

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.510
left visual field, about things
like if they put on a

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.240
bigger patch of light.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.650
He could tell if they gave him
a short line or a long line.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.300
Now, he would never say,
I see the line.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.670
You would have to make
him make a guess.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.100
So when you read the papers,
it's something like, I don't

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.550
see anything.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.210
I don't see anything.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.370
Well, you must guess.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.540
Is it a short line
or a long line?

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.410
I don't see it.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.660
There's no basis for
me to guess.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.220
It'll be a completely
random guess.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.810
But you must guess, OK?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.190
Short or long?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.980
And then, if the lines are far
enough apart in size, he's

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.806
almost 100%--

00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.690
97% accurate.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.070
If he's forced to guess but he
never has the experience that

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.650
he sees the line, he's just
forced to guess and told that

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.700
it's two lines.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.210
Or he can judge things like,
is it a circle or a cross?

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.800
Is it an x or an o?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.060
But he can't do something like
a square versus a rectangle.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.630
It's very limited.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.710
Subjectively, he always
feels he sees nothing.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.780
If he's given two choices, for
some things he can make the

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.800
correct choice if he's forced
to make a guess.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.170
And there's other sophisticated
ways, again, to

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.210
show that even though he's
unconscious of anything in his

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.210
blind field, something in his
mind and brain is processing

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.410
information there.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.710
So here, they had a thing where
he pushed a button when

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.010
a light came on.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.500
This is his good field.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.050
And it takes him, on average,
359 milliseconds.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.080
Now, they do the same thing.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.250
This is his good field.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.690
But they put on at the
same time a light

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.320
in his blind field.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.620
And when they do that, his time
goes up by about a tenth

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.440
of a second as if the
distraction in the blind field

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.130
was slightly distracting him
from making that button press.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.370
So another objective way of
demonstrating that some

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.780
information has been processed
in the blind field even though

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.820
he never says he feels like
something's happening there.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.419
So here's one more patient, and
the last one I'll show you

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.470
of this kind, who had the
unfortunate occurrence of

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.270
having two strokes, one in the
left occipital cortex and one

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.230
in the right occipital cortex,
about 36 days apart.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.910
So now, he was blind in both
fields by the time he had had

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.820
both of his strokes.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.140
So he was a very
unlucky person.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.140
Here in the dark is
the missing cortex

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.390
that has died away.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.580
Now, always the problems with
humans is the injuries are not

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.430
controlled and precise.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.550
And so here's two examples, one
in monkeys, an incredibly

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.110
clever experiment to get a
monkey to tell you what he or

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.380
she is thinking about.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.550
And then, one with infants
as well, human infants.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.600
And how do you get a monkey
to talk to you about their

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.900
subjective experience?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.230
The striking thing about
blindside is the person's

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.110
saying, I see nothing.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.670
I see nothing.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.210
I see nothing, even as he walks
past obstacles with

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.600
precision and carefulness.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.025
So here, what it is, they took
monkeys and made unilateral

00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:44.060
lesions in them.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.090
There's a control monkey and
three where they surgically

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.290
removed, as precisely as they
could, the left occipital

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.510
visual cortex and the corpus
callosum that connects the

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.050
left and the right.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.620
And the first task-- and I'll
show you in a moment-- was to

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.470
touch a light when
it comes on.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.730
And the second half is the
clever design to get the

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.810
monkey to tell you what
he or she subjectively

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.550
feels is going on.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.370
So here's the video they would
make of the monkey.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.790
And in one case, here's
the light coming on.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.030
So the monkeys had
left removal.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.140
So this is the blind side.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.310
These bars show you how often
they point correctly to a

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.520
light going on.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.060
And under this circumstance,
forced to point, forced to

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.850
point, here's the
control animal.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.420
And you can see that the animals
who are blind in this

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.190
field do almost perfectly.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.950
When they're forced to point,
they pick almost perfectly

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.020
which stimulus comes on
in the blind field.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.205
Now, they add one more thing
to the experiment.

00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:49.380
They have a number of lights
on the good side.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.370
Here is a response that they
can push to signal "I saw

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.540
nothing." And if they truly
saw nothing, they get the

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.250
juice reward for which
they're working for.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.912
But there's a light that can
come on here in their bad

00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:04.290
field on their right side.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.800
Now, what happens?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.570
Here's the control monkey doing
perfectly well for the

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.410
lights on this side, lights on
this side, and when nothing is

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.400
happening pushing this
bar to signal

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.450
that nothing is happening.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.570
Sometimes, no light comes on.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.330
So now, the monkeys will have
to say, "I see nothing," by

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.830
pushing this big panel up
here if nothing seems

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.230
to have turned on.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.660
But look what happens to the
monkeys with the cortical

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.230
lesions on the left.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.230
When this light comes on, they
almost never say they saw it.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.070
They almost always push,
"I saw nothing."

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.240
When they're allowed to say "I
saw nothing" by the response,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.590
then even though this thing that
you know they can see--

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.330
because you see here
they're responding

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.630
perfectly well over here--

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.040
but when allowed to consciously
respond what they

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.240
see, then these black bars
are all the way down.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.590
They almost never indicate
they saw something.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.950
They almost always pick the
response, "I saw nothing." So

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.380
the monkey is telling you what
his subjective experience is,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.870
which is like the humans with
the cortical lesions.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.930
They're reporting they see
nothing, even though some part

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.750
of their brain can pick it up.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.640
How about in humans?

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.550
So sometimes humans, children,
infants, for medical reasons

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.580
have to have hemispherectomies
in the first year.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.050
These are unfortunate infants
who have severe brain

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.160
injuries, severe epilepsy.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.540
And it's considered better to
help them by removing an

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.670
entire hemisphere than to let
them have the severity of the

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.870
epilepsy they were having.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.820
These are rare cases in very
unfortunate infants.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.950
And in these infants who got
this for purely medical

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.150
reasons to make their lives
better, they also did an

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.100
experiment to show you something
not only about, I

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.930
think, again, what happens in
our conscious visual system,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.940
but also how that system grows
in infancy and the growth of a

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.780
conscious cortical
visual system.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.510
So here's what they did.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.960
Infants this young-- because
they're in their first year--

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.880
can't even point and you can't
tell them to point.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.990
So again, you have to be
clever experimentally.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.360
And what they did is they
watched where their eyes moved

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.600
and recorded that information.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.420
And that was the behavior.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.550
Sometimes, they would
have a fixation.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.630
They've always had a fixation.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.870
You're looking in the middle.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.070
And then, something would come
on out of side or this side,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.420
in the blind field or
in the intact field.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.080
And they would see how often
would their eyes move to a

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.420
stimulus in their good
field, which they

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.550
expected all the time.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.560
But how often would it move to
the stimulus in the blind

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.280
field, the eye movement?

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.180
Then, they had a competition
condition where you have a dot

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.010
in the middle.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.350
And that fixation dot would stay
on while a box appeared

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.720
here or here.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.500
So the only sense--

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.920
the only difference between
these two is there's a dot in

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.120
the middle that can compete
for what you look at.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.420
OK?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.250
It's not a big competition.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.160
It's just a boring dot
that stays on.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.950
But there's a big consequence.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.020
So here's how often they moved
their eyes to the target in

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.610
the non-competition condition.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.620
The dot goes on.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.400
It goes off.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.640
And the box comes on in your
good field or your bad field.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.720
And all these bars are
up at the top.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.795
And practically every trial, at
eight weeks, 10 weeks, and

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:11.540
12 weeks of age, the infant
moves his or her eyes to the

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.980
stimulus whether it's in the
blind field or the good field.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.370
So something in their mind and
brain is letting them identify

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.150
something and moves their eyes
to the good field, much like

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.100
we talked about before
for the adults.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.100
Now, in the competition
condition, you can already see

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.060
it's not quite the same.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.130
If there's a dot on and the
box comes on their blind

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.050
field, they don't always
make it to the box.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.540
That dot is capturing their
conscious cortical attention

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.810
and diminishing the likelihood
they notice the box coming on

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.240
in the blind field.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.810
And as the weeks pass from
eight to 10 to 12, just a

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.270
month of development,
look what happens.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:51.530
This bar goes from a little
lower, a lot lower, near zero.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.060
That is, from eight to 12 weeks,
what it looks like is

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.370
happening is that as the
cortical system matures and

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:04.420
the infant's consciousness is
growing in some sense, now

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.920
it's no longer tending to
process the information in the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.470
blind field if there's
competition.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:15.130
Because the growth of that
consciousness in the cortex is

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.730
suppressing the ability of the
infant to communicate with

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.480
unconscious systems or be guided
by unconscious systems

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.730
in the brain.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.370
So the cool thing is the
implication of this, is all of

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.740
us have this collicular
system in us.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.480
It's a visual system
that's been around

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.600
long through evolution.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.495
All of us have this massive
conscious geniculate, the one

00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:41.270
that goes into your
cortex system.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.430
And that dominates this
other system.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.100
And so we only see it
revealed in these

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.560
patients as guiding behavior.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.970
But who knows what it
really does in us?

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.760
Because it's quietly
sitting there.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.460
We don't have conscious
access to it.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.140
And who knows how much it's
guiding our behavior?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.350
And it's very hard to
figure that out.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.080
But it's definitely disappearing
from our

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.160
conscious life within the first
couple months of our

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.430
development.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.240
So now, I'm going to switch to
the second major disorder

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.010
we'll talk about, attention and
neglect, and go through

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.230
anosagnosia, a spectacular
version of that disorder,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.100
something about how it's
behaviorally measured, its

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.170
brain basis, and then
a few more analyses.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.570
But in the book, there's
a very nice

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.730
chapter about these patients.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.620
Now, patients with blindsight
are extremely rare.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.800
You have to have exactly the
right kind of injury to damage

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.160
a lot of your occipital
cortex.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.350
And those kinds of injuries
rarely occur on that scale.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.100
Attention and neglect, what I'm
about to describe to you,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.740
if any of you become physicians
or work in hospital

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.250
settings, you are guaranteed
to see this a lot.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.780
A lot-- it's very, very common
for patients who've had things

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.380
like stroke or brain injuries
of some kind or another.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.890
And a pretty typical example
is from Oliver Sacks.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.630
Most of the Sacks cases are
pretty rare, prosopagnosia,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.690
pretty rare.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.310
Neglect?

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.950
Incredibly common in
the hospital ward,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.400
in neurology service.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.455
So here, he talks about a woman,
an intelligent woman in

00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:15.119
her 60s, massive stroke
affecting deep or inner back

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.380
portions of her right cerebral
hemisphere, good

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.740
intelligence and humor.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.010
And what happens to her when
they bring her her dessert or

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.700
coffee on her tray
in the hospital?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, she complains
that she's not getting enough

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.320
food because she's only
eating food on the

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.810
right half of her plate.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.680
The left half of the plate,
it's as if it

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.960
weren't present for her.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.540
When they say, "But Mrs. S.,
it is right there on the

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.530
left," she seems not to
understand what they say and

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.580
does not look to the left.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.640
If her head is gently turned
so the dessert comes into

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.140
sight in the preserved right
half of her field, she says,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.030
"Oh, there it is!

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.720
It wasn't there before."

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.130
You understand?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.450
It's as if the left half of
the plate did not exist.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.740
And if they swivel her head and
now that left half of her

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.790
plate is in her right field,
now she goes, oh my gosh!

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.400
Who snuck that on my plate?

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.170
Now I can finish my meal.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.090
And it's not just that.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.350
She also only puts on makeup
on half her face looking in

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.180
the mirror, which can lead
to comical impressions.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.330
So she ignores the left
half of her world.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.660
And it's not just that
it isn't there.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.990
It's as if it couldn't
be there.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.180
It's as if, what are you talking
about there's a left

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.090
half of something?

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.540
I see everything.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.250
So we'll talk a little about
this and understand more

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.280
of it coming up.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.480
So neglect means a failure to
respond or report to something

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.540
that's opposite to the lesion--
contralateral means

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.910
opposite to the lesion--

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.420
that can't be accounted
for by simple things.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.010
These patients don't have
primary visual problems.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.980
They understand language.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.180
They're paying attention.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.930
They're the ones who deny the
left half of their body.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.900
They dress on one side.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.130
They eat from one side
of the plate.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.100
And they also have something
that I'll show you in a

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.400
moment, the example because it
comes back a couple times.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.360
And it sounds fancy,
but it's simple.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.060
There's extinction to double
simultaneous stimulation seen

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.740
in the late stages.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.190
So here's what the neurologist
does-- and you'll see at least

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.590
one neurologist doing this in
a film clip coming up-- and

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.650
they do this all the time
in the hospital.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.930
They'll wiggle their fingers.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.800
They'll try to get it in the
middle of the patient.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.515
This isn't carefully controlled,
but it's done on

00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:16.360
the bedside.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.570
They'll wiggle one side
and say, do you

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.580
see anything moving?

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.690
Or the other side, and sometimes
they wiggle both.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.570
And the typical response
in neglect is already

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.600
fascinating.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.920
So past the early stages of the
disorder, they'll notice

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.790
the thing on the left side.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.440
From their perspective, that's
their neglected side.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.700
They'll notice it on
the right side.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.650
That's their good side.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.420
They're noticing this
finger wiggling.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.550
They're noticing that
finger wiggling.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.800
But when the physician wiggles
both fingers at the same time,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.490
then the patient will
only notice the

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.680
one on the good side.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.170
It's as if this is extinguished
because this one

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.850
grabs your attention.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.540
And you know they can
see it by itself.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.070
So it's only when it's both
sides that it's extinguished.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.950
And we'll come back to that.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.640
It's interesting.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.260
It's not that their
mind can't see.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.585
But when there's competition
in the two fields-- which

00:20:04.585 --> 00:20:05.980
reminds me a little bit
of blindsight --

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.120
then their mind can't see it.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.930
So a strong, a fascinating and
rarer piece of this, but again

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.810
not very rare, is something
called anosagnosia where they

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.140
not only have the neglect that
I just described, but they

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.700
deny any problem at all.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.200
So typically, the patient has a
big, right lesions, about 5%

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.720
of neglect cases.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.460
And a very fascinating
neuroscientist, you may have

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.170
read some of his stuff.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:40.330
He's a very creative mind,
Ramachandran at UCSD, did some

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.110
semi-experiments with some
of these patients.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.590
So these are patients with
right sided lesions.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.220
It says they have weakness or
non-use of their left hand.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.670
And so here's his dialogue
with them.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.850
Can you use your right hand?

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.260
And that patient's
hand is fine.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.100
Yes.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.230
Can use your left hand?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.930
Yes.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.870
The patient can't use
her left hand.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.900
Are your hands equally strong?

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.940
Yes.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.360
Can you point to my nose
with your right hand?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.860
And she does.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.200
Her right hand is fine.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.050
Can you point to my nose
with your left hand?

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.480
The paralyzed left hand-- it's
the left hand because it's a

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.870
right hemisphere stroke--

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.850
does not move at all.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.310
Are you pointing to my nose?

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.010
Yes.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.950
Can clearly see it pointing?

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.670
Yes, it's about two inches
from your nose.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.350
Can you clap?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.270
Of course I can clap.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.925
And here's what she does.

00:21:25.925 --> 00:21:26.960
Are you clapping?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.520
Yes, I'm clapping.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.680
She can't move her left side.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.710
But in every way in this
patient's reports, she seems

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.680
to deny in a deep sense that
there's any problem in her

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.910
performance or any weakness
of any kind.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:45.370
So he wanted to do a couple
little experiments to show

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:51.120
that it's not just that they're
saying, but they'll

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.820
follow all the way through.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.540
So imagine that you had
injured your left

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.900
arm, was in a cast.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.930
And somebody asked you, I'm
going to give you two choices.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.480
I'm going to give you $5 to
screw in a light bulb--

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.340
your left arm is
in a cast now--

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.400
or $10 to tie your shoe laces.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.080
Which would you take?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:09.740
The light bulb, right?

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.360
Because it's going to be hard
to tie your shoe laces with

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.770
one arm out of action.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.970
This person is the same way.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.730
She's had a stroke.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.160
Her left arm's not
functioning.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.060
She should definitely
take the light bulb.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.480
She takes the shoe laces.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.710
When the physician,
Ramachandran, describes as she

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.300
sits there with one hand trying
to flop the laces

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.320
together making no progress at
all, he says finally he has to

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.550
end the exercise.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.710
He can't take it anymore.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.380
She'll just keep going until--

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.815
So she just doesn't process
that her left side of her

00:22:41.815 --> 00:22:42.970
body's not working.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.130
And then, he does another
experiment more impressive.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.060
I can use one of
these, I think.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.870
So imagine this was a tray of
cocktail glasses full of

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.670
water, let's say to
the very brim.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.190
Imagine there's three here
and three-- six things.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.410
You can see they're
right at the top.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.350
And you're just hoping that the
person bringing it to you

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.770
doesn't spill it on you.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.320
And the person brings it over
to you, actually filled with

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.110
water and asks a patient
to hold the tray.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.580
OK, can I pick on you
for one second?

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.830
Imagine you had only--

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.250
how would you hold the
tray if one arm was

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.912
unavailable for you?

00:23:19.912 --> 00:23:22.270
OK, I'm bringing this over.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.810
You have to watch,
very exciting.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.640
There's water.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.760
Yes, OK.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.690
How would you had if two hands
were available to you?

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.300
OK, thank you.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:29.640
OK, right?

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.660
That's easy for you to imagine
how you would hold it.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.390
They walk over to the patient
with all this stuff.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.030
They hand it to her.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.120
And what does the patient do?

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.840
She puts out her right hand
on the right side.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.590
And the whole thing
falls over.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.760
They're trying to demonstrate
it goes all the way through.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.200
This person really believes
there's not a problem.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.610
And they can be doused in water
for a moment-- and I'm

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.220
sure dried appropriately--

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.030
and still deny there's
any problem at all.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.100
Now, one thing they can do--
and this is a weird line of

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.760
research, but there's a number
of papers that show this.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.580
And I'm not recommending you
do this at home because

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.290
actually, it's worse
than it sounds.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.750
They take a syringe with cold
water, and they put it into

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.510
the left ear, the
image is here.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.650
The patient's eye
starts to move.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.020
They get a nystagmus.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.370
And they ask them
how they feel.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.790
And then she says, my
ear is very cold.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.040
But other than that, I'm fine.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.070
But they've given her
a little bit of a

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.110
shock in the left ear.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.220
And now, he does the interesting
experiment.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.700
Do you feel OK?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.940
She says her ear is cold.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.180
Can you use your hands?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.020
At this moment when they've done
something in the left ear

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.250
that wakes up the opposite
right hemisphere.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.405
I can use my right arm,
but not my left arm.

00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:41.310
I want to move it, but
it doesn't move.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.370
This happens just in a
moment from the cold

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.660
syringe in her ear.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.690
Whose arm is this? holding
up the paralyzed arm.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.900
It's mine, of course.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.730
Can you use it?

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.330
No, it's paralyzed-- like, what
kind of doctor do I have?

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.330
It's paralyzed, of course.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.360
Now, here's something
really fun in a

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.290
Sherlock Holmesian sense.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.705
How long has your arm
been paralyzed?

00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:00.030
Did it start just now?

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.620
Because what he's asking is,
does she have a memory

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.810
somewhere in her mind of her
entire experience, or does she

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.040
say it just started right now?

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.910
I don't know how
this happened.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.680
It's just not working.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.350
And she says, it's been
paralyzed for

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.250
several days now.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.500
About 90 minutes later when they
redo this, she's back to

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.880
just how she was.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.100
So they can temporarily
alleviate this by this

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.130
irrigation to the ear.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.730
So this denial of the left half
of your body, this denial

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.240
that you have any disorder
whatsoever is a

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.280
very striking thing.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.140
In most patients,
it clears up.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.080
You saw pictures of
it from Melissa.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.600
You saw movies of patients
with object disorders.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.800
Those don't clear up.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.580
Balint's syndrome, spatial
disorders--

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.820
those don't clear up.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.280
Anosagnosia patients
grow out of it.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.750
Somehow, their brains
recover over time.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.500
But again, it shows you
how much attention is

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.370
constructed, right?

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.210
Because they have the
stuff to represent

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.690
their arm, their disease.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.870
That's all in their
mind and brain.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.940
But the state they're in because
of the brain injury

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.790
lets them not construct
that reality.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.390
So now, I'm going to show
you measures of neglect.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.100
This is in your list just for
your notes, but sort of fun

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.330
just to look at the examples.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.940
So here's a patient.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.910
With these patients, they
typically have right sided

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.430
lesions, so the neglect is to
the left half of the world.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.610
And here's a patient going to
the bathroom as if all you can

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.600
do is make right turns instead
of going this way, as if the

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.430
world weren't there, to
proceed on the left.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.240
Here's another test
that happens

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.020
every day in a hospital.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.270
The physician has drawn
these lines and says,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.700
cross out the lines.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.680
It's not perfect.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.510
The patient does that one.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.500
But look, they cross out
all these lines.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.530
And the left half ones are
mostly left uncrossed.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.380
It's as if they weren't there.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.060
Here's what's called a
cancellation test.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.010
There's lots of letters here.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.640
And their job is to cross
out all the A's.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.200
Now, let me start
with neglect.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.980
You see over here,
this whole area?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.430
Nothing is circled
or crossed out.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.760
And you could say, well, what
would happen if instead of

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.970
neglect, you were like one of
those blindsight patients who

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.740
had a big lesion in the
cortex and you were

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.460
blind on one side?

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.750
What would you do there?

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.660
Well, it's easy for those
patients because what they do

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.480
is they don't see part
of the world.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.860
But what do they do?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.180
They turn their head, just
like you would do.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.190
They turn their head.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.370
They don't see it, but they
know they don't see it.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.870
And they turn their head.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.790
And a patient who's blind on one
side, loss in the visual

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.200
field, gets all the lines
because all you have to do if

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.050
you're blind on one side
is turn your head.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.100
It's not that hard in
a practical sense.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.110
But if you don't imagine the
left half of the world exists,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.540
where would you turn
your head to?

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.620
And that's what these neglect
patients do, don't imagine the

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.640
left half of the world exists.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.270
So here's an example of a
patient reading a text.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.690
They're handed this text.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.710
The slash lines here are where
this patient seems to think

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.790
the left side of
the page stops.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.360
OK So they're overcoming
everything they know about how

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.600
a sentence should be and
reading this passage.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.410
The patient says, "had to pass
the windows whom good morning

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.560
message for the ground his with
all his and he bottle."

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.940
Thank you very much.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.985
It's right in front of them, but
the left half of the page

00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:12.110
is just not present for
this person's mind.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.550
Here is a person copying
a flower.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.170
A psychologist or a neurologist
draws this flower

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.890
or has a flower ready to go,
a drawing, and says copy

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.230
everything you see.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.790
And it's not always totally
perfect exactly how it works.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.240
But you can see there's a lot
of the left side of this

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.810
flower missing--

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.390
right in front of them.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.690
Here's a very simple one, too.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.680
Copy everything you see here.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.930
And what they see is these
three things up here.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.010
Their job's to copy everything
down here.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.810
They have all the
time they want.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.870
Left side is neglected.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.170
And all they copy
is the triangle.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.470
That's all they draw.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.850
And the tester will always
say, are you done?

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.800
Are you sure you're done?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.730
The person says, I'm
sure I'm done.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.580
Thank you very much.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.180
Sometimes, they do something
remarkable.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.410
They're shown a scene
like this.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.400
Here's four trees with a
house in the middle.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.740
And you can see this patient
starts over here.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.120
They say, oh, there's a
tree over, draws this.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.280
There's a house over here.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.990
And they jump from location
to location.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.230
Every time their attention
lands, they draw the right

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.060
half of it.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.910
It's always as if the
left were missing.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:16.290
And again, this idea of how
constructed this is.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.250
Here's two more examples.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.430
And the clock thing, we'll
talk a fair bit about.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.670
Here's a patient writing
to dictation.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.890
The first sentence, they
sort of stay--

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.450
but now, it's as if they
were running out

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.110
of room on the page.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.580
It's like they're reading,
but it's writing.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.680
The left half of the
page doesn't exist.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.530
Clocks are used a lot in this
land, because it's kind of

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:31.010
impressive.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.470
And we'll come back in a couple
different versions

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.850
about this.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.970
But look at that.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.620
They were asked to draw
the time on a clock.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.950
And it's as if they could draw
the time on the right side,

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:40.910
their good side.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.620
But it's as if the left half
of the clock didn't exist.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.180
Here's another patient asked
to draw the time.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:53.720
And you see almost what seems
like a struggle in the

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.320
patient, right?

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.010
They start on the right side.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.640
And then here, they're
running out of space.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.030
They've got to cram
in that 10.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.190
Their mind knows it
goes to 12, right?

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.580
But there's no space
to put it in.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.310
And so you put them, in a sense,
in a sense of conflict.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.640
And that's the top version.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.680
The bottom, they were given
numbers one at a time.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.370
They were given, it tells
you here, 12 and 6.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.000
So they put those in
the right spots.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.990
Here comes 11.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.360
Already, 11 is like,
uh-oh, right?

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.790
And then, they get 4, 9.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.210
9 is not going to make it.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.530
And 10, they know it has to come
after-- you can see that

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.990
they put them actually in a
struggle between what they

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.520
know, something about where the
numbers ought to go, but

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.130
the impossibility of the
left half existing.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.630
Now, here's something-- and
we'll come back to this in a

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.960
few minutes--

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.770
what happens if you just give
them a piece of paper and say,

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.770
write down 1 o'clock.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.160
And then, you take that
piece of paper away.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.910
Write down 2 o'clock.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.190
Take that piece of paper away.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.550
Then look--

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.210
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, those
are not bad, right?

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.770
If they just do one of them, the
very same patient who had

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.690
to crowd everything on the right
is quite comfortable in

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.160
putting down a pretty good
9, 10, and 11 if

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.830
it's just one of them.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.040
We'll come back in a little bit
to experiments that help

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.990
understand what's going on this
case because we don't

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.010
only want a scientist
to say, wow, this is

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.460
unbelievable and amazing.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.810
We like to say something more
about how the mind is doing

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.600
this and what part of their
brain is important.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.110
And kind of impressively, here's
a patient with eyes

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.080
open mostly crowding
on the right.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.640
Got the 10 on the left, but
doing a better job when their

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.310
eyes are closed.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.610
They missed the dial
altogether.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.880
Their eyes are closed.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.120
But they actually do it--
the same patient

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.250
does a better job.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.300
OK, so how does that work?

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.230
And one more thing to mention is
that neglect occurs across

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.790
modalities.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.840
That is, when these patients
have neglect, I

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.390
focused on the visual.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.710
But these patients also don't do
very well if they're doing

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.100
things like reaching
for things.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.210
It's not just vision.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.690
It's pretty much everything in
the left half of the world.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.400
And you can do these kinds of
things which, again, show not

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.090
only their neglect but the
constructed psychological

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.460
nature of the neglect.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.710
It varies in ways that
are interesting.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.690
So they're given a line
like this and say

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.860
mark the exact middle.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.210
You would draw something here.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.240
They draw here because they're
going to neglect

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.660
that part of the line.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.300
Then, they say read the A.
So they draw the person's

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.796
attention to A. And now draw
it, and they get better.

00:32:14.796 --> 00:32:17.370
Then, they're asked to
mark the middle.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.420
Not too good.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.030
Mark the middle-- but you
see the difference here.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.120
The A is present or
the B is present.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.210
And if the B is present, it
pulls them over here.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.510
If the A is present, it pulls
their attention over here.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.770
They put their hand at
the middle and say.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.940
Now, please mark the middle.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.600
Their hand goes over here
for the middle.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.635
But if they start them all the
way over here, their hand will

00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:35.300
only go this far.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.360
So as you see, all these
different movements are

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.340
telling you that the mind
is interpreting what the

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.570
world is out there.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.650
If you pull a little bit the
person to the left, they'll

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.930
notice a little bit
more of the left.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.180
Where is the injury?

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.220
So almost everywhere you read
still in neurology books to

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.980
this day that it's in
the parietal cortex.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.630
But in the last few years,
people have mostly come to

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.760
this idea that the damage
tends to be in

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.450
the temporal lobe.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.720
And what happens when the
temporal lobe is injured, it

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.910
knocks of the balance of
attention in the left and

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.680
right parietal cortex.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.610
And there's something about
the activity in the right

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.250
parietal cortex goes way down.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.620
That's paying attention to the
left half of the world.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.990
And as patients recover from
this, the balance comes back.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.260
And that's actually been
measured now by brain imaging.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.700
Their attention comes back
clinically, and it does in

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.260
most patients.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.980
Then, the balance between the
two parietal cortices get

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.680
reestablished.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.690
So even though people thought
the site of damage was here,

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.830
the interpretation's usually
here in the temporal lobe.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.160
But the consequence of that is
reduced activity in this part

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.010
of the brain, even if it's
not physically injured.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.240
The fantastic thing is--

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.200
think about this for a second--
in order to ignore

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.030
the left half of the flower, the
left half of a design, the

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.230
left half of a page, the left
half of a clock, what do you

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.680
have to know?

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.910
Where the left and right are.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.440
It's not as if his
eyes were closed.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.120
If your eyes were closed, you
wouldn't know where left and

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.810
right are on a page, right?

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.980
He has to represent in his mind
what is left and right

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.639
reasonably accurately.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.739
And then, he extinguishes
awareness that anything in the

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.940
left could exist.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.120
But part of his mind has to know
what is left for that to

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.780
work, right?

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.219
Otherwise, the digits would be
all over the piece of paper,

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.555
not even on the paper.

00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:30.139
He centers on the paper.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.179
He centers on the circle.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.790
Centering means I know
what's left.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.070
I know what's the center.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.610
And then boom, the left
disappears as a place that

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.060
could exist.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.179
So these are all tasks
in front of you.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:45.449
There's been some incredibly
Sherlock Holmes like clever

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:50.900
experiments asking whether you
also neglect your imagination.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.940
Not what's in front of you,
but your imagination.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.469
So here's the way they did it.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:57.640
Have any of you been in Milan?

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.310
There's a central cathedral
in part of town.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.560
It's a big deal.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.090
So they took Milanese patients,
people who lived in

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.110
Milan their whole lives who
had strokes in the right

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.920
hemisphere who had neglect, and
they asked them to imagine

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.130
the Piazza del Duomo, the major
church there, looking at

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.980
it from one side of the square
or from entering from the

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.160
opposite side of the square.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.370
And I'll show you the
other experiment.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.340
Here's the idea.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.050
They said imagine that you're
entering the square this

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.730
direction so that the church
is behind you, or this

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.490
direction so that the church
is in front of you.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.560
So you're entering the square
from one side or from the

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.090
other side.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.700
Now, the square that you've been
too many times, that you

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.260
know very well, tell me
everything that's in the

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.640
square as you imagine entering
from one side.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.040
And here's what the
patient reports.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.150
They're imagining coming
out facing the church.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:50.650
And they report these kinds
of things from this side.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.990
If that's only on the
right side, they're

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.740
ignoring the thing.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.890
So they say there's a cafe.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.920
There's a bookstore or whatever
else there is here.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.540
That's everything that's
in the square.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.450
Everything that's in the
square is shown in red?

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.200
Everything that's
in the square.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.540
They wait just moments.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.950
And they say, now imagine
instead you were coming out

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.520
from the church, opposite
view of the square.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.950
Tell me everything that's
in the square.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.240
And here's what they tell you.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.250
The items that are in blue--
and they don't tell you the

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.580
items they just told you, the
locations they've just told

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.900
you circled in red.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.680
So they're sitting their
imagining their square.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.190
And then, they will ignore
everything on the left,

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.050
whatever's their subject
of left.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.140
And you know they know it
because all they have to do is

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.000
imagine they're on the opposite
side of the square,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.370
and then they report.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.090
Does that make sense?

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.450
They're ignoring the left half
of what they imagine the

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.860
square looks like when they've
been to it many times.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.400
And here's another patient doing
exactly the same thing.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.770
Imagine you're coming
out of the church.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.700
What's in the square?

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.760
Well, here's some specific
places I know.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.240
That's it?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.450
That's it.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.620
Wait a minute.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.550
Imagine you come this way into
the square facing the church.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.350
What's everything
in the square?

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.020
And they only report the
things on this side.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.870
So they're ignoring-- yeah?

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:07.230
AUDIENCE: Does the patient
realize after a few seconds?

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.260
PROFESSOR: No, they never do.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.510
It's an excellent question.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.530
They just answered a moment
ago one side, right?

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.230
Why don't they tell you, I just
told you the stuff on the

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.010
other side?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.100
Because it's as if it
couldn't exist.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.930
It's a little bit analogous
to the patient

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.390
whose arm isn't moving.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.010
And you go, do you
have any problem?

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.690
And they go, no, I don't
have any problem.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.020
It's as if there couldn't
be a problem.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.630
What are you talking
about, right?

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.000
So it overcomes all their
knowledge and all their

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.120
intelligence.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.140
It's as if I forced you to guess
in detail what's in the

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.200
back of the room if something
new was there.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.310
And you go, there's no way.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:41.860
I can't see.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.180
I have no eyes in the
back of my head.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.030
It's sort of like that.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.120
It's as if the left half
couldn't exist.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.590
The contradiction they
could note--

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.430
just a moment ago I told you
the other one-- they don't

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:56.000
notice it because something
about this neglect swallows up

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.350
all of your judgment.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.110
It's beautifully phrased by some
neurologist as, it's as

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.840
if the left half could
not exist.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.990
Whenever you're thinking
left, it doesn't exist.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.650
And ironically, you have to
think left for that to work.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.510
That's the amazing thing.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.410
You have to go, I'm
in the middle.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:13.970
There's a left.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:14.520
There's a right.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.630
Now, the left doesn't exist.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.000
And it couldn't exist.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.320
And every hint I get that it
does exist, like there's food

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.995
on that side or the pages
usually go all the way here

00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:28.110
and makes the sentences make
sense, it all disappears on

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.200
you because it couldn't
possibly exist.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.700
And the neat thing about
that is it's striking

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.380
neurologically.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.810
But that means in our own heads
as we go around, we're

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.330
constructing the world this way,
building up two separate

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:42.230
sides of our brain that are
gluing together a picture of

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.560
the world around us.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.620
And these patients lose
that glue on one

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.370
side of their brain.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.410
Is that OK?

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.160
Here's another version.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.800
It's less flashy, but
it's the same idea.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.120
Now, neglect can't
get small enough.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.650
If you make something
very tiny, then you

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.810
don't ignore the left.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.700
Once it gets tiny enough,
you can't do it.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.690
So they took advantage
of that.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.680
And they show cloud like
stimulus of these.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.350
But they didn't show
them like this.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.880
They only had a slit.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.090
So you only saw the cloud
a bit at a time.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.650
And you see one cloud, and then
you see another cloud.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.870
Perhaps you'd see this cloud
go by, and you see

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:15.720
this cloud go by.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.580
And your job was to say were
they identical clouds or not?

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.550
And if they were not identical,
on which side do

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.210
they differ?

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.340
So because of all your visual
experiences through the slit--

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.850
which is too small for
neglect to happen--

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.380
what you do is you create in
your mind's eye what does that

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.720
whole cloud look like as it
passed through the slit in

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.990
your mind's eye?

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.210
And then, you see another one.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.690
And you put that up in
your mind's eye.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.410
And you compare these two
things that are in your

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.510
imagination in your
mind's eyes.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.280
And what happens is if these two
things differ on the left

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.830
side, the patients rarely can
make that distinction.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.260
It's not because they
can't see it.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.110
It's always in that
narrow slit.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.620
But once they put the pieces
together, they put it up in

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.580
their mind, the left half
disappears on them in their

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.420
mind's eyes.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.060
So here's an experimental
approach to think about what

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.660
might be going wrong
in these patients.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.250
So they used a very simple task,
which is when a light

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.520
comes on, you push a button.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.740
That's all the task is.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.030
Any light comes on,
you push a button.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.440
And sometimes, they'll
put an arrow.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.700
And sometimes, you have
no information.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.740
The light comes on on the
left or the right.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.910
And sometimes, they'll put on
an arrow in the middle that

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.445
will warn you whether the light
is likely to come on in

00:40:31.445 --> 00:40:33.230
the left or the right.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.800
So sometimes, you have
neutral things.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.970
You get a cross in the middle.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.220
Then, a light comes on.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.030
You don't have to say
left and right.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.820
You just push a button when
one of those goes on.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.250
Sometimes, he gets an error
that's called valid that, 80%

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.002
of the time if it's pointing
this way, it will turn out on

00:40:45.002 --> 00:40:47.150
that side, 80% it will
turn on this side.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.970
So 80% of the time,
it's honest.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.170
And 20% of the time,
it's dishonest.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.610
So here's what it looks like.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.840
You're looking here at
a computer display.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.010
That thing disappears.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.060
And then, either an
x is here or here.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.730
And you push a button.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.320
That's all.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.910
Or a light comes on, and
you just push a button.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:04.410
That's all.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.420
If it came on on the left or
the right, I push button.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.600
When an arrow appears, 80% of
the time it's warning you

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.130
where that light will appear.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:18.600
20%, it's dishonest and it
appears on the opposite side.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.620
So you will know, how good an
experimental psychologist you

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.610
are right now, if I ask you
which condition do you think

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.110
you're the fastest to push the
button, when you have an arrow

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.930
that's truly telling you where
the light will come on, an

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.610
arrow that's misleading
you, or an x

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.430
that tells you nothing?

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.430
Which do you think you'll
be fastest?

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.450
PROFESSOR: Where the arrow's
pointing, right?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.290
Like, here's the answer,
over here!

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.620
OK, thank you very much.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.820
Which do you think you'll
be slowest on?

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.390
The dishonest arrow, right?

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.510
The arrow says, look over
here, look over here!

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.520
And you're looking over there.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.130
And you go, oh no!

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:50.890
It came on the other side.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.960
You lied to me!

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.790
And the x is the middle.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:54.720
And here's the data.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.740
And it's a very simple
experiment, right?

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.610
How fast are you?

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.220
This is reaction time just
to push a button

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.370
when it comes on.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.010
Here's the neutral condition
in the middle.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.730
You're a little bit faster
if it's an honest arrow.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:07.930
You're a little bit
slower if it's a

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.350
dishonest, misleading arrow.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.920
So now, you do this
exact experiment.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.800
And I'll show you the data.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.850
And then, I'll simplify it for
you with patients who have

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.590
right sided damage, left
sided neglect.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.790
And you can see as you look at
these lines that the arrow can

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.750
be honest or dishonest,
and it can be on the

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.400
left or right side.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.040
Now, if you were always bad on
the neglected side, you go,

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.170
well, that's not
a big surprise.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.450
But here's a surprise.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.550
Patients were only bad--

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.950
the times were way up here only
when they had a dishonest

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.970
arrow that sent them into
their good side.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.490
That's when they were
really bad.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.130
So let's take a look
at this again.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.780
So here's the bad side.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.070
Here's the good side.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.330
When that arrow comes on
that's honest, good.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.990
When an arrow comes on that's
honest this way, they do fine.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.400
That's their bad field,
but they do fine.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.810
Tiny bit slower, but
just a tiny bit.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.800
Arrow comes on that moves them
into their bad field but

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.930
really the light is on
here, they do fine.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.970
But if an arrow sends them into
their good field, then

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.295
they're really, really slow
to get back here.

00:43:14.295 --> 00:43:17.210
So Posner argued that when you
move your attention in the

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.150
world, you have three steps
you have to do.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.270
You have to disengage your
attention from where you're

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.710
paying attention,
just logically.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.340
I'm paying attention
here right now.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.420
I'm going to pay attention
over here.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.600
I have to pull myself up from
here, move my attention over

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.540
here, and then focus here.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.300
So you disengage, get out from
where you are, move to where

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.920
you need to go, and land
and then focus

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.300
what you want to do.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.600
And the only condition where
they're bad is where they have

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.680
to get their attention out of
the good field as if once

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.460
they're in that good field, once
their mind is landed in

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.660
that good field, they're
in quicksand.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.100
And it's going to be really hard
to get their attention to

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.470
move into the bad field.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:54.520
So think about this.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.930
The clocks are perfect for this
because when you draw a

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.390
clock mostly--

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:00.900
think about that as
intuitively--

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.460
if I was to ask you to draw the
numbers on a clock, you

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.320
start with a 12 typically.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.070
Then, what's the next
one you would draw?

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.180
One, because that's how we're
taught to do clocks.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.330
Disaster if you have neglect.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.110
You're in the good field.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.550
Now, the left half of the clock
has disappeared on you

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.950
because the clock has made you
land your attention on the

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.260
good field.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.730
And now, you can't
pull out of it.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.350
But what happens if you only
have to draw 8 o'clock?

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.930
Your attention never got moved
into the good field.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.200
It's just starting from
middle, so to speak.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.980
And this very same patient can
draw the 8 o'clock or 10

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.220
o'clock pretty well.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.710
Does that makes sense?

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.340
Because they never got stuck
in the good field.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.400
They only moved into
the bad field.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.340
They can move into
the bad field.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.040
And so if their eyes are
closed, that's better.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.260
They get less stuck.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.630
And now, we understand
this thing.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:56.210
Why is it these patients, if
both fingers are moving--

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.230
because once their attention is
drawn into the good field,

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.160
it's as if the bad field
disappeared on them.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.370
But if they only get stimulated
in the bad field,

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:08.820
so right side here, then they're
OK because they never

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.580
paid that much attention
to the good field.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.445
So this is a nice experiment.

00:45:12.445 --> 00:45:14.240
It shows you what
is the problem.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.100
The problem is once you're
paying attention to the good

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.730
field, the normal, healthy
field, it's so powerful

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.500
compared to the weakened
representation here, that you

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.440
never leave it because it just
seems like everything.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.420
Now, here's a clever one.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.620
Again, this shows you how much
of attention is created by our

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.570
minds as opposed to just
simply defined by the

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.410
environment.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:41.350
So what if you show a display
to somebody with neglect and

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.850
then rotate the display right
in front of them?

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.860
So initially, the neglect is
going to be on the left side.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.520
But imagine the thing is turning
over like this, right

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.460
in front of them.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.590
Will the neglect travel with
the initial assignment?

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.790
So this is from Marlene
Behrmann, a very clever

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:58.370
experiment.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:59.530
They have to pay attention
if the light

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.930
comes on here or here.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.180
But what they do is while the
experiment's going on, right

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.000
in front of you, it slowly
rotates over to here.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.300
And sure enough, then
the light comes on.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.180
Sure enough, the neglect now
moves into the good field

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.509
because once you've assigned
left and right, you

00:46:15.509 --> 00:46:17.300
know this is left.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.840
So OK, you turn it over.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.340
That's still really left.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.340
But think how weird that is.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.790
The mind is deciding that.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.720
In an absolute sense, this
thing is on the right.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.600
But the mind said, this
is the leftward one.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.780
And you can flip it over, but
you're not tricking me.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.940
I know it's on the left, and
I'm considering it the

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.360
leftward one.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.370
The mind is deciding what
counts as left and

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.830
right, not the world.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.370
And what other kinds of
information is being processed

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.190
that's not reaching
attention levels?

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.070
So here's a cute experiment.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.930
They would say to these
patients, any difference

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:55.200
between these two things?

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.940
No.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.920
But if you had to live in one of
these houses, which one do

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.580
you think you'd live?

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.170
Well, I don't know.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.800
They're pretty much the same.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.460
Why would I pick one?

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.810
Well, pick one!

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.900
They go, ah, this looks like a
little better place to live if

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.280
I have to pick one.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.690
Which vase do you want?

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:08.070
I don't know.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.880
They look the same.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.590
You have to pick.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.350
I pick this one.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.180
Which glass to drink from?

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.140
You have to pick.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:14.430
Pick this one.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.640
So they consciously are not
aware of what's going on here

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.560
when there's information to
the opposite side to draw

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.410
their attention.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.570
But something in their mind
somewhere is picking up

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:23.670
information.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.870
So the last question-- and I'll
show you a final video--

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:26.690
is this.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.450
What kind of information is
picked up in the neglected

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:33.700
field as you decide, some part
of your mind, to neglect it?

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.240
So imagine if I showed
you two forks versus

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.490
a fork and a spoon.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.710
In order for that to make a
difference whether you report

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:47.890
both are present-- so again,
if you have a right sided

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.480
lesion, you might tend not to
report this fork or not to

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.250
report this key.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.650
If you just don't report either
one, OK, left is left

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:56.870
and you're bad at reporting
that one.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:58.650
There's something competing
in the good field.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.560
Your attention gets drawn
here, hard to disengage.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.690
But if it makes a difference
what this thing is, that means

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.920
that your mind kind of
knows what it is.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.980
And your mind is saying, well,
if it's a key, that's

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.930
different enough that I can
still pay attention to it.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.240
But if it's another fork, those
are really similar.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.820
And now, my mind is really
sucked into this fork.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.020
But in order for that to make a
difference, do you see that

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.650
you have to know somewhere in
your mind what's different on

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:28.680
the left for that to affect
your performance?

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.880
So now, we'll see a video of
a patient, the last one.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.270
This is a neurologist, Bob
Rafal, and a patient.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.150
It's a hugely nice thing of the
patients, most of all, but

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.590
also the physicians to make
these tapes available for

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:42.840
teaching purposes.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.380
So you understand--

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.420
just review for one month
and we're done--

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.470
that when the same object came
up, did he pretty much notice

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.730
the one on the bad side and
the right side for him?

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.600
No.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.840
Same object, he almost
always said it's one.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.850
If they're different objects, he
typically reported slightly

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.560
sluggishly the one
on his bad side.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.340
That means part of his mind has
to know what the object is

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.700
so that he ignores it if it's
identical and he reports it if

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.300
it's different.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.390
Well, you have to know
what it is to base

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.660
your answer on that.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.490
Yet, the logic of neglect is
that if they're identical,

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:24.710
then he's going to ignore the
one that he spotted on the

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.300
left in part of his mind but
squashed from his awareness on

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.085
the other side.

00:49:29.085 --> 00:49:30.335
OK, thanks very much.
