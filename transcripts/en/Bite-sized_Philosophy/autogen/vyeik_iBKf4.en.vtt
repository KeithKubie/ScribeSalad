00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
understand it because it works and so
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340 align:start position:0%
understand it because it works and so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 align:start position:0%
you think it's simpler than it actually
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.369 align:start position:0%
you think it's simpler than it actually
is<00:00:58.559><c> and</c><00:00:58.949><c> so</c><00:00:59.460><c> then</c><00:00:59.609><c> you</c><00:00:59.730><c> think</c><00:00:59.760><c> that</c><00:01:00.120><c> your</c><00:01:00.960><c> model</c>

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 align:start position:0%
is and so then you think that your model
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 align:start position:0%
is and so then you think that your model

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
of it is correct and then you think that
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
of it is correct and then you think that
your<00:01:03.870><c> manipulation</c><00:01:04.530><c> of</c><00:01:04.650><c> the</c><00:01:04.739><c> model</c><00:01:05.129><c> which</c>
