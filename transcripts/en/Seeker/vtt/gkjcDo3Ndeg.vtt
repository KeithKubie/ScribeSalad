00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.630
If a big enough comet hits the Earth, we all
die.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.810
But what happens if it hits the Sun?

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.790
Hmmm…

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.670
Hey guys, Amy with you getting nerdy about
space-impacts on DNews today.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.210
Comets, sometimes referred to as dirty snowballs,
are giant blocks of ice and rock way out in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.960
the Oort Cloud, the distant region home to
icy planetesimals left over from our Solar

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.289
System’s formation.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.609
They trace elliptical orbits around the Sun.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.820
As they approach, the heat and force of the
solar wind melts some of the ice, turning

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.530
it into a gorgeous, gaseous tail that astronomers
love.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.229
But some comets aren’t so lucky and whip
really close to our star.

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.600
These are called Sungrazers, and they can
pass within a few thousand miles of the Sun’s

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
surface.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.049
But the Sun isn’t exactly solid.

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.379
It’s a mass of incredibly hot gas, mainly
hydrogen.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.679
The outermost layer is called the Solar Corona,
where temperatures can be millions of degrees

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.690
Kelvin.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.619
So what happens when a dirty snowball gets
too close to something that big and hot?

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.469
Well, it’s not great for the snowball.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.620
We know the Sun has a strong gravitational
environment, so one potential death factor

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.950
for comets is the Sun’s Roche Limit.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.920
This is the imaginary line around the Sun
where if a body gets any closer it could be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.030
ripped apart by tidal forces.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.500
But not always.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.330
Survival depends on that body.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.560
If the comet doesn't have a firm enough central
mass, it will be ripped apart by the Sun’s

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.520
gravitational forces — think pulling apart
cotton candy.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.299
But if the comet so frozen solid it can pass
inside the Roche Limit and survive.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.049
It’d be like trying to pull apart a jawbreaker.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.049
It can’t happen.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.259
Counterintuitive as it might be, it's not
the Corona that poses the biggest threat to

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.760
comets; it’s not dense enough to transfer
enough heat.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.350
It’s actually solar radiation, the electromagnetic
energy emitted by the Sun, that’s the danger.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.310
This is the same radiation that causes sunburns,
so it’s super intense up close and powerful

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.090
enough to sublimate ice in comets and crack
apart rocks.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.330
If the ice melts and the rock cracks, this
can weaken the comet’s overall structure,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.369
making it less likely to survive its encounter
with the Sun.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
But some comets, even Sungrazers, still survive!

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.510
Comet Lovejoy survived its close encounter
with the Sun in December of 2011.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.599
Astronomers observed the comet after it passed
through the solar Corona.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.459
It looked like its nucleus (the comet’s
head if you will) had vanished and the tail

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.090
was longer and brighter.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
Researchers concluded that the Coronal heat
vaporised the ice and cracked away the rocky

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.120
body, which dissipated into the long, bright
tail.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540
So it was worse for the wear, but alive!

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.870
Comet ISON had a similar success story in
2013; astronomers suspect it was broken apart

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.920
but the parts continued traveling together
and eventually bunched up to look brighter

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.459
after its encounter with the Sun.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.599
But what about if a comet actually hits the
Sun?

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.120
Well, again, it's not solid, but that can
still happen.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.610
A big enough comet pulled into the Sun would
be accelerated to more than 370 miles per

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.569
second, at which point, drag from the Sun’s
atmosphere would flatten the comet with enough

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.670
force that it would explode in an airburst,
releasing ultraviolet radiation and X-rays.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.049
It could be as powerful as a magnetic flare
or coronal mass ejection but in a smaller

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.510
area, sparking sun quakes.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.790
These are all effects astronomers can see
with modern instruments, but it's not going

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.700
to do any damage to the Earth.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.519
Isn’t space just awesome?

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.569
And so many things going smashy, and not just
comets!

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.110
NASA used to smash spent spacecraft into the
Moon for science!

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:32.349
I can tell you why over on my own channel,
Vintage Space.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:43.459
But regardless of what else is happening in
space, the Sun always looks awesome!

00:03:43.459 --> 00:04:12.209
I tell you why in this video right here.
