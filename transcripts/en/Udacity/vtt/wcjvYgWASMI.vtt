00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.150
In the last lesson, we looked at the behavior of functions, including their

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.762
maxima and their minima, and where they're increasing or decreasing. In this

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:11.292
lesson, we're going to focus on polynomial functions in particular. We're going

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:15.683
to look at their graphs as a whole, and then, also zoom in on certain regions.
