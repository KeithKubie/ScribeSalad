00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:25.640
As

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.800
the current monarch of the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia and a bunch of other countries

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.810
that have her on their money, the Queen enjoys
something known as sovereign immunity.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.500
In a nutshell, sovereign, or crown immunity
as it is sometimes known, means that the Queen

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.839
is for all intents and purposes above the
law.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.390
So does this mean that the Queen could just
up and kill somebody if she felt like it,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.079
all the while getting off scot free?

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.670
In theory, yes, absolutely.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.819
It turns out the queen can commit any crime
just about anywhere in the world and get away

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.620
with it legally thanks to the fact that she
enjoys both sovereign immunity and diplomatic

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.620
immunity.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.490
As we’ve discussed in our article on whether
diplomats can really get away with murder,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.680
diplomatic immunity is so exceptionally far
reaching in its scope that a person protected

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.940
by it could indeed go all Lethal Weapon 2
on everyone with total impunity.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.612
The one problem for those diplomats, however,
is that their home nations would in all likelihood

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:30.090
not take kindly to them doing so and, beyond
recalling them, they’d likely face prosecution

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.220
at home for these acts if they were serious
enough crimes.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.180
(Although, as we discussed in that piece,
minor crimes like flouting any and all traffic

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.369
rules and racking up many thousands of dollars
in parking tickets without bothering to ever

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.670
pay tends to be seemingly every nations’
diplomats favorite passtime.)

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.290
Going back to the queen, however, unlike most
with diplomatic immunity, she does not technically

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.852
have to worry about what anyone in the UK
thinks.

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:58.119
You see, part of her immunity stems from the
fact that all justice in the United Kingdom

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.590
and various other countries she rules is meted
out in her name.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.590
Now, obviously the Queen doesn’t personally
dispense justice like the Kings and Queens

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.479
of yore, among other reasons because doing
so would be impractical.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.980
As a result of this, whilst the Queen is considered
the “fount of justice” for her subjects,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.250
the ability to administer it is doled out
to judges across Britain- all of whom are

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.790
granted the post-nominal of QC (standing for
Queen’s Counsel) as a nod to their position

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.880
as an extension of the Queen’s will.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.870
Likewise, the Crown Court similarly dispenses
justice in the Queen’s name and as a result,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.530
all cases brought before it are tried as The
Crown Versus *Blank*.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.420
Unsurprisingly from this, it is not technically
possible for the Queen herself to be tried

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.260
before the Crown Court as it would involve
her prosecuting, well, herself.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.720
Looking more deeply, her sovereign immunity
also makes it so that the Queen cannot be

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.370
tried in civil proceedings either, meaning
she cannot be sued or have other such civil

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.010
proceedings brought against her.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.900
The Queen also cannot be forced to testify
in open court or even be interviewed by the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.170
police, not that this matters seeing as she
also can’t be arrested.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.640
And even if she could be legally arrested
for a crime, it wouldn’t matter anyway.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.530
You see, technically no arrest can be made
“in the monarch’s presence” without

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.530
her consent.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.190
Thus, arresting her is impossible on this
count too because it would most definitely

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.350
have to happen in her presence.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.970
In addition, as if it being impossible to
arrest someone just standing near the Queen,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.920
let alone the Queen herself, this protection
extends to her various palaces too, meaning

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.970
the police can’t arrest anyone, including
the Queen, in any place she currently inhabits

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.660
unless she gives assent.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.760
It’s perhaps also worth mentioning that
all prisoners in the United Kingdom are held

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.730
“at her Majesty’s leisure” (which is
why the Queen can pardon criminals if she

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.620
so wills it), meaning she could just walk
out of prison anyway by telling everyone to

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.320
let her go.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.370
Speaking of the police, as with the justice
system, they too are charged with dispensing

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.940
justice in the Queen’s name and all members
of British law enforcement, upon joining the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.510
force, must swear an oath that reads, in part
– “I will well and truly serve the Queen

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.070
in the office of constable.”

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.380
Or to put it another way, the Queen is the
absolute authority of the entire UK policing

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.870
system and her word is, quite literally, law.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.790
As a result, the Queen could theoretically
shut down any attempt made to arrest her by

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.609
simply telling the officer to go away.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.870
Now you might say if she did all this, surely
Parliament would step in and curtail the murderous

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.990
Queen’s powers to ensure she could be prosecuted.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.560
The problem is that all laws proposed by Parliament
require what is known as Royal Assent before

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.530
they can be enshrined into British law.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.640
As the name suggests, Royal Assent comes directly
from the Queen herself so a parliament looking

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.600
to prosecute the Queen would need the Queen
to authorise the bill limiting her own powers,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.540
which she obviously would not do if she suddenly
decided to start treating life like a game

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.090
of Grand Theft Auto.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.940
Another avenue that could be pursued in regards
to prosecuting the Queen would be to force

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.560
her to abdicate, removing the many protections
she enjoys.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.380
To be clear though, this wouldn’t necessarily
open the Queen up to prosecution as, under

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.140
British law, nothing she does as Queen can
be considered illegal- it’d just mean she

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.570
could be prosecuted for any further crimes
she happened to commit after.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.850
It’s also worth noting here that the Queen
has the power to completely dissolve Parliament

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.440
if she so chooses and cause a whole new set
of people to be elected.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.600
And if this group displeased her, she is free
to do it again and again.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.640
It’s also the Queen’s duty to appoint
the prime minister and she could, in theory,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.560
appoint anyone she wanted to the position,
regardless of the way the British public voted

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.830
in any elections.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.900
So installing someone who would do what she
wanted would not be any real hurdle.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.710
Thus, it would take a literal revolution for
Parliament to rewrite the laws concerning

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.540
the Queen without her consent.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.950
There’s a potential problem with this too,
though.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.450
You see, the Queen is the Commander-in-chief
of the British Armed Forces.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.490
As former professional head of the British
Armed forces, Lord Charles Guthrie once noted,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.130
“The armed forces are loyal, and we live
in a democracy, but actually their ultimate

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.070
authority is the Queen.”

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.420
Yes, like with the police, every member of
the Armed Forces in Britain swears an oath

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.590
of fealty to the Queen and she is considered
the ultimate authority in regards to military

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.590
matters.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.010
Thus, if there was an attempt at a Parliamentary
revolution and members of Parliament refused

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.550
to step down as they were rewriting British
law without the Queen’s consent, she could

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.590
simply order the British Armed Forces to forcibly
remove them from power or even line them all

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.060
up and have them executed.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.230
The question then would be, in such a scenario,
would they honor their oaths to the Queen?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.350
Speaking of her power over the various groups
of highly trained armed forces, the Queen

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.980
has a remarkable number of ways she could
theoretically kill someone if she felt so

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.190
inclined, without need to get her own hands
bloody.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.510
For example, she could instruct a crack team
of SAS commandos to silently make a person

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.240
disappear, tell her personal guard to charge
them with their bayonets, or ask the Red Arrows

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.250
to crash into someone’s house.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.440
Again, whether the soldier, sailor or airmen
in question would honor their oaths and listen

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.550
to the order is another matter entirely- but
the point is, if the Queen ever gave such

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.970
an order there is no authority on Earth that
could legally override it save for herself.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.920
On top of that, if any investigation was every
put in place to see why these soldiers had

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.960
gone on their murder spree, the Queen not
only could not be questioned in court, as

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.390
previously mentioned, but also ignore the
matter entirely as, despite her prominent

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.320
political position, she and everything to
do with her private life are exempt from any

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.230
Freedom of Information requests.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.120
If the Queen felt particularly gung-ho she
could even personally declare war on any nation

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.080
or person and, thanks to her Royal Prerogative,
need not consult anyone about it before hand.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.480
In fact, she could even authorise a nuclear
strike on a person anywhere in the world via

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.560
Britain’s secretive and expansive network
of nuclear submarines, again thanks to the

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.380
fact that all of the men and women stationed
aboard these vessels swear to put the Queen’s

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.380
orders before all others.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.560
Now you might say a foreign power might get
pretty upset if that nuclear strike happened

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.280
on their soil, and the International Criminal
Courts might also try to step in, but if they

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.500
decided to tangle with this rather formidable
woman, the Queen could theoretically make

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.880
her army larger by commandeering any ships
that entered British waters (another power

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.949
of hers) and by commanding the various armies
of the commonwealth (all of whom swear a similar

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:58.820
oath of fealty to the crown, same as the British
armed forces) to come to her aid- that’s

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.120
a lot of nations and military might.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.300
Again, how many of these armies would listen,
particularly after she decided to go all Armageddon

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.020
on the world, is irrelevant to the legal discussion
at hand- what matters is that the Queen technically

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.270
has the ability to do all this and that nobody
could legally stop her.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.639
Despite the tremendous power she theoretically
wields and the fact that she enjoys a “unique

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.791
legal status” as monarch making her totally
and unequivocally above the law, the Queen

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:27.350
doesn’t utilise even an iota of her full
powers.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.350
Why?

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.380
Well, mainly to keep in the good graces of
her subjects with it being noted by the official

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.500
website of the British Monarchy that , “Although
civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.279
against the Sovereign as a person under UK
law, The Queen is careful to ensure that all

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:46.120
her activities in her personal capacity are
carried out in strict accordance with the

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120
law.”

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.129
At the end of the day, she herself swore an
oath to her subjects, which she seems to have

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.750
spent her many decades as Queen taking very
seriously.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.490
Specifically, in her speech at her 21st birthday,
she stated, “I declare before you all that

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.959
my whole life whether it be long or short
shall be devoted to your service and the service

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.100
of our great imperial family to which we all
belong.”
