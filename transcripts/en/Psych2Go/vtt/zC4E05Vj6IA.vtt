00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.959
Intuition is often an underrated - yet essential -  tool you can use when you're dating,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.360
- escaping danger, or even to build your career.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.760
The International Association of Administrative Professionals and Office Team

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.740
- surveyed 3,500 administrative workers

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.920
- and 1,300 senior managers,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.320
- and discovered that 88% of them make decisions based on their gut feelings.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.380
It turns out intuition is more than just magic when it makes up a good chunk of our life choices.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.400
Are you wondering what your intuitive power is? There are five types of intuition:

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.700
Analytical, Observant, Questioning, Empathetic and Adaptive.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
Analytical intuition involves spending a lot of time researching

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
- and gathering data before making a decision.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.600
People who identify as Analysts prefer to explore every potential scenario

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.180
- and want to understand all the details before a judgment is made.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.700
They like to take their time and are the most thorough and precise.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.180
Therefore haste, impulse, and recklessness are commonly avoided by them.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.000
Lawyers, for instance, are specifically trained to rely on their analytical intuition

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.780
- when they focus on facts and objectifies to solve cases.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.140
Next, we have Observant intuition, which involves gathering clues about people and scenarios.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.940
People who identify as observers are often visual learners

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.760
- and pick up on physical cues in their immediate surroundings.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.740
They are experts at finding visual patterns and notice subtle differences in their environment,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.859
- such as a co-worker not returning their smile or when an object goes missing.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.920
Observers tend to excel in outdoors-y and hands-on activities such as gardening

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.220
- or visual thinking careers such as art, web development and graphic design.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.060
Then, there is Questioning intuition, which involves making judgments based on real-life evidence.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.360
People who identify as questioners would rather rely on asking or surveying others directly

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.480
- instead of looking up online statistics before making a decision.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.780
For example: Before releasing a new video, Questioners would rather directly ask

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.620
- their community viewers what they want to see next instead of searching what's trending or popular today.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.620
People with Questioning intuition can make excellent investigators, accountants, and financial examinors.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.660
Then, we have Empathetic intuition, which involves great listening skills

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.900
- to understand where the source of the problem lies.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.420
People who identify as Empathizers withhold judgment and allow their colleagues and clients to vent.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.740
This helps them figure out what works best in their favor before making a decision.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.480
They usually work well in teams and are cooperative, considerate and introspective.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.660
People with Empathetic intuition make natural psychologists, doctors, writers and counsellors.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.820
And finally, there is Adaptive intuition, which is the most common form of intuition represented to the public.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.320
Adaptive intuition is based solely on gut feelings and is used by others to help them think and react quickly

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.640
- in situations that require immediate action.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.060
Adapters are great at giving advice and make reliable workers

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.880
- because you know you can always turn to them when you're in trouble.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.940
They seem to always have a hunch on just about everything.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.760
We hope that this video helps you discover more exciting things about yourself.
