00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.770
How the Himalayas Formed

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.240
The Himalayas, which stretch some 2,900 kilometres
between India, Pakistan, China, and Nepal,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.370
is the world’s tallest mountain range.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.340
In addition to Mount Everest, the world’s
tallest mountain by peak elevation standing

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.180
at 8,848 meters tall, the range also features
several other mountain peaks over 8,000 meters.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.679
It is the only mountain range to boast mountains
over 8,000 meters—the runner-up is a mountain

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.950
range in South America, whose tallest peak
is just 6,962 meters tall.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.830
Millions of years ago, these mountain peaks
didn’t exist.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.290
The Asian continent was mostly intact, but
India was an island floating off the coast

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.640
of Australia.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.800
Around 220 million years ago, around the time
that Pangea was breaking apart, India started

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.800
to move northwards.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.000
It travelled some 6,000 kilometres before
it finally collided with Asia around 40 to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.310
50 million years ago.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.050
Then, part of the Indian landmass began to
go beneath the Asian one, moving the Asian

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
landmass up, which resulted in the rise of
the Himalayas.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.800
It’s thought that India’s coastline was
denser and more firmly attached to the seabed,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.300
which is why Asia’s softer soil was pushed
up rather than the other way around.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.690
The mountain range grew very rapidly in comparison
to most mountain ranges, and it’s actually

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.130
still growing today.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.440
Mount Everest and its fellows actually grow
by approximately a net of about a centimetre

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.670
or so every year.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.101
That’s in comparison to the Appalachian
Mountains, which developed some 300 million

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:32.350
years ago or more, which are actually decreasing
in peak elevations as they erode.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.800
The continued growth in the Himalayas is likely
due to the Indian tectonic plate still moving

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.920
slowly but surely northward.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.540
We know the plate is still moving in part
because of the frequent earthquakes in the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.540
region.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.960
Now, if you do the math, you’d find that
if the Himalayas had been growing at the current

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.890
rate for 40 million years, they should be
about 400 km tall!

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.590
If that was true, once the infrastructure
was in place, this would have given us a much

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.430
cheaper way to put things into low Earth orbit
and beyond.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.170
(For reference, the International Space Station
typically orbits at between 300 km to 400

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.170
km.)

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.170
So what happened?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.160
In part, the rate of vertical growth has varied
over time, including in favor of more horizontal

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
growth.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.230
And, of course, gravity and erosion have limited
the mountains’ growth significantly.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.330
If you’re wondering who first figured out
how the Himalayas formed, India merging into

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.990
Asia became the accepted theory for this formation
around 1912.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.660
That’s when Alfred Wegener, a German meteorologist,
came up with the “Theory of Continental

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.000
Drift” which gave us our first ideas about
Pangea, tectonic plates, and the thought that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.790
continents were moving away from or closer
to each other.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.280
What does the future for the Himalayas look
like?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.580
Undoubtedly, the mountains will continue to
grow, though at the same time eroding too;

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.810
but the net is expected to continue to grow
as the Indian tectonic plate doesn’t look

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.390
like it’s going to slow down any time soon.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.230
That means more earthquakes and, over time,
slightly taller mountains to climb.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.920
Bonus Facts:
• In the last century, the east coast of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.250
the United States has moved about 8 ft or
2.4 meters further away from Europe.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.220
• The fossils of sea and coastal creatures
can still be found in the Himalayas, as it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.819
was once two coast lines that merged together.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.980
These fossils not only provide evidence that
the Himalayas once existed on a coastline,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.849
but also information about climate change
and plate movement.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.140
• The name for the Himalayas comes from
the Sanskrit for snow and dwelling: “him”

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.850
and “ālaya” respectively.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.770
Essentially, the home of the snow.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.650
• Mount Everest is named after one of the
Surveyor Generals of India, George Everest.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.810
It was not, however, Everest who first survey
the mountain, but Andrew Waugh who took over

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.000
the role of Surveyor General after Everest.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.260
Waugh thought it would be a good idea to name
the mountain after his predecessor.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.410
Everest didn’t like the idea, but he was
overruled and his name was eventually adopted

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.240
for the mountain by the Royal Geographical
Society in 1865.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.690
• While Everest is generally considered
the tallest mountain on Earth because it reaches

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.090
the highest elevation, some argue that this
should not be the measure used, but rather

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.870
the tallest from the base to peak.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.760
In that case, Hawaii’s Mauna Kea would be
the tallest at about 10,200 metres from its

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.700
base on the ocean floor to peak at 4,205 metres
above sea level.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.889
• Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay,
his Sherpa guide, became the first people

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.020
to successfully climb to the peak of Mount
Everest in 1953.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.729
Before Hillary, several dozen attempts had
been undertaken to climb to the peak since

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.009
1921.

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:38.020
Since Hillary, nearly 3000 people have accomplished
the same feat and around 200 have died trying.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.599
• The Himalayas serve as a “climatic divide”
as well as a physical barrier between India

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.060
and the rest of the continent.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.710
They prevent cold winter winds from entering
into India in the winter, making India warmer

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.540
than other regions along the same lines of
latitude at that same time of the year.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.300
Similarly, they prevent the southern monsoon
winds from taking moisture across the border

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.129
to Tibet; the result is India gets far more
precipitation than the relatively more arid

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:15.699
Tibet.
