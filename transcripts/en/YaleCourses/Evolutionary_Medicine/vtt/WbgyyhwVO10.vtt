1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.850
One of the major functions of the immune system is not defense,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.910
but managing the Microbiota and the Microbiota are then co evolving with their

3
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.750
management by the immune system,

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.430
just as they co evolve with the defense function of the immune system.

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
This happens particularly in the gut and on the skin.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.680
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.680
<v 1>and we also can see what would happen if there had not been any coevolution by</v>

8
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:35.830
considering the example of render pest.

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.290
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.410
<v 1>so our commensal Microbiota is immense.</v>

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.470
Each of us contains over a thousand species of bacteria and an unknown and

12
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.700
astronomically large number of viruses.

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.230
These microorganisms do not normally cause disease in a healthy host.

14
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.200
Some of them can do so in an immunocompromised host if they change niche.

15
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.630
<v 1>Pathogens represent only a tiny fraction of the microbes that colonizers</v>

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
and many of the commensal microbes are present providing us with essential

18
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.560
benefits.
They produce vitamins,

19
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.440
they help us digest complex polysaccharides.

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.260
They detoxify harmful chemicals,

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.010
they compete with pathogens for intestinal niches,

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.810
and they provide the stimulation necessary for proper maturation of the immune

23
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.644
system.

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.823
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.060
<v 1>so how are they managed?</v>

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.280
<v 1>They're managed by our immune system.</v>

28
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.080
We can see this in immunocompromised individuals who suffer from infections that

29
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:51.430
are commonly caused by the same microorganisms that are normally harmless in

30
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:52.630
immune confident people.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.340
<v 1>The immune system is those operating both remove pathogens but also to maintain</v>

33
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.050
host microbe homeostasis.

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.221
<v 1>It does.</v>

36
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:08.840
So by controlling the growth and invasion of commensal microbes that can cause

37
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.720
disease in immune in immunocompromised states,

38
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.740
these are the opportunistic or endogenous pathogens.

39
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440
<v 1>The action is actually most intense at epethelial interfaces and the epithelium</v>

41
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.000
Mucosa.
See where our need for access,

42
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.110
access to oxygen and the nutrients opens up doors that microbes can enter.

43
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.450
So that is where the management needs to be the most careful.

44
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.190
<v 1>We do produce some natural probiotics to help manage the Microbiota.</v>

46
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.160
Human milk oligosaccharides are the third most abundant component of breast

47
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:49.994
milk.

48
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.340
When bifidobacterium longum infanticide has grown on human milk

49
00:02:55.341 --> 00:03:00.190
oligosaccharides,
it adheres better the human intestinal epilepsy,

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.024
legal sales,

51
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.420
and there it induces greater expression of anti inflammatory cytokine aisle 10

52
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.670
and junctional adhesion molecules then do control strains that are grown on

53
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
lactose.

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.020
So the kind of illegal saccharide provided by human breast milk appears to have

55
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.730
been designed by evolution specifically to promote the growth of a particular

56
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:26.050
member of the Microbiota.

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.990
Those of the host is encouraging the colonization of infant gut by a beneficial

58
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
bacteria.

59
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.060
Let's take a look at the gut ecosystem.

60
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.300
In this left panel we have a healthy gut environment and in the right panel we

61
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.860
have an altered gut environment and the healthy gut environment.

62
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.250
Out in the gut lumen we have a mixture of peacekeeping bacteria and pathogens.

63
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.910
We have a healthy epithelial barrier and behind that epithelial barrier we have

64
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.770
t-cells,
various types,

65
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.130
and we have then the Lamin appropriate,

66
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.900
which is also a mechanical barrier and an altered gut environment.

67
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.110
We have a damaged epithelial barrier that allows increased bacterial adherence

68
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.580
and penetration because normally the bacteria can't get through the mucus to get

69
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.170
that close to the epithelium.

70
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.140
And if the bacteria you can get through the barrier,

71
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.040
they produce back pathological inflammation.
So in the healthy gut,

72
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.041
the immune system is maintaining the microbes as commensals out in the lumen and

73
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.170
in the altered gut.
The defenses have been breached.

74
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.710
And Immune activation leads to inflammation and infection can follow both genes

75
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.380
and environment are contributing to this.

76
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:52.381
So there are genes where mutations in particular receptors such as the nod

77
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.540
receptor,
uh,

78
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
make this kind of breaching of the barrier more likely and stress Diet and uh,

79
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.740
vaccines possibly.
And then,
uh,

80
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.460
infections are all things that can contribute as well.

81
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.800
So it's a gene environment interaction.

82
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.490
Similarly with the skin

83
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.460
and the healthy skin ecosystem,
we have the epidermis.

84
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.550
Of course there are things that breached the epidermis.

85
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:29.530
There are sweat glands and hair follicles.

86
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.450
So those are paths of entry living on the epidermis or fungi,

87
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.780
bacteria and viruses that are also living in the hair follicles.

88
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.560
They are communicating below the,

89
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.890
below the epidermis and Dermis with macrophages and with dendritic cells.

90
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And these are sending out signals which are generating antimicrobial defenses.

91
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.290
So there are anti microbial peptides that are also out there on the surface of

92
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:03.590
the skin that are being made by the immune system.

93
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.310
<v 1>So in the healthy skin,</v>

95
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.610
the Microbiota are in conversation with the immune system?

96
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.000
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

97
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.750
<v 1>they promote immunity by activating lymphocytes.</v>

98
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.010
And to visualize the scale of this,

99
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.100
the healthy human skin contains about 20 billion lymphocytes with a huge

100
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:27.480
population of memory t cells.

101
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.270
<v 1>There are at least five mechanisms that Microbiota can use in causing a skin</v>

103
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.480
disorder.

104
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.530
One is if there is a genetic predisposition in the host,

105
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.850
so there might be a barrier defect or some defect in a regulatory pathway.

106
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.930
Another is an increase in general microbial density that can happen with a

107
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.460
metabolic disease or with something like acne.

108
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.340
Another is a shift in context,

109
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:05.140
so a pathogen that would cause damage only when the skin barrier is breached.

110
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.540
That would be something like a staphylococcus aureus or Candida Albicans.

111
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.840
They're living there on the skin most of the time and they aren't causing us any

112
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:15.940
problem unless there's a break in the barrier.

113
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.950
<v 1>Other pathogens can infect and open a pathway for our skin microbiota to get</v>

115
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:30.010
through.
And there can also be increases of defined bacteria.

116
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:34.120
So for example,
staff,
Oreos can increase,
uh,

117
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.960
particularly if it's a multiplier resistant.
Staph Auria is,

118
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.160
so psoriasis,

119
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:47.161
dermatitis and acne are all diseases that result from disturbance of the skin

120
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.380
ecosystem.
It's a complex ecosystem,

121
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.380
normally managed by crosstalk with the immune system.

122
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.930
Now extrinsic and intrinsic very islands are concepts that crop up in this

123
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:06.880
context as well.
Many pathogens are harmless in their normal hosts,
but highly,

124
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:09.580
very Linton accidental hosts.
These are the spillover ones.

125
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:10.710
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

126
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.760
<v 1>there are variances.</v>

127
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.690
Extrinsic because it depends on the environment in which they find themselves.

128
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.580
In contrast to that intrinsic very lens is defined by the position,

129
00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:25.020
by the pathogen of genes that make it more virulent in the naive host.

130
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.720
Then related microbes that lack those jeans.

131
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.840
<v 0>Okay,</v>

132
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.350
<v 1>so a good example would be the genes that mediate the production of the toxins</v>

133
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:35.900
that cause either diptheria or tetanus.

134
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:40.660
So here is a painting of a person who is having a tea,

135
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.850
a tetanus convulsion,
and is absolutely rigid.

136
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.030
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

137
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.060
<v 1>Extrinsic and intrinsic virulence are often difficult to separate.</v>

138
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.970
They are the best analyzed in cases like myxomatosis.

139
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.140
We saw the virus infecting Australian rabbits in which scientists can set aside

140
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:06.591
both the virus and the rabbit and thereby study changes in host and in pathogen

141
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.840
in a controlled comparative fashion.

142
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.980
Resistance and tolerance in the host are also critical.

143
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.000
Pathogens can evolve to be less virulent,

144
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.370
but host can also evolve to be more tolerant or more resistant.

145
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.220
Both are often happening at the same time.
Either way,

146
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:32.010
a symbiotic relationship can be established,

147
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.100
so a destructive relationship can be potentially converted into a non

148
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:43.200
destructive relationship.
By evolution.
However,

149
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:47.490
the resulting intrinsic variants of the symbiosis is very different in these two

150
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.324
cases,

151
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.730
and it has important consequences for naive hosts who lack that co-evolutionary

152
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.723
history.

153
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.500
These consequences played out dramatically in the introduction of render pissed

154
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.450
from Eurasia to Africa.

155
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:08.110
So we're now going to take a look at a case in which an entire continent was

156
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:11.540
naive.
This is a,

157
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.680
this is an infected piece of tissue that has rendered pissed in it.

158
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.340
This is a pathogen that was native to the Eurasian continent and was introduced

159
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.740
to Africa.
It's a virus.

160
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.660
It attacks buffalo cattle,
Eland,
Kudu Giraffe,
Bush book,

161
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:33.920
warthogs and Bush pigs,
so as attacking ungulates,

162
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.420
it's endemic to the Asian steps and it was repeatedly introduced to Europe

163
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.910
through human invasions where it did cause some problems.

164
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.990
It entered Italian Somali land either in cattle imported from Asia in 1889 or in

165
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.831
Russian cattle with the relief of General Gordon in Khartoum in 1884 so late

166
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:56.874
19th century

167
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.290
by 1890 it crossed the Sahara and it spread into populations that had no evolved

168
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:04.344
resistance.

169
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.730
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

170
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.260
<v 1>there were some direct consequences.</v>

171
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.510
It's spread over eastern central and southern Africa between 1890 and 1899

172
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.350
they're eliminated most domestic cattle and wild buffalo and many of the related

173
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.443
bovines.

174
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.430
One species of antelope went extinct and the distributions of the other species

175
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:29.510
remain altered.
To this day.

176
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.650
The pastoral and nomadic peoples lost their food sources and then under the

177
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:38.010
stress of starvation,

178
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.370
the human population suffered an outbreak of endemic smallpox.

179
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

180
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.060
<v 1>There were subsequent epizootic in 1917 and 18 and 1923 and in 1938 to 41</v>

181
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.340
there were also indirect consequences over much of that infected area at CT

182
00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:03.711
flies disappeared after the epidemic because the population's wild ungulates on

183
00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:09.210
whose blood they fed had been killed by render pissed.

184
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

185
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.040
<v 1>Those flies required trees and bushes is their habitat and those herbivores for</v>

186
00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:16.874
their food.

187
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.840
The disappearance of game because the appearance of man eating lions and Uganda.

188
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:27.260
In the 1920s there was a lion that killed 84 people.

189
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.320
It was starving because render pest had killed it's natural prey and the

190
00:12:32.781 --> 00:12:36.980
presence of man eating lions caused the farmers to abandon large areas in which

191
00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:38.930
thickets of brush then grew up.

192
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.630
The wild ungulates developed immunity to render pest move back into the

193
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:49.290
abandoned farming areas where they became host for the CT flies.

194
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.080
The CT flies could now live in the new thickets of brush and on the wild

195
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.923
ambulance

196
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.100
because the CT flies transmit sleeping sickness.

197
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.470
The human population then withdrew further and remained absent even after the

198
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.750
lions had switched back to eating ungulates.

199
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.580
So the humans avoided those areas because sleeping sickness is an extremely

200
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:12.420
serious illness.

201
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.060
Some of those areas then became the national parks of East Africa.

202
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

203
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.680
<v 1>So to summarize,
render pissed,</v>

204
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.450
it changed the ecological structure of half a continent for at least a century.

205
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:28.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

206
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.990
<v 1>The consequences for humans were drastic.</v>

207
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.460
They were often indirect and they were predictable only in retrospect

208
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.940
it did.
The African ungulates what measles and smallpox did,
the new world humans,

209
00:13:41.941 --> 00:13:44.370
when they were introduced by European colonists,

210
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.430
and it has fortunately recently been eliminated by a vaccination campaign.

211
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.291
However,

212
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:57.291
it gives you some idea of what happens when a pathogen can encounter immune

213
00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:00.570
systems that have not coevolved with it.

214
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.523
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

215
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.150
<v 1>So to summarize,
the immune system,
not only defense against pathogens,</v>

216
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:08.950
it helps to manage the microbiome

217
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.130
long co-evolutionary interactions between humans and their microbiota has

218
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:19.780
produced precise physiological mechanisms that foster a symbiotic relationship.

219
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:21.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

220
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.720
<v 1>Very Lens is the product of a host pathogen interaction that has components</v>

221
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:30.060
contributed by both the host and by the pathogen.

222
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.120
We see the consequences of host pathogen coevolution most clearly when they have

223
00:14:36.121 --> 00:14:36.954
not occurred,

224
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.790
and that was the case with render pissed in Africa a complete disaster.
