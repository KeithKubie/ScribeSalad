Aceable is an education
focused company

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.100
delivering what we call
required education,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.575
or high stakes learning,
through mobile devices.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.320
About nine months ago now,
I sat down with an advisor.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.120
He was like, you basically
don't have a company worth

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.090
investing in.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.000
The idea of mobile
makes a lot of sense.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.530
The idea of using game
mechanics makes a lot of sense.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.729
And even content and education
makes a lot of sense,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.180
but the material
that we were offering

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.650
at that point, none of
it was have to have.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.460
You could go find
out about pregnancy

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.710
from 1,000 different sources.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.362
You didn't have to buy it.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.070
So this guy gave me
a lot of good advice.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.650
He said, go focus on areas where
people have to learn things.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.900
And deliver that content
through mobile with game

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.300
mechanics in a
social, fun manner.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.910
So last July that's what
we started focusing on.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.320
Nine months later we
released a driver's ed app

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.025
that actually gets
you full certification

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:05.980
in the State of Texas from
a driver's ed standpoint.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.480
Looking back on times when
things are really hard,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.660
the only way we turned
the corner was really

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.530
just sheer persistence.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670
Raising money, we raised a half
a million dollars at Christmas

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.705
time when people told me there
was no way it could be done.

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:25.520
And the only way
was persistence.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.190
And I think I've
perfected writing

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.630
the email where it says,
I hope you don't take

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.560
my persistence as
being annoying,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.120
it's just I'm sure
you know how it is.
