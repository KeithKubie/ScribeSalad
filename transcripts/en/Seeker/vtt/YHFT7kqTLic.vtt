00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
Let’s take a second to pretend I’m in
the shower right now.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.600
I know, you’ve always wanted tickets.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
There’s my rubber ducky.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
And there’s my loofa!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
BAM!

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
I just had an epiphany!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600
E=Mc squared!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.250
There’s a hole in the ozone layer!

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.690
Entropy can be created but not destroyed!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.400
I’m a smart person now.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.720
Hi, I’m William Haynes.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.930
You ever notice how you probably seem to get
your best ideas, or do you best thinking while

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.930
you’re in the shower?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570
Well that’s because science.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.610
The human brain when awake produces enough
electricity to power a 40-watt light bulb!

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.500
But by the time you exit that haven of thought
the idea vanishes.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.690
It turns out all people receive these types
of inner-renaissances but not just from showering.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.329
Apparently when your brain is preoccupied
by a menial task like a long drive, a short

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.149
walk or even doing some simple gardening you’ve
created the right environment of activity

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.589
for something called free association.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.780
Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations
per second!

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.730
Psychologists have a theory that describes
these types of mental states as something

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.530
called the Default Mode Network.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.359
As John Kouinos a psychologist who studies
creativity and distraction told Wired, “You

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.149
become less aware of your environment and
more aware of your internal thoughts.”

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.770
Which makes it sound all deep.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.660
Now I feel like I should be loving myself.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.390
Apparently when your brain is working on a
problem, it focuses on just a few strategies.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.830
According to psychologists these are like
“ruts” that your mental wheels get stuck

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.830
in.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.010
If you want to have a good idea you should
take breaks so those thought patterns no longer

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.390
take control of your thinking.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.120
This is also a good reason to do your favorite
thing: mindlessly scroll the internet.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.360
Or take a walk, be healthy.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.360
The ocean is blue because water absorbs colors
in the red part of the light spectrum leaving

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.830
only blue!

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.180
So that’s why your brain does these things
better in the shower and when you least expect

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.180
it to.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.250
Do you ever come up with cool things in the
shower?

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.250
Start taking shorter showers.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.650
California’s in a drought right now, geeze.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.650
I’m William Haynes.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.930
You can see me say other things at SourceFed.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.320
Thanks for watching.
