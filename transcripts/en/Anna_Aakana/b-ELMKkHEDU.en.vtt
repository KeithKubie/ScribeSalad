Hi

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.780
I'm Anna Akana

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.760
And I have six cats

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.480
If I could I'd have all the cats

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.560
How many cats is too many cats?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.820
There's no such number

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.140
And I have six cats

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.060
I wish I had infinity cats

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.860
You should adopt a couple of cats

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.800
and he doesn't do anything

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.200

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.140
We chopped off his balls

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.880
but he's still crazy

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.780
This is Ghost

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.060
On cue

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.620
(Actual Ghost the cat noises)

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.860
