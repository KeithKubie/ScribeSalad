00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
Luis receives a gift card
worth $25 to an online

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.560
retailer the sells digital
music and games.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.440
Each song costs $0.89 and
each game costs $1.99.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.580
He wants to buy at least 15
items with this card.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.140
And then they want us to set
up a system of inequalities

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.410
that represents the scenario and
then identify the range of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.505
possible purchases
using a graph.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.710
So let's see if we
can do this.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.410
So he's going to buy some
amount of games and some

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.550
amount of music.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.670
So let's make those
our two variables.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.680
Let's let x equal the
number of music, or

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410
the amount of music.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.060
And let's let y equal the amount
of games, or the number

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.250
of game units or whatever
you want to call it.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.420
So we have the first constraint
here that the gift

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.020
card is worth $25.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.810
So I'll underline, the gift
card is worth $25.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.680
So the total amount he spends
on games and music combined

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.470
can be no more than $25.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.660
So how much is he going
to spend on music?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.770
Well each song costs $0.89.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.910
So he's going to spend $0.89
times the number of songs he

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.200
buys on music.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.130
Plus how much is he going
to spend on games?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.620
Well each game is $1.99.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.250
So he's going to spend
$1.99 times the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.690
number of games he buys.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.520
And that has to be less
than or equal to 25.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.010
So that's our first
constraint.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.550
And then the second constraint,
is that he wants

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.740
to buy at least 15 items
with his card.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.410
So the number of songs plus the
number of games has to be

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.880
at least 15.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.950
so x plus y has to be a greater
than or equal to 15.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.170
And so just like that we have
our two constraints.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.670
We've set up the system of
inequalities that represents

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.580
the scenario.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.180
Now we need to identify the
range of possible purchases

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.430
using a graph.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.400
And this is a pretty
straightforward graph to draw,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.160
this one down here.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.850
This one is the little less
straightforward, because it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.210
doesn't have nice
round numbers.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.900
We could round it off to say
this is 1x plus 2y, but

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.690
instead of doing that, let's
just take out a graphing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020
calculator and graph
it on that.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.960
And actually before I graph it,
let me put it in y equals

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.640
mx plus b form, or slope
intercept form.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.220
So the second one right here,
if we subtract x from both

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.030
sides, we get y is greater
than or equal to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.300
negative x plus 15.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.000
So that's the second equation.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.650
This first equation, if we
subtract 0.89x from both

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:47.580
sides, we get 1.99y is equal
to negative 0.89x plus 25.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.370
Sorry, that should be less than
or equal to, not equal

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.990
to, this is an inequality.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.170
So negative 0.89x plus 25.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:04.980
And then divide both
sides by 1.99.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.500
And we get y is less than or
equal to, the calculator will

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.535
actually be useful for this, we
have negative 0.89 divided

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:29.110
by 1.99 is equal to negative
0.447 I think is pretty good.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.380
Negative 0.447x plus
25 divided by 1.99.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:45.280
So 25 divided by 1.99
is equal to 12.56.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.540
Plus 12.56.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.970
So that that blue constraint,
that we can't spend more than

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.170
$25, when we put it in slope
intercept, it turns into this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.860
inequality.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.810
And the second constraint, is
that he wants to buy at least

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.110
15 items, turns into
this inequality.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.060
So let's graph the
two inqualities.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.250
Or let's graph the lines
and think about

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.330
the region of overlap.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.980
So if I have my calculator out,
I should have it in a

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.240
place where I can I look
at both graphs.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.800
So let me to click on graph.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.450
So this first one is
negative x plus 15.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.220
And then press enter.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:33.610
The second equation is negative
0.447x plus 12.56.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.170
And now we're ready
to graph them.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.150
And let's see what happens.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.930
OK, so it's it looks like we're
a little bit out of the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.970
range of where you would expect
to be hanging out here.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.530
So let me change the range.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.130
Let me go into the
positive range.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.640
Which makes sense, because he
can only buy positive units of

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.710
things to begin with.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.890
Let's make the minimum
x-value here zero.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.060
Let's make the maximum
x-value here 20.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.750
Let's make the x-scale 1.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.260
The minimum y-value is 0.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.070
He can't buy a negative
number of games.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.110
Let's make y-max 20 and
y-scale is 1 and

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.360
now let's graph it.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.590
There you go.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.990
So we're sitting in the
positive quandrant.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.190
So the first graph, this one on
the top right here, this is

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.140
the orange graph.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.320
This is y is greater than or
equal to negative x plus 15.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.190
And actually, even better, so
I can color it in, I'm going

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.490
to pause the video for a second
and try to copy and

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.120
paste this image so
I can color it in.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.050
Hold on one second.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.200
So I've pasted it in here so
I can actually draw on it.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.610
So this first graph here, y is
greater than or equal to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.560
negative x plus 15, this is this
top line, because it has

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.450
a higher y-intercept than
this other guy.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.060
This guy is 12.6.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.460
So let me color it in
that same color.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.610
So it is that line
right there.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.340
You can see it has slope
of negative 1.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.085
So it's that line.

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:07.750
And we want to be greater than
or equal to that line.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.430
So we want all of the values
of above that line,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.360
including that line.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.020
We could also be equal
to that line.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.250
So it's everything
above that line.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.990
Now this blue line, this is the
other one, it's this one

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.240
right here.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.630
And we have to be less
than or equal to it.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.750
And we can see it has
a slope less than 1.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.310
Or a slope less negative
than 1.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.960
It's actually a larger number.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.000
But it's a less downward
sloping, and that's because

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.375
negative 0.44 as opposed
to negative 1.

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:41.110
And it has a lower
y-intercept.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.820
And we want all the
values below it or

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.800
equal to that line.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.540
So all of these values
over here.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.280
Now, the area that overlaps
between these two constraints,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.260
I'll do it in this yellow color,
is below the blue line,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.220
including the blue line, and
above the red line, including

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.800
the red light.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.760
So it's this area right here.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.770
So any combination of games
and music that are in that

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.010
area will meet both of
his constraints.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.160
And one thing you might want to
consider, since you can't

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.090
buy half a game or half a song,
it would only be kind of

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.630
the integer coordinates in this
region that would satisfy

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.490
his constraints.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.230
So however many games, however
many songs this is and music

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.250
is, this would satisfy
his constraints.
