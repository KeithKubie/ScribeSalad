00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.903
- [Narrator] Since
the dawn of man,

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:07.707 align:start size:97% position:3%
the black hairline has been
a symbol of protection.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.377
Literally; the further
back your hair line,

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.679
the less protection
you had from the sun.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.216 align:start position:0%
In the 300s, Africans would
mark their foreheads with black

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
to create the appearance
of a hairline.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.088 align:start size:94% position:6%
This technique did not
last with everyone though.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.024
From the the past, to today,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.394
we embark on a wonderful
journey into the world of:

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.995
the black hairline.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.867
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.977
People of all races
have hairlines of
all sizes and shapes.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.947
But why is the black
hairline so important?

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The African-American
community has built

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start size:94% position:6%
a social caste system
based solely on hairlines.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.256 align:start size:97% position:3%
Let's look at this
dramatization, for example.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.590
That's not a TV.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.027
- Wow, your hairline,

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.962
crispy AF.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.397
- I respect that.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.935 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] However, a bad
hair line warrants no respect.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.004
- Damn, your hair line,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:11.938
trash.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.074
- Wow, this disappoints me.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.943
- [Narrator] There
are different types

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.978
of African-American hairlines.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:19.913
- Straight up?

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.281
- Yeah, yeah, straight up.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.349
- [Autotune Voice] Straight up!

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Vintage Radiocaster]
From downtown.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.089
(seagulls cawing)

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Smooth Male Voice]
I'm just coolin'.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.963
- [Autotune Voice] Damn!

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.132
- [Autotune Voice] Damn!

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.567
- [Autotune Voice] Damn!

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.102 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Narrator] The
African-American woman

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.137
is greatly affected
by the hairline.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.772
- Lemme see you
without your hat.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.040
- No, I'm good,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.740 align:start size:81% position:19%
I ain't got not
line up right now,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.008
you know.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.709
- I'm sure you look
the same without.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.410
- No, I don't!

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.678
- Let me see!

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.979
- C'mon man, you're
playing too much.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380
Man, I told you I
had a new haircut.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.815
Gimme my hat back.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Narrator] The
African-American woman

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.418
does not have to worry about

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.587
the increase of facial features,

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.821
because studies show

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.224
83% of attractive women

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.060 align:start size:81% position:19%
do in fact have
big-ass foreheads.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
The popular braided
style of hair

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.265
creates tension on the hairline,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
which can confuse their
emotions to peers.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.073
What is the future of
the black hairline?

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.909
We sent our scientists to
investigate one company

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.310
that has the answer.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.980
They've been featured
on numerous magazines.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.449
They are the line elite;

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.385 align:start size:97% position:3%
a five-man company
dedicated to the crispyness

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.120
of the black haircut.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:39.192
(scissors snipping,
bottle spraying)

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:45.932
(chimes ring)

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.434
- Now in the year 2020,

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.538
the hairline will be in
the state of recession.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:55.241
2040, the hairline will be
in the state of depression.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.076
Now, by the year 2050,

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.413
the hairline will be

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.616
in the state of Texas.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we gotta fight
for the line, people.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.053
Fight for the line.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.257
- [Group Chanting]
Fight for the line.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.859
Fight for the line.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.428
Fight for the line.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.262
(group cheers)

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.931
Fight for the line.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.799
- [Narrator] Throughout
our adventures, we see

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.836
the different ways
African-Americans
express themselves.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.739 align:start size:94% position:6%
The black community
maintains its own systems

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.942
of fashion and hair culture

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:32.378
that constantly morph
and change over time.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.380
I'm Ben Putin, and this has been

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.283
Black National Geographic!
