00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.772
Diabetes mellitus has been a scourge
of the developed world

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:14.852
with an estimated 400,000,000 people
worldwide suffering from this disease,

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:17.718
and 50% more predicted
within twenty years.

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:19.108
Its early symptoms,

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:22.220
which include increased thirst
and large volumes of urine,

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:25.846
were recognized as far back
as 1500 BCE in Egypt.

00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:29.469
While the term diabetes,
meaning "to pass through,"

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:32.185
was first used in 250 BCE

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:34.970
by the Greek physician
Apollonius of Memphis,

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.510
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes,

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:40.610
associated respectively
with youth and obesity,

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.563
were identified as separate conditions

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:45.885
by Indian physicians
somewhere in the 5th century CE.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.093
But despite the disease being known,

00:00:48.117 --> 00:00:50.956
a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.548
would remain tantamount
to a death sentence

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:56.116
until the early 20th century,
its causes unknown.

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:58.702
What changed this dire situation

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.433
was the help of humanity's
longtime animal partner:

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:03.712
Canis lupus familiaris,

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.782
domesticated from Grey wolves
thousands of years ago.

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:11.095
In 1890, the German scientists
Von Mering and Minkowski

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.360
demonstrated that removing
a dog's pancreas

00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:16.321
caused it to develop
all the signs of diabetes,

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:19.498
thus establishing the organ's
central role in the disease.

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:22.177
But the exact mechanism
by which this occurred

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.381
remained a mystery until 1920,

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:27.337
when a young Canadian surgeon
named Frederick Banting

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:28.840
and his student, Charles Best,

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:31.228
advanced the findings
of their German colleagues.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:34.694
Working under Professor Macleod
at the University of Toronto,

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:38.788
they confirmed that the pancreas was
responsible for regulating blood glucose,

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:42.975
successfully treating diabetic dogs
by injecting them with an extract

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.216
they had prepared from pancreas tissue.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.163
By 1922, the researchers working
with biochemist James Collip

00:01:49.187 --> 00:01:52.235
were able to develop a similar extract
from beef pancreas

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.172
to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy,

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.654
followed by six additional patients.

00:01:57.678 --> 00:02:01.297
The manufacturing process
for this extract, now known as insulin,

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.526
was eventually turned over
to a pharmaceutical company

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.571
that makes different types
of injectable insulin to this day.

00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:09.479
Banting and Macleod received

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:12.906
the Nobel Prize for Medicine
in 1923 for their discovery.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.225
But Banting chose to share
his portion with Charles Best,

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.703
for his help in the initial
studies involving dogs.

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:23.401
But while medical experimentation
on animals remains controversial,

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:24.559
in this case at least,

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:27.709
it was not just a matter
of exploiting dogs for human needs.

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:32.119
Dogs develop diabetes at the rate
of two cases per 1,000 dogs,

00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:34.940
almost the same
as that of humans under 20.

00:02:34.964 --> 00:02:37.926
Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.526
similar to the type
that young children develop

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.982
following immune system
destruction of the pancreas,

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:44.839
and genetic studies have shown

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:48.367
that the dog disease has many
similar hallmarks of the human disease.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.813
This has allowed veterinarians
to turn the tables,

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.013
successfully using insulin
to treat diabetes

00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.578
in man's best friend for over 60 years.

00:02:56.602 --> 00:02:59.869
Many dog owners commit
to managing their dogs' diabetes

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.161
with insulin injected twice daily,
regimented feedings,

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:04.877
and periodic blood measurements

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.557
using the same home-testing
glucose monitors used by human patients.

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:12.021
And if the purified pig insulin
commonly used for dogs

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:14.443
fails to work for a particular dog,

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:17.713
the vet may even turn
to a formulation of human insulin,

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.918
bringing the process full circle.

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:22.712
After all that dogs have done
for us throughout the ages,

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.957
including their role
in a medical discovery

00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:27.194
that has saved countless human lives,

00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:31.227
using that same knowledge
to help them is the least we could do.
