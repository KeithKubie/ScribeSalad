dealing with the question of obesity you
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.690
dealing with the question of obesity you
want to eat better and not eat the kinds

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
want to eat better and not eat the kinds
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910
want to eat better and not eat the kinds
of foods that are recommended you want

of foods that are recommended you want
to eat less in general and you want to

to eat less in general and you want to
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240
to eat less in general and you want to
move more but the problem is that all of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
move more but the problem is that all of
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.839
move more but the problem is that all of
those

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849
those
 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.000
those
are not particularly good for the food

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
are not particularly good for the food
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.180
are not particularly good for the food
industry and we have a food industry

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
industry and we have a food industry
 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.080
industry and we have a food industry
that is very large Nestle very large and

that is very large Nestle very large and
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.860
that is very large Nestle very large and
makes most of its profits from the foods

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870

people so this brings us to a lot of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700
people so this brings us to a lot of
 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.199
people so this brings us to a lot of
irony's in the food system and

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209
irony's in the food system and
 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.420
irony's in the food system and
difficulties with thinking about these

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
difficulties with thinking about these
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.050
difficulties with thinking about these
things and the particular contradiction

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060
things and the particular contradiction
 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.620
things and the particular contradiction
that I like talking about is in the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630
that I like talking about is in the
 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.910
that I like talking about is in the

Agriculture's nutrition policy it says

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
Agriculture's nutrition policy it says
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.490
Agriculture's nutrition policy it says
make half of your plate fruits and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
make half of your plate fruits and
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.330
make half of your plate fruits and
vegetables sounds good to me

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
vegetables sounds good to me
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.110
vegetables sounds good to me
but if you look at the other side of US

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
but if you look at the other side of US
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.660

Department of Agriculture policy for
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.479
Department of Agriculture policy for
agriculture it does exactly the opposite

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489
agriculture it does exactly the opposite
 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.050
agriculture it does exactly the opposite
and from this particular formulation

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
and from this particular formulation
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.979
and from this particular formulation
which was agricultural subsidies from

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
which was agricultural subsidies from
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.240
which was agricultural subsidies from
2008 to 12 I think the amount of federal

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
2008 to 12 I think the amount of federal
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.610
2008 to 12 I think the amount of federal
subsidies that went to fruits and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620
subsidies that went to fruits and
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.069
subsidies that went to fruits and
vegetables a manner to less than half a

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079
vegetables a manner to less than half a
 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.920
vegetables a manner to less than half a
percent when all the rest of it went to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
percent when all the rest of it went to
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.620
percent when all the rest of it went to
corn soybeans and other kinds of foods

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630
corn soybeans and other kinds of foods
 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.170
corn soybeans and other kinds of foods
that are mostly fed to animals thereby

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
that are mostly fed to animals thereby
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.339
that are mostly fed to animals thereby
promoting a diet that's higher in meat

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349
promoting a diet that's higher in meat
 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.319
promoting a diet that's higher in meat
so the food industry has a big problem

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329
so the food industry has a big problem
 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.020
so the food industry has a big problem
we produce in the United States probably

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030
we produce in the United States probably
 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.199
we produce in the United States probably
twice as much food as is actually needed

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209
twice as much food as is actually needed
 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.020
twice as much food as is actually needed
by the population and this has led the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
by the population and this has led the
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.349
by the population and this has led the
food industry to emphasize marketing in

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359
food industry to emphasize marketing in
 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.050
food industry to emphasize marketing in
a way that it never has before

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
a way that it never has before

a way that it never has before

and to develop methods to get people to
 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.900
and to develop methods to get people to
eat more food one of which is to develop

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910
eat more food one of which is to develop
 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.229
eat more food one of which is to develop
larger portion sizes and if you look at

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239
larger portion sizes and if you look at
 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.839
larger portion sizes and if you look at
what's happened to portion sizes in the

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849
what's happened to portion sizes in the
 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.309
what's happened to portion sizes in the

they have gotten much much bigger and as

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229
they have gotten much much bigger and as

a nutrition educator if I had one thing

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680
a nutrition educator if I had one thing
 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.379
a nutrition educator if I had one thing
that I could teach the world it would

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389
that I could teach the world it would
 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.610
that I could teach the world it would
that larger portions have more calories

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620
 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.730
it's not intuitively obvious trust me on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740
it's not intuitively obvious trust me on
 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.089
it's not intuitively obvious trust me on
this one so the food industry has a

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099
this one so the food industry has a
 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.029
this one so the food industry has a
terrible problem in in that it's very

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039
terrible problem in in that it's very
 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.309
terrible problem in in that it's very
very competitive and it has to do

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319
very competitive and it has to do
 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.010
very competitive and it has to do
everything it can to sell foods to get

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
everything it can to sell foods to get
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.170
everything it can to sell foods to get
people to eat more of a company's

billions and the one that strikes me is
 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.909

particularly poignant is the 17 billion
 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.089
