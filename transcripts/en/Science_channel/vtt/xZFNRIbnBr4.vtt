00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.606
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS
DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON ICE.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.974
North: THIS CLIP IS NUMBER 1

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.075
BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE
SOMETHING TOTALLY UNEXPECTED

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:11.910
AND SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.179
Narrator: INCREDIBLE.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.881
WE TRAVELED TO LONDON
TO MEET THE ICE MAN JACK

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.083
AND HIS WHEELS OF WONDER.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.353
ANY TIME YOU TELL ANYBODY
YOU'RE AN ICE SCULPTOR,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.954
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.557
IT IS A REALLY FUN,
INTERESTING JOB TO HAVE.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.726
IT DOES VARY SO MUCH, THE WORK.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.695
I COULD BE MAKING
A 6-FOOT MILK SWAN,

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:32.531
AND THE NEXT DAY WE'RE MAKING
A GIANT ZOMBIE HAND

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.999
COMING OUT OF THE GROUND.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.269
NEXT DAY YOU'RE MAKING
A CAR DRIVING ON AN ICE WHEEL.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.504
I'D DEFINITELY SAY IT'S UP THERE

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.238
WITH ONE OF THE BEST JOBS
IN THE WORLD, YEAH.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.407
DON'T PARK THIS CAR
OUTSIDE A COCKTAIL BAR 'CAUSE

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.576
YOU COULD COME BACK AND FIND
THAT YOUR WHEELS

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.078
ARE NOW A MAI TAI.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.914
BUT IT WOULD STOP YOU
FROM DRINKING AND DRIVING.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.549
WE REALLY WORKED IT OUT
AS MUCH AS WE COULD.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.984
SO THEY HAD CONFIDENCE
IT WAS GONNA WORK.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.086
BUT THERE WAS STILL
A DEGREE OF DOUBT

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.521
IN EVERYBODY'S MIND 'CAUSE

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.823
REALLY THE WHOLE IDEA
WAS A BIT OUTLANDISH.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:01.894
BUT THE SECOND IT DID ACTUALLY
MOVE ON THOSE WHEELS WAS

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.097
A BIT OF A DELIRIOUS MOMENT
FOR EVERYONE, I THINK.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.466
AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED IT,
IT WAS HARD.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.036
BUT IT WAS IN THAT FINAL MOMENT
MADE IT ALL WORTH IT.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.404
THIS IS THE CNC MACHINE

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.606
THAT WE USED TO MAKE
THE ACTUAL ICE WHEEL.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.642
IN A MOMENT, IT'S CUTTING
QUITE A BASIC LOGO,

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.278
SO IT'S JUST
A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SHAPE,

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:22.648
WHEREAS THE WHEEL IS ACTUALLY
A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SHAPE.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.917
A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.721
Narrator: SO HOW CAN ICE WHEELS
SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF A CAR?

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.390 line:0%
THE TOTAL MASS OF THIS CAR
IS OVER 2 TONS.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.994 line:0%
THAT MEANS THAT EACH WHEEL NEEDS
TO SUPPORT OVER HALF A TON.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.563 line:0%
A BLOCK OF ICE
THE SIZE OF A WHEEL

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.065 line:0%
DOES HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.733 line:0%
TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT
OF THE CAR.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.269
BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT THE CAR
TO SIT ON BLOCKS OF ICE.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.272
THEY WANTED TO SIT ON WHEELS
THAT LOOK LIKE REAL WHEELS.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.908
Arney: BY TRYING TO MAKE
THESE WHEELS LIFELIKE,

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.611
THEY'VE GIVEN THEMSELVES
A LOAD MORE PROBLEMS.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.946
THERE'S THE THIN SPOKES
OF THE WHEELS,

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.183
WHICH ARE MUCH THINNER
THAN SOLID ICE.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.285
North: AND THEY HAD TO BOLT
STRAIGHT INTO THE ICE.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.554
THESE HOLES AND THE PRESSURE
OF THE BOLTS

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.322 line:0%
COULD CAUSE
STRESS CONCENTRATIONS

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.824 line:0%
WHICH WOULD CREATE CRACKS

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.759 line:0%
AND LEAD TO THE FAILURE
OF THE WHEELS.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.795
AND ALL OF THAT
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:13.132
FOR THE WHEEL TO REALLY
BE MADE OUT OF ICE.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.067
WELL, THE ORIGINAL PLAN
WAS TO MAKE A FULL ICE WHEEL

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.202
LIKE THIS ONE.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.636
BUT OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:18.905
IT'S QUITE DELICATE
IN THE CENTER.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.407
SO WE ACTUALLY USED
TWO FACADES OF ICE

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.409
THAT CLAMP
ONTO THIS ACRYLIC RIM.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.845
THIS WAY THE ACRYLIC
WAS CARRYING THE BULK

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.246
OF THE LOAD OF THE CAR.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.415
IN FACT, ACRYLICS
COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.017
CAN BE 10 TIMES STRONGER
THAN THAT OF ICE.

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:33.286
AND OBVIOUSLY IT
WAS CRYSTAL-CLEAR,

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.722
SO YOU BARELY NOTICED IT WAS
THERE IN THE FINAL SHOT,

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.922
WHICH WAS GREAT.

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.958
YOU COULD SAY THEY'RE CHEATING,

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.895
BUT I THINK THEY'VE TAKEN
SOME BRILLIANT PHYSICS

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:46.398
AND USED IT TO CREATE
AN INCREDIBLE SPECTACLE.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.433
NICE JOB, GUYS.
