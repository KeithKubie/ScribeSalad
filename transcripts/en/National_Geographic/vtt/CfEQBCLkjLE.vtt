00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.977
I want to leave you with
this one last little story.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:17.417
This story about
the moments before

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.886
<i> before my day of
 reckoning, really, okay?</i>

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:24.657
<i> On our last expedition, I came
 down off this mountain top</i>

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.093
<i> and these trucks
 pulled up to our camp.</i>

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.360
And they were shamans.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.396
There were these seven shamans

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:33.099
who had showed up at the
base of the Burkhan Khaldun

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.135
this mountain to
pay tribute to...

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.936
Genghis Khan.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:41.007
And Professor Ishdorj comes
to me and he goes, "Albert...

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:47.113
the head shaman wants to see
the leader of our group."

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.482
( audience laughter )

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.419
I was like, "Oh, shoot!"

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:54.520
( audience laughter )

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.223
<i> This is the moment
 before, you know</i>

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:00.827
<i> I've a little bit of
 video, not a lot.</i>

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:08.902
( speaking in Mongolian )

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.574
I can't say
I'm not nervous.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.643
I'm terrified, okay!

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.211
Like, what's going
to happen here.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.146
And these guys are
running around preparing,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.615
and you've got that arrow, you
know, pointed up at the mountain

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:26.819
and the shaman is putting
on, you know, his gown.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.789
And what else could I do...

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.025
( sound of pounding
on rustic drums )

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.028
<i> You know, you couldn't
 even see his face</i>

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.964
because he was covered in
this black, this black felt

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.232
that wouldn't allow
you to see his eyes.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:44.303
<i> But he had these big eyeballs
 painted on to his headband</i>

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.706
<i> and these huge feathers...</i>

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.508
these huge massive
feathers that went from

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.812
you know, above his
headband into the sky.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.382
And he had these massive
dreadlock-like things

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.683
flapping around him as

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:59.719
the pounding got
more and more intense.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.621
Boom, boom, boom over my head
and my heart started pounding

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.089
<i> with the same rhythm
 underneath him</i>

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:08.127
<i> as he is pounding over my
 head and I'm literally stuck</i>

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.431
like a stone to the
ground, terrified.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:16.035
( sound of pounding
on rustic drums )

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.503
And then it just stops.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:22.709
( sound of pounding
on rustic drums )

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.043
And he falls to the ground

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.246
you know, he just
sort of collapses.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:31.384
And he just asks me these
really simple questions, like

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.354
"what's your name,
when were you born..."

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.124
You know, then he asked me

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.226
"why am I here?"

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.362
And I'm sitting there and I'm...

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:47.800
And I tried to give this great
explanation, you know, like

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.670
the whole deal with the
technology and the search

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.406
and why we're doing
it all, and...

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:57.577
you know, it's a
long explanation and it gets

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:02.214
translated into Mongolian and
a little bit gets lost there.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.683
By the time it gets
to the attendant

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.052
who is translating it from
Mongolian to ancient Mongolian

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:09.288
it's like one or two words,
you know.

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:10.689
( audience laughter )

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.158
And...

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.327
I'm like, "Wow, didn't
really work out."

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:18.631
And I am sitting there
and the shaman just

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.933
he doesn't even care,
you know.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:25.070
And he starts talking, he
was like, "it doesn't matter

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.307
about the technology," he says.

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:32.945
He says,
"I was sent here

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:37.916
by my own soul to try to
know more about my past.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:41.120
<i> And it's my intentions
 that matter."</i>

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.725
<i> And he says, "Go off and tell
 the world about this story.</i>

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:50.162
<i> And then your intentions
 will be true.</i>

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.798
<i> For you will have
 followed through with</i>

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.500
what you told me."
You know.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.971
"Stay true to your traditions,
stay true to your honor

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.807
but do this, tell the
story of our mountain."

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.278
So, today I am standing
around you, you know

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:08.547
at the National Geographic
headquarters

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:11.651
years after I launched
this project

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.886
which has totally
changed my life.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.022
And you are just

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.359
so deeply in my heart...

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.629
the edge of that journey,
the continuing part of that.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.398
You are the reason
why I did it all.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:29.369
And now you are part
of that whole story.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.771
So, thank you very much.

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.377
( applause )
