00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey guys! We are back in the lab with a

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.750
10 pound block of dry ice to answer the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.879
question: what does dry ice do in a vacuum

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.680
chamber? The request for this experiment

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.510
came in the comments from Jason Gamer.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.759
Thanks for your question, Jason. I'm sending $25

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.830
your way. Now dry ice is solid carbon

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.969
dioxide with a temperature of about

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.640
-190 degrees fahrenheit but that's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.529
at sea level. If we put it in a vacuum

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.449
chamber and suck the air out, the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.039
pressure changes and the properties of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.240
the dry ice change as well.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.590
Now people ask all the time, "Where do you

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.180
even get dry ice?" I just went down to the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.560
grocery store and picked this up for about

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.150
thirteen dollars. They usually have a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.199
container near the front of the store

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.489
where they keep it. You can get some as

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.870
long as you're over 18.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.559
Okay, Cool! Let's jump right in. *muffled* Gloves make this hard to work with. Being safe

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.500
is so restrictive.  Ooh, good stuff. Hey just a thought will

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.090
your tongue stick to dry ice if you lick it?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.200
Apparently not but it is a little fizzy.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.500
My tongues a little cold *Laughs* Ok so one problem

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.820
guys, this isn't gonna fit in there, we're gonna have

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.010
smash it up a little bit, so let's grab a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.260
hammer, and go to work.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.260
Oh.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.180
You think I could karate chop this in half?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.100
Ahhh... *Grant is proud of himself* WOOOOOOO

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.180
It was a lot harder than I thought and it actually

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.259
did hurt quite a bit but WE DID IT! We

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:22.979
did it.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.159
THAT is how you break dry ice! There we go,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.359
alright cool

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.239
we've got a few chunks of dry ice in there. Listen to that...

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.490
Our dry ice is having a private moment... Look

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.020
at the way the vapor is falling out and filling

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.670
up the container. Right now what it's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.619
doing is pushing the oxygen out and filling

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.570
the container with carbon dioxide. So we got

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.979
a few good chunks of dry ice in our

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.329
vacuum chamber, let's go ahead and put on

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.280
the lid, close the valve, get this thing

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.780
fired up. Let's see what happens.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.679
Alright so it actually is pulling vacuum

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.020
pressure. It's probably not the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.670
smartest idea to be using a glass

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.619
container because the dry ice can actually

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.179
cool down the glass of the bottom while

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.530
the glass of the top stays warm. So that

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.819
creates a difference in temperature that

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.099
could expose the glass to shattering and

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.500
imploding. So, this is a little bit dangerous. From

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.180
here I can see the gauge is probably

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.220
around 23 inches of mercury which is

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.230
about as low as that vacuum pump can pull.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.849
I'm going to close this valve and turn

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.329
off the vacuum pump. Watch the gauge as I do.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.820
Now it's about 22 inches of mercury

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.280
but as the dry ice continues to vaporize

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.530
that carbon dioxide you can see the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.090
container actually starts repressurizing

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.849
and the gauge is dropping in pressure. So just to

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.440
go a little bit further, let's release

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.730
the pressure. Let's add a little bit of

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.319
warm water to get this thing vaping a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.640
little bit and then turn the vacuum chamber

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.540
back on. Let's open the valve in 3,2,1

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.500
Sweet dry ice vapor. Actually smells like

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.640
vinegar and I think that's because of the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.760
proto putty. *laughs* I just poured some hot water

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.260
it's about the hottest I could get it out of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.209
my tap, and pouring it will actually help

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.739
insulate the bottom of the glass as well

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.049
and reduce the chances of it imploding on

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.250
us

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.760
oh that's cool

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.260
oh man, who doesn't love dry ice?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.060
Surprisingly I can actually breathe that quite well I

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.409
mean I thought I'd be seeing my lungs

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.450
like if you put right into a balloon and

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.640
breathe it but I could breathe just fine

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.989
Let's go ahead and add the rest of it. So we

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.569
now have hot water dry ice in our vacuum

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.650
chamber so let's go ahead and put the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.120
lid on and see what happens when turn on

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.879
this time.  This valve open this valve

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.069
closed you can see if I actually try to

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.290
hold this container close the lid will

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.459
actually start popping up there's

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.260
nothing I can do about it. If I open the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.450
exhaust valve we can actually get

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.180
dry ice vapor... shooting out-  that looks cool!

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.230
that's right out of the movies like a

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.389
busted pipe line or something

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.299
ok let's close that off and turn on the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:07.130
vacuum. 3... 2...1...

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.690
oh and we actually are pulling vaccuum

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.160
pressure, that's surprising to me

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.140
because with how much vapors coming off

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.520
I wonder if that would kinda neutralize,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.130
if it's equalize. But we're at about 13 inches of

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.770
mercury right now and steadily increasing so

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.510
there used to be a really dense thick

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.520
white fog and that has been reduced the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.930
point where i can actually see the dry

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.120
blocks inside. There still is a white

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.820
vapor but that is slowly being pulled

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.140
out if you look closely you can even see

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.420
a little bit of that paper flowing down

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.880
the tube here to the vacuum pump. I'm not

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.410
exactly sure how good it is to be

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.760
running carbon dioxide and water vapor

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.310
into a vacuum pump for you guys it's for

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.120
science

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.590
alright so update guys were down to about

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.020
20 inches of mercury now let's just flip

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.760
the valve open let all the air back in

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.740
and see what happens now you can hear

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.330
bubbling again that's interesting

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.370
we tried a massive amount of dry ice in a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.570
container what would happen if we just

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.760
tried a very small amount of dry ice? Let's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.320
break off a small chunk, throw it into our pressure

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.460
cooker and just see what happens there

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.910
Throw that in, set the vacuum on... the gage is rising, rising

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.990
fast; that looks good. Yeah that's a lot faster than when we

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.970
had all that dry ice in there. We're

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.660
almost at as far as this thing can go right now

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.840
22 inches of mercury oh wow look the dry ice is

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640
shaking a little bit like vibrating

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.730
look's really nervous right now. If I

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.380
grab this lid and shake it there's no

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.240
way that's coming off but interestingly

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.820
enough like the dry ice isn't doing much

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.830
in there it's still sublimating like it

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.180
normally would but I don't know if it's

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.040
sublimating any faster but I really have

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.830
no way to gauge that so yeah dry ice in a

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.900
vacuum is very anti-climatic nothing's

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.860
really happening

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.660
so there you have a guy's a very fun and

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.090
very cool experiment with dry ice in a

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.250
vacuum chamber and thanks again to Jason

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.260
gamer for a question this experiment. If

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.730
any of you have experiments want to see

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.320
me try, post your suggestions down

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.670
below thanks for joining me for this

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.440
video, I'll be looking for the next one

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.800
talk to you then.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800
*Vibrating Noise* Excuse you
