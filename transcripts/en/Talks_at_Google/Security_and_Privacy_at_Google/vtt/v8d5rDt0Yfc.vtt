[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.280
SPEAKER: Ryan Shapiro
is a PhD candidate

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.370
at MIT, a former researcher
affiliate at Berkman Klein

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.310
Center for Internet and
Society at Harvard, now

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.740
the co-founder and director
of the nonprofit transparency

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.430
organization, Property
of the People.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.560
"Political" has called Ryan
a "Freedom of Information Act

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.220
guru."

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.803
The "Nation" has
described Ryan's work

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.080
as "a ray of hope in these
dark political times."

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.582
Michigan University Professor
of Journalism and TED Senior

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:31.790
Fellow, Will Potter, has
called Ryan "the FBI's worst

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.074
nightmare."

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.240
Without any further ado,
I'd like to introduce Ryan.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:42.605
RYAN SHAPIRO: All
right, it's green.

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:49.230
Thank you so much for having me.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.780
Is this-- is this good?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.280
This volume?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.200
Hooray.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.991
All right, thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.850
It's a real genuine honor for
me to be here speaking with you.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.280
So yeah, some things about me.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.700
I'm a long time animal rights
and social justice activist,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.520
a transparency activist,
a PhD candidate at MIT

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.710
where I am an historian of
the political functioning

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.180
of national security and
the policing of dissent.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.050
And I'm also the
co-founder and director

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.810
of the nonprofit transparency
organization, Property

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.460
of the People.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.910
So I'm at Google,
so I'm going to give

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.140
a talk about search protocols.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.170
This is a talk about the FBI,
record systems, and democracy,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.290
but first, we're going to take
just a little trip down memory

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.472
lane.

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:43.680
So I've always liked animals.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.170
Here is me as a little
kid with a goat.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.360
And I got into radical
politics and punk rock

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.320
at a very early age.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.480
Here is me in eighth grade.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.300
And around the same
time, influenced

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.890
by punk rock and radical
politics, I became vegetarian,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.467
and then a few years
later, I became vegan.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.050
Learning about how
animals are treated

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.600
on factory farms, confined
in spaces so small

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.140
they can't stand, turn
around, or spread their limbs.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.900
And this had a big impact on me.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.900
And so I grew up in DC
and then I went to college

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.730
at NYU for undergrad.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.730
And while in New York, I started
coordinating above ground

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.240
direct action campaigns-- civil
disobedience style campaigns.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.680
This is my first arrest.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.544
I'm not the first guy
but the second guy.

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:36.960
We're locked in
these metal pipes.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.690
This is the ramp to
Ringling Brothers' circus.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.990
We are preventing the elephants
from getting into the circus,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.610
shutting down the circus.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.410
They weren't able
to get in but they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.880
were able to stand above us and
the ring folks kept them there

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.400
until they urinated on us and we
marinated for hours in elephant

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.070
urine, and then we were brought
into jail in southeast DC.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.180
Stinking of elephant
urine is quite something.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.910
At NYU, I coordinated a takeover
of the president's office

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.410
to shut down a laboratory where
they were forcing chimpanzees

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.520
to smoke crack.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.670
Here I am locked inside
a concrete barrel

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.790
to protest the sale of fur.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.451
Here is another shot of that.

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:22.200
This is what it looks
like getting it out.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.070
They have to use
jackhammers and--

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.360
and you know, when I left
New York, I moved to Hawaii

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.420
and co-coordinated a campaign
to shut down a captive dolphin

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.680
facility in a shopping mall.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.860
We were making
surfboard protests.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.860
Here, I sabotaged whale
hunts riding jet skis,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.640
in between the gunboats
and the whales.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.750
And so this is all in the mid
'90s, late '90s, early 2000s.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.350
And then, around 2002, along
with some other activists

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.300
who I'd worked
with for some time,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.130
I co-coordinated a year-long
undercover investigation

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.770
of foie gras-producing
factory farms in New York

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.770
and in California and we openly
rescued a number of animals

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.720
from those farms.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.630
Here's me rescuing
one of the ducks

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.250
from a foie gras factory
farm in New York.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.680
We made a documentary about it.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.560
I did go to NYU
undergrad for film.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.720
And we got prosecuted for
doing this in 2003 and 2004.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.400
We were facing felony
burglary charges.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.660
This is Sarahjane Blum.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.269
She and I were facing felony
burglary charges in New York.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.810
I was getting a
master's degree in DC

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.435
at the time in modern
American history.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.640
And to my surprise, we ended
up beating the charges.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.050
And so this brings us up to 2004
and I had a bit of a dilemma,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.200
because in 2004, there was
this massive legislative

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.060
and legal and
prosecutorial shift.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.169
In 2004, the FBI designated
the animal rights

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.710
and environmental movements to
the number one domestic terror

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.792
threats in the United
States, despite the fact

00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:08.250
that neither of
these movements has

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.140
ever physically injured a single
person once in this country.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.010
And yet, number one
domestic terror threat.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.560
Not militia movements,
white power movements,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.380
anti-abortion folks--
people who kill people,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.880
people who try to kill people--

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.660
but puppy huggers
and tree huggers.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.050
And there was also, shortly
after that, the passage

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.060
of the Animal Enterprise
Terrorism Act,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.230
or AETA, which is a piece of
pernicious post-911 legislation

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.690
that's essentially a Patriot
Act explicitly targeting

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.960
animal rights and
environmental protesters.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.000
And there was also
the prosecution

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.220
of some of my closest
friends and colleagues

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.130
under federal felony terrorism
charges for running an animal

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.100
rights website.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.370
They are known as the SHAC 7.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.980
I kid you not.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.315
And all of this was part of
what journalist Will Potter has

00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:58.440
termed "the green scare"--
the disproportionate use

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.690
of the rhetoric and apparatus
of national security

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.820
to marginalize animal
rights activists

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.750
and environmental activists
as threats to the state.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.210
Will's excellent book,
"Green is the New Red,"

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.460
talks about this if you're
interested in learning more.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.212
So, as I said, I had
something of a dilemma.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.670
I didn't know what to do next
because the model of activism

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.269
that I'd pursued, along
with many other folks,

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:24.810
for the previous
decade with impunity

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.110
was overnight terrorism.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.130
And so, like lots of folks who
don't know what to do next,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.230
I stayed in grad school
and I started work on a PhD

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.480
at the University of California
Santa Barbara, program

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.650
in the history of
science, trying

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.170
to figure out how we got
to this state of affairs.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.440
And then I went over
to MIT, where I am now,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.560
finishing up my PhD there.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.890
And so, you know,
my dissertation--

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.200
I'm interested in how we got
to this state of affairs.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.450
How did the FBI come to
understand the animal rights

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.400
and environmental movements as
the number one domestic terror

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.220
threats in the country?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.490
How did the animal rights
and environmental movements

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.304
first come to the
attention of the FBI?

00:07:06.304 --> 00:07:08.220
What was the role of
industry in this process?

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.640
And again, number one
domestic terror threat?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:18.000
So my professional
training as an historian

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.510
is primarily archival research--
at least it was at that time.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.490
And while some portions
of my dissertation--

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.960
I'm looking at a 100-year span
of the use of the rhetoric

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.380
and apparatus to target animal
protectionists in the United

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.880
States--

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.880
some of it, I was
able to use archival--

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.360
you know, standard
historian's archival tools.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.969
But for the more
modern stuff, so

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:40.260
starting with the emergence
of the modern animal rights

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.790
movement in the 1970s and
certainly with FBI involvement,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.760
there's not really going
to be any archives that

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.180
are going to be of use here.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.672
So I realized I would need--

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:53.130
I was like, I'll try to use
the Freedom of Information Act.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.270
I didn't know anything
about FOIA at the time,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.960
but I did know that it was
going to be the only way that I

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.150
might be able to get anything.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.550
So, you know, not knowing
anything about FOIA,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.425
I shot off a FOIA
request to the FBI

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:10.260
and I asked for records on me.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.630
And the FBI turned
around and they

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.130
said they don't have anything.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.632
They actually said they
can't find anything, but--

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:20.965
no records responsive to your
FOIA request were located.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.300
I'll be honest, I
was a little hurt.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.690
You know, I thought I was
more important than that,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.010
but that's all right, you know?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.690
I could take it.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.065
It's fine.

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:32.690
It's all right.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.659
It's all right.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.950
But I really wanted records
and I was looking for a way

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.530
in and so Sarahjane Blum, the
activist who I pointed out

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.740
earlier, when we were arrested
for the foie gras undercover

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.762
investigation and open
rescue back in '03--

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:51.220
we were arrested
for the same thing

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.765
but we were arrested separately.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.640
I was arrested just by
New York State Police,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.015
but when Sarah
Jane was arrested,

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:58.569
she was arrested by New York
State Police and an FBI agent.

00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:00.610
So I was like, OK, well
I'm not important enough.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.130
I wasn't important enough
to warrant an FBI file,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.350
but Sarah Jane obviously was.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.150
I mean, there was
an FBI agent there.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.480
So she kindly gave me
her written permission--

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.110
her consent--

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.790
to submit a request about her.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.380
That doesn't mean the FBI
has to give me her files,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.963
it just means they can't use her
personal privacy as an excuse

00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:18.290
to withhold them from me.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.030
And so I submitted
the request on her.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.100
And again, the
results came back.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.070
Same thing.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.740
Hey, look, we couldn't
find anything.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.230
I was like, well, that's
weird but all right.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.870
I was like, OK, I know what.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.492
I have this other
friend of mine.

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:34.200
The FBI has chased
her around the country

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.340
with a warrant for her DNA.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.710
They've raided her storage
unit on multiple occasions.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.690
They've arrested her
on multiple occasions.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.700
She's done time for
grand jury resistance.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.580
The FBI is obsessed
with this woman--

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.500
with this wonderful
person and activist.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.708
The FBI is obsessed with her.

00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:50.730
She definitely has a file
and, like, a giant file.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.680
So she kindly gave me
her written consent

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.910
to submit a request on her.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.492
So I was like, all right, now
we're going to get somewhere.

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.090
Eh, the same thing happens.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.465
They turn around and was like,
no, I don't have anything.

00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:01.900
I was like, oh, I get it.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.400
I'm sorry.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.560
This is my fault.
This is my bad.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.950
I'm being lied to and I was
naive and didn't get it.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.490
I mean, the thing is, I hated
the FBI basically forever.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.250
I grew up as a punk rock kid
listening to the Dead Kennedys.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.890
My first research paper ever
was in eighth grade about Sacco

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.390
and Vanzetti, two
Italian anarchists

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:23.090
who were ultimately murdered
by what would become the FBI--

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.787
or, well, they were executed
by the state and the FBI was--

00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:28.620
or the Bureau of
Investigation at the time--

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.994
was heavily involved.

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:31.410
I read Brian Glick's
"War at Home"

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.080
about the FBI's COINTELPRO or
counterintelligence programs

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.190
where the FBI targeted
the civil rights

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.710
movements, the black
power movement,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.670
the anti-war movement.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.070
I read that when it came out
when I was in eighth grade.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.320
So I hated the FBI forever,
but for some reason,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.650
I had naively believed
that the FBI RIDS,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.900
the Records/Information
Dissemination Section--

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.047
that's their FOIA
division at the FBI--

00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:55.470
I naively believed that FBI
RIDS, their FOIA division,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.260
would be not mission-driven
like the rest of the FBI

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.890
but just sort of a
bureaucratic outpost.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.390
I was like, you know, when
I got back the third denial

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.130
letter, my friend who I know
she's got a massive file,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.130
it's like, OK, I get it.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.050
This is my fault.
I'm being lied to.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.110
This is my bad.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:17.750
And no one likes being lied
to, but I get real twitchy

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.830
about it.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.590
And you know, we
all have qualities

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.420
that at some times
in our lives prove

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.960
more adaptive or maladaptive,
depending on the circumstances,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.200
and my OCD need for
conflict and contempt

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.280
for federal
intelligence agencies,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.320
it's not always been the most
conducive to positive outcomes.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.420
But in this case, it
worked out very well.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.390
And I started to become
obsessed not only

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.950
with trying to get records
about FBI campaigns

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.158
against the animal rights
and environmental movements

00:11:45.158 --> 00:11:48.560
but trying to map out the
nature of FBI noncompliance

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.240
with the Freedom
of Information Act

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.180
because you know, the Freedom of
Information Act is federal law

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.340
and the FBI is the leading
federal law enforcement

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.136
agency in the country
and this means

00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.760
we have the outrageous
state of affairs

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.170
in which the leading
federal law enforcement

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.128
agency in the country is
in routine in flagrant

00:12:04.128 --> 00:12:05.930
violation of federal law.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.310
And the question is, how?

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.110
How is the FBI systematically
avoiding compliance

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.700
with the Freedom
of Information Act?

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.200
And so that question
increasingly

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.810
became as and then
more important to me

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.330
than the original questions I
was asking about FBI campaigns

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.413
against animal rights and
environmental movements.

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:23.719
And so I started submitting
hundreds and hundreds

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:24.760
of experimental requests.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.460
I got signed privacy waivers
from 250 leading animal rights

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.460
activists from the
1970s to the present,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.300
submitting hundreds of
requests trying to get records

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.050
in different ways.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.605
Started submitted FOIA requests
about my FOIA requests,

00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:37.540
which we'll come back to later.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.480
I scoured-- you know, I
was scouring FOIA case law

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:48.050
to try and find anything that
I could that would be helpful.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.890
Here's my dog and
best friend, Ihi,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.520
helping out with the
secondary literature review.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.340
Here he is again
because he's the best.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:03.320
And so, you know,
in the process,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.940
two things became
apparent to me.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.070
The FBI does nearly
everything in its power

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.160
to avoid compliance with the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.560
Indeed, if FOIA work
with some agencies is

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.250
akin to trying to get customer
service over a holiday weekend

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.010
from a giant telecom,
FOIA with the FBI

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.980
is akin to a street fight.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.570
And number two, essential to
making FOIA work with the FBI,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.800
it was developing an
intimate familiarity

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.720
with the Bureau's
FOIA-specific information

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.330
storage and retrieval systems.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.430
And using the techniques
that I mentioned--

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.510
the experimental
techniques that I mentioned

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.110
and a bunch of others,
I did just that.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.270
And this really
started to pay off.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.556
If the FBI has x amount of
first-round dirty tricks

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.930
that they use to
avoid compliance

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.190
with Freedom of
Information Act requests,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.190
you know, I mapped out
a good number of them.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.720
And I started getting a
lot of documents-- in fact,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.060
thousands and
thousands of pages--

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.685
about FBI campaigns against the
animal rights and environmental

00:13:55.685 --> 00:13:57.230
movements, including--

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.100
oh, that's not where I
thought that would be.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:12.330
Well, either way, so here I am.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.120
So we'll say hi to Ihi again.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.900
Yeah.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.519
And the FBI said,
oh, that's real cute.

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.310
You're very clever.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.850
Look at you.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.700
You've got all these documents.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.350
You should be very
proud of yourself.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.380
Watch what we can do.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.740
And then they sat on their
hands because the Freedom

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.406
of Information Act is one of the
most under-appreciated elements

00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:36.880
of the entire
American experiment.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.170
The notion that the
records of government

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.340
are the property of
the people and all

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.100
we need to do to get them is
to ask for them is radically

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.680
democratic but FOIA is broken.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.430
And one of the main
reasons FOIA is broken

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.480
is that there are no
penalties for noncompliance.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.970
So an agency that
doesn't want to comply,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.470
or in the case of
the FBI, an agency

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.310
that is overtly hostile to the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.600
has no incentive to comply.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.100
And so they just
sat on their hands.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.480
And an agency only
has 20 working days

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.590
to comply with a request--

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.190
not to give me the records
but to process the request--

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.730
and they sat on these
requests for years.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.494
So I sued.

00:15:05.494 --> 00:15:07.660
I mean, FOIA's toothless
but it has this baby tooth.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.243
There's no penalties
for noncompliance

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:11.330
but you can sue an agency
for failure to comply.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.390
So I teamed up with Jeffrey
Light, who is a brilliant FOIA

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.190
specialist attorney with
politics similar to my own,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.690
and we sued the FBI for
failure to comply with FOIA

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.206
because they took
way, way, way too long

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:31.210
to comply with my request--

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.460
or my requests.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.810
And sorry, here.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.220
That's a little awkward.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.170
Yeah.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.510
And so what's supposed to
happen in a circumstance

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.300
like this is you go in and
the judge is like, OK, FBI,

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.008
you're obviously in
violation of the law.

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:50.110
When are you going to comply?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.199
Not when are you going
to give the documents

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:54.740
but when are you going to figure
out what you're going to do?

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.947
And instead of negotiating
with me via my counsel--

00:15:58.947 --> 00:16:01.030
you know, they want to do
it in a year and a half.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.440
I want it yesterday.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.017
Maybe we'll agree on a
calendar of nine months.

00:16:05.017 --> 00:16:07.600
The FBI comes in and invokes the
nuclear option of a FOIA case

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.970
called an open America state.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.690
They say they want seven years--

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.580
actually unprecedented--
to just think

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.300
about how to respond
to my FOIA requests.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.670
Doing so, they are relying on--

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.090
they revived a Cold
War-era FOIA secrecy

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.720
doctrine known as the
Mosaic Theory of Information

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.080
in order to argue that my MIT
dissertation FOIA research

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.554
methodologies are themselves
a threat to national security,

00:16:34.554 --> 00:16:36.970
which is the nicest thing that
anyone's ever said about me

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.377
and will look great on the cover
of the book, but keep in mind,

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.710
the FBI is not arguing that
the release of the documents

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.650
that I've requested would
threaten national security

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.510
but rather that
deciding whether or not

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.640
to release the
documents to me would

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.310
threaten national security.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.250
And further, the purported
risk to national security

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.470
posed by my
dissertation research

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.400
is ostensibly so grave that the
FBI can't even talk about it.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.481
Indeed, the FBI's primary
support for its argument

00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:10.689
came in the form of an ex
parte in camera declaration

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:13.069
to a secret letter from the
counter-terrorism division

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:17.530
of the FBI to the judge
about why they can't tell us

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.530
why my FOIA dissertation
research methodology is

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.011
a threat to national security.

00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:24.260
And this is an especially
circular and Kafkaesque line

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.550
of argument.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.527
The FBI considers it a
national security threat

00:17:27.527 --> 00:17:29.360
to make public its
reasoning for considering

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.970
it a national security threat
to use federal law to request

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.440
information about
the FBI's deeply

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.945
problematic understanding of
national security threats.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.120
And it's important to remember
that though the FBI doesn't

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.320
want damning records about
it coming out whether they

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.584
be about campaigns against
the animal rights movement,

00:17:53.584 --> 00:17:55.250
the environmental
movement, or whatever,

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.840
that's not what this
is really about.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.580
Rather, the FBI's
core motivation

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.610
here is maintaining
its functional immunity

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.150
from the Freedom
of Information Act.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.940
And this brings us to
FBI record systems.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.640
So one of the core ways that
the FBI maintains its immunity

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.410
from FOIA is through its
failure-by-design FOIA search

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.000
protocols.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.110
Since its earliest days, the
FBI has used political dissent

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.750
as a threat, and since the
Freedom of Information Act

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.020
was first amended in
1974 to apply to the FBI

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.650
and other intelligence
agencies, the FBI

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.670
has understood FOIA
in the same light--

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.600
as a threat-- and has done
functionally everything

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.510
within their power
to avoid compliance.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.689
Indeed, in 2009, the
National Security Archive--

00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:47.480
a great transparency
organization based out

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.520
of George Washington
University--

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.057
gave the FBI its hoax
Rosemary Award for "worst

00:18:54.057 --> 00:18:55.640
Freedom of Information
Act performance

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.420
by a federal agency"
for "outstandingly bad

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.830
responsiveness to
the public that

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.410
flaunts the letter and spirit
of the Freedom of Information

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.860
Act."

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:10.280
In like spirit, a related 2009
"Associated Press" article

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.770
decried FBI abuses
of FOIA and it

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.080
opened by asserting, "if
information were a river,

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.840
the FBI would be a dam."

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.540
So, over the years, the FBI
has established countless means

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.760
by which to avoid
compliance with FOIA.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.190
One of the chief means by
which the FBI accomplishes

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.870
this is to search for
records in such a way

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.290
that the search routinely
fails by design.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.840
The National Security
Archives 2009 study

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.730
found that on
average, the FBI fails

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:42.140
to locate any records at all
for every two out of three FOIA

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.720
requests.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.710
That's a failure rate
five times higher

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.231
than other agencies on average.

00:19:48.231 --> 00:19:49.980
And you could say,
well maybe the FBI just

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.470
gets a lot of crappy requests.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.156
That's not-- that
would be wrong.

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:57.280
I mean, I'm sure they get
a lot of crappy requests,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.660
but that is not what
is happening here.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.120
So, the Freedom of
Information Act, the statute,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.780
it doesn't require an
agency to locate records.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.620
It requires an agency to conduct
a search reasonably calculated

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.800
to locate responsive records.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.100
And by utilizing a deliberately
deficient FOIA search

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.990
methodology, the
FBI superficially

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.022
appears to be in
compliance with FOIA

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.980
without having to actually
locate and therefore

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.400
potentially release
many records.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.400
So how exactly does this work?

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.460
Today we're going to take
a look at a key part of it.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.420
So FBI RIDS-- the
FOIA division at FBI--

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.610
asserts that nearly all records
responsive to nearly all FOIA

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.270
requests will be maintained
within the FBI's Central

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.450
Records System, or CRS.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.270
And this is problematic
on a number of levels.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.930
There are many FBI records that
are not contained in the CRS,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.620
including the ELSUR indices--
the electronic surveillance

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.060
records.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.840
The FBI's indices for searching
for electronic surveillance

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.910
records are separate from the
CRS and cannot be searched

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.387
using a CRS search.

00:21:13.387 --> 00:21:14.970
But either way, we're
not really going

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.530
to deal with ELSUR
records right now

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.110
and we're really just going
to be looking at the CRS.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.770
So the CRS does
have a huge amount

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.570
of records in it-- about 115
million records-- not pages,

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.070
but records.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.160
It's the FBI's main
investigative database.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.890
And in fact, it's
basically the same CRS

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.640
that J. Edgar Hoover
helped design in 1921.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.070
So the FBI got--

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.370
its inception was in 1908 when
the attorney general appointed

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.000
some special agents in 1909.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.600
It took the name Bureau
of Investigation.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.860
And between 1909 and 1921,
the Bureau of Investigation

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.160
experimented with a whole number
of records management systems

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.440
and they were all
totally failures.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.260
In fact, it was so bad that
in 1920, the FBI gave--

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.530
or the Bureau of Investigation--
gave up entirely and just gave

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.660
all of its records to the DOJ.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.750
In 1921, the DOJ said, no, thank
you, and gave the records back

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.290
to the Bureau of
Investigation, at which point

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.890
J. Edgar Hoover helped
design what ultimately became

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.180
the Central Records System.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.630
Notably, Hoover's first job
was an entry-level position

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.680
at the Library of Congress,
and so he cared deeply

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.140
about records management
and brought that knowledge

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.990
to bear in designing the
CRS and it's the same CRS

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.632
that we deal with today.

00:22:35.632 --> 00:22:37.090
But those FOIA
requests [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.390
that is the FBI's main
investigative database.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.600
So, according to the FBI, the
CRS itself cannot actually be

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.544
searched.

00:22:48.544 --> 00:22:49.960
It's a little
unclear why this is.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:56.170
It's probably because the CRS
is in fact a paper database

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.470
of 115 million records.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.170
And so, to search
the CRS, the FBI

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:08.360
created something
called the ACS in 1995,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.700
which more or less mirrors
the CRS and is searchable.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.800
Between 1921 and 1995,
there's essentially-- well,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.320
between 1921 and
the early 1970s,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.810
there was no automated
search capacity.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.160
Between 1970 and '79,
there was a teeny bit.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.370
But through '95, there was
extremely little functional

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.410
search capacity of
an automated fashion.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:39.220
In '95, the ACS comes in-- the
Automated Case Support system.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.250
And while the ACS is
definitely better than nothing,

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.720
it is still garbage.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.040
It is a garbage search platform.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.560
Indeed, the inherent
deficiencies of the ACS

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.360
are so severe that they extend
well beyond the world of FOIA.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.060
In 2005, the Department
of Justice's Office

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.180
of the Inspector General
itself concluded that there

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.377
were national security--

00:24:03.377 --> 00:24:04.960
this was the document
I wanted before.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.710
I apologize for that.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.140
So here we go.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.190
What we have here--

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:17.930
one of the documents that I
got about animal rights stuff

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.520
showed that the FBI considered
pursuing federal terrorism

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.709
charges against people who take
pictures of animals trapped

00:24:25.709 --> 00:24:27.500
in cages so small they
can't stand up, turn

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.340
around, or spread their limbs.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.000
And the "LA Times"
wrote about it

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.499
and I was certainly
distressed to see my own name

00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:36.290
under the people that
they were considering

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.540
pursuing federal terrorism
charges for taking pictures

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.430
of animals trapped in cages.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:48.170
But back to the DOJ
OIG's 2005 report,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.130
which said that there are
national security implications

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.460
because the FBI is continuing
to rely on the ACS,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.620
which hampers FBI
agents and analysts

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.410
from adequately searching
and sharing information

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.310
from their investigative files.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.860
The 2005 DOJ OIG
report further found

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.020
that the need for a new
automated investigative case

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.330
management system to replace the
existing obsolete and limited

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.440
ACS system is vital
to the FBI's ability

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.540
to perform its
mission effectively.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:25.000
And the 2005 DOJ OIG report also
further found the critical need

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.030
to replace the ACS, the FBI's
obsolete case management

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.880
system, remains.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.630
And starkly, the very
first recommendation

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:37.240
and the conclusion of this
2005 DOJ OIG report was,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.820
"replace the obsolete
ACS system as quickly

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.480
and cost effectively
as feasible."

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.200
Yet, the FBI
continues to rely upon

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.640
this antiquated, obsolete, and
limited ACS system for FOIA

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.480
search purposes, even while
the FBI has increasingly

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.440
relied upon more modern
non-ACS search platforms

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.560
for its non-FOIA operations.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.390
Indeed, even the FBI's own
2004 Report to the National

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.030
Commission on Terrorist
Attacks upon the United States,

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.180
the FBI'S counter-terrorism
program since September 2001,

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.040
found that the FBI's grievous
failure to identify or prevent

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.900
the terrorist attacks
of the September 11,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.660
2001 was in part due to the
woefully deficient nature

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.340
of the ACS.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.270
Found the FBI's 2004 Report,
on September 11, 2001,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.770
the Bureau of
Information technology

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.326
was inadequate to support its
counter-terrorism mission.

00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:33.700
A core element to
this deficiency

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.820
was that the FBI had a deficient
information management system.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.640
The FBI's legacy investigative
information system,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.890
the Automated Case
Support, or ACS,

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.440
was not very effective in
identifying information

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.240
or supporting investigations.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.150
So the ACS is so bad
it's partially to blame,

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.060
according to the FBI,
for 9/11, and yet, this

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.530
is still what the FBI is using
for FOIA search purposes.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.440
Additionally, the FBI's
own actions further

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.960
demonstrate that
the Bureau itself

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.750
believes reliance
on ACS searches

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.700
is woefully insufficient.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.190
The FBI has lobbied
for and received

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.740
hundreds of millions
of dollars to develop

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.710
next-generation records
search capabilities,

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.500
in no small part
because of the FBI

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.780
and DOJ's own
assertions pertaining

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.530
to the dangerous poverty of
reliance upon ACS searches.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.310
For example, the FBI's sentinel
database and Investigative Data

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.650
Warehouse, or IDW, which
has been referred to as a,

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.790
quote, "Uber Google."

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:36.410
are examples of some of these at
times wildly expensive, quote,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.320
"next-generation FBI
search platforms"

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.720
that offer modern full-text
search capabilities.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.370
Yet, the Bureau
nearly always refuses

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.560
to utilize these capabilities
for FOIA purposes.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.080
Instead, for FOIA searches, the
FBI insists upon using the ACS.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.620
So let's talk about the ACS.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.570
The ACS is comprised of three
primary search applications

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.910
that the FBI can use
to perform to what

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.730
amounts to searches of the CRS.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.980
One of these is the
Universal Index or UNI.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.080
Then, there is the ICM, or
Investigative Case Management,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.270
search application.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:23.410
And then there is the ECF,
or Electronic Case File.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.330
Now the FBI's default
FOIA search protocols

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.230
involved utilization
of the UNI to search

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.280
an arbitrarily-produced index,
or indices, of FBI CRS records

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.525
mirrored within the ACS.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.060
The FBI has long
publicly insisted

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.790
that a UNI index search alone
is adequate for FOIA purposes,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.490
and therefore, the
FBI nearly always

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.160
refuses to utilize either
of ACS's other two search

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.010
applications, the
ICM or the ECF.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:02.880
Internally, however--
well, you know,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.960
here is a training slide for
when to do an ECF search.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.070
Basically, in very rare cases or
if it's a high-visibility case

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.750
so people might
notice that the FBI is

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.910
conducting a deficient search.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.350
So yeah, we should
talk about the ECF.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:29.300
So the ACS's ECF application
conducts full-text searches

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:29.825
of the CRS.

00:29:33.884 --> 00:29:35.300
It's not a great
full-text search.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.734
It's a 1995 full-text search.

00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:38.900
But it's a full-text search.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.370
And as opposed to the
UNI, which only searches

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.630
several limited lists of
arbitrarily-indexed subjects

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.890
of the CRS.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.650
The ECF performs a relatively
modern full-text search

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.760
of the CRS.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.090
So on the one hand, the UNI,
it's just a list of indexes.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.000
It's just indices.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.570
The ECF, it conducts
a full-text search

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.970
of everything in
the ACS, which is

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.154
most of the things that
are in the CRS, which

00:30:10.154 --> 00:30:11.070
is what we want to do.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.680
We really want more
than the CRS but we

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.079
don't get to deal with that.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:16.870
Right now, we're just
trying to do the CRS.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.210
We're trying to search the CRS.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.360
So, again, the ECF
full-text searches,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.790
it's not a modern
sentinel or IDW--

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.930
Uber Google-- full-text
search but it's

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.660
still a full-text search.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.460
However, declares the FBI's
FOIA chief, David Hardy,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.010
"only under extraordinary
circumstance--" oh, sorry.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.750
Here's a screen capture
of an ECF search.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.810
So this is what we
want them to do, right?

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:50.230
Like, that's sort of how
low the bar is here, right?

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.670
This is like, oh,
please, do this.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:31:01.670
But yeah, so David Harty,
the head of the FBI'S FOIA

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.380
division, says
that, quote, "only

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.910
under extraordinary
circumstances

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.630
would the FBI conduct ECF
full-text searches of the CRS

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.440
in response to a FOIA request."

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.570
Somewhat amazingly,
the FBI insists

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.580
that ECF full-text
searches are not

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.510
more likely to locate responsive
records than UNI index

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.970
searches.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.000
Further, the FBI argues
that ECF full-text searches

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.670
for FOIA requests
are unduly burdensome

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.480
and would be wasteful
of FBI resources.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:36.540
Declared FBI FOIA chief,
David Harty, in 2014,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.170
"full-text searches such as ECF
are considered an extraordinary

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.380
measure that is unduly
burdensome and not reasonably

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.840
likely to locate
responsive records."

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.600
And "The net result
of a full-text search

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.730
is typically a significant
use of time and resources

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.260
that yield no additional
responsive information.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.370
As such, the ACS index
search of the CRS

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.290
is the key to
locating information

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.140
responsive to FOIA requests."

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.230
So again, searching this
arbitrarily-produced index

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.880
rather than a full-text
search is the key.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.540
And these are submitted
under penalty of perjury.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.040
The FBI's position here is akin
to suggesting that a search

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.840
of a limited and
arbitrarily-produced card

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.790
catalog at a vast library--

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:25.390
150 million volume library--

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.790
is as likely to locate book
pages containing a specified

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.090
search term as a full-text
search of a database containing

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.210
digitized versions of
most books in the library.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.070
I mean, simply,
the FBI's assertion

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.980
is absurd on its face.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:44.380
Notably, and as one can
see, in this document--

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.560
and I'll show you in a moment--

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.150
this document from 2007, for
its own investigative non-FOIA

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.150
purposes, the FBI routinely
uses the ECF application

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.140
to conduct full-text
searches of the CRS

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.140
and they don't think it's
that much of a burden.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.355
So, here, the FBI is--

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:05.160
you know,
counter-terrorism division,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.890
they're very stressed that
animal rights activists are

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.390
having their annual conference
at a convention center

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.950
hotel in DC.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.120
I was there.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.828
It was all right.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.220
And, you know, the FBI notes,
again in this counter-terrorism

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.810
document and note
the date on it--

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.520
not that long before
2000 and the FBI

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.850
is spending its time looking
at puppy huggers meeting

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.372
at a conference in DC.

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:36.330
At this time, there is
no specific intelligence

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.430
to suggest that any participants
in this upcoming conference

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.450
are planning to engage
in criminal activity,

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.120
but these paid lobby groups
of the biomedical research

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.270
industry say that some
activists a couple of years

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.550
ago got arrested protesting
outside a McDonald's when

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:55.020
they had a conference
there over the summer.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.930
And so this whole document--
this whole counter-terrorism

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.870
document-- is a big
intelligence score.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.150
We got a list of the speakers.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.358
Yeah, it was publicly posted.

00:34:03.358 --> 00:34:05.680
We're trying to get people
to come to our conference.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.281
And down here, note, a
prompt and limited checking

00:34:08.281 --> 00:34:09.739
of initial leads
has been performed

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:15.350
by [INAUDIBLE] regarding
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:21.835
A review of the ACS support
utilizing free text searches

00:34:21.835 --> 00:34:23.210
revealed the
following, which may

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.860
be of interest to recipients.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:30.510
So prompt and limited review
of the ACS full-text search.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.850
So when the FBI is asked to use
ECF full-text searches for FOIA

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.709
purposes, it is unduly
burdensome and doesn't work.

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.250
It's redundant and
unduly burdensome.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.333
But when they need to do
it for their own purposes

00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:44.360
because they want
to see literally

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.870
who the listed speakers coming
to town are, it's prompt,

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.949
it's limited, it's
easy, and they do it.

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:51.590
That's what they do.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.080
Because it's the only
thing that make sense.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.400
So, for FOIA purposes,
the FBI nearly always

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.470
refuses to use any of
the full-text searches

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.050
available to it,
whether it be the ACS's

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:08.330
antiquated but functional ECF
or the Bureau's modern Sentinel

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.760
and IDW platforms.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.970
Instead, as noted, the FBI's
default FOIA search protocol

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.170
involves utilization
of the UNI to search

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.080
an index or indices
of FBI CRS records

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.390
mirrored within the ACS.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:30.316
And this is a screen capture
of a UNI, so an index search.

00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:31.940
The one we saw before
was the good one.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.840
This is the bad one.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.500
Yeah.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.990
So, right.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.660
So the FBI relies
upon index searches--

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.760
indices-based searches-- to
conduct FOIA searches and this

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.500
is a serious problem.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.790
First, in order for the
names or other search terms

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.260
to be entered into an index,
hey have to be indexed.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.410
And these are not automated
indexing processes.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.010
It's literally a case
agent or, frequently,

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:08.709
his or her secretary going
through with a pencil

00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:10.500
after they've completed
creating a document

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.500
and saying this
name, this person.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.810
You got a 20-page report
and you want to go home.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.590
You're underlining names, you
pass it off to your secretary,

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.900
he or she wants
to go home, right?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.430
And that's also-- so
it's very limited.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.970
It's not like every word.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.840
It's the teeny minority of
words that gets indexed.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.890
It's arbitrarily produced.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.900
Different people are
going to index differently

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.130
and it's extremely limited.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.420
Yeah.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.820
Notably, this UNI
search, no records

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.480
were found, as is the
case most of the time--

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.550
two out of three times.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:53.110
Even David Harty, head
of FBI FOIA himself,

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.570
concedes in court declarations
that the indexing of records

00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.064
by the FBI, which are
essential to FBI UNI searches,

00:37:00.064 --> 00:37:02.230
is characterized by a largely
discretionary and even

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.372
arbitrary set of practices
not designed or suited

00:37:05.372 --> 00:37:07.330
for the purpose of
effectively locating records

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:10.630
responsive to FOIA requests.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:15.870
So for example, this
is an FBI record

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:20.640
about spying on the
anti-apartheid movement

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.680
in the United States,
believing that

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.750
the anti-apartheid
movement and Nelson Mandela

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.700
are a Kremlin-directed
plot to undermine

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.340
American national security.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.070
And this is what
indexing looks like.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:37.790
The agent, underlining the
name or a group or a phrase

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:42.630
or whatever, and
then the secretary,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:48.900
once he or she is done entering,
manually, the selected search

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.520
terms into the index,
we'll cross it out and say,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.930
hey, I did it.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.760
Right?

00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:01.690
So here's the same document
indexed by a different office.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.530
Notably, the ANC,
Mandela's political party,

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.100
the anti-apartheid resistance
party, South Africa,

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.060
it's indexed here.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.230
So, conceivably-- and we'll
get to why it probably

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.530
wouldn't-- but conceivably, an
index-based search would come

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.990
up with a hit here if you
were searching for records

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:26.180
on the ANC but not here because
indexing is not only limited

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.415
but arbitrary.

00:38:27.415 --> 00:38:29.540
Further, in the same
document, the exact same thing

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.020
but reversed.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.270
Now the other document has
the index item and this one

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.930
doesn't.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.960
South African president,
de Klerk, no index.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.170
South African president,
de Klerk, index.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:44.600
Again, not only is FBI indexing
a tremendously limited practice

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.670
but it is also, especially
for FOIA search purposes--

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.290
it works well for the
FBI's purpose of they

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.450
want to be able to
retrieve the information

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.880
for their
investigative purposes,

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.260
but from a FOIA
perspective, I mean,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.430
it's, again, limited
and arbitrary.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.300
So, because there are
these inherent problems

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.000
with FBI records
indexing procedures,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.400
UNI searches frequently fail
to locate a large percentage

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.540
of responsive records.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.360
Simply, the overwhelming
majority of [INAUDIBLE] search

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.310
terms just aren't indexed.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.770
So searches of the UNI
indices for these terms

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.160
produce no responsive results.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.312
I mean, nothing is
indexed on this page.

00:39:27.312 --> 00:39:28.895
So if you want
something on this page,

00:39:28.895 --> 00:39:31.825
submit a FOIA
request for it, nope.

00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:32.950
Here you have these things.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.033
That's all that's indexed.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:42.150
But even within UNI searches,
not all UNI searches

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.560
are created equally crappy.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.620
Some UNI searches are far
more inadequate than others.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:55.160
So UNI searches can be
performed in two primary ways.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:05.790
One is to perform a UNI index
search of its main file index

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.750
and the other is to conduct
a search of the UNI's

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.260
cross-reference index.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:20.129
So the FBI asserts
that a main file--

00:40:20.129 --> 00:40:22.420
something that would show up
in the main file indexed--

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.086
is a meta-entry.

00:40:23.086 --> 00:40:23.700
A main file.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.200
It carries the name of someone
who is the subject of a file,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:26.650
right?

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.316
If the FBI is really
interested in you--

00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:31.150
if you're being targeted by
the FBI-- if you're relevant--

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.610
you're a main file.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.480
What's a cross-reference
according to the FBI?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.539
Cross-reference is defined as
a mere mention of or passing

00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:41.080
reference to the
subject of a request

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.330
and files relating to other
individuals, organization,

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.280
events, or activities.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.030
So let's say the FBI
is investigating you.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.074
You'd be a main file
according to this.

00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.990
The person you spoke to
at the ice cream store

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.860
before you went to rob the
bank, allegedly, you know,

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.330
that person might be
a cross-reference.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:00.920
Right?

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.780
That's trivial.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.730
Insignificant.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.400
He's just really not important.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.604
Further, search the
FBI, our experience

00:41:10.604 --> 00:41:12.770
has shown that even when
cross-reference records are

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.697
actually responsive
to a FOIA request,

00:41:14.697 --> 00:41:16.280
references usually
contain information

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.200
similar to the information
already processed

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.340
in a main file.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.840
So it's going to be redundant.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.340
It's insignificant.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.240
It's insignificant.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.080
It's redundant.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.860
You'd have gotten it anyway.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:33.190
So, with this as justification,
this main file versus

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:37.300
cross-reference distinction,
the FBI's policy--

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.230
their FOIA policy-- is not only
to limit searches of the CRS

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.760
to the ACS's UNI application
but to limit those UNI searches

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.265
solely to the UNI
applications main file index.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.750
there's an exception to
this policy so if you submit

00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:01.760
a request to the FBI and they
conduct a main file only search

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.830
and you are sophisticated enough
and have the time to submit

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.980
an appeal of that request to the
Department of Justice's Office

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.880
of Information Policy
appealing the inadequate search

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.527
because the FBI only conducted
a man file request and they

00:42:15.527 --> 00:42:17.610
should be conducting a
cross-reference request too

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:21.467
and you know this, then OIP--

00:42:21.467 --> 00:42:23.800
the Department of Justice
Office of Information Policy--

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.341
maybe nine months later, there's
a good chance that they will

00:42:26.341 --> 00:42:28.540
ultimately remand your
request back to the FBI--

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.220
maybe it took them a year or
two years to get it to you

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.904
in the first place--
the denial letter--

00:42:31.904 --> 00:42:33.070
the main file denial letter.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.580
You appeal.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.160
Nine months later, OIP remands.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.177
A year or two later,
maybe then the FBI

00:42:38.177 --> 00:42:39.760
does a cross-reference
search for you.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.500
But if you appeal
inadequate search

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.740
based on the lack of a
cross-reference search,

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.550
the FBI has a policy, they are
potentially open to conducting

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.990
a cross-reference search.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.400
And also if you sue.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.869
The FBI will
automatically conduct

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:55.910
a cross-reference search
because the FBI does not

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.810
want this issue to be
before a court as case law

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.029
because it's so grossly
violative of FOIA.

00:43:02.029 --> 00:43:04.070
The Freedom of Information
Act requires an agency

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.778
to conduct searches
reasonably calculated

00:43:05.778 --> 00:43:07.490
to locate responsive records.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.010
This is not
reasonably calculated

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.280
to locate responsive record.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.017
So if you sue, automatically,
the FBI wants to moot the issue

00:43:15.017 --> 00:43:17.100
and they will do a
cross-reference search for you.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:23.650
But for the vast majority
of FOIA requesters

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:28.110
who neither appeal nor
litigate, they just

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.726
get a no response of
records denial letter.

00:43:30.726 --> 00:43:32.850
We searched the main files
and didn't get anything.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.150
So the FBI tells us that
essentially everything a FOIA

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.690
requester might
reasonably want is

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:40.830
likely to come up under a UNI
main file search of the ACS

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.350
and that a UNI cross-reference
search would be,

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:48.240
again, wasteful and
redundant, which the FBI often

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.849
continues, because
they are the FBI,

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:52.140
therefore it constitutes a
threat to national security,

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.900
because wasting the FBI's
time, thank you, Bin Laden.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.470
[? Right? ?]

00:43:56.470 --> 00:44:00.774
And so let's take a closer
look at how this actually

00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:01.690
plays out in practice.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.729
So we've seen what
the FBI has to say.

00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:05.270
Maybe just because
I'm cynical, let's

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:10.910
take a closer look about
how it operates in reality.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.520
So again, the FBI makes clear,
at the initial administrative

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.480
stage--

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.850
so that means when you
submit a FOIA request--

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.790
it is the FBI's policy to search
for and identify only main file

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.340
records responsive
to FOIA requests.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.190
And here, surprisingly,
that search

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:29.470
resulted in no
records being located.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.817
And again-- here.

00:44:36.817 --> 00:44:38.400
Searches are conducted
for main files.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.441
This is a training slide.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.100
Searches are conducted
for main files.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.206
Searches may also look
at reference files

00:44:46.206 --> 00:44:47.580
if you provide
information that's

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.120
almost impossible to actually
meet their standards on

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.450
or if you appeal.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:52.950
Right?

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.366
And again, but
that's years later.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.360
So let's look at some
examples of how this plays out

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.860
in real life.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.540
I submitted a Freedom
of Information Act

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.600
request for records
on the pro fur lobby

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.620
group, the anti-animal
rights lobby group, FC USA,

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.680
or Fur Commission USA.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.570
2011, the FBI gives
me a denial letter--

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.300
"unable to identify
main file records

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.532
responsive to the FOIA."

00:45:17.532 --> 00:45:19.240
This is the same
language that everyone--

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.490
that most people-- get when
they submit a FOIA request

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:22.430
and they get a denial.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.010
People read it to think
that the FBI's saying

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.500
they don't have anything.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.070
What it says is we looked and
we couldn't find anything.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:35.180
What it actually says is, we
looked in one database using

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.090
one search methodology for
a very limited set of file

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.460
types and oh yeah, we
didn't find anything.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.840
And by the way,
that's the point.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.280
But either way.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.090
So submitted my FOIA
request for FC USA.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:55.310
Unable to identify main file
records responsive to the FOIA.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.890
Then, with a
cross-reference search,

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:02.000
because I do appeal
everything and I do litigate,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.040
you know, here is a document.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.590
And so, again, the FBI claims
that a cross-reference--

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.870
and this comes up in a
cross-reference search

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.100
of the UNI's cross-reference
indices for records on FC USA.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.740
So again, the FBI said
that cross-references are

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.280
mere trivial passing reference.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:28.260
Here, the FBI is having a
meeting with the FC USA,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.990
introducing an intelligence
analyst at the FBI

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.890
to a representative
from the FC USA--

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.810
this fur industry lobby group--

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.030
to be a routine point of
contact with the San Diego

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.204
division of the FBI.

00:46:41.204 --> 00:46:42.870
Here, the police are
meeting with the FC

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.230
USA, the meeting which
is hosted by FC USA

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.790
and held at this resort.

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.450
FC USA is holding
trainings for the FBI

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:57.950
on how to deal
with puppy huggers.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:58.450
You know.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.370
And the FBI is giving
information to FC USA.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.340
They have a routine
back and forth.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.210
FC USA is teaching the FBI how
to use the FC USA's database

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.627
of animal rights activists
because the FC USA isn't--

00:47:12.627 --> 00:47:14.210
they don't have any
of the limitations

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.700
that the FBI ostensibly
has on spying

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.520
on protected first
amendment activities.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.100
Review and discussing how law
enforcement and the FC USA

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.720
can best complement each other.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.800
So hardly a trivial
or passing reference.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.880
Certainly not duplicative.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.470
No responsive records come
up under the main file

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:35.970
and far from trivial.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:37.470
All right.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.240
Now, next.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.750
Submitted a FOIA request
on my dear friend,

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.940
the legendary Steve Sipman.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.670
Steve Sipman, in 1977,
was one of two men--

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.800
the other is Kenneth
LeVasseur-- who

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.510
participated in the
first reported animal

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.040
liberation in US history.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.920
The liberation of two dolphins
which were at a University

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.040
of Hawaii at Navy Laboratory
in downtown Honolulu.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.480
They called themselves
the Undersea Railroad.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.090
Submitted this request
on Steve Sipman,

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:09.360
unable to identify
responsive main file records.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.620
I also submitted a
request on Kenny--

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.980
on Kenneth LeVasseur's records
because I got signatures

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.950
from both of them.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.390
Kenny's came back.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.860
Now, so it turns
out, for something

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.520
to come up as responsive as
a hit on the main file index,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.600
not only does it truly
need to be a subject

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.130
but it literally needs to be
the top line of the subject.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.540
And, just like indexing, the
top line, it's arbitrary.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.720
It's up to the case agent.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.615
It could be alphabetical.

00:48:41.615 --> 00:48:42.990
It could be
perceived importance.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.561
It could be who
has a better beard.

00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:45.060
Right?

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.770
Like, it's totally arbitrary.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.730
And it can change over the
course of an investigation.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:50.730
They can move it around.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:55.110
And literally, a request
for Sipman, no main files.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:58.990
A request for LeVasseur, main
file, because he's the top.

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:00.420
You can see that
Sipman's indexed.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.380
You can see the line.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.270
But he's a cross-reference
because he's not

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.350
the top, top line.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:10.514
And let's say the top line
had been Undersea Railroad.

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.180
Then neither-- which
it easily could be.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.290
Then neither of them would
have come up as a main file.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.355
Let's say it had been theft of
two dolphins from the Kewalo

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:20.480
Basin Marine Mammal
Laboratory as the top line.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.470
Then not even Undersea
Railroad would have come up.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.130
And not only does it
have to be in the subject

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:34.130
and the top line, it has to
be all that the top line is.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.890
So this comes up as
a cross-reference

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.450
for Nelson Mandela.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.800
So a main file search
on Nelson Mandela

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.540
would not come up with a hit
for a visit of Nelson Mandela

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.830
to the United States.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.810
This is a cross-reference
because it's not

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.875
Nelson Mandela on
the top line, it's

00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:53.750
visit of Nelson Mandela
to the United States.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.960
Similarly, also, the
cross-reference release.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.620
Visit of Nelson Mandela to
accept his freedom award

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.042
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:50:05.042 --> 00:50:06.000
Not a main file search.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.740
If you submit a
request to the FBI

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:12.060
and they conduct only an
index-based search and only

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.060
a main file index-based search
and you asked for Nelson

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.600
Mandela, you don't get this.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.970
You don't get it.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:22.700
And the records that I got on
Mandela showed that the FBI,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.700
in 1990, after Mandela got
out of prison after 27 years

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.220
in prison in South Africa for
his anti-apartheid activities,

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.896
the FBI was tasked with
protecting Mandela--

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:34.270
when he came to
the United States

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.700
to continue his
anti-apartheid efforts,

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.680
the FBI was tasked with
protecting Mandela.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.179
And while they were
doing that, they

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:42.460
took the opportunity to place
a confidential informant

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.543
within Mandela's inner
circle in the United States

00:50:44.543 --> 00:50:47.800
to pass political information
to the FBI about Mandela

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.200
and his anti-apartheid
associates activities

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.560
in the United States.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.010
And then let's look at this one.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.260
TSBR, the Texas Society
for Biomedical Research,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:04.320
another lobby group for
the biomedical industry,

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.660
unable to identify
main file records.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.210
OK?

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.545
What do we got?

00:51:10.545 --> 00:51:11.515
I appealed.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.180
Let's look at the dates.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:19.540
So I submitted the request
maybe a year before that.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.060
They come back, tell me
they don't have anything--

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.310
unable to identify main files.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:29.770
Now in 2012, after
I appealed, DOJ OIP

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.680
says, all right,
all right, yeah, OK.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.261
We'll remand it to the FBI
to look for cross-references.

00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:36.760
OK.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.160
Behold, they find some.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.910
I get them a couple--
you know, I get them

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.590
in February of this year.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.690
Six pages.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:48.920
You know.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.770
And the first of the documents.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.350
You know, it's more than a
passing fleeting reference.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:59.310
The FBI is getting an alert
from the Texas Society

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:01.540
for Biomedical Research.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.870
TSBR's been monitoring
animal rights hotlines

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:08.230
and it's rumored that the
widely-broadcast protests that

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.125
happen every year
are going to happen.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:18.610
But OK, so you know,
we didn't get that.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.920
And then I also got this one.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:28.100
I mean, the FBI attends another
workshop held by a biomedical--

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:33.890
by an anti-animal
rights lobby group

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.250
to talk about animal
enterprise terrorism laws.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.590
And again, they
come up as trivial.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.684
The fact that the FBI
is actively colluding--

00:52:41.684 --> 00:52:43.850
getting so much of their
information about targeting

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:44.780
the animal rights
environment movements,

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.325
which the FBI declares the
number one domestic terror

00:52:46.325 --> 00:52:48.140
threat in the United States--

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.790
getting this
information directly

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:53.300
from the corporate interests who
are opposing the animal rights

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.620
movement.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.720
Yeah, it is anything
but trivial.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.230
And again, literally the line
is actually the entire top line,

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.780
but because there's a little
bit after that, we don't get it.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.590
But OK.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.900
OK.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.469
So I sued and got processing
notes from this FOIA request

00:53:11.469 --> 00:53:13.510
and we're going to come
back to that in a moment.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.968
So this is from
the second passage.

00:53:14.968 --> 00:53:16.380
This is after the remand, right?

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:21.741
So I just got the documents
that is remanded in 12

00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:22.740
and they searched again.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.300
They did a
cross-reference search.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:28.300
They located the six pages
in those two files, 2012.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:28.800
OK.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.600
Because they did a
cross-reference search.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.980
And here is the search slip.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.417
And these are going to
become important in a minute.

00:53:35.417 --> 00:53:37.750
This is the search slip for
the second request when they

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.900
did a cross-reference search.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.580
You can see, even though no
responsive records came up

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.441
when they just did a main
file search, here we go.

00:53:45.441 --> 00:53:47.440
Cross-reference search
brings up the two things,

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.960
including the FBI going to
the meeting held by TSBR.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:54:02.080
I also got the FOIA search
slip for the first request

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.640
and they came up with--

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.530
they found them then
but they still gave

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.810
me "no responsive main file"--

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.510
a denial letter.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.574
So it's not just--

00:54:13.574 --> 00:54:14.990
I mean, so they
actually conducted

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.540
a main file and a
cross-reference search here

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.474
but they simply chose
not to give them to me

00:54:19.474 --> 00:54:21.140
because the policy
is not to give it.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.700
It's not just that they're
not conducting them.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.825
They're not giving them
out even if they find them.

00:54:24.825 --> 00:54:27.564
Literally, they found them,
and in that first document,

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.980
they gave me a no responsive
main file records were found.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.230
It's true because of how
they define main file records

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.745
but they literally
even found them

00:54:33.745 --> 00:54:34.870
and didn't give them to me.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.650
Right.

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:43.250
So there is also one
additional possibility

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:48.620
here as to why the FBI
didn't give me these records

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.960
and that's that
they're control files

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.600
and the FBI black-balls control
files-- control files just

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.260
mean it's sort of a meta file
and the FBI doesn't give out

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.640
those records for
no good reason.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.840
They just say they
are black-balled.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.590
And then Jason Leopold,
a great journalist

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.860
who I work with sometimes,
did an expose or an article

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.026
on black-balling and then
the FBI continued doing it

00:55:07.026 --> 00:55:09.990
but just changed the
name to analyst removed.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:11.200
But either way.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.350
So let's talk about
search slips for a moment.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.270
How much time do I have?

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.992
SPEAKER: I think
you can keep going.

00:55:19.992 --> 00:55:21.491
There is one question
which actually

00:55:21.491 --> 00:55:23.836
relates to search slips, so if
you want to start with that,

00:55:23.836 --> 00:55:24.310
I can--

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:25.851
RYAN SHAPIRO: Cool,
yeah, because I'm

00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:27.984
going to talk about that
now so that's perfect.

00:55:27.984 --> 00:55:29.436
What's the question?

00:55:29.436 --> 00:55:34.280
SPEAKER: One second.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.892
RYAN SHAPIRO: I tend to be a
bit loquacious so I can go over.

00:55:36.892 --> 00:55:37.834
Sorry about that.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:45.360
So just to illustrate
how far the FBI will

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.189
go to conceal the deliberate
and unlawful inadequacy

00:55:48.189 --> 00:55:49.980
of their FOIA searches--
their default FOIA

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.080
searches-- we're going to
look at an ongoing FOIA

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.190
lawsuit of mine, which is a
lawsuit for FOIA search slips.

00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:00.700
So, some time in 2010, prior
to that-- prior to 2010,

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.440
you request a FOIA search slip,
the FBI, more often than not,

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.620
would release it to you.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.340
Some time in late
2010, the FBI stopped.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.770
They didn't give
any explanation.

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.215
They say, hey, no response
to main file records.

00:56:12.215 --> 00:56:14.160
We looked and didn't
find anything.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.790
What do you mean you looked
and didn't find anything?

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:16.315
You have it.

00:56:16.315 --> 00:56:18.720
You generate it with
every FOIA request.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.926
Nope.

00:56:19.926 --> 00:56:21.510
I don't know what you mean.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.060
You know?

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.300
By early 2012, the
FBI and DOJ jointly

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.864
came up with an explanation
or a justification.

00:56:30.864 --> 00:56:32.530
I mean, the bottom
line is, the FBI just

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.730
doesn't want people seeing
how bad their searches are.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:38.790
But in 2012, the FBI
and DOJ jointly come up

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:43.020
with a formal policy and
supposed justification for it.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.642
And the policy they said was
the FBI is not going to give out

00:56:48.642 --> 00:56:50.600
any search slips for
investigative records that

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.700
are less than 25
years old and it's

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.040
justified on the basis
of FOIA Exemption 7E.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.890
FOIA has nine exemptions.

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:02.420
So legitimate reasons that an
agency is permitted to withhold

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.230
records.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.960
So you see things redacted, B5.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.421
That's exemption B5.

00:57:08.421 --> 00:57:12.140
B5 is the "withhold it
because you want to"

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.480
exemption, as it's
commonly known.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.480
But deliberative process.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:21.137
B6 is personal privacy, so
it'll be someone's name.

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.970
There are nine FOIA
exemptions and there are

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.050
subdivisions of them--

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:29.480
B7 A, B7 D. But anyway, there
are nine FOIA exemptions,

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.930
with subdivisions, and the
FBI says, we're not going

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:33.720
to give out any search slips--

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.720
just categorically, not
going to give out search

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.460
slips because 7E.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.800
That's notable because 7E
is the FOIA exemption that

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.590
prevents disclosure
of information that

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.740
would reveal law enforcement
techniques not generally known

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.370
to the public.

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.380
So secret law
enforcement techniques.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:55.010
The FBI claims that
giving out this

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:57.892
would give the public
information on secret law

00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:58.850
enforcement techniques.

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.296
How they search
for FOIA records.

00:58:02.296 --> 00:58:05.420
So in 2012, along with
some other requesters,

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:11.010
I sued, challenging
this policy itself.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:13.880
And then in February
of 2014, the FBI

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.815
gives its first
official explanation of,

00:58:15.815 --> 00:58:17.010
well why is that 7E?

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.830
What are you talking about?

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:22.580
And how are they protecting
a secret law enforcement

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.340
technique by not giving
out FOIA search slips?

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:27.830
And the answer that
the FBI gave in court

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:29.790
has to do with FOIA exclusions.

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.720
So FOIA has nine exemptions,
which an agency, as I said,

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.370
can use to
legitimately withhold.

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.080
They can also abuse
those exemptions

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.350
but they can legitimately
withhold records

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:41.030
under those exemptions.

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:42.780
The records are
subject to FOIA, it's

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.780
just those individual
records that would violate

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.010
someone's personal privacy.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.600
I mean, I can't
request your FBI file

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.950
even though you are
allegedly accused

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:51.094
of robbing this bank
because you haven't given me

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.010
your personal consent.

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.260
B6, B7 C, personal privacy.

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.780
That's reasonable.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:00.519
FOIA exclusions, we can thank
the Reagan administration for.

00:59:00.519 --> 00:59:02.810
The Reagan administration
and Attorney General Ed Meese

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:05.330
under Reagan, they were
real stressed back in 1974

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:09.140
when FOIA was amended to
apply to the FBI and other law

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:09.964
enforcement.

00:59:09.964 --> 00:59:10.880
Intelligence agencies.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.690
The military.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.856
That this was really damaging
the national security.

00:59:13.856 --> 00:59:16.250
And so in '86, attorney
general Ed Meese

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:20.016
pushed through, under the guise
of fighting the war on drugs,

00:59:20.016 --> 00:59:21.390
all these revisions
to FOIA which

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.090
really eroded a lot of it.

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.130
And one of the
major parts of what

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.930
the '86 FOIA amendments did
was to include exclusions,

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:30.050
which are just, hey,
the agency doesn't

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.660
want to tell you that
these records exist

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:37.900
and so they're going
to lie to you about it.

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.540
They're going to say--

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.737
you know, you request
records, they find records,

00:59:41.737 --> 00:59:43.320
and they're going
to say, because it's

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.945
such a national
security problem for us

00:59:44.945 --> 00:59:46.410
to admit that the
records exist--

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.701
and we can't even say-- we
can neither confirm or deny.

00:59:48.701 --> 00:59:49.907
We're just going to deny.

00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:50.740
That's an exclusion.

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:52.260
The records are actually
excluded from FOIA.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:53.680
They're not subject to FOIA.

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.410
And the FBI said that
they can't give out

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.362
FOIA search slips
because maybe we'll

00:59:57.362 --> 00:59:59.820
be able to figure out that an
exclusion was used somewhere.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:05.520
Keep in mind that last-- in
2016, the FBI used exclusions

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.280
93 times.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.640
They have to report how many
exclusions they use a year.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.420
That's out of roughly
14,000 requests

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.740
that the FBI processed.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.440
But the FBI says
a savvy requester

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.020
might be able to figure out
if an exemption is being used.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.290
It's unclear how because I don't
think it's going to be, like,

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:26.444
stamped exclusion,
so it's unclear how.

01:00:26.444 --> 01:00:28.360
I mean, as we can see,
there's lots of reasons

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.060
that the FBI might not give out
documents even if they found

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.490
them, but either way, the FBI--

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.100
so the FBI claims that
disclosure of search slips

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.308
might help a requester deduce
the use of an exclusion

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:43.210
and argues that the FBI--

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:45.970
you know, that exclusions are
law enforcement techniques not

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.020
generally known to the public.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.870
And so the FBI is
arguing here that it

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:52.810
can't release FOIA search
slips under 25 years old

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:55.990
because the FBI claims that
lying to FOIA requesters

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.720
is a law enforcement
technique not generally known

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.340
to the public.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.420
And like, no, for real,
use of FOIA exclusions

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.400
as a law enforcement subterfuge.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.911
According to the FBI, the use
of subterfuge, ruse, or a cover

01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:17.410
is a fundamental law enforcement
tool technique or procedure

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.780
whereby an investigative
agency employs a form of cloak

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.240
to cover the true nature and
scope of investigative efforts

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.739
to detect criminal activity and
safeguard national security.

01:01:24.739 --> 01:01:27.760
Functionally, there is
no discernible difference

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.500
between using intentional
misinformation

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.140
from an undercover agent or an
informant in the authorized use

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.330
of exclusions in response
to a FOIA request

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.370
for investigative records.

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:40.150
No discernible difference.

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:44.050
In both instances, the
subterfuge of misinformation

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.640
functions as a
protective mechanism

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.723
to protect the integrity
of sensitive FBI criminal

01:01:47.723 --> 01:01:50.210
and national security
investigations.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.765
So, for real, the FBI is saying
that lying to FOIA requesters

01:01:53.765 --> 01:01:56.140
is a secret law enforcement
technique not generally known

01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.210
to the public and that's why
you can't see FOIA search slips.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:05.870
The judge in January
of 2016 said, no.

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:06.550
No, FBI.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.400
That's not right.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.920
Exclusions are not law
enforcement techniques.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.010
They're law.

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:14.390
They're part of the statute.

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.056
They're not a law
enforcement technique,

01:02:16.056 --> 01:02:18.490
they are literally the
law, so you can't do that.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.940
You can't categorically
withhold FOIA search

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.430
slips on the basis of 7E.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:28.360
You know, you've got to
give me the search slips.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.760
But then the FBI turns
around and says, hey, judge,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.360
you know what?

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.420
You know that policy you
just ruled on and said

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.130
we can't use it anymore?

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.380
Yeah, well we don't actually
have that policy anymore,

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.566
and in fact, like, we
haven't for, like, a year.

01:02:42.566 --> 01:02:43.940
We got rid of it
like a year ago,

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:48.090
we just didn't bother
to tell you or anyone.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:50.225
We just let everyone
fight about it for a year

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:52.350
and didn't bother to tell
you that we got rid of it

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:53.660
and we have a new policy.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.010
And you know, because we have
a new policy which is basically

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:02.400
just the same policy just
tweaked a little bit,

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.250
we should get to
fight about that now.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.770
We should get to have a whole
new round of briefing on that.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.160
And because it's new and so we
should get to fight about that.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.000
Basically start the trial over.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.250
You know, because as I said,
we got rid of that policy

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:19.100
like a year ago, so, like, your
ruling doesn't matter, judge.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.120
And not only that, the
FBI is like-- and yeah,

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.416
I'm totally doing
this verbatim--

01:03:24.416 --> 01:03:26.540
also, judge, by the way,
not only should we get to,

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.730
like, fight about
our new policy now,

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.430
but we should also get to
introduce new exemptions now,

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:32.090
too.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:35.810
I know we said 7E
before and I know

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.360
that, like, we have to
introduce all our exemptions,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.150
like, upfront at once, otherwise
the case will literally go on

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:45.170
forever, and we only did 7E
but we want a whole bunch

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.542
of new ones now too.

01:03:47.542 --> 01:03:50.570
And continued the FBI,
and I'm quoting here,

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.970
yeah, you know, I know
we were supposed to,

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:58.670
but like, we didn't, so we
should get to do it now.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.400
We weren't acting in bad
faith, we just basically

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.639
didn't think we'd lose and
so we didn't bother to do it,

01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:06.680
so now we want a do-over.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.175
And in this do-over,
we're not only

01:04:12.175 --> 01:04:14.800
going to rely on our new policy,
which is the same policy, just

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.200
tweaked a little, but
we're also beyond just 7E,

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.510
which we're using in the
new policy, just tweaked.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:24.210
We're also going to bring in
exemptions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7A, 7C,

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.430
7D, and 7F.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.400
This case actually
warrants its own talk.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.500
It just goes on forever.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:37.151
But the judge, while pissed at
the FBI for obvious reasons,

01:04:37.151 --> 01:04:38.900
essentially gave the
FBI almost everything

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.691
they wanted, because
at the end of the day,

01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:45.010
even judges who are
skeptical, end up

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:49.147
balking too much of the time and
the FBI turns around and says,

01:04:49.147 --> 01:04:49.730
really, judge?

01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:50.030
Really?

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.090
You know national security
better than the FBI?

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.048
Oh, where'd you go to
national security school?

01:04:54.048 --> 01:04:57.110
Because we're the FBI and I know
it doesn't seem like a big deal

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.330
to you, but do you want
the next twin towers

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:00.500
falling on your hands?

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.400
Because that's what
it's going to be

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.941
and we're going to
make sure everyone

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:04.540
knows it when you
cause it to happen.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.540
So you want to release
records on puppy huggers?

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.123
You want to release
FOIA search slips?

01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:10.871
You think you know national
security better than the FBI?

01:05:10.871 --> 01:05:12.620
We're going to make
sure everyone knows it

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.310
when people die on your watch.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.630
And the judges, far
more often than is

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:26.330
acceptable in a democracy, they
cave and defer to the agency.

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:28.080
So when the FBI screams
national security,

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.705
even for FOIA search slips-- and
that's what exemptions 1 and 3

01:05:30.705 --> 01:05:32.660
are about here--

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.350
judges cave.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:36.750
And this case is ongoing
and we're still fighting it.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.349
But again, remember, all of
this happening in this case

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:41.640
is occurring primarily just
so that the FBI can prevent

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.730
FOIA requesters from seeing how
deliberatively shitty FBI FOIA

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:47.235
searches actually are.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.860
So, as I said, FOIA's one of the
most underappreciated elements

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.970
of the entire
American experiment.

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.080
The notion that the
records of government

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.100
are the property of
the people and all

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.475
we need to do to get them is
to ask for them is radically

01:05:55.475 --> 01:05:56.804
democratic but FOIA is broken.

01:05:56.804 --> 01:05:59.220
And this is just one part of
the ongoing crisis of secrecy

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.311
we now face.

01:06:01.311 --> 01:06:05.280
A Harvard historian of
science, Peter Gallison,

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.521
has shown that the universe
of classified knowledge--

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:10.020
published classified
knowledge-- now

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.660
exponentially exceeds
the universe of published

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.860
unclassified knowledge.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.140
And this disparity
grows worse by the day.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.110
Literally, the
universe of published

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:22.380
unclassified knowledge
is dwarfed exponentially

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.599
by classified knowledge.

01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:25.890
The vast majority of published
information in the world

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:29.855
is inaccessible without
security clearances.

01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:31.980
And classification is just
one part of the problem.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.813
Most of the records I'm
seeking from the FBI

01:06:33.813 --> 01:06:35.115
here aren't classified.

01:06:35.115 --> 01:06:36.740
The government just
won't give them up.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.580
In fact, the FBI and DOJ invoke
classification only about 5%

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.470
of the times when it
denies FOIA requests.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:44.230
95% of FOIA denials are not
pertaining to classified,

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.970
they just deny them
for whatever reasons.

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:48.553
7E is not classified, it's just
law enforcement techniques not

01:06:48.553 --> 01:06:51.090
generally known to the public.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:55.780
Secrecy is a cancer on
the body of democracy.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.750
And you know,
increasingly, my focus

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.240
has been on
transparency activism,

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.440
and along with Jeffrey
Light, my amazing attorney,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.120
we've been scaling
up our efforts.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.240
And around the time
of the election,

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.930
we incorporated as a
nonprofit, a 501 C3

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:15.850
transparency organization.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:20.080
We've been joined by the amazing
Sarahjane Blum, the woman who

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.910
was on the cover of the
documentary and who also,

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:26.880
they said, did not have an
FBI file, which she does.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.580
And yeah, we started with
a successful crowdfunding

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.150
campaign.

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:33.470
We're currently in
our startup phase

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:34.940
and now we are
building capacity.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.090
I'm proud to
announce that we just

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:40.360
hired our first employee,
our new attorney,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.700
the brilliant Gunita Singh.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.966
And some highlights of our
successes so far include--

01:07:46.966 --> 01:07:50.470
oh, I meant to have that up.

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.370
All right.

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:52.610
Yep, Property of the People.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.700
This is the name of
our organization,

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.010
coming from our motto,
"the record of government

01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:58.570
are the property of the people."

01:07:58.570 --> 01:07:59.725
Check us out on Twitter.

01:07:59.725 --> 01:08:01.750
There's our web page.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.042
Some of our successes include--

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:05.125
you know, some of these
are before we incorporated

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.700
but had still the same team.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.066
Exposing the now
earliest-known FBI utilization

01:08:10.066 --> 01:08:11.440
of classified
remote installation

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.240
to circumvent
encryption happened

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.800
to be against animal
rights activists

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.170
who are friends of mine, 2003.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.840
We also exposed that
the DOJ unlawfully

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.830
failed to report details of
that to Congress, as they

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:25.510
are required to
do, and we've got

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.350
a new project looking into
broader issues associated

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:30.520
there.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.890
We exposed that the FBI
spied on Nelson Mandela

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:34.280
and viewed him not only
as a communist threat

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.640
but planted a confidential
informant in his inner circle

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.100
when they were supposed
to be protecting him.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:44.140
We exposed that the American
Egg Board, a USDA entity,

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.890
was unlawfully colluding
with the egg industry

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:52.680
to prevent Hampton
Creek, a manufacturer

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.460
of egg-less mayonnaise,
from being able to succeed

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.590
as a corporation.

01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:00.810
The president of the
American Egg Board

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:05.819
was forced to resign in
disgrace as a result.

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:11.819
We exposed FBI policy of
warning its technical agents not

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:14.040
to share details of its
technical surveillance

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.399
with prosecutors and
defendants alike.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.160
And most recently, and this is
after incorporation as Property

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.689
of the People, I mean,
now we focus a huge amount

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:27.800
of our resources, which are
limited, but nonetheless,

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.109
on the Trump administration.

01:09:31.109 --> 01:09:34.077
And so, recently, we exposed--

01:09:34.077 --> 01:09:36.660
here's a document that we got,
which shows a National Security

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.880
Council payment to Trump's
Mar a Lago luxury resort,

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.819
which is likely a violation
of the Constitution's

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:47.279
domestic emoluments clause--

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:50.580
literally a
constitutional violation.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:53.870
And yeah.

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:58.010
So democracy cannot meaningfully
function without an informed

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.890
citizenry and such a citizenry
is impossible without broad

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:05.070
public access to records about
the operations of government.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.546
This has always been the case,
and given President Trump

01:10:07.546 --> 01:10:09.170
and his administration's
overt contempt

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.360
for transparency
in a free press,

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.340
it has never been more so.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.470
And of course, Google
itself is in the business

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:18.894
of providing information to
the people to create good.

01:10:18.894 --> 01:10:20.810
And when the majority
of published information

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:23.180
in the world is kept hidden
from public view, when

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.670
false news dominates and the
actual actions of government

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.760
are kept secret, this is a
problem not only for democracy

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.820
but for Google as well.

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.260
It's not surprising
those in power

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.030
wish to keep their
actions secret.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.850
What's surprising is how
readily we tolerate it.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:38.787
I'll say it again.

01:10:38.787 --> 01:10:41.120
The records of government are
the property of the people

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.079
and it's time we reclaim them.

01:10:43.079 --> 01:10:44.057
Thank you.

01:10:44.057 --> 01:10:46.013
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:53.170
AUDIENCE: When you
file a FOIA request,

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:54.685
there's a section
in which it asks

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.060
you something
along the lines of,

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.260
how hard do you want us to try?

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.760
I.e., how much money
are you willing

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.950
to spend on us going above
and beyond a normal lookup?

01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.090
What's that actually for?

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:06.099
If I said I'm willing to
spend $1,000, what happens?

01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:06.890
RYAN SHAPIRO: Sure.

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:08.250
That's a great question.

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:12.710
So they're not really asking
how hard you want them to try.

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:16.190
Just as the agencies,
and especially the FBI,

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:19.460
use deficient FOIA search
protocols as a barrier

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.210
to preventing people from
conducting successful FOIA

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:27.290
requests, agencies, certainly
very much including the FBI,

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:29.810
use FOIA fees as a
way to do the same.

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:32.310
So they're not actually saying
they're going to work harder.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.490
The FBI is interested
in preventing people

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.590
from submitting
successful FOIA requests.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:41.150
And so when they're saying, how
much are you willing to pay,

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:44.240
they're trying to figure out
if they can make you go away.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.200
Can they make you go
away because they're

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.890
taking too long?

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:47.150
Can they make you go
away because they're not

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:48.139
locating the records?

01:11:48.139 --> 01:11:50.180
Can they make you go away
because they're saying,

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.380
we're going to charge you
a lot of money for it.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.838
And there's all sorts of fees
that the agencies can charge.

01:11:54.838 --> 01:11:59.360
They can charge for a search,
review, or duplication fees.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.540
And fees, I mean, since FOIA
was amended in '74, I mean,

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:09.560
there's been a lot of talk about
how agencies use fees as speed

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.454
bumps on--

01:12:10.454 --> 01:12:12.370
I'm trying to remember
the metaphor they used.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.020
Something like speed bumps on
the highway for information.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.600
Either way, so
what's going on there

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.780
is the agency is trying
to scare you off.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.490
What I would
encourage you to do--

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:26.030
and I don't know this
individual situation,

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:31.810
but FOIA requesters can
ask for a fee waiver

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:37.010
and they can also ask for
placement in a particular fee

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.770
category.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.860
So if someone's a
student, someone

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.610
should request placement
in the educational--

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.550
what one should do if they're
looking for these ways to get

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:48.925
out of paying fees-- legitimate
ways to get out of paying

01:12:48.925 --> 01:12:50.270
fees--

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.880
I request a waiver of fees
and I also request placement

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.400
in x, y, or z fee category.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.135
So educational fee
category or representative

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:02.300
of the news media fee category.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.647
This way, agencies-- if
you get either of those,

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.230
the agencies can't
charge search fees,

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:10.380
and search fees can be $45 an
hour and the agency can charge

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:10.880
as much--

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.060
they can say it's
going to take us

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:17.300
1,000 hours to search for
stuff that you're requesting.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.405
We don't know if we're
going to find anything

01:13:19.405 --> 01:13:21.530
but you're going to owe us
the money no matter what

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.300
and you've got to pay
half of it up front

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:27.110
and a search requires
this level of analyst

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.810
and so that's $45 an hour so
you owe us a whole lot of money.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:31.950
Are you sure you want
to go forward with this?

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.915
And so if you can get either an
educational requester status--

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.410
fee requester--

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:40.130
like fee status--
or representative

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.560
of the news media,
agencies are no longer

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.490
allowed to assess search
fees or review fees

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:49.510
and then you're stuck only
with duplication fees.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:52.790
You know, which aren't really
going to go above about like

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:56.420
$0.10 a page, which, while
it can still be onerous,

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:01.200
it's not $45 an hour unlimited
and independent of whether

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.344
or not you get records.

01:14:02.344 --> 01:14:03.760
AUDIENCE: Cool,
thank you so much.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.060
SPEAKER: Thank you, Ryan.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:04.660
RYAN SHAPIRO: It's
an honor to be here.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.660
I really enjoyed it.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.160
Thanks.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.810
