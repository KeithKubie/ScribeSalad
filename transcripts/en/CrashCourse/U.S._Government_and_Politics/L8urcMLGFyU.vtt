00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.400
Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're going to examine

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.930
the leadership structure of Congress! I know, pretty
exciting stuff! Now calm down, let me explain.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.930
[Theme Music]

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.200
Are you ready to talk about Congressional
leadership? You better be.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.180
So, the Congressional leadership are the Congresspersons with titles like Majority Leader

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.060
and Minority Whip, and they have a lot to do with
political parties, so we're going to talk about

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.000
what the political parties do in Congress as well.
Even if you don't follow politics, you probably

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.400
have heard of the name and titles, if not
the functions, of the various leaders. I'm

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.100
going to need some help on this one, so...
Let's go the Clone Zone!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.660
In the Clone Zone today I've got House Clone
and Senate Clone to help me explain Congressional

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.600
leadership. House Clone in the house! Take
it away.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.780
The leader of the House of Representatives
is the Speaker of the House, and he or she

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.620
is the third most powerful person in the country.
The speaker is always elected by whichever

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.320
party is in the majority. These elections
take place every two years, because the whole

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.299
House is elected every two years. That's a
lot of elections! At the time of the shooting

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.019
of the episode the Speaker of the House is John
Boehner from Ohio, known for his tan, tears, and tacos.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.840
Yeaah, he's oddly really good at making tacos.
I had the barbecue pork at his house one time....

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.260
Yeah, I had the beef taco! He called it la lengua.
Interesting choice.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380
Yeah. The speaker has two assistants to help
run the house. The Majority Whip has the primary

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.149
task of counting votes on important pieces
of legislation, and making the party members

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.289
vote along with their party. Whipping them
into line, I suppose. (whipping noise)

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.499
The third in line is the House Majority Leader,
who helps the majority and probably does other

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.479
stuff, but mainly he's chosen by the speaker
because he's popular with particular factions

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.779
within the party. The Minority Party, that's
the one with fewer members elected in a term,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.280
duh (scoffs), also has a Minority Leader,
and a Minority Whip, but no speaker. The Minority

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
Leader is the de facto spokesperson for the minority
party in the House, which is why you often see him or

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.780
her on TV, or on your phone, or, your iPad, or your pager.
I don't think you can see it on your pager.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.320
Hey, that was some pretty good stuff
you said there House Clone.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420
What's the deal with the Senate, Senate Clone?

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.619
Things are simpler over in the Senate because
we have only 100 august members and not the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.610
rabble of 435 to try to "manage." The leader
of the Senate is the Majority Leader and he

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.340
(so far it's always been a he) is elected
by the members of his party, which by definition

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.940
is the majority party, the one with 51 or
more members. There's also a Minority Leader,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.680
which, like the Minority Leader in the House,
is the party's spokesperson. The Vice President

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.300
presides over the Senate sessions when he
doesn't have anything better to do, even though

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.560
it's one of his few official constitutional
duties. When the veep is off at a funeral,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.670
or undermining the president with one of his
gaffes, the President pro tempore presides.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.820
The President pro tem is a largely ceremonial
role that is given to the most senior member

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.650
of the majority party. Senior here means longest
serving, not necessarily oldest, although

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.870
it can be the same thing. No one would want
to be a Congressional leader if there was

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.210
no power involved, so it's important to know
what powers these folks have, and how they

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.650
exercise them. Also, I'm not supposed to do
this, but let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140
I love saying that!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.040
The primary way that leaders in both the House
and Senate exercise power is through committee

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.200
assignments. By assigning certain members
to certain committees, the leadership can

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.820
ensure that their views will be represented
on those committees. Also, leaders can reward

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.470
members with good committee assignments, usually
ones that allow members to connect with their

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.320
constituents, or stay in the public eye, or
punish wayward members with bad committee

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.620
assignments. Like the committee for cleaning
the toilets or something. The Speaker of the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.960
House is especially powerful in his role assigning
Congressmen to committees.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.480
Congressional leaders shape the agenda of
Congress, having a huge say in which issues

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.350
get discussed and how that discussion takes
place. The Speaker is very influential here,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.040
although how debate happens in the House is
actually decided by the House Rules Committee,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.500
which makes this a rather powerful committee
to be on. The Senate doesn't have a rules

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.640
committee, so there's no rules! Aw, yeah!
There's rules. The body as a whole decides

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.290
how long debate will go on, and whether amendments
will be allowed, but the Majority Leader,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.870
if he can control his party, still has a lot
of say in what issues will get discussed.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.700
Agenda setting is often a negative power,
which means that it is exercised by keeping

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.350
items off the agenda rather than putting them
on. It's much easier to keep something from

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.140
being debated at all than to manage the debate
once it's started, and it's also rather difficult

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.530
for the media to discuss an issue that's never
brought up, no matter how much the public

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.420
might ask, "But why don't you talk about this thing that
matters a lot to me?" Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.739
Speaking of the media, Congressional leaders
can also wield power because they have greater

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.499
access to the press and especially TV. That's the
thing people used to watch. Instead of YouTube.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.979
This is largely a matter of efficiency. Media
outlets have only so many reporters, and they

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.020
aren't going to waste resources on the first-term
Congressman from some district in upstate

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.800
New York. No one even goes to upstate New
York. Is there anyone in upstate New York?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.639
Has anyone ever gone to upstate New York?

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.279
When the Speaker calls a press conference reporters
show up, and the Majority Leader can usually

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.800
get on the Sunday talk shows if he wants. Media access
is a pretty handy way to set an agenda for the public.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.200
Finally, Congressional leaders exercise a
lot of power through their ability to raise

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.189
money and to funnel it into their colleague's
campaign. I want colleagues like that. Each

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.090
House of Congress has a special campaign committee
and whoever chairs it has the ability to shift

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.080
campaign funds to the race that needs it most,
or to the Congressperson he or she most wants

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.189
to influence. The official leadership has
little trouble raising money since donors

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.740
want to give to proven winners who have a
lot of power, and get the most bang for their

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.629
buck. Since the leaders usually win their
races easily, this is more true in the House

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.310
than the Senate. They frequently have extra
campaign money to give. Often the donations

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.700
are given to political action committees, or PACs,
which we'll talk about in another episode.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.819
We're going to spend a lot of time talking
about political parties, and probably having

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.879
parties of our own in later episodes, especially
their role in elections, but they are really

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.189
important once Congress is in office too.
One way that parties matter is incredibly

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.210
obvious if you stop to think about it. It's
contained in the phrase "majority rules."

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.840
This is especially true in the House, where
the majority party chooses the Speaker, but

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.189
it's also the case in the Senate. This is
why ultimately political parties organize

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.560
and raise so much money to win elections: if one of the
parties controls both houses and the presidency,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.260
as the Democrats did in 2008 through 2009, that
party is much more likely to actually get things done.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.900
The party that's the majority in each house
is also the majority on all of that house's

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.099
committees, or at least the important ones,
and, as we saw in the last episode, committees

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.599
are where most of the legislative work in
Congress gets done. Gets did. As you probably

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.080
figured out, the majority party chooses the
committee chairs, too, so it's really got

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.449
a lock on that sweet legislative agenda. Parties
also can make Congress more efficient by providing

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.669
a framework for cooperation. The party provides
a common set of values, so a Republican from

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.989
Florida and one from Wyoming will have something
in common, even if their constituents don't.

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:20.389
These common values can be
the basis of legislation. Sometimes.

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.160
But sometimes -- [punches eagle]
-- that happens.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.060
Political parties also provide discipline
in the process. When a party is more unified

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:34.120
it's easier for the leader to set an agenda and get
the membership to stick to it. Right? Unified.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.909
Lack of party unity can make it difficult
for the leadership. In 2011 a large group

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.169
of very conservative newbie Congressmen associated
with the Tea Party Movement made it difficult

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.239
for Speaker Boehner to put forward an agenda.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.740
The Tea Party caucus felt Boehner compromised
too much with the Democrats, even though his

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:52.209
agenda was, by some standards, pretty conservative.
As a result, Congress wasn't able to get much

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:53.920
done, except make itself unpopular.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.400
So, if you combine all this with the stuff
we learned about Congressional committees,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.800
you should have a pretty good understanding
of how Congress actually works. Yay! Understanding!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.120
As this course progresses and you fall in
love with politics, and myself, be on the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.620
lookout for how the leadership sets the agenda
and pay attention to what issues might be

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.860
floating around that aren't getting discussed
in Congress.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.020
Understanding who the Congressional leaders
are, and knowing their motivations, can give

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.629
you a sense of why things do and don't get
done by the government. And, if you're lucky,

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.339
you live in a district represented by a member
of leadership. In that case, the person you

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:27.050
vote for will be in the news all the time,
which is kind of satisfying, I guess.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.860
Yeah, I voted for that guy! Yeah! And now
he's on the TV! Yeah!

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.800
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
What do you think, can we be unified?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.940
Can we get things done?
We can't.
