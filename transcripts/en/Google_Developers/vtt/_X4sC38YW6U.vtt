BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
Good afternoon everyone,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.781
and welcome to the Making
Money on Google Play session.

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:07.030
My name is Brahim Elbouchikhi.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.878
I'm a product manager on Google
Play working on payments.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.222
BOB MEESE: And I'm Bob Meese.

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:14.680
I'm the head of games business
development for Google Play.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.400
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: So as Bob
and I got together and thought

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.050
about what would be some useful
things that we could share

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.410
with developers today,
things that could help you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.850
make decisions as you run
your Android businesses.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.050
And we landed on talking
about going global

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.520
on Google Play and
the aspects that

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.620
make Google Play a particularly
great platform for becoming

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.020
a global business.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.380
So that we're going
to talk about today.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.360
And we'll do so in two segments.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.380
First, we'll look at data
and some product updates

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.636
from our end-- things that
will kind of produce by Google

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:50.260
that we can share
with you and give you

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.550
insights and best practices.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.050
And then--

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.591
BOB MEESE: And then
for case studies,

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:56.160
we'll have two main focuses.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.500
So first, we'll focus
on what developers

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520
are doing to encourage users
of applications in players

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.470
of games to make a purchase
within the products,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.836
and then second, how developers
are expanding to new markets.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.870
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: All
right, so let's get started.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.460
Before we go too
far, I just want

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.210
to celebrate the announcement
from earlier today.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.260
In case you missed
it, we've paid out

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.990
over $5 billion
dollars to developers

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.790
since we last met
here at I/O. This

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.479
is an absolutely exciting
milestone for us.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.520
We could not have done it
without all of the work

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.576
that you all do.

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:31.450
After all, it is the
applications and content

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.650
you create that the
users actually purchase.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
So incredibly exciting.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.180
And we can't wait
for what we're going

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.090
to do next year and the updates
from next year and all that.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.550
It's going to be
exciting, and this

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.850
is a huge milestone for us.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.930
And we're super
excited about it.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.410
So let's talk about the
next $5 billion dollars.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.040
When we think of monetization,
there are two aspects to it.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.970
There is the experience that
you build, the engagement that

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.050
happens within your application.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.610
It is that which
ultimately triggers someone

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.560
to press the buy button.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.030
It's that excitement
to unlock a new level.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.110
It's that excitement to unlock
new features that ultimately

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.880
make a user press
the buy button.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.580
And as anybody who knows
from a small business,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.900
it is incredibly
hard to get someone

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.160
to actually give you their cash.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.430
It's hard earned cash.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.540
And so, within that, we think
our responsibility is that when

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.850
someone clicks on
that buy button

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.770
that we make sure that
we convert and turn

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.190
those clicks into purchases
for as many users as possible,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.905
wherever they are.

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:42.530
And that's the
interesting aspect here,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.290
is they're wherever they are.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.760
We're on a global platform.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.930
We have buying markets
in 134 countries.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.470
And so the global
aspect of this is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.980
that as we build our
payments platform,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.930
we think about how can
we improve conversion

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.725
for your clicks, your buy
button clicks globally.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.790
Now, let's talk about
the kind of thought

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.910
process for going global.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.790
We always start with
what's familiar to us.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.660
We start with a market that
we understand with a need

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.420
that we relate to as developers.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.630
With a need that we relate to.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.970
With a user experience
that we really love.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.780
And then we expand from there.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.300
They may consider going
to a similar market, one

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.640
where they speak
the same language.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.400
And then from there, he may
go another distant market,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.870
but one that has a similar need.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.170
And all of a sudden, boom.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.120
You're a global developer.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.100
You have users and
buyers in 10, 20, 30, 40,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.740
50 potential countries.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.290
And so this is the exciting
thing about Google Play,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.150
is that this is
achievable, and is actually

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.790
done on a daily basis by
developers like yourselves.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.140
Now, I want to share with
you an interesting metric.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.030
In the US, we
looked at developers

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.270
that are based out of the US.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.260
And those that are earning
most of their income

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.660
internationally-- earn about
2.5.x those that aren't.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.490
And this particular transition
has happened for corporations

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.590
in the past in the US, where
you're domestically based,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.590
you earn most of their
income domestically.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.340
And then one day, whether
consciously or not,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.200
you actually start earning most
of your income internationally.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.899
And as that happens, there
are things that change.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:38.190
And again, whether consciously
or not, there are things

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.770
that change.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.626
And it's important for you to
be conscious of those things.

00:04:43.626 --> 00:04:45.000
Another interesting
metric I want

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.060
to share with you is
that over the past year,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.810
globally, we had a 38%
increase in developers

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.490
that are doing just that--
earning most of their income

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.500
internationally.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.040
This is really exciting to
us, because what it means

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.190
is that developers more and
more are using Google Play

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.350
and particularly using its
power as a global platform

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.612
to grow their businesses.

00:05:09.612 --> 00:05:10.770
That's super exciting.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.000
And we hope that this talk will
help even more developers go

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.830
in that direction.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.550
Hopefully more than one.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.340
So how do you go global
with Google Play?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.290
The first part is really easy.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.400
By publishing an application
on the developer console,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.240
you're actually making it
available in 190 countries.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.090
By making a product that
is buyable on Google Play,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.290
it's already available to
users in over 130 markets.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.490
And in 65 of those
markets, you can actually

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.500
tailor your pricing, which
we'll talk about later.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.010
It's particularly important from
a user experience perspective.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.960
So the first part, check.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.732
You count all our
global merchants.

00:05:59.732 --> 00:06:02.190
One thing we've learned about
payments over the past couple

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.270
years is that there's no silver
bullet-- except for cash,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.270
but we can't take it
in digitally for now.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.550
But otherwise, preferences
vary quite a bit.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.510
So in the US, credit cards
are extremely popular.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.980
In Japan, carrier billing is
the equivalent form of payment.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.730
So interestingly, as you want
to build a global payments

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.280
platform, you actually
have to think very locally.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.260
And these preferences
influence lots

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.570
of other things on the stream.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.830
And so we'll talk
about that next.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.570
So over the past year, we
spent a lot of time thinking

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.890
about these local
forms of payment.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.990
How can we make sure-- again,
in each user for each country

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.660
as they come through and
click on that buy button

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.800
on your application--
how can we make

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.844
sure they do convert as
many of them as possible?

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:52.260
And one of the key
things we found

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.750
is that finding the familiar
form of payment, finding

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.170
the familiar experience, is
actually really important.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.190
So we launched a Google Play
gift card in 13 markets.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.390
We launched carrier billing
now in 25 markets total,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.970
and we launched PayPal,
a longstanding user

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.099
and developer requests
in 13 countries.

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.140
We will continue to expand
these forms of payment

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.730
into more markets.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.450
But at the same
time, we are going

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.630
to think more and more locally
about what forms of payment

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.590
work for users in each
of these countries.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.870
So again, as we build a
global payments platform,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.710
we have to think very locally.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.560
Let's deep dive a bit into the
Germany launch of the Google

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.260
Play gift card.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.050
Year over year, we've had a 70%
growth of buyers in Germany.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.982
While this increasing buyer
engagement is really exciting,

00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:45.440
what is really cool is what
this has done to our conversion

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.000
rates, our payments
conversion rate.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.520
And we've had a 25%
improvement year

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.920
over year in our payments
conversion rates.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.900
What this means is
that more of those

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.970
hard earned clicks that are
coming from your applications

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.910
are converting.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.010
Partially because users are
finding forms of payment

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.800
are familiar to them.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.680
Now at the end of the day,
what you care about is sales.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.500
And over the past
year, we've more than

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.100
tripled our sales in Germany.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.460
Of course, this is partially
due to the continued growth

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.980
of Android devices to
develop new forms of payment.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.200
But also, the great content
and apps that you all

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.880
are creating for the market.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.130
But when these aspects converge
in such a good and perfect way,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.260
we see huge growth.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.020
And so our work now is to
replicate this model elsewhere.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.552
In Hong Kong, we launched direct
carrier billing and gift cards.

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:48.910
And over the past year,
we've seen an 80% improvement

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.480
in buyers-- increasing buyers.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.250
In Russia, we launched
carrier billing,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.890
and over the past year, we've
had 100% improvement in buyers.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.640
Now let's talk about tablets.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.841
Of course, tablets are an
important segment for us.

00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:10.090
And some during the morning
discuss the growth in this

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.410
segment. .

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.400
But one really cool
thing we did today--

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.040
and as of today, actually--
is that we can extend carrier

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.540
billing to you use to tablets.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.170
And this touches on another
important aspect of payments.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.225
When you have a familiar
experience, when

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:26.860
you have a familiar
form of payment

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.480
that you use on a
regular basis, you

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.610
want to find that in every
device you're actually using.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.060
And so extending carrier
billing to tablets

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.600
is particularly important from
a user experience perspective

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.770
as well.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.510
And it will also include,
obviously increase,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.960
revenue spent on tablets.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.640
So we're super
excited about this.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.140
It is available as of this
morning, my engineers tell me.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.270
Woo hoo.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.220
There you go.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.830
Yes.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.760
It's after lunch, it's cool.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.260
So another aspect of,
obviously, any commerce business

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.280
is the content, is what
users are actually buying.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.450
And we're always super excited
about launching new countries

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.179
where developers can sell
their apps-- where developments

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:17.220
can sell their apps from.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.680
So, new developer countries.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.410
And over the past year,
we went from about 30,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.900
31 countries to
having 45 countries.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.000
And what we see when we
launch a new payments

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.710
country for developers is
that a virtual cycle begins.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.760
Developers start to
launch and iterate.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.050
They improve their apps, they
target their content better,

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.180
and then buyers start to get
more engaged with that content.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.860
And then the virtual
cycle begins,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.380
and then we have an extension
of the Android ecosystem

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.830
the flourishes in that country.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.780
And today I'm super
excited to announce

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.470
we're adding another 11
countries over the coming

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.290
weeks.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.810
Our hope and mission is
that anybody anywhere that

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.370
can build an awesome
Android experience

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.060
can monetize and earn a living
in on it here on Google Play.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.920
So we'll not dive
into things that you

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.180
can do to actually
take advantage

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.750
of Google Play as
a global platform.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.440
Again, thinking initially
of the things that we do,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.980
which is what we
just talked about.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.860
And one of the things
that we believe,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.930
best practices that
you can do to take

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.890
advantage of the
global platform.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.194
First is localizing listings.

00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:32.610
This is the best
practices that we

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.360
see most of our best
and top developers

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.480
that ear the most
on Google Play do.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.720
It is pretty straightforward.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.520
If you're addressing a user, you
need to speak their language.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.610
You need to communicate with
them in a way they understand.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.525
And Pocket, as featured
here, does a really good job

00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:54.300
at localizing their
listings and the screenshots

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.280
to each of the
markets they target.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.800
What we have observed
is is that broadly,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.160
apps with localized listings
earn about six times those that

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.750
aren't.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.500
So this is important.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.170
And if you are consciously or
actively addressing a market,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.180
you really need to localize
your listings and the experience

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.440
itself, by the way.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.950
We do provide tools
on the developer

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.110
console to make this really
accessible to all developers.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.030
You can take advantage of those.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.460
Now, pricing.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.250
Pricing is important,
and it's one

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.410
of those-- we have this really
easy to use auto convert

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.940
function, and a
lot of developers

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.210
take advantage of that.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.710
And so, you hit
that button, it auto

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.870
converts into all
of our currencies.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.504
And sometimes, you just
leave it like that.

00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:46.170
What we were seeing
is actually that has

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.310
an impact on your sales.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.640
We all know about
the $0.99 effect.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.160
It's just that
price where somebody

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.030
thinks it's a trivial
purchase here in the US.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.325
Or maybe it's a significant
purchase over $5,

00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:59.330
or whatever that number is.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.310
Well, that exists
in every country.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.620
Every market has that
equivalent threshold.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.220
And you need to consciously
target that price.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.440
And so what we did is
we analyzed products

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.867
that are priced
at exactly 100 yen

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:14.700
and compared their
performance to those that

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.060
are priced slightly
over and slightly below.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.160
Literally, two or three
yens, plus or minus.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.710
And we see a 2x difference in
sales between those two groups.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.150
There is no significant
change in price, obviously.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.540
One more yen or 2 more
yen isn't actually

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.050
driving the conversion
improvement.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.390
But when you user comes
through and you see 101 yen

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.190
as the price of this
product, it simply

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.830
is going to influence
their decision,

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.135
and it just comes
into that split moment

00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:48.410
where you're making that
decision to buy or not.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.670
It becomes an important
decision making factor.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.700
So again, if you're actively
targeting the market,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.490
you really need to consciously
price for that market.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.690
Business models need to
be localized as well.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.980
There are markets where
ads are the primary way

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.480
of earning sales and income.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.610
But there are others where
in-app is the way to go.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.930
There are others where
subscriptions-- especially

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.560
some apps categories
that Bob is going

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.560
to talk about next-- where
subscriptions is the best ways

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.230
to monetize your app.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.390
And so again, as you
go to your application,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.440
think of the various ways that
you can tailor that experience

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.380
to actually have a
different business model.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.730
It is much more challenging,
I have to admit,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.650
to build an application that
can support both subscriptions

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.930
and in-app.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.720
But it is doable.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.390
And if your category actually
is suitable for that,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.570
you should take
advantage of that.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.970
And adMark is announcing
there in-app purchase ads

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.970
which allow you to even
more easily acquire

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.340
users and buyers, which
is another tool for you

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.450
if you are an in-app
given business.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.910
So localize your business model.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.107
Now, let's deep dive
into subscriptions.

00:14:58.107 --> 00:14:59.690
Since we launched
subscriptions, we've

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.210
been very excited
about the growth.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.820
And today, we're
excited to announce

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.410
a number of new features
that will further

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.064
strengthen our platform.

00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:10.480
First, we're
announcing that we'll

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.760
support in the coming few
weeks, weekly and seasonal

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.150
subscriptions.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.650
Seasonal subscriptions,
for example,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.530
will be extremely
good for sports

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.740
where they have a non-
regular recurring period.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.590
Weekly, again, for
a faster occurrence,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.880
for maybe shorter lifespan
type of applications.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.090
Another exciting update
is about goodwill credits.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.770
So it will allow you to actually
better retain the subscribers

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.410
by offering them a
goodwill credit in case

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.090
you had an outage,
or in case they're

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.190
just a really loyal subscriber
and you want to give them

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.980
a bit of a goodwill credit.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.100
So it'll give you more
tools so you can better

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.920
engage and retain
your subscribers.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.220
And you can build a
subscriptions driven business

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.350
on Google Play.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.830
These features will be launching
over the coming few weeks,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.265
so stay tuned on our blogs
for the announcements.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.140
Going back to some of
the metric discussions.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.960
Quality really, really
matters, as you'd expect.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.700
And what we've
done here is looked

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.950
at apps that are rated
between three and four stars,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.710
and those that are
rated between four

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.570
and five and the other brackets.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.690
And you can see the
improvement in sales

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.680
between each of those brackets.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.390
So as you invest in QA, bug
fixing, new device types,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.745
new platform versions, replying
to reviews-- as you invest

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.495
in each of these,
there's obviously a cost

00:16:40.495 --> 00:16:42.380
that you need to evaluate.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.400
We would like you to have also
the upside, the possible upside

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.199
as you look at that
equation and analyze

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.490
what you would like to do next.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.846
Now, we talked about tablets
and how awesome they are now

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.970
and how they'll soon have
carrier billing available

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.810
to them.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.790
But one aspect of tablets as
well is that apps that are

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.630
designed for tablets earn about
10 times compared to those that

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.940
aren't.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.776
And so as-- and
today is particularly

00:17:09.776 --> 00:17:12.359
important for this discussion,
because we've announced so many

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.089
new form factors, so
many new platforms

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.290
you can reach, from
[INAUDIBLE] TV to auto.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.770
And so if you are going to
be-- if your application is

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.069
an application that
is suitable for one

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:27.180
of these new platforms-- again,
designed for that platform,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.315
explicitly designed
for it-- it will

00:17:31.315 --> 00:17:35.340
make it easy to share APKs
across multiple platforms.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.060
It is important
to actually design

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.750
an experience that
works for that.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.990
And so, if a user comes
through on a tablet

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.304
and they're browsing
on a tablet,

00:17:43.304 --> 00:17:45.470
they're simply not going
to have the same experience

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.060
and the same engagement
if that application is not

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.520
designed for that device.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.070
So finally, to wrap up
this portion of talk,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.270
to go global with Google Play,
you need to do a few things.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.507
First, just think beyond
your familiar markets.

00:18:01.507 --> 00:18:04.090
You're all entrepreneurs, and
as you start as an entrepreneur,

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.140
you're thinking of what's
most familiar to you.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.019
But there is this
global multiplier

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:11.560
you can take advantage of, where
you can take the work you've

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.600
done for a specific market,
modify it according to what we

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.720
just discussed, and potentially
actually leverage it

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.110
to actually grow your business
and in a scalable way.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.970
While you think
global, make sure you

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.250
think local-- you act
local, that's it actually--

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.640
you act local.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.530
And so, localize your business
models, your languages,

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.710
your listings, your pricing.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.420
Again, think local.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.647
And then continue to focus on
quality and new form factors.

00:18:39.647 --> 00:18:41.230
We've announced so
many of them today,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.300
it's incredibly exciting.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.842
But build and design for
those new form factors.

00:18:46.842 --> 00:18:48.520
All right, I'm going
hand it off to Bob

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.890
who's going to walk us through a
number of the case studies now.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.072
BOB MEESE: Thanks, Brahim.

00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:59.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:00.380
BOB MEESE: It's so exciting.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.380
This is the second year that
we've done this in a row,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.820
and just like
seeing year to year

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.430
the progress is
amazingly exciting.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.590
So, as I mentioned earlier,
my name is Bob Meese.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.150
I'm the head of games business
development for Google Play,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.641
and I'll review the case study
as part of the conversation.

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:16.140
And so first, before
we get started,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.740
I just want to thank all the
developers that participated

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.800
and helped put this
content together.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.910
As you can see
here from this map,

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.060
they're are all
across the world.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.780
Some of you even traveled
here today for Google I/O.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.080
And so, just really,
thank you for helping

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.970
provide your insights
into this presentation,

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.970
sharing them with me, letting
me share them with everybody

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:36.770
here today.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:37.755
So thank you for that.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.222
As I mentioned earlier,
I'll cover two main sections

00:19:43.222 --> 00:19:44.180
in the case study part.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.650
And so first, I'll talk
about what developers

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.160
are doing to encourage
users of applications

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.960
and players of games to make a
purchase within their products.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.700
And so as Brahim
mentioned earlier,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.030
we have this idea
of what happens

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.180
before someone
presses a buy button.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.640
And that's largely the work
that all of you are doing.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.056
And we'll talk
about some examples

00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:05.960
of that-- and then what happens
after somebody presses that

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.540
buy button.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.980
And Brahim shared all the
great work we're doing there.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.310
And then the second part
will be some case studies

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.350
around how developers
are expanding

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.610
to new markets and geographies.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.560
So let's get started
with the first part.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.820
And so I'll cover six
different strategies

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.890
on this first topic of
encouraging purchase.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.215
And you can see the developers
and the applications

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:26.870
that we'll cover there.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.715
There are some commonalities
are similarities between them.

00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:31.590
So you'll see that the
application developers

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.780
on the left-- all of them
are using subscriptions

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.832
to monetize the businesses.

00:20:36.832 --> 00:20:39.040
And then on the right you'll
see the game developers,

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.269
and all of them are
using in-app purchases.

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:43.060
And so there's certainly
some commonalities

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.484
that we observed across
all these developers.

00:20:45.484 --> 00:20:46.900
There's also some
differences too.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.149
When you look at the strategies
that we'll talk about,

00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:51.235
they are fairly different
across the developers.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.724
So the first of all for
all talk about is Evernote.

00:20:57.724 --> 00:20:59.390
So you look at, why
is this man smiling?

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.610
This is Phil Libin,
the CEO of Evernote,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.330
the developer of a very
successful set of productivity

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:06.830
tools.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.630
They recently
announced last month

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.140
that they now have more than
100 million users worldwide.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.300
So they've been
quite successful.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.990
They take a very
customer centric view

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.010
towards monetizing
their business.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.940
They just want you to keep
using our applications.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.800
They're very confident that
if you keep using Evernote,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.780
eventually you'll
find a reason to pay.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.450
Remember everything is
their motto, their mission.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.270
It's very bold.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.390
But if they deliver
on that, and if you

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.260
keep using their service, you'll
put more and more of your life

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.890
into Evernote and
they'll find a way

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.090
to help you pay for the service.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.900
They really focus on the
perception of user value

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.150
over time.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.850
And they see this big hockey
stick to the right here.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.110
So here, what you
see is over time,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.770
people become much more
likely to pay for Evernote.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.480
In the first month after using
the service, only one half

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.980
of 1% of users actually
pay for the premium version

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.780
of Evernote.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.390
Well, over time that
changes dramatically.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.210
So active users of Evernote at
the one year point, 7% of them

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.080
have upgraded to premium.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.570
At the two year point for
active users of Evernote,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.260
11% of those people have
upgraded to premium.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.710
And after five years, 25%
of active Evernote users

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.124
have upgraded to premium.

00:22:27.124 --> 00:22:29.290
So for them, the goal is
just keeping people around.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.090
And if you look at the
premium features for Evernote

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.630
you'll see why that happens.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.580
Where they offer, for example,
offline access to your content.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.110
They offer better search
across all the different file

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.580
types in your content.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.996
And so there, you'll see that
as you put more of your life

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:46.440
into the service, you get
a lot more value out of.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.636
And there's that aspect.

00:22:47.636 --> 00:22:49.010
And so it's
essentially important

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.490
to think about
how you could have

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.440
some of these aspects in
some of your applications.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.892
On the flip side, when I
was speaking with Evernote,

00:22:56.892 --> 00:22:58.100
they give me a funny example.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.320
They said, just
think of this idea

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.290
of perceived value over time.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.586
And so I have a sandwich that's
either delicious or gross

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:06.710
depending on how old it is.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.834
And so I think the perceived
value of the sandwich,

00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:10.190
it may be five minutes.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.610
Hits its max, and it cools
off, and five minutes

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.540
after it's made, it's great.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.420
Evernote, they give
the five year mark,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.030
five years after the
sandwich is made,

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.340
I want nothing to do with it.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.881
It's going to kill
you if you ear it.

00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:23.340
So it's really important to
think about just the user

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.173
perception of the value
in your applications

00:23:25.173 --> 00:23:27.590
over time, looking for
services like Evernote

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.510
that tend to increase.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.550
And sandwiches, obviously,
they go to zero very quickly.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.920
It's something
where-- as we look

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.850
about the applications that do
this well, applications that

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.420
add personalization,
applications that they grow

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.450
their overall user
base over time--

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.550
those are the
applications that we

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.820
tend to become more
valuable over time.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.580
And so look for opportunities
to add those types of features

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.010
to your apps.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.805
The next company
I'll cover is Noom.

00:23:53.805 --> 00:23:56.180
They were featured in the
keynote this morning, actually.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.610
And they are a New York
City based developer

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.060
of fitness and weight
management applications.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.595
If you eat a lot
of those sandwiches

00:24:03.595 --> 00:24:04.970
we just showed,
you'll definitely

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.900
need Noom to help lose weight.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.920
But what they really
focus on for monetization

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.400
is they recognize that
there's a seasonality

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.720
to the demand for
their business.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.320
And so, around New Year's,
New Year's resolutions.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.940
A lot of people are
interested in losing weight.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.830
Around the period leading up
to summertime, a lot of people

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.680
are also interested
in losing weight.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.650
And so, for a company
like Noom, they

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.800
can't be running
promotions all the time,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.040
but they really try to
sequence those promotions

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.366
around the highest
demand periods of time

00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:34.740
throughout the
course of the year

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.320
to capitalize on people who
are interested in upgrading

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.310
to Noom Pro.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.750
And so here's an example of a
seasonally relevant promotion

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.890
that they ran just recently
for a summer sale-- 50% off

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.100
for Noom Pro.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.440
And you'll see how they
executed that sale.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.670
So they did an in-app promotion
that you'll see on the left.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.710
At the same time, they
did an email promotion

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.210
that reached users
in different ways.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.410
And then they followed
up four days later

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.890
with an in-app
reminder of that sale.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.320
And then you'll see the results
on the slide of-- they're

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.830
able to spike their
revenue, which

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.310
is a really compelling thing.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.960
And so they're able to deliver
three times revenue per day

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.810
by doing these promotions.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.261
And the thing they really focus
on is you cannot run these

00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:19.260
promotions all the time.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.620
But find the times during
the course of the year

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.210
where the demand is
highest your services,

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.540
and run promotions then.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.980
Noom also really, really
has some cool uses

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.020
of data in terms of
helping to convince

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.160
people to upgrade to premium.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.600
And so here, there's an
in-app message that says,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.197
we've looked at data
from millions of Noomers.

00:25:38.197 --> 00:25:40.030
And what we've found
is that the people that

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.646
have upgraded to Pro, they're
losing twice as much weight

00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:45.020
as the people that
are just using

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.550
the free version
of the application.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.090
And so here, this is a
really compelling message

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.935
to deliver to people
to get them to upgrade.

00:25:52.935 --> 00:25:54.310
And when you look
at the features

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.250
within the
application-- so, Noom

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.610
Pro groups-- it's
a way for people

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.790
who have similar
goals to get together.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.610
Noom Pro also unlocks additional
content, provides personalized

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.790
recommendations, and a
priority customer support line.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.680
And so these are
some of the features

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.140
that Noom is using
to upgrade people

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.845
to the Pro version
of the application.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.410
Next we'll talk
about Smar Education.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.340
They are a developer
based in Tokyo

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.160
that makes apps for
children's education.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.450
This is [? Akia Than ?] who
is the CEO of Smart Education.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.720
So, over the past year,
they've made a big pivot

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.750
to their business to
really focus on free trials

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.464
and subscriptions
in their business.

00:26:40.464 --> 00:26:42.130
And so this is an
example of a promotion

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.460
they ran within the most
successful application,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.060
which happens to be based on
a popular Japanese TV show.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.230
And they did a bunch
of testing in terms

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.400
of different types of
promotions they could run.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.950
And they found that
offering a free trial

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.470
was very effective in terms
of getting people to sign up.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.160
What they found was a one
week duration of the trial

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.800
was the optimal
duration for them

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.900
in terms of getting
people to start the trial,

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.108
and then getting people to
convert after that period.

00:27:12.912 --> 00:27:14.370
And effectively,
what they're doing

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.917
is breaking the purchase
decision into two.

00:27:16.917 --> 00:27:19.500
And so they were able to share
some very impressive statistics

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.560
that they have.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.390
And so here on your left,
you'll see the number

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.520
of the percentage of
people who installed

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.680
the application and those
who started that free trial.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.720
And that was about 8%.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.250
But I think, very
impressively, of those people

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.710
that did the trial,
60% percent of them

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.490
actually started the
subscription, which

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.910
is a very impressive number.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.670
And when you put
that together, you

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.715
get 5% of the
installs of this app

00:27:45.715 --> 00:27:49.090
fr Smart Education converting
to a premium subscription.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.180
And I think people who have
a recognition of how hard it

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.550
is to convert people
into payers recognize

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.655
how impressive a result this is.

00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:59.530
Smart Education is not
just a one hit wonder.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.113
And so when you look
at their presence

00:28:01.113 --> 00:28:04.230
on that top charts for the
education category in Japan,

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.430
they're doing quite well.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.790
And so here, half of
these applications

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.130
are Smart Education,
so five of ten.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.880
So it's been great for them.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.750
Now, moving into the games
part of the conversation.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.600
This is Mediocre.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600
There are actually two guys.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.205
So this is Henrich and
Dennis, based in Sweden.

00:28:21.205 --> 00:28:24.030
And it's just really,
really easy like these guys.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.170
They developed a great
game at few months

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.665
ago that's called Smash
Hit that's done quite well.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.340
And so when you talk
about them, they're

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.889
actually not the
most-- they don't

00:28:35.889 --> 00:28:37.430
run a ton of analytics
in their game.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.820
They're a little bit
different than most developers

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.600
in that way.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.620
But what they really focus on
is building a trusted brand.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.110
And what they--
when I was talking

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.318
to them, one of things t
that really came out is just

00:28:47.318 --> 00:28:50.800
they want to develop games
where people just-- players want

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.820
to tell other people about them.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.290
And that's obviously
great free marketing,

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.220
but it's earned as well too.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.440
These guys are not spending
anything on marketing.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.070
But they really focused
on creating a product

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.500
that people love that they
want to tell others about.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.910
And so it's really,
in some ways,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.236
a simplistic
modernization strategy.

00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:11.360
But they really focus on
the quality of the product

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.530
and delivering that
for their players.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.370
And of course, you can't
forget the purchase

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.510
funnel as well too.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.520
Historically, Mediocre
had done something

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.103
where they would
have where they would

00:29:21.103 --> 00:29:22.620
have a paid version of the game.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.200
And they would have a
free version of the game,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.590
and it would be very separate.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:28.160
And you would upgrade but
it was a little bit awkward

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.950
to move within the two.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.660
So here, they have in this
game for the first time, what

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.300
I believe is a much more
compelling and elegant purchase

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:36.840
experience.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.915
And so for me, when I'm playing
the game on your left here,

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:42.560
you'll see I play
for about 15 minutes.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.630
I play through to that point
and I die, unfortunately.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.650
And I have a big
promo that says, hey,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.890
would you like to continue
through the progress

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.030
that you've made.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.840
And it's a pretty
compelling statement

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.020
at that point of the rest
of the time of the game.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.240
If I say, yeah, sure.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.070
I click anywhere in that circle,
it immediately says, hey,

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.820
would you like to get
the premium version,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.970
because that's
what's required to be

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.750
able to save the progress
that you've just made.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.690
And Mediocre is
quite modest in terms

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.310
of only asking for
$2 from any user.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.710
And so they actually convert
quite well in this dynamic.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.030
But it's a really great focus
of great content and really

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.970
elegant purchase
experience that's

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.070
made this game quite successful.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.950
Also don't be afraid to show
your personality as well, too.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.440
So you go through, you
make that purchase.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.440
They actually pop an
achievement that says, hey,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.600
you've just received the
developer love badge.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.650
So, thank you very much paying.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.870
You're supporting
two dudes in Sweden.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.344
And so that they make it
feel a lot more personal.

00:30:38.344 --> 00:30:40.510
It's something-- they don't
have to this obviously--

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.510
but that's what
encourages people.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.120
That's part of what
encourages people

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.870
to tell their friends
about the game.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.540
And if you just at
the results here.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.730
So the blue line at the top
is the top three ranking

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.460
for the game in the US,
and the red line below it

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.760
is the top grossing line
for the game in the US.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.390
And you can see here that
the free rank, the installs

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.330
were just amazingly successful.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.220
So in March, for
several weeks, the game

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.310
was number one, topping even
games like Candy Crush that

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.500
have been mainstays on
the top of the free charts

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.920
for a long time.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.140
I mentioned that Mediocre has
a more modest modernization

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.306
strategy, just looking
for $2 from each user.

00:31:20.306 --> 00:31:21.930
And so they're never
going to be making

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.610
millions of dollars a day.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.110
But this outcome at 57 is great
for any number of developers,

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.090
let alone a developer
that's two people.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.750
And so this is
what I would argue

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.785
is a very successful outcome
for these developers.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.000
Next up is my.com, the
developer of jungle heat,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.290
and they' are based in Russia.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.950
And who you see here is the
games team for Jungle Heat.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.320
And so their approach
was a bit more structured

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.560
in terms of encouraging
first time payer conversion.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.600
And so they did this trial
here where they specifically

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.470
focused at the top of
their funnel on their new

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.670
and their non paying users.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.160
And there, what they
decided was there

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.620
was a specific point in
the overall experience

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.530
of consuming the game
where they would focus

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.760
on trying to convert
people into being payers.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.830
And so, in this case, it was
after someone had completed

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.420
the tutorial, and then
after they had then

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:22.400
won three player versus player
battles within the game.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.840
At that moment-- that's
the second come on.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.950
The third was, they looked
at what the offer would be.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.220
And the offer within this game
was a 2x value versus normal.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.340
And so for the same price that
somebody would normally pay,

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.120
that person would
receive 2x the diamonds.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.690
And you can see that
called out in the lower

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.300
part of the screen.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.460
And then within that,
you have this offer--

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.032
you need to bound
that somehow by time

00:32:46.032 --> 00:32:47.240
to create a sense of urgency.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.679
And so in this case, there
is a timer that counts down

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.970
to say-- they were generous
and they ran this promotion

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.270
for one day.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.070
And so you would have one
day to claim this promotion

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.776
for the discount to convert you
into a payer within the game.

00:32:59.776 --> 00:33:03.130
And so the result
here was very good.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.420
And so during the week
they ran this promotion,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.740
they were converting
two times more

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.610
than they converted
in the previous week

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.291
when they weren't
running a promotion.

00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:13.790
And so there, they're seeing
great results from doing these.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.470
And again, various developers
stagger these promotions.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.220
You can't do them
all the time, and you

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.020
need to find for
every developer what's

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.950
the right cadence for you
to run these promotions.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.470
And finally, in this section of
the talk, I'll adress Playtika.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:30.470
This is them showing off their
beautiful office in Tel Aviv.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.451
And for them, they
are quite impressive.

00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:33.950
I'm hearing more
and more developers

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.570
talking about
player segmentation.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.250
And looking at
Playtika is really

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.000
the leader in this regard
among game developers.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.960
And so, some of history
what they've done.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.300
Over the past several
years, at the top

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.110
here, they used to not segment.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.850
And so they would deliver
the same gameplay experience

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.850
and the same user communication
to all their players.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.280
Next down, they
offered what they

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.470
considered basic segmentation.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.720
And so some of what you've
heard earlier, segmenting out

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.880
the people who have paid within
the games versus the people who

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.260
have not, and then offering
different communications

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.320
to those two groups.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.040
And the third, in
terms of advanced,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.600
you're starting to get much
more real time information.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.520
And so as you have more
nuanced information

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.300
about people and
about their game play,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.280
then you can start to be
more structured in terms

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.489
of creating more and more
segments in a more automated

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:29.346
way.

00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:31.679
And then finally, as they
think about potential for what

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.489
they would call
hyper segmentation,

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.480
there they're adding
more machine learning

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.620
and automated approaches.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.360
So removing some
of the humans who

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.560
are doing some of this advanced
segmentation and letting it

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.300
become more
algorithmic over time.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.239
And so, tangibly
what does this mean,

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.489
they've talked with us a bit
about the business intelligence

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.520
solution that they have, and
the evolution of that over time.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.550
And so in the beginning when
you're not doing segmentation,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.529
they were really just focusing
on accurately collecting events

00:35:03.529 --> 00:35:04.070
from players.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.760
And so for example, if the
game goes offline or crashes

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.630
for whatever reason,
making sure that you

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.270
have a very accurate
and reliable data

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.760
store within the application.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.900
Next is you move into
segmentation that'

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.070
more of the basic format.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.670
So there, if you
remember they're

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.170
just segmenting
out the people who

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.100
have paid within the games
versus the people who have not.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.030
When you have these
very discreet buckets.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.530
For example, some
of the things they

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.640
could do to encourage
purchases are they

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.520
could have their email
marketing team send an email

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.160
out to non payers over the
course of the week giving them

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.480
special promotions.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.380
As you move through
the advanced category,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.860
you're getting
much more real time

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.330
data within the application,
within your analytic systems.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.450
And so rather than having to
do weekend long promotions

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.160
towards a very broad group of
people like all of your non

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.800
payers, you can start to do
much more fine grain promotions

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.090
to people that are
much more fine grain.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.130
And so there we could
do, for example,

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.679
is send personal
notifications to people

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:10.720
based on their game play.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.100
And so how often
they're playing,

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.980
how many sessions per day, for
how long the sessions last.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.670
And you can have a very
customized communication

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.470
to those users based
on the game play.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.310
And then finally, for
hyper segmentation,

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.390
there's key here as
I mentioned earlier,

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.200
is adding additional
machine learning

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.680
in automated approaches
to what humans

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.350
are doing in the advanced state.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.130
And so here, the results are
again just very compelling

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.130
where-- just based on
this segmentation alone

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.840
Playtika noticed that
they were getting

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.380
a 30% uplift in new
payer conversion

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.460
from what I just mentioned.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.660
More broadly, too, they're
seeing a revenue uplift

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.500
of 50% overall for the
segmentation activities

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.660
that they're doing overall.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.750
And so they're seeing both an
impact on new payer conversion

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.360
as well as their
overall revenue, which

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.350
is quite impressive
at this point.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.815
All right, next we'll cover
expanding to new markets.

00:37:04.815 --> 00:37:07.140
And so here, we'll cover a
couple of developers already

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.910
mentioned briefly, and then a
couple that are more specific.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.020
And just in terms of
breaking this down,

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.490
there's certain developers
that have applications

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.510
like Smash Hit, like Evernote.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.570
As I mentioned, just
broadly applicable.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.490
And Google Play is
very powerful in terms

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.180
of allowing those developers to
reach just a global audience,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.370
in many cases, without
much customization.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.960
And then at the
bottom you'll see,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.209
there's a lot of developers--
we get a lot of interest

00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:33.280
in terms of, how
do I go to Japan?

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.990
How do I come to the US?

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.552
How do I reach
other Asian markets?

00:37:36.552 --> 00:37:38.010
And so we have a
couple of examples

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.000
of developers that
have done just that.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.800
And so there's a
difference between those

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.630
that are looking for the
broad swath of geographies,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.330
and then some specific
target geographies.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.780
And so if you look
at Smash Hits,

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.590
I showed that the US graph
of the results earlier.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.271
But their success was hardly
constrained to just the US.

00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:57.020
And so here, there's
a bunch of countries.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.810
They were number one in
23 different countries

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.750
during that time.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.950
And if you look at just a
couple rungs down the latter,

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.940
so if you look at the
top five-- that not 23,

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.900
but it's an additional
11 countries.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.050
But there within the
top five top free.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.910
And so for a developer
like Smash Hit,

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.710
they invested a
relatively modest amount

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.960
in terms of changing the game.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.450
It's a relatively simple game.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.300
And so it's the
power of, if you can

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.030
create a compelling yet simple
experience on Google Play,

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.980
you can reach this
vast audience and have

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.180
just a great amount of success.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.770
Then Evernote is similar
too where Evernote says,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.810
they have the same
service worldwide.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.450
They believe that they're
addressing a universal need.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:40.580
And so they don't feel a need to
radically change that service.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.050
As I mentioned earlier,
Evernote announced last month

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.969
that they have now
over 100 million users.

00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:47.510
And they're based
here in California.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.120
But if you look at how
those users are distributed,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.280
their biggest areas
is actually APEC.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.680
And their second
biggest area is Europe.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.910
And so it's not-- the US is the
third largest region for them.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.570
And so it's been really
powerful for them

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.370
to be able to reach such a
broad demographic and broad base

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.230
of countries with that service.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.120
And when you look at
it, Evernote-- it's

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.290
very language intensive.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.510
And so while they believe
that it's OK for the service

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.450
to be consistent
across geographies,

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.190
they obviously
need localization.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.510
And so here, they're
based in the US

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.732
and so obviously they
started with English.

00:39:23.732 --> 00:39:25.440
And then Brahim had
mentioned earlier too

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.981
about what is familiar with us.

00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:28.730
And so the other
countries that they chose

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.670
were Russia and Japan.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.580
And Russian-- because
Phil who I showed earlier

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.160
is actually born in Russia.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.440
And a number of early
Evernote employees

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.640
were actually Russian.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.880
And so just starting
with what is familiar

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.980
and authentic-- this is
clearly an example of that.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.434
And Japan was just--
for whatever reason,

00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:48.350
they started to get a
bunch of users in Japan.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.650
So that moment, you decide,
OK, do we establish a presence

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.670
here, are we going to
really lean into this,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.110
or is this something where
we need to pull back.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.760
And so in their case, they
established an office,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.410
they established
customer support.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.710
They really focused on investing
in the quality of translations

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.600
that they were doing
for the Japanese market

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.872
and were very successful.

00:40:06.872 --> 00:40:08.580
And so on the basis
of those first three,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.082
they've grown to 14
and up 34 languages

00:40:11.082 --> 00:40:13.540
that Evernote is supporting,
and it's growing all the time.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.390
Next, I'd like to talk
about the developers

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.670
Space Ape and their
game Samurai Seige,

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.200
which although it launched
recently in Japan,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.530
it's been successful so far.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.946
And there's just
a lot of interest

00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:29.670
in terms of Western
developers who

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.650
say, how can I be
successful in Japan?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.690
So we'll talk a little
about what they've done.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.910
And so this is the 50 or
so people in the company

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.540
and their avatars
on the website.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.332
So you can see that,
definitely a fun group

00:40:41.332 --> 00:40:44.890
of people who don't take
themselves too seriously.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:47.690
And so in terms of how
they prepared for Japan,

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.480
there were just a
couple of key steps.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.250
And so localization
is really important.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.420
And so doing a lot
of the localization

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.360
of the game by hand
is really important.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.960
And so, as Brahim
mentioned, localization

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.566
is something that
really important.

00:41:02.566 --> 00:41:05.190
You can't necessarily just trust
the autofill for these things.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.648
You need to do
something that feels

00:41:06.648 --> 00:41:08.910
authentic in the
local geography.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.400
And then on that point too,
they invested in a local team

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.460
as well with country
manager, customer support,

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.210
and all of that.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.150
Local PR too.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.360
Just reaching the publications
that the local gaming

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.660
audience pays attention to is
really important for Space Ape,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.000
and they found
success with that.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.850
Game play.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.770
So they did a soft launch.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.350
They believed that they didn't
need to change the game,

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.490
they wanted to test that to
make sure that was the case.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.310
So they did need to
provide a super custom

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.520
version of the game for Japan.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.530
And finally, in terms
of what was not done.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.904
So as I was just
mentioning, they

00:41:40.904 --> 00:41:43.930
didn't fork a version of the
game to be Japan specific.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.830
They believe that the core
global version of the game

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.829
would be appropriate for
the Japanese audience.

00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:50.620
And they also didn't
work with a publisher.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.362
So by investing
so many resources

00:41:52.362 --> 00:41:54.320
into the Japanese audience,
they felt confident

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.066
that they could be
successful on their own.

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.850
And so in terms of the results.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.020
So on the left, the game
developers in the room

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.400
will see these results.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.910
And they'll know
that it's early,

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.320
but they're quite impressive.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.610
Particularly the
per user metrics.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.080
In terms of the lessons
learned, Space Age

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.950
really focuses on live events.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.390
And the Japanese market
really rewards live events.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.060
A lot of the best
Japanese developers

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.820
run great live events.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.130
And so that was simply
something that was successful.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.510
The localization that they
invested in was very helpful.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:27.010
And as I mentioned, by
reaching local PR outlets,

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.270
they were able to reach
some really strong players

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.330
in that way.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.477
Next is Com2us in
their expansion,

00:42:34.477 --> 00:42:36.560
they're a Korea based
developer in their expansion

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.490
of their game Ace Fishing
to Southeast Asia.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:43.649
This is the local game
team for Ace Fishing.

00:42:43.649 --> 00:42:45.690
And so you can see, this
is the revenue pie chart

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.680
for Ace Fishing.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.930
Very impressively, more
than half of their revenue

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.770
is coming from Southeast Asia.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.620
And the second largest piece
of the pie is actually the US.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.970
It's not until you get
to the third largest

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.220
piece of the pie, which is
their home market in Korea.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.101
So obviously they're having a
lot of success internationally.

00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:03.610
When you look at
what they're doing,

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.110
they're investing
very significantly

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.990
in locally
appropriate marketing.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:09.870
And so here, for Southeast Asia,
they're doing print magazines,

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.640
they're doing online magazines.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.230
They're doing web tunes
for community engagement.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.010
They're doing outreach to power
bloggers to get game reviews,

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.159
and they're doing a whole
slew of media and PR

00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:20.700
that you see on the
right in addition

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.116
to working with us to make
sure that we're supporting them

00:43:23.116 --> 00:43:26.090
with our local teams.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.030
Then finally in here
we'll talk about Gumi.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.360
And so here, Gumi
is a company as you

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.250
can see-- these guys
are also smiling,

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.020
they're doing amazingly well.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.980
They're really a model
for global expansion.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.664
And here's a big
reason why, I think.

00:43:39.664 --> 00:43:42.080
It's not something they're
just bolting onto the business.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.520
But when you look at them,
they're based in Tokyo,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.850
but here's all the
various offices.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.130
They have about half
of their whole company

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.770
outside of the headquarters.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.690
And they give them a
lot of autonomy as well.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.356
In many cases, they're
calling the heads

00:43:54.356 --> 00:43:57.770
of these local offices
the CEOs of those offices.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.820
And so Gumi, unlike
the other companies

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.410
takes a very local approach
to distributing their content

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.774
in various geographies.

00:44:06.774 --> 00:44:08.690
And so here, I mentioned
around customization.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.660
So their game Brave Frontier has
been their most successful game

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.797
from Japan coming to the US.

00:44:14.797 --> 00:44:17.130
And some of the things that
they're doing are obviously,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.400
translation is kind
of table stakes.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.610
But they have made the tutorials
very different as well too.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.720
And so RPG games in
Japan are quite common.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.664
You don't really need as long
of a tutorial in that geography.

00:44:29.664 --> 00:44:31.830
First in the US, there's a
lot of game players here,

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.110
but they want to reach
a broader audience,

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:36.220
and so they made
a longer tutorial

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.622
to help educate a broader
demographic who may not

00:44:38.622 --> 00:44:41.080
be familiar with this type of
the game about the value that

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:41.680
provides.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.700
And they've been quite
successful with that.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.390
And then even a
more extreme sense,

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.390
they've changed some of
the game play mechanics.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.640
So some Asian countries that are
accustomed to PCI online gaming

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.290
culture where session
lengths are quite long,

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.610
Gumi actually removed the
energy mechanic from its game

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.620
for those geographies.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.180
So they're willing to invest
in extreme customization

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.782
with its games when
it's appropriate

00:45:00.782 --> 00:45:01.740
for the local audience.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.450
And see here as I
mentioned, Brave Frontier

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.780
has been the most successful
Japanese game in the US.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.140
Here's the results
from this here.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.900
And they've reached
a peak top grossing

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.414
rank of number six, which
is extremely impressive

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.830
and have held onto
that quite well

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.140
for the course of the year.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.240
So that almost wraps
up our presentation.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.850
But just in summary, how
we think about making money

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.980
on Google Play, we're really
working in partnership

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.790
with all of you.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.002
And that's why the two
of us do this every year.

00:45:32.002 --> 00:45:33.960
But it's really all the
work the developers are

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.930
doing to encourage the
users of applications

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.820
and the players of games to
make that purchase, and then

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.410
the responsibility that
we have to keep investing

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.020
in our platform to be launching
more and better features

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.987
every single year.

00:45:47.987 --> 00:45:49.570
And then the global
piece as well too.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.100
So just delivering great
advice to all of you

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.710
about how you can build
your business globally.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:58.480
And so activating all of the
local markets that are there,

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.830
helping you
localize, helping you

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.510
learn from others that are
succeeding these other markets

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.565
to help you be
successful globally.

00:46:05.565 --> 00:46:07.940
So before we go, we want to
call out a couple of sessions

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.523
in particular.

00:46:08.523 --> 00:46:10.380
And so our friends
Kho and Yoshi are

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.660
going to be presenting tomorrow
at 9:00, Goin Global on Google

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.250
Play.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.990
It won't have as of
a monetization theme,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.531
but it'll be a lot
of similat topics.

00:46:17.531 --> 00:46:19.160
Highly, highly
recommend that talk.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.510
And then please do the second
one, the Google Play power

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.180
session.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.770
So Ellier Powers who did
such a great job this morning

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.130
presenting the keynote will
be up next on this stage,

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.030
so please stick around for that.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.000
So thank you very much
for your time today.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.550
[APPLAUSE]
