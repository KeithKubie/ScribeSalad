00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's say that someone's running
a fairly unusual pet store that

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.480
only has three types
of animals in it.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.910
It has cats, and we
represent the number

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.230
of cats with the letter c.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.590
It has dogs, and we
represent the number of dogs

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.290
by the letter d.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.200
And it has bears.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.680
That's what makes it unusual.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
And we're going to represent
the number of bears

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.150
with the letter b.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.940
Now, this person also tells us
that at this unusual pet store,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.790
the number of cats is greater
than the number of dogs, which

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410
is greater than the
number of bears.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.780
Now based just on
this information,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.590
they then ask us which
expression is greater.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.270
b divided by c plus
d plus b or 1/3.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
And I encourage you to pause
the video now and come up

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.120
with your own rationale behind
which of these is greater.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.787
Or maybe neither is greater.

00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:58.620
Maybe they're equal.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.578
Or maybe you just don't
have enough information

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:03.480
from what this pet store owner
told us to actually figure out.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.067
So pause the video now.

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:08.400
So let's reason through what
this expression is actually

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.440
representing.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.140
This is b, the number of
bears, over the number of cats,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.670
plus the number of dogs,
plus the number of bears.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.826
So there's the number of
bears over the sum of all

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:24.325
the animals.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.390
So this really is the
fraction that are bears.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620
Now so this question
really reduces

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.060
to is the fraction that are
bears greater than a third,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.070
less than a third, equal to
a third, or can we not tell?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.580
And there's a bunch of different
ways to do this problem.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.950
And I'll try to expose
you to many ways

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.640
in this video and the next.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.450
So let's do a visual one
doing different cases.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230
Let's do the scenario where
the fraction that are bears

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.170
are greater than one third.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.070
So let's visualize this.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.660
So this little diagram
right over here.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020
Let's say this is all of
the pets in the pet store.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.570
And I've divided it into
thirds right over here.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.140
If the fraction that are bears
is greater than one third,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.670
then it might look
something like this.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.720
So this is a third
under the dotted lines.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.178
If I want to be greater than
1/3, I'll go a little bit more

00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:28.660
than greater than 1/3.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.830
So we go greater than
1/3 right over there.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.530
But if the fraction of
bears is greater than 1/3,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.286
well the fraction of dogs has
to be even greater than that.

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:40.410
So it has to be at least
as much as this blue area.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.600
So it's going to be
even greater than that.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.170
And the fraction
that are cats has

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.780
to be even greater than that.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.327
And I didn't even make
this one that great.

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:50.910
It has to be more
than this blue area.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.090
And the fraction
that are cats has

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.460
to be even greater than that.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.030
And you see, you can't
have three things

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.620
that are all greater than
1/3 adding up to a whole.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.140
You can't have all three parts
of it being greater than 1/3.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.369
So this scenario breaks down.

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.160
Another way you could
have thought about it

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
is if this expression right over
here is greater than a third,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.550
then c plus d over this
has to be less than 2/3.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.010
But that means one
of them, c or d,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.450
would have to be definitely
less than a third

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.700
in order for that to work out.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.400
So at least thinking
about this way,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.170
you know that this thing
cannot be greater than a third.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.320
Let's think about whether
it can be equal a third.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.075
Let's imagine if this
expression, the fraction that

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:35.080
are bears, were
equal to a third.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.960
So let's make our diagram again.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.420
So in this situation, the
bears are exactly 1/3.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.100
So I'll just color in this
third right over here.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.010
So exactly 1/3 are bears.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.469
But we know that
the number of dogs

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.968
is greater than the
number of bears.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.400
So the fraction
that are dogs has

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.862
to be greater than the
fraction that are bears.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:00.320
So the fraction
that are dogs would

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.486
have to be greater than 1/3.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.840
But if the fraction that are
dogs are greater than 1/3,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.380
then all we have left is
something less than 1/3

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.260
for the cats.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.760
That's actually the
largest fraction

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.090
of the animals are cats.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.575
So we know that this also
is not a possibility.

00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:19.950
So what we're
really left with is

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.040
that this has to
be less than 1/3.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.130
And let's make sure
that's reasonable.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.230
So, let's paste another
example right over here.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.911
So if the bears
are less than 1/3--

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:37.660
let me make it a little
bit more dramatic,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.590
so that you can make it clear.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.040
So this is less than a third.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.627
let's say that the
purple, the dogs,

00:04:49.627 --> 00:04:51.210
let's say they're
roughly exactly 1/3.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.600
Then you could make
a scenario where

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.210
you have the largest
proportion of cats.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.372
So this would be the
cats right over here.

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:02.955
That's not the same
color as the cats.

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.520
Let me do the same color
as that pink color.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.060
So this right over
here is our cats.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.970
So this is complete believable.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.260
c over c plus d
plus b does indeed

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.480
look bigger than d over c plus
d plus b, which does indeed

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.410
look bigger than b
over c plus d plus b.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.620
This is completely believable
to be less than 1/3.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.540
So based on just this visual
argument that we just made,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.880
you could say hey, look.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.400
This right over here
is the larger quantity.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920
In the next video,
I'll give what

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.120
I would call more of an
analytical argument, where

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.690
I won't draw diagrams
to show that this

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.810
has to be less than 1/3.
