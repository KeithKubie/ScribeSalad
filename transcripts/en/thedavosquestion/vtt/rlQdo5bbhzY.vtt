&gt;&gt; Hi Zennie I really loved your video and
I would like to respond to it because , I

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.660
sort of feel about it in the same way.
I worked for a lot of refugees in London and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.710
I think that one of the greatest problems
that we have is our difficulties

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.230
in receiving and tolerating anyone who's different
from ourselves. We have so many boundaries

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.989
in the world and I think
that one of the only ways that we can start

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.449
to mount those boundaries by really talking
to each other. We need to listen to

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.730
each other's stories. That's the bottom line
really and art and culture can help with that

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.030
a great deal, but we also need to
encourage you know businesses and politicians

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.239
to listen in a slightly different way. There
was this young kid from China on

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.430
my session yesterday who said "you know the
politicians need to use their ears as something

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.989
other than just operations on the
side of their head" and I just thought that

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.219
was brilliant. So I heard you and I'm working
very hard myself to mount those

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.480
strange walls that we put up between each
other and I think that that kind of work can

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.630
be done on the ground, every day, just
by turning around to someone who looks different

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690
to you and saying hello what's your story.
