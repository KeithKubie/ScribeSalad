00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say we are simulating a nondeterministic RAM machine

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
inside of a deterministic RAM,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so the main cost of that is simulating the if&lt;u&gt;better function since&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it's really the primary difference between

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a deterministic RAM and a nondeterministic one.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But what exactly is the cost of simulating if&lt;u&gt;better?&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's say we have a polynomial time algorithm,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and that algorithm uses if&lt;u&gt;better a constant number of times.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then does that mean that the simulation on the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
deterministic RAM takes a constant number of time,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a linear number of time, a polynomial amount of time,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or an exponential amount of time?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And similarly, if we use the if&lt;u&gt;better function&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a logarithmic number of times in the input

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or a linear number of times in an input,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and just for kicks,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
let's do something a little bit more challenging.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
How about if we use the if&lt;u&gt;better command&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
every 3rd instruction in the execution,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
then how much time does this simulation cost us?

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
