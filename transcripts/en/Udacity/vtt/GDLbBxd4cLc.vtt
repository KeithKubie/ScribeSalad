00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.342
So, we started out lesson one using a

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:04.910
lot of different functions, and we built two main

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.590
projects. In the first one, we helped our

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.260
friends take a break and in the second one

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140
we sent a secret message to our loved

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.640
ones. Then we came across a scenario, while building

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.470
a movie website, where using functions didn't quite present

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.210
a very elegant solution. That solution requires something new.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.720
And that new idea, in programming, is called classes,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.920
and here in lesson two, we will spend a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.780
lot of time, and build a lot of different

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.300
examples, showcasing the power of using classes. Now, we will

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.310
return to our movie database example in lesson three.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.600
But here, in lesson two, we will start out with

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.570
ideas and examples that are the easiest for me

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.800
to explain the power of classes to you. Let's begin.
