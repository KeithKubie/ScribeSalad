00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.319
Well, it’s finally happened.

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.400
My cat evolved.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.160
He wants me to call him Steve, can you believe
that?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.350
Steve is obsessed with vinyl, coffee shops
and wants best burrito in the city.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.350
Did I say evolved?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:19.019
Hello evolved 
primate animals of the family great ape, Trace

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.019
here.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.650
You’re watching a science show, so I’m
assuming you know what evolution is… slow

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.599
change over time by random mutation, right?

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.739
It usually takes generations to observe evolution
in action.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.110
As Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species,
“Natura non facit saltum” -- nature makes

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.730
no leap, but perhaps Darwin was looking in
the wrong place, and in cities, “natura

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.930
salit” … nature jumps!

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.440
Normally, in “natural and non-urban” systems,
evolution takes about one million years, but,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.470
in urban systems -- evolution might work completely
differently.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.350
From 2000 to 2030, human cities will nearly
triple in land area; adding another 1.2 million

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.290
square kilometers or about the whole of South
Africa.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.870
This will obviously affect the evolution of
animals that we share this planet with, and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.530
a new study in the January 2017 Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences has found

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.530
just that.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.740
Rapid human urbanization screws with the evolution
of species, causing evolution to happen not

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.280
in a million years, but in just a few decades…

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
As humans build cities, we displace and severely
alter the natural environment; causing animals

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.659
to adapt (slash mutate) or go extinct.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.270
Say we cut down a forest and put up buildings
over a few years.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.900
Without the forest, migratory birds have to
adapt to be able to stop and rest in this

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.060
new environment.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.709
That might seem easy, but birds don’t think
buildings and trees are similar.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.799
Buildings might not provide the cover from
predators birds evolved to seek out!

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.189
Buildings don’t have tasty bugs living on
or near them to eat!

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.380
So the birds might just fly on by…

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.409
But, birds with mutations enabling them to
adapt to these conditions go on to survive,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.340
while others don’t.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.359
Evolution by human natural selection.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.549
This is similar to the idea of human harvesting,
or human selection.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.710
We take an animal out of the natural order
and guide its evolution in a favorable way

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290
to us.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.890
Think farm animals or pets.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.900
And the built environment isn’t just about
sidewalks and buildings.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
Transmission towers for cell phones and radio
are often made of zinc-coated steel, because

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.500
zinc doesn’t rust.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.980
But, zinc can be toxic to some plants, causing
necrotic lesions, and chlorosis (reduction

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.510
of green color).

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.000
Plants with mutations to resist zinc can thrive
on or near towers, while others die out.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.530
Evolution by human selection.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.340
Even when we try and help, by building fish
ladders to provide a path for spawning species,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.770
like we did in 1966, at a dam in Norway, human
activities still affect their natural evolution.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.690
By 2003, the brown trout that were too large
or too small to use the ladder had pretty

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.980
much died out, leaving only the middle-size
mutants behind.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.630
Who cares, amirite?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.810
Well, lots of other species rely on the trout,
either to eat, or to BE eaten!

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.770
Different trout can change the whole ecosystem.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.210
Just like with the bird and plant examples,
we have no idea the ultimate cost or benefit

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.200
to these human-selected mutations thanks to
our urbanization.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.640
Of course, urbanization has been connected
to global warming as well, but we also have

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.810
to consider overfishing, overhunting, land
use, habitat destruction, and of course -- human

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.940
harvesting of animals from an environment.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.050
All of these things have an effect on evolution.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.460
There was a time when a human could stand
on a desert plain and know we are but a speck

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.790
on a speck, the power of the Earth is the
ultimate authority.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.300
That’s still true, but now Earth has a middle
manager, and we are really changing how things

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.930
work around here… maybe not always in the
best way.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.180
How does this make you feel?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.820
Let us know down in the comments.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.900
Can evolution reverse?

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.700
Can we make it all better?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.260
