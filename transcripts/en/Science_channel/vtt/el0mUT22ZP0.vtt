00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.868
Narrator:
A VERTICAL MILLING TOOL SCULPTS

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:11.334
A RECESS IN THE BLANK
TO SEAT AN O-RING SEALER.

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.868
THEN, SWITCHING BITS,

00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:15.267
THE MACHINE CONTOURS
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BLANK,

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.968
TAKING IT FROM
RECTANGULAR TO ROUND.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.767
OTHER TOOLS CARVE
A LARGE HOLE IN THE CENTER

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:24.567
AND PROFILE THE INNER DIAMETER

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:27.634
SO THAT THE PART
WILL MATE TO THE TANK.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:30.067
THIS RING IS DESIGNED
TO BE REMOVABLE

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:32.634
TO ACCESS THE TANK
FOR MAINTENANCE.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.868
HERE'S THE BLANK BEFORE
AND AFTER MACHINING.

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:39.734
LIKE POWERFUL COOKIE CUTTERS,

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.300
COMPUTERIZED PUNCHES CUT OUT
NUMEROUS PARTS

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.367
FROM AN ALUMINUM SHEET.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.033
THEY INCLUDE THE OIL-TANK BODY,

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.701
THE TOP,
AND OTHER ASSEMBLY PIECES.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.334
TO MAKE THE TANK BODY
CYLINDRICAL,

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:56.167
A WORKER TURNS A CRANK
TO CURL IT AROUND A ROLLER.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:59.100
THIS TANK BODY
IS CALLED THE WRAPPER.

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:05.868
A WORKER WELDS THE TANK RING
TO THE BOTTOM CONE,

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.567
CREATING A THICK SEAM
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.100
HE THEN SEALS THE SEAM
OF THE CYLINDRICAL WRAPPER BODY

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.234
AND WELDS A TOP CAP
TO A DEAERATING BAFFLE.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.601
AIR WILL RISE THROUGH IT
AND VENT IT INTO

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:26.067
AND OUT OF A SIDE CHAMBER,
LEAVING ONLY OIL IN THE TANK.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.300
HE FITS AN ADAPTER RING
TO THE UPPER LIP OF THE TANK

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.434
AND TAPS IT DOWN
WITH A RUBBER MALLET.

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:34.767
A WORKER NOW TAPS
PERFORATED PLASTIC INSERTS

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.767
INTO HOLES
IN THE AIR-VENT CHAMBER.

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.067
THESE INSERTS WILL BOTH VENT

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:43.067
AND FILTER THE AIR
FROM THE TANK.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:45.667
HE FITS A RUBBER SEALING
RING AROUND THE FILL NECK

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:49.133
AND SCREWS THE CAP ON.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.200
HE APPLIES
ADHESIVE-BACKED DECALS

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.467
TO THE TANK
FOR BRANDING PURPOSES.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.334
HE CAPS THE OIL-INLET TUBE

00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:00.234
TO KEEP CONTAMINANTS OUT
DURING SHIPPING.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.767
HE TURNS THE TANK UPSIDE DOWN

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.000
AND INSTALLS A VALVE
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE VENT TANK.

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.367
HE INSERTS A RUBBER O-RING

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.567
INTO A GROOVE ON THE BASE
OF THE TANK WALL

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:18.901
AND TUCKS IT INTO PLACE
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.567
AFTER EQUIPPING
THE FITTINGS ON THE CONE

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.033
WITH CAPS FOR SHIPPING,

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:28.701
HE INSTALLS THE CONE
ON THE BASE OF THE TANK

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.033
AND SCREWS THE RING
TIGHTLY TO IT.

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:35.667
ACCESSING THE TANK
FOR MAINTENANCE REASONS

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.701
WILL MEAN UNSCREWING THIS PART.

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:45.634
THAT COMPLETES
THIS RACECAR OIL TANK.

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:48.167
HOOKED UP TO A SYSTEM OF PUMPS,

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.133
THESE TANKS WILL RECEIVE
AND DISPENSE OIL

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:54.334
SPARINGLY TO IMPROVE
ENGINE PERFORMANCE.

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:57.801
THEY'VE BEEN WELL-EQUIPPED
FOR LIFE IN THE FAST LANE.
