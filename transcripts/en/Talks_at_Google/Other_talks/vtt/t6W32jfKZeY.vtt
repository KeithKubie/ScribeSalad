00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone.
This is another amazing Authors@Google event.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.050
Today's talk is by Jeff Wise, who's a science
journalist and a

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.160
full-time adventure seeker.
He seems to find adventures wherever he goes.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.369
He's a contributor to many popular magazines,
including the very

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.029
popular "I'll Try Anything" column for Popular
Mechanics.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.550
He's here to talk about his book called "Extreme
Fear", get a copy.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.739
Um, "Extreme Fear: The Science of Your Mind
in Danger".

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.620
In this book, he talks about fear.
And he writes a very gripping view of the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.640
science behind it.
Let's give him a warm welcome.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.380
JEFF WISE: Thank you very much.
I appreciate you're all coming out to learn

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.750
about my book.
So I just want to start by talking about fear

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.480
 -- what is fear?
Why should we care about it?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.059
Now, every organism on the planet has some
very basic motivations.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:11.630
It needs to find food and it needs to reproduce.
And it needs to avoid being eaten or killed.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.380
So fear is a response that, you know, even
in the most primitive form,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.600
every creature has.
And it's -- it evolved in a very early state

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.659
in our development but as
we evolved, we generated layer after layer

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.980
of sophistication.
And it's something that we tend to have a

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.040
paradoxical relationship
with.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.710
It's something that we on the one hand that
we try to avoid as much as

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.240
possible.
We avoid danger.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.439
We avoid situations where we're going to become
fearful.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.380
But at the same time, we're drawn to it.
We go on roller coaster rides.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.329
We go to see scary movies.
We read books like "Extreme Fear: The Science

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.810
of Your Mind in Danger".
So for me it became a really interesting question

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.069
of why is it that we
can have such contradictory feelings towards

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.380
this one seemingly simple
emotion?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.069
A little bit about myself, my own background.
I started off being interested in science.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.180
I got my degree in biology at Harvard and
wasn't really interested in

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.530
test tubes or field work.
I was more interested in the storytelling

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.070
aspect of fear, learning
about how things evolved, why things are the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.280
way they are.
And I became a journalist, ultimately, rather

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.660
than a scientist.
But I was drawn to the scientific stories

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.010
that were unfolding in the
world around me.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.709
And the way my career took me was towards
a lot of adventure travel.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.730
And I found myself doing things like bungee
jumping, white water

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.800
rafting, jumping out of airplanes, that sort
of thing.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.890
And as I found myself in these situations,
where my heart was in my

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.170
throat, my palms were sweaty, my heart was
racing -- much like right

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.190
now, for instance.
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.069
Um, I thought, why is this happening?
What's going on?

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.250
Like most of us, I tend to think of myself
as someone who is in charge

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.140
of my brain.
I'm in charge of what I do.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.379
I'm in charge of what I think and how I act.
But when you're on the edge of a cliff and

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.710
you know rationally that
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.519
You know that there's these elastic cords
attached to your ankles.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.519
You know, the chances of something going wrong
are pretty small.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.659
Statistically.
But there's something inside your brain that

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.580
doesn't recognize
statistics, it doesn't understand elastic

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.720
bands.
And it comes up in a very powerful way.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.840
And you suddenly find yourself thinking, what
am I doing here?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.520
This is awful.
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.250
And so I found myself again and again in this
situation where a part of

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.629
my brain was taking over my conscious thought.
And I thought, what's happening?

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:18.350
I want to find out more about this.
And so I started this journey of looking into

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.691
the research and talking
to scientists and figuring out what's happening?

00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:25.480
Where does it come from?
And how does it work?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.760
Ultimately, the idea is being that if you
understand how it works,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.110
hopefully, you'll be able to stay in control
a little bit better.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.881
That's the hope.
Um, but since I'm at Google today, I thought

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.080
I would look at it from a
slightly different perspective from how I

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.260
tackle it in the book.
I guess there's probably a fairly high concentration

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.810
of computer
scientists here and people who work with code

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.080
and processors and
things.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.030
So I think that you guys all have a unique
perspective on how the brain

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.930
works or how we think about how the brain
works.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.050
Because as you know, the brain is a mysterious
thing that we only can

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.550
grasp indirectly.
I mean, we have our own direct intuition of

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.640
what's happening inside our
own skulls but it's a slippery fish that evades

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.890
our grasp.
I think I'm going to do this and I then I

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.790
wind up doing something else.
Or one day I think that buying a certain kind

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.570
of car tomorrow is going
to make me happy and then it turns out that

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.280
it makes me miserable.
We're very poor at predicting our own mental

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.600
behavior.
So, to make a long story short, we have -- tend

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.100
to have metaphors for what
the brain is like.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:49.530
And, um, when computers became a reality in
 -- after World War II, the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.180
model of the mind as a kind of computer became
increasingly

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.090
fashionable.
And one of the seminal moments in the modern

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.540
understanding of the brain
was a theorist named Alan Turing, who I'm

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.180
sure you all are familiar
with, who devised a kind of a thought experiment

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.130
called the Turing test.
And the idea was that if you could create

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.841
a machine who could answer simple
questions or not-so-simple questions in a

00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.320
way that was indistinguishable
from a human being then you would have to

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.970
admit that that computer was
essentially equivalent in some fundamental

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.810
way to the human mind.
And it's a good story and so it became very

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.140
plausible.
And it became essentially the basis, I think,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.190
for how artificial
researchers progressed from that point.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:47.460
The idea was that if you could model a response
to a English language

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.260
question or whatever language you're posing
it in, if you could get

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.780
that right then you had essentially solved
the problem of human

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.660
consciousness.
So in Turing's sort of thought experiment,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.010
he gave the example of a --
of a teletype.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.490
So you're getting a message over this text
printout machine like a

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.780
printer.
And he was talking about scanning a line of

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.880
Shakespearian verse.
And if you can explain this line of Shakespearian

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.670
verse, then you're
essentially a human, you are essentially conscious.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:29.580
You are equivalent to us as thinking beings.
And in the 70's, this became a leading school

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.580
of thought in
artificial intelligence.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.610
It was the idea of language of thought.
The idea was that when we speak, what we're

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.110
essentially doing is giving
physical manifestation to what is happening

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:48.280
inside our brains.
And that was a prominent leading view for

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.810
a long time.
The problem with this is that it fails to

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.210
answer some pretty basic
questions.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.770
And one of the problems that was pointed out
was something called the

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.950
frame problem.
Okay?

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.170
So say you're a robot and you're running this
software in your little

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:12.930
metal head and you're pushing a cart.
And on this cart is a bomb.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.721
Now you're processing where the cart is located,
where your goal is,

00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:21.370
how to get there on the corridor, and then
there's a flashing light on

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.360
the bomb that means that it's going to blowup.
So how -- amidst all the other processing

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.020
tasks that you're trying to
do, how do you deal with the fact that there's

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.160
also a flashing red
light and what that means and what you should

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.120
do in response?
And given the state of artificial intelligence

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.279
at the time it was an
unsolvable problem.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:44.330
Well, what's happened since then it is not
a serial processor kind of

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.650
situation.
That the human brain is running multiple modules

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.520
in parallel, all at
the same time.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.130
Few of these ever reach consciousness.
And so this idea that it can all be explained

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.700
by the language of
thought, that everything that essentially

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.720
is playing out in this inner
dialogue in our heads is all we really need

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.010
to know about the situation
is fundamentally flawed.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.430
And so something else that's happened recently
is this idea of

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.720
embodiment of cognition.
The idea that a brain only really makes sense

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.330
in the context of the
body that's it's in.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.750
And so our moods, our hungers, our appetites.
These aren't just phenomena that occur on

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.080
the fringes of our consciousness
and sort of muddy our Spock-like thinking

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.370
of the world.
They're actually crucial to why we have cognition

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:48.060
in the first place.
Um, so, to kind of get back to the original

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.110
point, the idea that we are
living in our heads, essentially, generating

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.980
thought, solving chess
problems, this kind of intellectual endeavor

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.490
that occupied so much of
our day-to-day lives and feels like the essence

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:07.280
of who we are is
actually a very small part of what our brain

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.550
is doing.
And it's a crucial misunderstanding that a

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.670
lot of us walk around with
and it especially becomes important when we're

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.750
trying to understand the
fear response.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.640
Well, a lot of time, we don't care about the
fear response.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.180
Most of us go through our daily lives not
being afraid of much.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.750
And we can just think our thoughts and plan
our day and go about our

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:35.630
lives without having to worry anything about
anything except for our

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:43.060
rational, Spock-like thoughts.
And so we have a hard time escaping from this

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.310
illusion that is really
ancient.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:51.700
And it was best formulated by Rene Descartes
who said, "I think,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:11:01.830
therefore I am," among other things.
And he lent his name to the Descartesian dualistic

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.570
point of view or
illusion as it's commonly referred to.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.460
So the idea that -- the Descartesian Dualism
is that there's a little

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:17.320
man in our heads with a bunch of levers.
Light comes in from the eyes, from the ears,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.550
and he -- everything
that's processed in the brain goes to this

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.110
little man and he makes
everything happen.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:31.870
And it feels like that's how it works until
you're in a situation where

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:38.250
you're, um, suddenly overwhelmed with fear
and you find yourself

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.670
running or you find yourself frozen or you
find yourself playing possum

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.690
willy-nilly and all of a sudden this Descartesian
Dualism gets thrown

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:52.970
out the window in rather stark terms.
So, um, it can be confusing if you haven't

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:58.500
encountered this before.
So in the book, I talk about a woman who was

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.620
very generous with her
time with me her name is Cindy Jacobs.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.550
She wasn't really unusual in any regard.
She was one of millions of Americans who suffer

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:11.279
from anxiety disorder.
And so she was driving down the road one day

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.730
 -- and I wouldn't be
surprised if a fair percentage of people in

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.060
this room have had a problem like
this, I have.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.920
She was driving down the road and she started
 -- she had her four

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.600
children in the back.
She'd been picking them up from daycare, she

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.570
had to deliver them home,
feed them, take them to somewhere else.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.900
She had a very busy day.
She was a normal homemaker.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.940
She started to have a heart attack as she
was driving down the road.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.290
She pulled over, she took out her cell phone,
she called the nurse of

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.710
the HMO that she belonged to and she said,
"I'm having a heart attack.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.590
Can you please arrange for medical care?"
And the nurse said, "You're not having a heart

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.870
attack.
If you were having a heart attack, you wouldn't

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.550
be on the phone to me."
So she was a bit flummoxed by this because

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.150
she was -- had this pain in
her chest and she couldn't breathe and all

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.550
the things that you feel
like when you are dying.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.720
And so ultimately she -- the nurse sort of
talked her down and she got

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.491
back on the road and drove home and didn't
really think about it.

00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.100
But then a few weeks later, she was in church
and again she felt she

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.910
was having a heart attack.
And she -- why did she think this?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.470
Her doctor told her that she was having an
anxiety attack, a panic

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.910
attack.
So she couldn't believe it.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.110
She thought I'm not the sort of person who
is nervous or has mental

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.380
problems.
I am a person who gets things done.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.170
And so this is not possible.
She didn't -- because she was so firmly in

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.260
the grips of the
Descartesian Illusion that she -- she had

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:47.089
no mental model for how it
would be possible to find yourself taken over,

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:51.750
essentially.
These, um, deep centers that lie within our

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:57.650
brain that handle the fear
response are so below our conscious level

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.380
that they feel almost
external or that they're happening within

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.060
some other part of our body
that's not connected directly to our brains.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.660
The word "panic" derives from the name of
the Greek god Pan.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.630
It was believed that when you were walking
in the forest and suddenly

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.480
became so overwhelmed with fear that you started
running pellmell, this

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.480
was a case of possession by the god Pan.
It feels like possession.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.400
It feels like an external force taking over
your brain and making you

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.270
do whatever you do.
And so why does it matter that we dispense

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.170
with the Descartesian
Illusion?

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.570
Only it matters because we have fear in our
lives.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.420
Fear can crop up unexpectedly, that's its
nature.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:51.400
So forewarned is forearmed.
This is how our brains work.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.480
They don't work the way we expect them to,
especially in dangerous

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.350
situations or in scary situations that aren't
dangerous.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.589
One of the mantras in the book is that when
we're afraid, we have two

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:10.430
problems essentially.
We have the thing that's making us afraid

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.290
and we have the fear itself.
Our own fear response is often the most dangerous

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.370
thing about the
situation.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.920
And sometimes there isn't something making
us afraid.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.130
Sometimes there are things that should be
making us afraid and they're

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.190
not.
But if we just rely on our little man in our

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.710
heads to steer our way
through danger, we'll find ourselves becoming

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:38.380
a copper because what
happens is when the fear centers are activated,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.220
the sympathetic nervous
system, fight or flight, pumps powerful brain

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.210
chemicals into your
system.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.921
And one of the first things it does is to
shut down the frontal cortex,

00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:53.260
the part of our brain that thinks complex
thoughts, that makes plans,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.980
and arranges for the future.
And so, a very simple example.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.910
If you're in a nightclub, for instance, if
you come in, and you don't

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.730
notice where the fire exits are and then a
fire happens -- and this has

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:13.430
happened several times -- your frontal cortex
is shut down.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.760
All you can essentially do is follow everyone
else out through the door

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:24.690
that you came in.
Most people avoid the fire exits.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:34.330
And that can have really tragic consequences.
So knowing how the brain works, we can, not

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.529
necessarily -- no let me
rephrase that.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.420
Knowing how fear works does nothing to help
us control our fear.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.380
Fear is a very powerful force that simply
understanding it does not

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.520
help you suppress it.
It's like being swept out to sea by a tidal

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.260
wave.
It's overwhelming.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.710
You can't fight it with sheer will power.
However, if you understand how it works, you

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.941
can, (A) go a little bit
easier on yourself, like Cindy Jacobs.

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:06.030
When she gradually, after a year, came to
understand, that okay, my problem

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:13.100
is anxiety.
I will treat it using medication, using therapy.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:21.550
And in that way, you can get a grip on it.
You can also avoid the mental unpleasantness

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.339
of beating up on yourself
for thinking, I'm a coward, I'm mentally ill,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.880
I shouldn't be doing
this.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.390
You know, we have a really erroneous idea
fed to us through the media

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:38.390
of what the proper fear response is because
in movie after movie, as

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.630
obsessed as we are with what extreme danger
is like, we see movies like

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.429
Diehard, and you know, High Noon and movies
where people are in mortal

00:17:47.429 --> 00:17:52.000
danger.
These movies are very erroneous.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.710
You know, Clint Eastwood walks down the street,
there's the bad guys

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.790
ahead of him packing heat.
Somebody's going to shoot somebody else.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:03.480
It's going to be bad.
Somebody should be afraid.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.730
But, you know, Clint Eastwood just kind of
narrows his eyelids a little

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.580
bit and that's it.
Well, he's a very brave man obviously.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.710
Well, not really.
That's not how brave people respond to danger.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.480
You know, the famous case of Captain Sullenberger,
who landed the

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.090
airplane in the river last year, was a marvelous
feat.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.030
He had practiced thousands of hours so that
when danger happened, he

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.420
could do what he needed to do without needing
to use his frontal cortex

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.480
too much.
He was very calm and collected given the situation.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.290
But he was extremely nervous.
He was terrified.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.670
And he later said it was the scariest day
of his life.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.380
I tell a story in the book about another pilot
whose wings started to

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.200
come off as he was performing aerobatics,
and he -- he performed

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.380
masterfully.
But his legs were shaking, he was trembling.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.000
He said he found it very difficult to think
straight as well.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.340
So I think if we have a more realistic idea
of what the fear response

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.309
is like, we can prepare ourselves better to
deal with it.

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:15.550
We can not beat ourselves up when we behave
differently from how Clint

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:24.620
Eastwood has led us to expect we should behave.
And we can generally lead a life that is less

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.360
fearful of fear.
If we -- if we make a habit of just getting

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.030
a little bit closer to the
edge of what's makes us comfortable, we become

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.200
habituated to the
sensation of fear a little bit.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.270
Not to be, you know, to just go out and start
jumping off of buildings

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.390
with your base jumping parachute tomorrow,
but if you just do something

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.550
a little bit different -- eat a different
food or take a different

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.360
route home from work or, you know, see a different
kind of movie, make

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.650
yourself a little bit uncomfortable.
Take a risk.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.060
Let yourself enjoy the payoff of that risk
or if the risk doesn't pay

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.900
off, you know, don't beat yourself up about
it.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:07.820
Your -- your field of possibilities becomes
gradually larger.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.620
And I think that's really the ultimate goal
of the book is, you know,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.650
not only to tell some hopefully gripping tales
and lend some insight

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:20.780
into how fear works, but also just to encourage
people to not feel

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.810
afraid of fear, to recognize it as an emotion
that's part of all of our

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.600
lives.
And to embrace it, even.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.970
To accept that it's a fine line between fear
and excitement.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:41.880
And to -- to lead a life that's more enriched
because of it.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.400
How are we doing for time?
We have lots of time?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:50.390
We have too much time?
Um, well -- is it too early to see if people

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.390
have questions?
It's okay?

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.360
Let's take a few questions.
Does anybody have any questions?

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360
Do you want to come up to the microphone,
I guess that will --

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360
[PAUSE]

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, panic attacks seem decidedly inconvenient.
Is -- are there any theories on sort of like

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:10.590
the evolutionary rationale
for such things or is it just the body breaking

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.650
down as it gets older?

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.810
JEFF WISE: Well, thank you.
That's a great question.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.179
There's a couple chapters in the book about
panic attacks.

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:26.900
And essentially, what happens is -- I haven't
really gotten into the

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.040
anatomy of the fear response too much here
today -- but the long and

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.280
short is that we have these subcortical structures
deep within our

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:47.429
brain, evolutionarily ancient structures that
become activated by

00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:51.690
stimuli that we don't necessarily become aware
of consciously.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:59.360
And these, um, stimuli can trigger the fight
or flight response.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.450
And if we've been trying like Cindy Jacobs
to not think about what's making

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:11.200
us nervous or trying to just sort of endure
whatever hardship we're in

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.890
life.
We're stressed out but we don't want to admit

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.429
that we're stressed out.
So the stimuli reach a critical threshold,

00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:19.880
subconsciously activates the
fear response so we get the racing heart,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.580
the shortness of breath, the
sweaty palms, and then we consciously notice

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.620
that.
We notice the external symptoms of the sympathetic

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.080
nervous system
activation.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.110
So we become consciously afraid.
So the conscious mind, which not only can

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:41.380
suppress fear but also
activate fear, notices these symptoms, thinks

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.740
something's happening.
What is happening?

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.200
That fear about the fear response is a feedback
loop.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.370
And so it's not that the system is breaking,
it's like a microphone

00:22:52.370 --> 00:23:00.090
that picks up its own signal and it just spirals
out of control.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:07.280
Now what you can do -- it's fairly treatable.
What you can do -- this isn't appropriate

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.260
for everyone in all
situations -- but if you take a betablocker,

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.809
what it essentially does
is suppresses the outward manifestations of

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:19.960
the fear response, the
racing heart and so forth and it just cuts

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.929
that feedback loop.
I don't know if that answers your question?

00:23:22.929 --> 00:23:25.360
&gt;&gt;Yes.
Jeff: Okay. Thank you.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:33.230
&gt;&gt; Such a interesting topic.
I'm wondering if you can comment on fear and

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.230
the ability to learn or
cognitive ability.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.240
I guess I'm thinking of maybe the example
of children or kids who are

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.720
in, you know, maybe a bad area of town and
there's violence or they're

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.679
in an abusive household, and what the impact
is on the ability to

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.679
learn.

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:57.360
JEFF WISE: Right.
That's a great question.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.780
We're really talking about two separate situations,
I would think.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.970
A lot of what I deal with in the book is acute
fear, meaning some

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.750
specific danger that is present but that will
go away.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.520
And so if you're living in a bad neighborhood
and say someone starts to

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.410
chase after you with a knife or something,
that has one effect on our

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.240
brains and bodies.
One of the things I do -- it does, as I mentioned,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.669
is it will shut down
our ability to think sophisticated, complex

00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:29.200
thoughts.
But I think what you're referring to more

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:35.820
involves not acute stress but
stress that persists for a long amount of

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.200
time.
And what happens in that situation is that

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.310
a lot of the body's
resources that are mobilized to deal with

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.390
an acute stress, like in
evolutionary times, being chased by a bear,

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.450
for instance.
They linger.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:54.000
Cortisol is one the main stress hormones and
if it's released and

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.750
reaches elevated levels for a long period
of time, it becomes

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:03.480
neurotoxic.
It essentially -- among its many negative

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.679
effects, I mean, all the
negative effects of stress can -- heart disease

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:11.049
for instance, can be
traced to cortisol as well.

00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:15.929
But it can hinder long-term learning.
And yes, to live in a consistently stressful

00:25:15.929 --> 00:25:19.549
environment, I think, can have
damaging effects on brain such as learning

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:22.760
and memory and cognition.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.690
&gt;&gt; Quick followup.
Sorry.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.510
Is there any linkage or relationship between
fear and addiction?

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:37.960
JEFF WISE: Well, that's a great question.
I've never considered it in that direct way.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:44.660
But I think it's very interesting, um, that
fear -- as I mentioned at

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.320
the very beginning of the talk, it's something
that we have a very

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.760
complex relationship with.
We avoid it and we also seek it out.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.130
And one of the reasons we seek it out is that
it has -- we were just

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:01.290
talking about negative effects that fear and
stress have in terms of

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.320
shutting down the brain, hurting memory, hurting
cognition.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:11.070
But it also has lots of positive effects.
There's actually an ideal middle ground that

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.880
we perform optimally at.
And one of the -- and so when you're very

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.740
afraid, fear focuses your
thoughts, makes you stronger, makes you faster,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.880
makes you resistant to
pain.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.559
It makes you a kind of a super human person
for a short while.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:31.880
Why that is, is in part due to endogenous
chemicals that are released

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.980
within the brain that mimic the effects of
marijuana and amphetamines,

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.740
among other things.
So around about way to say that I haven't

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.120
thought about your specific
question in that specific way but it's very

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:52.760
interesting that in essence
when we become dependent on certain drugs,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:59.690
what we're doing is
artificially elevating, or artificially recreating

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.540
elements of our fear
response.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.840
And people become addicted to fear.
I mean, is there a relation between becoming

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.429
an adrenaline junkie who
has to jump out of an airplane every Saturday

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:13.040
and somebody who has to
smoke crystal meth or something?

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.080
I mean, it's very similar brain compounds
are involved.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.049
I don't -- I'm no expert.
But -- and I don't think that anybody really

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:23.919
knows.
Frankly, addiction is an incredibly complex

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:26.559
and politically sensitive
topic.

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:32.290
But it's a really, real interesting question.
So thanks.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:41.550
&gt;&gt; So this first question about children got
me thinking, right.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:47.679
So in kids, you sometimes see this sort of
weird dichotomy, where kids

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:52.020
can be like just incredibly afraid of like
what's under the bed or in the

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.900
closet, but then they can go and they do something
sort of like ridiculously

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.520
foolish or courageous. They'll go around like
jumping over train tracks and

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520
stuff like that.
There are any good explanations for that kind

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.520
of dichotomous behavior?
Or is it --

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.090
JEFF WISE: That's a really interesting question.
I have a 15-month old at home and he's just

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.570
gotten -- he just started
walking last week.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:09.360
And so the dangers are infinite.
Although I have to say, I've been somewhat

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.470
surprised as a first-time
parent at how I sort of thought that every

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.220
potential lethal object he
could get his hands on, he would immediately

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.571
take and impale himself
on.

00:28:16.571 --> 00:28:21.570
There does seem to be a certain amount of
self-preservation even at

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.760
that age.
But, you know, I'm definitely trying to keep

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.080
the bleach out of his
grasp.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.150
Um, that's a fascinating question.
One of the things I've noticed about my young

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.530
son is that, you know,
the most highly evolved parts of our brain,

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:39.790
the planning, the thinking,
the reasoning, abstract concepts, and self-control

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.100
 -- I mean it does
not exist.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.760
He has no self-control.
He wants it, he wants it.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.770
And there's no mitigation of whatever emotion
he happens to be feeling.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:55.710
So, you know, if we look at, you know, the
issue of courage, of

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.520
self-control in the face of danger as being
a sort of tug of war

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.510
between our higher complex reasoning, the
frontal cortex, and our

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:08.940
primitive subcortical limbic system regions
like the amygdala.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.020
He's missing the whole first part.
He's got none of that.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:17.020
So if it triggers his fear, he's wildly afraid.
If doesn't trigger his fear, he's not afraid

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.190
at all.
So maybe the answer to your question has something

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.049
with the fact that
the amygdala doesn't understand trains.

00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:26.370
It understands height, you know, understands
fire.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.460
It's like Frankenstein, it's like a zombie.
It gets the really simple stuff but it gets

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.929
the simple stuff really,
really well.

00:29:33.929 --> 00:29:41.410
So a dog, a barking dog or even a cat, you
know -- who knows?

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.241
It's scary to him it's not scary to us.
But because it's triggering the amygdala -- and

00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:49.880
this also gets back to
the question of, you know, the -- I mentioned

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.850
very early on that we
have these multiple layers in the alarm system

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.820
that basically our fear
system is, and some of them act very quickly

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.561
but have a very, um, crude
handle on what's going on.

00:30:04.561 --> 00:30:08.679
So if you're walking in the woods and you
hear a stick break or there's

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:14.131
a loud noise, you get very scared.
You jump, your heart races and everything.

00:30:14.131 --> 00:30:18.460
And then a second later, it takes your, your
slower but more detailed,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.640
more nuanced parts of your brain to sort of
sift through this incoming

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.820
data, and say, okay, look it's not a -- it
was my dog that stepped on the stick.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.470
It wasn't a bear.
And so then you calm down.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:35.350
But these very quick ones are very blunt,
very crude, very effective.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.080
You know if someone shouts in your ear and
you're not expecting it, you

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.020
jump a foot up in the air.
It's neurologically impossible for you to

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.390
consciously suppress the
startle response.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:51.020
like, it's a very small number of neurons
that are involved in it but it

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:56.100
doesn't discriminate between, you know, trains
and, you know, whatever

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.840
complex fear.
But I think that might be part of the answer

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.640
that kids who are young
who haven't finished their cognitive development,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.400
they can't be afraid
of things that they don't understand.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.710
It's not that the system is broken it's just
that it hasn't finished

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:15.490
building itself yet.
Essentially parents are functioning as a remote

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:21.080
frontal cortex.
You know, where it's sort of like an accessory

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.690
that hasn't been
integrated into the frame of the computer.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:26.690
So --

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.340
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Um, I think you began to answer my question.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.340
But can you elaborate how fear relates to
stress?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:35.260
Is like one -- is the stress a low-grade version
of fear or is fear an

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.570
acute version of stress or are they related?

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:45.940
JEFF WISE: They're very closely related and
in fact, Lillian [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.230
, the scientist who I took part in her research
by jumping

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.210
out of an airplane wearing sensors and so
forth.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.289
She made the really excellent point that when
we evolved we

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:57.710
basically were faced with threats that were
acute in nature.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.710
A bear would chase after us, we'd escape.
It would be over, we'd feel good we'd go back

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.840
to base line.
Today, our threats don't go away.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.000
Your taxes never go away.
You know?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.429
Your deadline is looming.
Eventually it comes but then you get another

00:32:13.429 --> 00:32:15.730
one.
And so we tend to be in these situations where

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.940
there's no resolution.
So the cortisol levels build, but they -- we

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.789
never have that satisfying
sensation of the sympathetic nervous system

00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:27.980
turning off, the
parasympathetic nervous system which handles

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.630
relaxation, digestion and
so forth, that never comes, that never gets

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.990
kicked in.
So then, the damaging effects of this stress

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.621
response kick in and so they're
related.

00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:45.860
But, you know, in a way we -- we didn't really
evolve to live in the

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.240
modern world.
So it's not a great fit sometimes.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.150
&gt;&gt; So as a followup, your kind of conclusion
of the book is that we

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:57.920
can't control the fear as much but maybe understanding
it helps us in a

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.060
certain way?

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.060
JEFF WISE: Yes.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.429
&gt;&gt; Now with stress, is that -- also holds
true or is it a different --

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:04.919
JEFF WISE: Yes, yes.
That's an excellent point.

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:09.530
It does hold true.
And if you can, one of the most powerful things

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.080
you can do to counter
stress, for instance, is to exercise.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.370
Now, say you go for a run.
I'm a jogger myself.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.570
Jogging is something that a lot of psychologists
would consider what they

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:26.450
call EU-stress.
E-U stress, meaning stress that is positive

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:31.809
in its benefits.
So your body it reacts to this load that's

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:35.090
put on it by becoming
stronger.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.409
When you put weight on your bones, they'll
grow thicker.

00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:42.110
If you lift weights, they'll become -- your
muscles will become bigger.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.659
Similarly, your stress response will become
more robust if you put

00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:49.990
EU-stress on it.
So, you know, and this also helps us deal

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:54.309
with acute fear.
I should -- you know, it's really an important

00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:58.299
point about the science
of fear is that -- the military is putting

00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:01.679
a lot of money into
researching this phenomenon.

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:05.190
And one of the main conclusions they've reached
is that what's

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:09.010
important when you're handling, say, what
they're interested in is

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.669
something like a fire fight.
You're going into a situation where for a

00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:15.089
short period of time someone
is going to be trying to kill you with all

00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:20.349
their might.
And it really matters how cleverly you can

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:23.559
think, how quickly you can
react.

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:28.919
And so, they -- what they have found is what
is crucial is not how

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:32.609
elevated your fear response is, how strongly
the sympathetic nervous

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:36.270
system kicks in, but rather how quickly do
you return to baseline

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.200
afterwords.
People who are physically fit tend to return

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.879
to baseline quickly.
So the cortisol dissipates.

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:49.569
If you don't exercise, if you aren't naturally
someone who handles

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:54.079
stress well, what tends to happen is that
 -- that as I've said several

00:34:54.079 --> 00:35:01.559
times before -- that bad stuff accumulates.
But it is -- I would say that as with fear,

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:05.989
the more you understand how
your stress response works, the more effectively

00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:07.450
you can take steps to
deal with it.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:12.809
Because you can't just will yourself to be
in control of your mind.

00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:16.040
Your mind is a tricky, tricky thing to get
a grip on.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.599
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:22.440
JEFF WISE: Sure.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.180
&gt;&gt; Can you tell me about situations in which
we should be scared

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.769
spitless but we aren't?
I got hit by a car turning into me.

00:35:30.769 --> 00:35:35.410
I consciously remember time slowing down and
thinking, oh, I'm going to

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:40.519
have a hood ornament on my hip.
And I was never afraid and I don't understand

00:35:40.519 --> 00:35:43.219
why I shouldn't have been
scared.

00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:51.329
JEFF WISE: That's a really interesting point.
Now, what's very common, very, very common

00:35:51.329 --> 00:35:58.440
in situations like yours
where someone is in a car accident or, you

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.039
know, there's a story in my
book of a guy who was driving on the road

00:36:01.039 --> 00:36:04.890
in Colorado, an avalanche
came and swept him and his wife and their

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.920
car off the cliff -- boom,
boom, boom.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.589
Down they go, it was turning head over heels.
And he didn't feel afraid, he didn't feel

00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:17.039
any pain even though a tree
trunk went through the windshield -- and he

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:20.799
had a severe bruise.
In fact, he had a dislocated rib.

00:36:20.799 --> 00:36:22.700
He was in bad shape but he didn't feel any
pain.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.890
And this gets back to what I was talking about
earlier, the beneficial

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.190
effects of fear.
It helps us, when it's working correctly,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:36.319
it's an incredibly robust,
well-designed system for putting us where

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.579
we need to be mentally in
that acute danger.

00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:44.009
And oftentimes I've heard people say, I didn't
feel any fear, I did

00:36:44.009 --> 00:36:48.450
what I needed to do.
And only afterwards -- now this fellow said,

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.069
it wasn't until the next
day, he went to the lot where the wrecker

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:56.480
had put his car and he
saw how crushed it was that his knees went

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.960
weak and he felt fear for
the first time only the day after.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:09.630
And it sounds you never felt fear at all.
But, um, it may be that, you know, you were

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.809
consciously thinking, oh
this is a bad situation, but your amygdala,

00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:19.589
the part of your brain that
subconsciously processes fear, just didn't

00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:24.859
register it as a threat.
And so when, you know, there's lots of examples

00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:28.140
we can think of of
behavior that's dangerous but that doesn't

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:35.710
register to our subcortical
minds as dangerous because it's too abstract,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.039
it's too complex, you
know.

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:42.510
Smoking a cigarette.
We don't have an innate fear of cigarettes

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.529
like we have an innate fear
of spiders.

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:50.109
Which is more dangerous a cigarette or a spider?
You know, your amygdala has a different answer

00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:53.569
to that than your
frontal cortex does.

00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:58.759
And, you know, you and -- you can never -- your
cortex can never

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:03.099
convince your amygdala that it's the other
way around.

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:08.630
You just have to rationally take those steps
and try to keep

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.299
the amygdala out of it.

00:38:12.299 --> 00:38:17.400
&gt;&gt; You said a difference between one moment
of intense stress versus

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.269
sustained low amounts of stress over time?

00:38:20.269 --> 00:38:25.670
JEFF WISE: Yeah, that's something we were
touching on earlier.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:31.420
Intense fear is -- is related, but it plays
 -- the dynamic is very

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.170
different.
One of the things I should point out is there's

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.040
different kinds of fear and
just because you handle yourself well in one

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.130
situation doesn't
necessarily mean you'll handle yourself well

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:47.440
in another situation.
I tell the story in the book about Audie Murphy,

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.040
who was very famous
after World War II.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.210
He was the most decorated U.S. solider and
he had this incredible

00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:01.019
situation where he fought off an entire oncoming
armored German

00:39:01.019 --> 00:39:08.760
battalion and he became famous for that.
And he was in movies and Life magazine and

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.569
everything.
So he didn't -- he was afraid -- it's not

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:15.989
correct to say he wasn't
afraid of German tanks, but he was able to

00:39:15.989 --> 00:39:18.920
keep himself possessed and
to do what needed to be done.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.719
Now when it came to girls, he was terrified
of girls.

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:25.650
And he didn't -- he hated standing in front
of a crowd.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.630
He once said he was in front of a group like
this and he said I'd

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:37.729
rather be facing German tanks.
So, you know, we all have our quirks and oddities

00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:40.839
of our personality.
We all are more afraid of some things than

00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:46.469
of others.
But it's important to remember that the fear

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:53.329
is in here.
A tank is not scary, a crowd of people isn't

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:57.450
scary, a girl is not
scary, a tiger is not scary.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.819
They're just what they are but we generate
the fear response

00:39:59.819 --> 00:40:01.950
internally.
We generate it so automatically that we feel

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.829
like it's inherit in the
world around us.

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:11.131
And you know if we just take the step to recognize
okay, the spider

00:40:11.131 --> 00:40:17.009
isn't scary, what I'm experiencing is my own
internal mechanism that

00:40:17.009 --> 00:40:22.400
while it's very difficult to control, it is
a finite physical process

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.609
that I can have some effect on.
I love the story of a woman -- I heard this

00:40:27.609 --> 00:40:29.869
story a long time ago, I
don't know if it's true or who it happened

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:34.890
to -- but she was terrified
of bugs.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:40.190
And so she decided that she was going to handle
this head on and so she

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.160
started looking at pictures of bugs in books
until it no longer

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.151
bothered her to look at pictures of bugs in
books.

00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:51.000
And then she started looking at bugs in real
life, like, far away but

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.670
-- and then she would get closer and closer
and closer eventually she

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.660
got to point where she could pick them up
with her bare hands.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.709
And as this process happened, it turned out
that of course, the flip

00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:09.910
side of fear is excitement.
And so this rush of adrenaline she would get

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:13.630
when she would first, look
at the book and later when she would look

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.160
at -- she became addicted to
that excitement.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.769
And she became fascinated by the object of
that anxiety and she winded

00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:23.170
up becoming an entomologist.
Like I said, I don't know if that story is

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:28.130
true but it kind of sounds
true and it sounds plausible to me.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:33.150
So you know, here is this situation where
a woman was in -- you know,

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:37.239
you're talking about protracted fear, and
she was in control of that

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:41.130
fear.
One of the most stressful things in human

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:45.589
life is to be out of control.
It's something we instinctively seek.

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:51.859
Fear is less horrible when we have some modicum
of control or even if

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:55.329
we believe we have a modicum of control.
I think one of the reasons people pray when

00:41:55.329 --> 00:42:00.200
a situation get really
bad -- look, if fear was really effective,

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.589
it would be the first thing that
you would do not the last thing that you would

00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:06.020
do.
So I think that maybe prayer in itself is

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.029
not that effective but what
it does is when all else fails, you take a

00:42:10.029 --> 00:42:13.849
course of action that is
available to you.

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:18.109
And that in itself can help you keep it together
when things are scary.

00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:19.279
&gt;&gt; Hello.
Do you talk at all about shock?

00:42:19.279 --> 00:42:20.890
And I ask that because the accident in question
triggered it.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:24.089
I had read somewhere that you can experience
pain up to a certain point

00:42:24.089 --> 00:42:30.510
and then your body just sort of shuts down.
It can't bear that much pain.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.680
And I wondered when you're in shock if that
overrides sort of fear, and

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.779
I'm not even sure if pain comes from the amygdala,
but you talk about

00:42:39.779 --> 00:42:42.190
that at all?

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:47.339
JEFF WISE: I don't deal with shock per se.
I'm not very well versed in that topic.

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:54.849
But it's -- you know, it's very plausible
when the brain finds itself

00:42:54.849 --> 00:43:01.009
in a situation where it can't effectively
cope with a situation, it

00:43:01.009 --> 00:43:04.890
tends to shut down that option.
There's -- one of the chapters in my book

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:05.990
is about the different kinds
of panic.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.970
There's actually four different kinds of panic
and which one becomes

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.660
implemented depends on the situation.
So, you know, I've sort of slandered the amygdala

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:21.140
for being crude and
blunt in its decision making, but there's

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.930
actually a surprising amount
of subtlety.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:28.400
I tell the story in the book of a woman named
Sue Yellowtail, who was a

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.579
hydrologist studying a river in a remote canyon
in southwestern

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:36.010
Colorado and she noticed that a mountain lion
was looking at her from

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:42.509
the bank.
And her fear system kicked in, not surprisingly,

00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:46.599
and she, first thing
she did was she froze.

00:43:46.599 --> 00:43:51.959
And we're all familiar with the fight or flight
idea of fear, but

00:43:51.959 --> 00:43:58.319
there's actually four Fs.
And I usually can't get them all in one go.

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:07.239
Fight, flight, freezing, and fainting.
And which one swings into action depends on

00:44:07.239 --> 00:44:09.190
this context in which it
occurs.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.720
So here she was on the riverbank, the mountain
lion was kind of far

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.119
away.
So she froze and when you freeze in response

00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:20.440
to danger, your attention
turns to the threat, you become focused, very

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.299
still, it's an attitude of
waiting to see what happens next.

00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:28.690
The mountain lion started to move towards
her and then that triggered

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:33.339
the next F which is fleeing.
She started to move away.

00:44:33.339 --> 00:44:38.489
Now she had studied biology in school.
She knew about predator behavior and that

00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:42.479
if you run, that can trigger
its own instinctual response, it will chase

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:45.410
after you and try to eat
you, in which it may have been on it's mind

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.369
already.
She wasn't sure.

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:51.450
So she used her frontal cortex, her complicated
knowledge of

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:56.140
theoretical matters to suppress this fear
response.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:01.049
So she just moved fairly slowly away.
But the closer this thing got, the more quickly

00:45:01.049 --> 00:45:04.150
she walked, the less
effective her attempts to suppress her flight

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.859
response became.
Ultimately, it was within leaping distance

00:45:07.859 --> 00:45:10.759
of her and she completely
give into panic and started to run.

00:45:10.759 --> 00:45:18.619
She ran into the river, she slipped, she fell.
The lion jumped on her and at that moment,

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:20.840
running was no longer an
effective option because the mountain lion

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.089
was now on her head with its
teeth on her scalp.

00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:29.880
And she remembers having a kind of a dreamlike
sense of looking up at

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.579
the water shimmering above her, she could
feel this thing's mouth on

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:38.609
her head.
And she thought well, you know, we all have

00:45:38.609 --> 00:45:44.469
our day when we have to go.
And it's fascinating because she went from

00:45:44.469 --> 00:45:48.309
being very, you know, in
gear thinking very clearly about what she

00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:51.020
needed to do and then doing
it, to being in a state where she essentially,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:55.589
had dissociated and dissociation is
when you essentially remove yourself from

00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:59.369
your mental environment.
And it, you know, people often report that

00:45:59.369 --> 00:46:00.460
it was like they were watching a
movie.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:07.180
But fortunately, that didn't last very long.
Next thing she knew she had sort of -- wait,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.599
let me before I move on to
next phase --

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:16.000
So when you faint with the -- so she had moved
to this situation called

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.670
tonic immobility, immobility.
She was playing possum.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:29.349
She had gone limp.
And it's a very reasonable thing to do when

00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:31.269
you're trapped, you're
helpless.

00:46:31.269 --> 00:46:34.019
There's nothing you can do and a lot of predators
won't eat dead prey.

00:46:34.019 --> 00:46:38.450
So that's all you've got going for you, a
statistical predilection of

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:43.019
certain predators to not eat dead prey.
That's all you've got.

00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:45.950
And so you know, it's very interesting.
You hear cases like when the Virginia Tech

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:50.900
shooting happened, some of
the students said, "Well, he came in and I

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.029
decided to play dead."
It's very interesting because I'm sure in

00:46:54.029 --> 00:46:58.089
their minds they were -- it
felt like they were deciding to play dead.

00:46:58.089 --> 00:47:00.880
But what I would argue that what was happening
was that a region of

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:06.739
their midbrain was triggering this very stereotype
behavioral suite and

00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:08.460
that they didn't really have a choice in the
matter.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.619
You know it's -- when we do -- when we behave
rationally --

00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:15.089
Let me put it this way: When we behave in
a way that seems reasonable

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:19.950
to us, we have a tendency to ascribe to ourselves
agency.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.819
To say, I chose to do this.
Our brains are very good.

00:47:23.819 --> 00:47:27.709
It's called confabulation.
We paint a picture for ourselves that's pleasing

00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:31.949
to us.
That's why introspection is a very poor tool

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.579
for understanding how the
human brain works.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:37.219
And it's why psychology really didn't make
very much progress until

00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:40.619
quite recently because we're constantly deceiving
ourselves.

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:45.849
So anyway, she played possum, against her
will I would argue, and then

00:47:45.849 --> 00:47:49.279
she, for whatever reason, that strategy wasn't
really working.

00:47:49.279 --> 00:47:56.209
And so her brain went to option number four
which was to fight.

00:47:56.209 --> 00:48:02.690
So she jumped up, she started to run.
And here's the interesting parenthetical observation,

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.809
for 15 seconds,
she had no recollection of what happened.

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:10.130
She doesn't know what happened between getting
up off the riverbed and

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:14.969
winding up on the bank of the river with her
arm down the lion's mouth.

00:48:14.969 --> 00:48:18.069
So she came to, next thing she knows, she's
lying on the riverbank, her

00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:22.079
arm is in the lion's mouth, she's leaning
on it with all her weight to

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:25.440
try to keep to down.
And she's trying to figure out what do to.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.610
So now she's fighting.
This is the fourth of the four Fs, in this

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:35.160
telling anyway.
And so, this is -- this is where the strength

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.119
comes into it.
She -- when your sympathetic nervous system

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:43.839
is activated, you're in the
grips of full-on fight response, you're a

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:48.799
very formidable opponent.
And we all know about mother bears.

00:48:48.799 --> 00:48:52.510
You don't want to get between a mother bear
and her cub because her

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:59.549
fight instinct is very strong and bears are
bad enough.

00:48:59.549 --> 00:49:02.119
But when they've got this other thing happening,
now they're super

00:49:02.119 --> 00:49:05.739
bears and they're pissed and they're mad at
you specifically.

00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:09.440
So here she was wrestling with this predator
but she -- it was

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.490
interesting that while all this was going
on, and this gets, I think,

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:17.299
back to your idea of clear thinking in the
midst of a crisis, she was

00:49:17.299 --> 00:49:20.390
able to reason through what she should do
next.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:26.059
She thought she had a kind of a string that
was holding a set of pliers

00:49:26.059 --> 00:49:29.479
essentially on her vest.
And she thought, well, if I can wrap it round

00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:33.160
the neck and then I'll
strangle it, but she tried to do that and

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.099
it's teeth kind of got too
close and she thought that's not going to

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:39.690
work.
So wound up taking the pliers and the stabbing

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:45.789
the thing in its eye
until it just was done.

00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:49.180
And it let go and she stood up and she managed
to back away.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:57.699
And eventually, you know, she got to civilization,
she got treatment.

00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:00.110
And again, as with the avalanche guy, it wasn't
until she was in the

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.519
ambulance that she started to feel pain.
You know, she had gotten some pretty serious

00:50:04.519 --> 00:50:07.410
injuries scraps and so
forth in fighting this mountain lion, as one

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:13.499
does.
But only when she as coming down from that

00:50:13.499 --> 00:50:18.309
plateau after all those
chemicals that we can become addicted to were

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:23.670
starting to leech out of
her system did she feel the pain.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:27.769
So then some trackers went back and found
the mountain lion and shot it

00:50:27.769 --> 00:50:31.440
as a threat to public health.
And it turned out that it was a female mountain

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.530
lion, it was quite old
in mountain lion terms.

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.910
It was emaciated.
Its teeth had started to fall out so it wasn't

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.140
able to catch prey, so
it only in desperation that it had seen this

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.920
human being and thought,
well, I've got nothing to lose.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:50.039
And so if it had been a full grown male in
its prime, she probably

00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:55.900
wouldn't have had a chance.
But you know we are -- we like to think of

00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:01.579
ourselves as individuals but
we are actually creatures of statistical outcome

00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:08.400
of genes, you know.
And so everything that we -- all of the useful

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.440
things that our bodies
can do for us are there not because they're

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.079
going to guarantee our
survival but all they need to kind of increase

00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:18.509
our probability of
passing the relevant genes along.

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:22.960
And she was lucky.
I mean, somebody accused me of succumbing

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.739
to survivor bias in this
book.

00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:29.420
Namely, you know, I only tell the stories
of people who survived and

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.980
she might have -- all these wonderful systems
that I describe, happened

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:40.240
to work in all these cases.
And not in a few, a few cases.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.519
But it's -- oh, we're out of time.
Sorry.

00:51:44.519 --> 00:51:46.219
Anyway.
Okay, here's my book.

00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:49.829
"Extreme Fear: The Science of Your Mind in
Danger," available at fine

00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:52.079
bookstores near you.
Thanks very much.

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:53.079
Appreciate it.

00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:53.080
