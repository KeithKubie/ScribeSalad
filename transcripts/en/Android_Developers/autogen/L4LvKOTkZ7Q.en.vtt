the day which can send notifications to
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.670
the day which can send notifications to
you on the phone the notifications are

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
you on the phone the notifications are
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.410
you on the phone the notifications are
shown together with a total number shown

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
shown together with a total number shown
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810
shown together with a total number shown
in the phone's notification area when

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
in the phone's notification area when
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490
in the phone's notification area when
you click on the notification this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
you click on the notification this
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530
you click on the notification this
brings up the application to show all

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
brings up the application to show all
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320
brings up the application to show all
the details on a wearable it would be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
the details on a wearable it would be
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.789
the details on a wearable it would be
really cool if we could look at each one

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
really cool if we could look at each one
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560
really cool if we could look at each one
separately and perhaps take some

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
separately and perhaps take some
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630
separately and perhaps take some
specific action or ignore until later

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
specific action or ignore until later
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.249
specific action or ignore until later
then there's no need to pull the phone

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
then there's no need to pull the phone
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.609
then there's no need to pull the phone
out of our pocket so in this demo you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
out of our pocket so in this demo you
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530
out of our pocket so in this demo you
can see both the phone and a wearable

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
can see both the phone and a wearable
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050
can see both the phone and a wearable
emulator running together on the phone a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
emulator running together on the phone a
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149
emulator running together on the phone a
notification is shown and on the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
notification is shown and on the
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920
notification is shown and on the
wearable you can see there's a stack

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
wearable you can see there's a stack
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140
wearable you can see there's a stack
notification made up from multiple

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
notification made up from multiple
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230
notification made up from multiple
events you can touch the notification

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
events you can touch the notification
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.789
events you can touch the notification
and it will expand into separate

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
and it will expand into separate
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010
and it will expand into separate
messages you can touch the specific

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
messages you can touch the specific
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990
messages you can touch the specific
notification and then swipe it to the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
notification and then swipe it to the
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.330
notification and then swipe it to the
side to see possible actions and when

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
side to see possible actions and when
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490
side to see possible actions and when
you use an action that notification will

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
you use an action that notification will
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560
you use an action that notification will
be dismissed if it's been specified to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
be dismissed if it's been specified to
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899
be dismissed if it's been specified to
do that in your code you can then take a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
do that in your code you can then take a
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.460
do that in your code you can then take a
similar action on any remaining

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
similar action on any remaining
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190
similar action on any remaining
notifications and remember this can all

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
notifications and remember this can all
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.300
notifications and remember this can all
be done while your phone remains in your

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
be done while your phone remains in your
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160
be done while your phone remains in your
pocket by interacting with your wearable

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
pocket by interacting with your wearable
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.429
pocket by interacting with your wearable
device so let's work through the code

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
device so let's work through the code
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.100
device so let's work through the code
that was used to create this example

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110
that was used to create this example
 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.180
that was used to create this example
firstly this is the code that you would

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
firstly this is the code that you would
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.290
firstly this is the code that you would
already be using to create a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
already be using to create a
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780
already be using to create a
notification appearing on your phone one

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
notification appearing on your phone one
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.160
notification appearing on your phone one
of the nice things about the Android

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
of the nice things about the Android
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.670
of the nice things about the Android
wear eye

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
wear eye
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.709
wear eye
guys is that it leverage as much of your

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719
guys is that it leverage as much of your
 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.649
guys is that it leverage as much of your
existing code now we create a

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
existing code now we create a
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.360
existing code now we create a
notification that uses a group key

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
notification that uses a group key
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.580
notification that uses a group key
string this is a global identifier that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
string this is a global identifier that
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740
string this is a global identifier that
Android uses to know which notifications

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
Android uses to know which notifications
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.179
Android uses to know which notifications
should be grouped together on the

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189
should be grouped together on the
 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.709
should be grouped together on the
wearable it can be any string that you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719
wearable it can be any string that you
 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.920
wearable it can be any string that you
want this is the first notification that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
want this is the first notification that
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.869
want this is the first notification that
will appear on the wearable you start

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
will appear on the wearable you start
 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.580
will appear on the wearable you start
off by creating the intent and the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
off by creating the intent and the
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440
off by creating the intent and the
pending intent with whatever result you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
pending intent with whatever result you
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.569
pending intent with whatever result you
want this is exactly the same as you

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579
want this is exactly the same as you
 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.110
want this is exactly the same as you
would do for your existing notifications

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
would do for your existing notifications
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.610
would do for your existing notifications
you then create the notification with

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
you then create the notification with
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.500
you then create the notification with
the specific details of the message in

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
the specific details of the message in
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.909
the specific details of the message in
exactly the same way that you would have

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919
exactly the same way that you would have
 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.069
exactly the same way that you would have
done it with your existing code note

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
done it with your existing code note
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.780
done it with your existing code note
that this notification is never meant to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
that this notification is never meant to
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.759
that this notification is never meant to
appear on the phone only on the wearable

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
appear on the phone only on the wearable
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.369
appear on the phone only on the wearable
and we use the call to set action to

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379
and we use the call to set action to
 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.349
and we use the call to set action to
indicate an intent for when an action

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359
indicate an intent for when an action
 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.890
indicate an intent for when an action
icon is touched on the wearable display

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900
icon is touched on the wearable display
 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.970
icon is touched on the wearable display
you then need to build a notification

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
you then need to build a notification
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.009
you then need to build a notification
for the wearable with a call to set

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019
for the wearable with a call to set
 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.869
for the wearable with a call to set
group which puts it in the group

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
group which puts it in the group
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.089
group which puts it in the group
specified previously with the string

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099
specified previously with the string
 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.059
specified previously with the string
constant this is the second notification

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069
constant this is the second notification
 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.740
constant this is the second notification
that appears on the wearable the codes

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
that appears on the wearable the codes
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.270
that appears on the wearable the codes
basically the same except the message

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
basically the same except the message
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.360
basically the same except the message
text and the action are different and

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370
text and the action are different and
 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.280
text and the action are different and
finally we issue the notifications to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
finally we issue the notifications to
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.110
finally we issue the notifications to
Android so they appear on the phone and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
Android so they appear on the phone and
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.449
Android so they appear on the phone and
the wearable we issue all three of them

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
the wearable we issue all three of them
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.349
the wearable we issue all three of them
separately with unique ID numbers this

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359
separately with unique ID numbers this
 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.909
separately with unique ID numbers this
part of the code issues the group

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919
part of the code issues the group
 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.649
part of the code issues the group
notification appearing on the phone and

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659
notification appearing on the phone and
 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.360
notification appearing on the phone and
would probably already be in your

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
would probably already be in your
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.939
would probably already be in your
existing code make sure you use a

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949
existing code make sure you use a
 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.460
existing code make sure you use a
notification manager compat instead of

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
notification manager compat instead of
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.780
notification manager compat instead of
the notification manager from the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
the notification manager from the
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.550
the notification manager from the
framework when you're dealing with

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
framework when you're dealing with
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.039
framework when you're dealing with
wearable devices and now we can issue

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049
wearable devices and now we can issue
 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.569
wearable devices and now we can issue
the notifications for the wearable

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
the notifications for the wearable
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.640
the notifications for the wearable
device and that's it we're done with

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650
device and that's it we're done with
 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.610
device and that's it we're done with
this example so you can see how easy it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
this example so you can see how easy it
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.349
this example so you can see how easy it
is to add stack notifications to your

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359
is to add stack notifications to your
 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.719
is to add stack notifications to your
applications most of your code and api

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729
applications most of your code and api
 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.119
applications most of your code and api
is used remains the same and you can

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129
is used remains the same and you can
 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.559
is used remains the same and you can
just add a little bit more to specify

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569
just add a little bit more to specify
 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.809
just add a little bit more to specify
the grouping you can use stacks in any

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819
the grouping you can use stacks in any
 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.849
the grouping you can use stacks in any
application that might generate many

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859
application that might generate many
 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.770
application that might generate many
notifications that you'd want to group

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
notifications that you'd want to group
 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.749
notifications that you'd want to group
together so some examples could be an

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:05.759
together so some examples could be an
 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.610
together so some examples could be an
email client and instant messaging

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
email client and instant messaging
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.030
email client and instant messaging
application and so forth there are so

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
application and so forth there are so
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.559
application and so forth there are so
many other cool possibilities of what

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569
many other cool possibilities of what
 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.089
many other cool possibilities of what
you can do here this is really just the

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099
you can do here this is really just the
 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.979
you can do here this is really just the
start of what I've shown you Android

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
start of what I've shown you Android
 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.629
start of what I've shown you Android
wear is really exciting new technology

that's going to allow all kinds of
 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.960
that's going to allow all kinds of
really neat applications from developers
