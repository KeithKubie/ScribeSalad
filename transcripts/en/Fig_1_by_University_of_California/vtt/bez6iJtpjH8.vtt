00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.800
it definitely easy not to be aware how
much

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.130
sugar you're consuming. The American Heart Association

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.690
recommends that women consume twenty-five grams

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.830
of added sugar a day.  Its enlightening
picking up the large

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.980
candy bars or those single package
cookies

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.190
and see how many have them you cannot
eat

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.369
without going over that recommendation.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.880
I'm excited for the new nutrition labels

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.719
which differentiates between the sugars
that are naturally occurring in the food

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.800
verses sugars that are added

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.440
by the food processor.  Yogurt â€“ expecially
like a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.499
a fruit yogurt, when I look at the amount

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.699
of sugar it's a very high number

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.199
but how much that sugar comes from milk

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.949
Milk has milk sugar it's not a sugar

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.389
that cause the same problems we see with
fructose sweetened beverages

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.590
fruit has sugar and they clearly put
some fruit in there

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.030
and then they've added sugar. I wanna know how much

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.120
is added sugar and I can't even tell and
I'm a registered dietitian who is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.200
taken a lot of nutrition courses. So
the general public doesn't know either.
