1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.930
The Joe Rogan experience.
Um,
yeah.

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.610
I don't know of capitalism is the problems or maybe it's how people engage with

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.490
capitalism.
Maybe it's what people choose to focus on.

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:15.690
If you're just about acquiring wealth and money,
some people are,
yeah,

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:19.140
they're going to be very deeply unhappy and it's going to be this weird game of

6
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.540
acquiring influence and power to,

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.710
you just have this insurmountable mountain of money that you live on top of.

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.280
Right?
I don't think that's a a good way for them either.

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.140
I think if we're gonna really,

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.460
we're going to look at this country fairly.
We have to look at,

11
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.030
think of all the poor neighborhoods and imagine being born in those poor

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.200
neighborhoods and imagine being born in a place where there's no resources.

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.220
There's no how you live in the fucking mountains of West Virginia and was coal

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:49.370
mining communities or people.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
It's all just mobile homes and pills and it's chaos,

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
but it just extreme poverty.
What do you do if you're stuck in that?

17
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.880
What have you,
if you're born to that clan,
that's the group you're born into,

18
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.650
you're,
fuck man,
you're fucked.

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.860
We have to take our resources and concentrate on parts of America the same way

20
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:12.060
we concentrate on many other problem spots in the world and look at them as
like,

21
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:16.290
hey man,
there's a spot where people are fucked.
We should unfucked them.

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
We should figure out a way to go into every single horrible community in this

23
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.160
country on this plan.

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.490
Ones that are just as bad as some of that you see in third world countries.

25
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:30.390
They exist right here in America.
Fix that.
Don't to ignore that.

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.760
That's crazy though.
If they're in Detroit,

27
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.980
if they're in wherever the fuck they are,
whatever,

28
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:36.390
whatever the horrible community is.

29
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.890
Why isn't there a concerted national effort to eliminate that?

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
That's a major source of crime.
It's a major source of pride.

31
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:48.750
People feel like they got fucked over in life so they want to get at you and

32
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.270
take from you because you've got that easy road.
Hey man,

33
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.600
you're born in the fucking suburbs.
Hey Man,
your mom and dad are still together.

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.481
You know?
Hey Man,
your,

35
00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.500
your dad has a job and your mom's at home baking and show you live like a

36
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.040
motherfucking Norman Rockwell movie.
Fuck you man.
My Mom's on crack.

37
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.400
My mom's a prostitute.
My life is hell.
My Dad beats me.

38
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.470
I've been sexually molested since I was a little kid.

39
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.500
This is the reality that people exist and they don't feel like anybody's coming

40
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.250
to help them.
We,
we need to concentrate on that.
The government,

41
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.140
if the government really cares about us,

42
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:19.740
if they're really involved in social engineering and making America better
again,

43
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.150
make those places better.
Those are the places you need to concentrate on.

44
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.480
Not Tax breaks for fucking super rich corporations that get you in place.

45
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.370
They make enough money,
man,
that's not the problem.
The money where,

46
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.140
where the money goes,
what's it being allocated towards?

47
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.940
The biggest problem in our country is he's in impossible to escape communities.

48
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes.
That's so many people just get sucked into this trap.

49
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.510
And for every person that gets out and becomes a basketball player or a

50
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:47.130
successful business person,

51
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.670
and they have this story about the poverty that they grew up and they,

52
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580
they are so rare.
Yes.

53
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.340
And then it's not to be applauded that they got through that.
It is,

54
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.620
but it's more to be,
we should understand like,
hey,

55
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:03.130
we've got a real problem that we're churning out all these people that live w w

56
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.610
they start out in life with a massive deficit,
start out in life,

57
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.590
emotionally fucked,
physically abused.

58
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.760
They start out with everybody around them a loser.
Everybody's going to jail.

59
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.360
Everybody is constantly doing pills or this or that.
They're the,

60
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.380
it's all negative.

61
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.470
And to to to ask them to develop their own positive mindset uniquely in a

62
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.200
vacuum,
it's preposterous.
So all these pull them up by your bootstraps,

63
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.680
all those assholes,
hey,
you gotta pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

64
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:32.170
Like they don't even have boots,
man.
You don't understand.

65
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.360
Like you don't know what you're talking about.
You,
you've never seen it,

66
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.270
you've never been involved in that kind of poverty.
It's not fair.

67
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.400
It's not fair at all.
If we care about people,

68
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.250
that's what we should fucking care about.
Yes,
I couldn't agree more.

69
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.550
The number one problem,
and it's everywhere in the world,
all the,

70
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.640
all the crime and poverty will imagine if everyone the lowest you could live.

71
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.010
It's like a middle class existence.
Yes.
Boy,

72
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.370
everybody would all be a lot more fucking relaxed if you always had meals,

73
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.990
you always had food,
you always had a roof over your head.

74
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.790
Everyone lives Middleclass Holy Shit.

75
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.750
I mean obviously that's way past the expectations that we have right now for the

76
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:12.751
world because like $34,000 a year globally puts you in the world 1%.

77
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.780
You know what I mean?
That's the w.
If you make $34,000 a year,

78
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.080
which is hard to live on,
man,
you,
you're in the 1% of the world.

79
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.790
<v 1>But that standard that you've say very eloquently described is I think</v>

80
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.910
achievable and that ought be the aim.

81
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.920
And when you give just one example of how legislate the bias of legislation is

82
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.870
continually to support the powerful while making the just making nominal

83
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.320
gestures to poverty.
Good women.
Yeah,

84
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:48.270
middle gestures like where you put the yeah and that say that if there is a

85
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:49.290
point to nation,

86
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.280
if there is a point to a flag and our belief in this idea that there is in

87
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.250
America and there is a Britain and we're all together and we're all one and

88
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:59.520
we've got a common destiny in a common past,
then if we're not,

89
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.970
if we're ignoring and neglecting those communities then I say that is what

90
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.100
defines us.
You know,
and until there are systems codes,

91
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
regulations that prioritize that we will continue to live in something heading

92
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.520
to if not a dystopia.

93
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.521
I think moving in the direction of dystopia where the priorities and dreams are

94
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:24.801
sort of owned really by the kind of mad evil insect robot images that we've seen

95
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:26.581
discussed.

96
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:30.600
Then people do get very concerned when someone reaches a point of excessive

97
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.510
power and influence like a Jeff Bezos type character.

98
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.370
When you see some guy who's not,
he doesn't have $1 million.
Like Yo,
wow,

99
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.010
guys got $1 million.
Like you must be so relaxed.

100
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.000
It's got so much money now he's got 150 billion

101
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.780
<v 0>and he works every day maniacally.</v>

102
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.130
And he's constantly doing new projects and new things and buying out whole
foods.

103
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:56.300
And that's like pinnacle capitalism is one of the things that scares people the

104
00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:58.130
most when someone just acquires

105
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.960
<v 1>is insane position of power and wealth.
Like,</v>

106
00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:06.530
like a Bill Gates type character who is very altruistic,
very,

107
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.341
very generous.

108
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.570
Bill Gates is accused of one of the better examples of someone who gains a lot

109
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.710
of money and then does a lot to help people,
especially in his retirement.
All,

110
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.280
all they do is focus on charitable organizations and yeah,
which is brilliant.

111
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.640
But yeah,
and in a marvelous,
and you know,

112
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.410
I'm not criticizing the great achievement of brilliant people,

113
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.160
but like if really for me that demonstrates their limit,

114
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:30.230
that the limitations come from the type of systems we live in,

115
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.360
that you can't fruit charity effect every impoverished community in America.

116
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.350
You know,
like we,
the systems that we have are,
are,
well,
if you're poor like that,

117
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.720
you know,
the boot strap model,
well this guy did it.

118
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.990
Look at this great guy who overcame the odds,
you know,
until like,

119
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.400
I feel like in a sense charity has become a kind of valve that allows that,

120
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:54.110
you know,
people like you and I who aren't poor to feel like,
well I do a bit,

121
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.980
you know,
I'm sort of involved.
I can wash my hands with it when,
you know,

122
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.960
like what these,
unless we,
the reason no America,

123
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.350
there is no England.
Unless we have integral relationships with one another,

124
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.710
we support one another.
If we really are on a team,

125
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:11.750
when we see someone who's completely downtrodden,

126
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:13.580
who's on our team and we ignore them,

127
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.130
well that's not much of a fucking team is it?
No,

128
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.590
I mean that's what I feel like when it come to red lights and I see homeless

129
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:23.480
people.
I,
I feel terrible.
I'm like,
I feel like,
you know,
I mean,
there's,

130
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:24.171
part of me is like,

131
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:26.750
don't give him any money because they know they're going to just buy drugs.

132
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.510
You know?
Let them figure it out,
but then they're not going to figure it out.

133
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.530
They have mental health issues and it's done.

134
00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:33.620
It's drier and they're supposedly on the team.

135
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.580
They probably were born in America.
They probably have national citizenship here.

136
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.940
You know,
they,
this is our team and no one gives a fuck.

137
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.200
They're camped out under the bridge.

138
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.060
It's like the diffusion of responsibility that comes with these massive numbers.

139
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.830
20 million in La,
300 and plus whatever it is now,
what?

140
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.080
It's like three 20 in America.
Yeah.
It sound believable.

141
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.700
I think there's 90,000 in the General California.
Right,

142
00:07:56.701 --> 00:07:59.780
like a city's worth of homeless people,
isn't it?

143
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:04.400
It's not difficult for me to envisage that when we talk about the transcendent

144
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.100
states that can be achieved through meditation and Psychedelics,

145
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:11.450
meaning that beings like us can access them is not difficult to envisage humor,

146
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:13.850
like a type of creature type of being.

147
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:17.120
A little more evolved than us that we'd look back and say,
oh my God,

148
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.440
they allowed homelessness.

149
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.080
They allowed those impoverished communities or why was it oxide?

150
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.340
This belief in competitive systems and survival of the fittest that we're

151
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.120
resourced from ideas that weren't really meant to be translated into that.

152
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.060
When you were talking before about like the natural world is fraught with

153
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:34.730
competition and fret.
Of course there's days animals.
So you know,

154
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.020
I'm not disputing what you're saying there,

155
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.230
but we can't transpose that into an economic system.
Survival led a fist.

156
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:41.120
If you ain't got enough hustle and muscle,
fuck you.

157
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:43.060
You have to do a town by the wayside.
You know?

158
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.210
Here we have an obligation to aspire to the better parts of our nature.

159
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.710
Not to continually use materialism and rationalism to justify that 20% of the

160
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.660
population that you know or whatever is energy is at just garbage.
It just there.

161
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.790
That's affordable.
We can call,
we can live with that.
He is.
For me,
it's,

162
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.820
that's why would we,
once we have the knowledge that,
oh yeah,

163
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.370
we shouldn't be farming in that way.
Oh,
we shouldn't have social systems.

164
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.811
All of the,

165
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.120
the answer's always the same because if you were to change in that area,

166
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.000
it will affect the interests of the powerful,
it will affect,

167
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:15.410
impede the ability of certain organizations to make profit.
Now I'm,
you know,

168
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.630
I'm not talking about,
yeah,

169
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.150
I don't know the lexicon enough around socialism and capitalism and Marxism and

170
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.190
various forms of social organization.

171
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.400
I'm just talking about my assumption that we're all resourced from the same

172
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.190
basic material and phenomenal.

173
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:33.210
We all have compassion and loving us and if we on an individual level can

174
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.830
achieve some level of access to that,

175
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.150
then we can start to organize ourselves on that basis,
not on the basis of,
well,

176
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.380
what's the most I can get as an individual?
It's rational for me to be there.

177
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.780
I'm not involved in that.
That doesn't affect me personally,
you know,

178
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.490
and I think it's a hard thing for us to hold.

179
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:51.120
I think the reason we all do just live with homelessness and the only decision

180
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:54.690
we make is do we put a couple of dollars out the window with the light or not?

181
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.930
Then like big,

182
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.890
it's hard to hold that it's hard to love more than a hundred people.

183
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.910
<v 0>There's no fix.
There's no as an individual,</v>

184
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.830
not as not one person and even collectively as a group when you have mental

185
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:11.970
health issues,
unless you want to institutionalize those people.
Yeah,

186
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.750
but then who?
Here's the thing,
right?
If everyone has a unique,

187
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.030
and if everyone has their own ideas about what to do with their life and

188
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:21.870
everyone has freedom,

189
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.260
what if you just don't have enough people that are interested in,
in,

190
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.510
in mental health of the homeless people?
You just don't have enough.

191
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:30.180
There's no resources guarantee.
The results is,
yeah.

192
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.140
That's a big question because our systems are biased in a particular direction.

193
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.130
What if they have government funding?

194
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.780
Do you think that that could cure homelessness?
One of the advantages I've got

195
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.820
<v 1>being a drug addict does it means I have to help have a drug addicts as part of</v>

196
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.390
my own recovery.
This puts me into areas,
institutions,
groups,

197
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.910
facilities where me and drug addicts and always what?

198
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:49.200
You'll find that people that work there,

199
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:52.430
there's always someone like a man or a woman most often in my personal expenses

200
00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:52.861
as a woman,

201
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:57.780
some matriarchal woman full of mother energy that just will do this shit forever

202
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.850
for free,
for nothing that just loves it.

203
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.110
Let's just put herself like my grandmother did or my mother data I'd like these

204
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:07.650
women do between people in the gutter that are just willing to say,

205
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.800
I'll be the person,
I'll be the person in la at friendly house.

206
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.930
It was a woman called Peggy all but used to run a play.

207
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.900
A friendly houses are for women that have got drug and addiction and abuse

208
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:18.570
issues and like this woman,
she was from Chicago,

209
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:23.571
she was 90 years old by the time like I'm actually so rude and brilliant and

210
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:26.820
beautiful and entirely willing to dedicate yourself.

211
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.570
And I think every community everywhere,
everyone knows people like that.

212
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.270
And I feel like the same way as like if it is someone who has got a great

213
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:35.100
capacity or play basketball or be a comic.

214
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.150
Like I think that when you spot those people that you encourage them and

215
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:40.850
talented and help them people.
Yeah.

216
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:43.130
The talent of compassion and let you know that.

217
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.790
But we don't value that unless it's like,

218
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:46.170
unless it can be turned to a profit fuck off.

219
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.830
All of those organizations like those organizations that help people with

220
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:51.160
addiction issues,
you know,

221
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:56.161
like they are maligned and like the people that profit from the opioid crisis,

222
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.060
they are supported.
They are able to conceal as John Oliver Brilliantly revealed.

223
00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:02.890
Are they,
they're able to conceal their practices continually.

224
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:07.891
The invisible biases in the direction of profit and like the failure of certain

225
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.020
types of socialism doesn't mean that's the end of the argument.

226
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:15.680
I think we have an obligation to look for ways of accessing our own,
uh,

227
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.100
higher nature,
better nature kind of nature.

228
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:21.700
Call it what you will and seeing how we can organize that as an individual.

229
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.600
You can do so much.
I,
if Bill Gates can,
you know,

230
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.270
fucking Hell I had no cure malaria and make the significant charitable Dana,

231
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.380
these impressive,

232
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.280
powerful people can't make a meaningful difference than clearly this is a

233
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:33.990
systemic,
yeah,

234
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.860
<v 0>problem.
Well,</v>

235
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:38.160
there's also the problem with homeless people and that they're adults.
Um,

236
00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:41.580
when you become an adult and you develop from the time you were a child,

237
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:45.450
it's probably very likely that the damage was all done while they were young.

238
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.320
They were probably abused and neglected and there's a lot of issues that led

239
00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:53.490
them to either have mental health problems or they had mental health problems

240
00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:56.790
already.
Maybe they have genetic problems.
Then on top of that,
there's drug abuse.

241
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.450
Do you,
for each one of those people to get well,

242
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.700
you're going to need a massive amount of folks.

243
00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:06.330
You're not going to have one old lady who's rude.
Brilliant.

244
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.980
That's a cute movie,
but that's 20 people.
Yeah.
He's a good movie.
Yeah.

245
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.670
You're down.
Write it down.
Yeah.
Who would,
who would be the woman?

246
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.280
Faye Dunaway or some shit like the one that was a out of golden girls.

247
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.860
Estelle Getty.
She's still available.
I thought,
Oh God,
a wrap.

248
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.340
They white still around.
Betty White's still hanging in there.
Yeah.

249
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:30.630
But what'd you book a movie around her stink.
Hang on one [inaudible] yeah.

250
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.940
How are we going to fund this?
Yeah,
it's um,
yeah,

251
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.550
<v 1>no you're right.
Look,</v>

252
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.870
there's limitation to be individual but that there's not like crushed this

253
00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:39.030
optimism in the crib now Joe.
Right.

254
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.910
<v 0>Cause I know trashing the optimism,</v>

255
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.590
but I'm saying the logistics of it would almost be insurmountable and it's very

256
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:47.424
hard to fill.
It

257
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.710
<v 1>is not an objective thing.
It's this thing that's been biased over time.</v>

258
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.210
<v 0>Sort of once a person is developed once they're assuming it's very difficult to</v>

259
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.560
turn that train around.
Yeah.

260
00:13:57.561 --> 00:14:02.480
If we can save the community and save the future,

261
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.490
like help,
like less people get through fucked help,

262
00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:12.230
let me help more people get through with hope and with a real possibility for

263
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.030
improving their life versus have this sense of hopelessness that many are

264
00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:20.210
confronted with that's going to make less crime.
I agree.

265
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:22.120
That's like that's just if they,

266
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.750
if someone looked at it from a social engineering standpoint,

267
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.860
it almost seems like the only way that would ever have to happen would be

268
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:32.180
there's be some fucking catastrophe that force people to act like we sometimes

269
00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:35.570
need something that's shoved in our face to force us to act,

270
00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:40.571
but if someone brilliantly calculated the amount of resources that it would

271
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:44.480
require and then also brilliantly calculated how much less crime me,
we'd have,

272
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.580
how much less,
how many more innovations because people didn't waste their lives.

273
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.380
In fact,
they got through and used one of the most valuable resources we have,

274
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:57.600
which is the human imagination and creativity and ingenuity like,

275
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.430
and we're missing that on these people that are growing up in these horrible

276
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:04.360
environments where they can't escape.
There's so fuck from,

277
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.000
they're in gangs there,
you know the crime and poverty and violence,

278
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:13.001
there's so fucked that whatever genius they have is wasted on this nonsensical

279
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:17.810
existence.
If they could just show that in,
quantify how much that would be,

280
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:22.790
how valuable that would be to the overall culture and community of the co of the

281
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:23.401
continent.

282
00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:27.170
And then ultimately of the earth mean do you would have a reason to engineer.

283
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:27.870
Think about that.

284
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.910
<v 1>She has a beautiful,</v>

285
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.990
that is really beautiful and it's interesting that the way that I agree with you

286
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:37.940
that it's almost has to at some point be translated into monetary value because

287
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:38.800
otherwise people

288
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.590
<v 0>does seem to read it.
Yeah,
and safety for everybody,</v>

289
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:46.130
for them who live in these horrible communities wouldn't be great.
Again,

290
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:48.140
if everybody lived like a middle class person,

291
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.310
the idea that that's impossible seems so insane.
It's almost seems like,

292
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:53.810
well then nobody should live like that.

293
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:56.820
Then like either everybody should be able to live like that or nobody should be

294
00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:59.840
a little boy.
That was like,
that's what everybody really wants,
right?

295
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:04.820
You want to be comfortable like in terms of like your ability to exist and then

296
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.060
all the things you're doing that you struggle with should be a good percentage

297
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:13.040
of them other than emotional and friendship type thing should be of your own

298
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:16.550
choosing.
You choose to,
to take a difficult path.

299
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:18.380
You she choose to take an adventure.

300
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.270
You choose to try to enrich yourself with this difficult experience and the

301
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:26.600
challenge of it and try to overcome that challenge instead of you.

302
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.160
Your challenge is not to get killed by a gang.
You know,
your,

303
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:33.410
your challenge is not get fucked by your uncle again.
You know what I mean?

304
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.720
I mean,
this is what people have to deal with and you're,

305
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:38.510
you're missing these brilliant minds.

306
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:40.700
They don't get this chance to come through and,

307
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.550
and sneak through that fucking salmon ladder.
You know,
get up to the top.

308
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.970
<v 1>This would be a very beautiful,
that you are passionate about this.</v>

309
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.030
And I think popularizing these ideas is important because I feel that then

310
00:16:55.941 --> 00:17:00.080
people will be familiar with this kind of language and we'll recognize that when

311
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.840
there is political discourse.
How phatic an empty he yeah.
