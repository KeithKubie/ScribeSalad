00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.360
Did you know video games can give you superpowers?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.280
Okay, not really.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.360
But they can improve your lucid dreaming powers.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.000
It's got to be close.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.120
You can literally do anything you want inside your head.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.140
Anything.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.360
For those who don't know what lucid dreaming is,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.860
it's basically when you're dreaming and you can consciously control what happens.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.880
Usually, said person wakes up inside the dream and goes,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.120
"Whoa"

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.240
and probably takes a dump in his pants from the literal holy crap moment.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.280
The entire thing is pretty cool.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.080
Once you realize you're dreaming,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.540
you can proceed to sprout wings and fly,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.140
dance with some monkeys,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.280
or bang pretty much anyone you want.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.280
Lucid dreams can be so vivid that the person having them can hardly tell if they're dreaming or not.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.000
Because of this, many practice doing a reality check everytime they think they're dreaming.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.160
This usually consists of trying to do something impossible,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.360
like breathing while your nose is plugged and your mouth is closed,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880
or walking through a wall,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.500
or 'poofing' a magical girl monkey into existence.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.300
It's honestly really, really cool,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.140
and it seems video games help you achieve this.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.240
It's widely known that what you do during the day can affect the dreams you have the following night,

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.000
and so people who play video games often before going to sleep,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480
are more proficient at controlling them,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.180
which in turn leads to lucid dreaming.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.980
A lot of popular video games like 'Halo' and 'Call of Duty' are similar to dreams in the way you control an avatar in a separate world.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.900
The video games are almost like practice, so that the skills you gain translate right into dreamland.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.120
You're also able to control yourself more proficiently, and your dreams themselves are more like a video game.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.560
Unfortunately, this doesn't allow for all the cool powers of lucid dreaming,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
since the dreams themselves become more video game like,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.900
the only person you can control, is yourself.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.500
So no 'poofing' up magical monkey girls.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.680
However, just being able to control your own movements gives you an edge with fighting nightmares,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.080
and even decreases the frequency of having bad dreams.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.020
Also, gamers who end up in a nightmare said that they don't usually feel scared or afraid,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.660
but they decided to fight, instead of running away,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.740
viewing the entire thing like another round of 'Call of Duty'.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.380
Except, you know, minus the annoying screaming ten-year-olds.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.720
Jane Gackenbach, a psychologist at the Grand McKewen University in Canada and the founder of this phenomenon,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.500
believes that this is a major find to help people who have recurrent nightmares and even war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.100
So, if you have recurrent nightmares or PTSD,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.220
or you just think running around in a video game-like dream sounds fun, then play some more video games.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.860
Even if you're not interested in this, play some more video games anyways.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.960
Video games are great.
