00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.360
racial and ethnic diversity and
therefore you won't have to take race

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
therefore you won't have to take race
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.410
therefore you won't have to take race
and ethnicity into account consciously

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:07.420
and ethnicity into account consciously
 

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.350
and ethnicity into account consciously
in order to address these issues I think

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360
in order to address these issues I think
 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.699
in order to address these issues I think
it's it's both faults on the solution

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:15.709
it's it's both faults on the solution
 

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:21.220
it's it's both faults on the solution
and and really misses the point on the

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.230
and and really misses the point on the
 

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.379
and and really misses the point on the
on the first because of course we're

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:23.389
on the first because of course we're
 

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.150
on the first because of course we're
concerned with inequality of wealth and

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160
concerned with inequality of wealth and
 

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.239
concerned with inequality of wealth and
income of course we want to maintain

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:28.249
income of course we want to maintain
 

00:10:28.249 --> 00:10:31.689

course it's a basic principle in
 

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:37.030
course it's a basic principle in
American life that your child's

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040
American life that your child's
 

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.499
American life that your child's
education should not depend upon the

00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:38.509
education should not depend upon the
 

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:41.559
education should not depend upon the
wealth of the family we should work on

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:41.569
wealth of the family we should work on
 

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:44.499
wealth of the family we should work on
that we do work on that but where its

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:44.509
that we do work on that but where its
 

00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:47.949
that we do work on that but where its
faults on the on the solution is that

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959
faults on the on the solution is that

all the scholarship that exists on this

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
all the scholarship that exists on this
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.470
all the scholarship that exists on this
points out what is a sort of undeniable

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480
points out what is a sort of undeniable
 

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.239
points out what is a sort of undeniable
fact that the effort to try to achieve

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:57.249
fact that the effort to try to achieve
 

00:10:57.249 --> 00:11:01.079
fact that the effort to try to achieve
greater access for low-income children

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:01.089
greater access for low-income children
 

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:04.389
greater access for low-income children
from low-income backgrounds will not

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399
from low-income backgrounds will not

really yield racial and ethnic diversity

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:07.459
really yield racial and ethnic diversity
 

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:10.480
really yield racial and ethnic diversity
and that's because of demographics that

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.490
and that's because of demographics that
 

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.350
and that's because of demographics that
in every sector of American life the

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360
in every sector of American life the
 

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.499
in every sector of American life the
largest population is going to be white

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:17.509
largest population is going to be white
 

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:20.290

and therefore by focusing only on a

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:20.300
and therefore by focusing only on a

particular aspect of the race or
 

00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:25.090
particular aspect of the race or
