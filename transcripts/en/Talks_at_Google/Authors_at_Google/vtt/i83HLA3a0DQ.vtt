NILKA THOMAS: All right.

00:00:02.725 --> 00:00:03.470
So hi, everyone.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.469
My name is Nilka Thomas.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.310
And I'm a manager of diversity.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.560
And I sit in the
New York office.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.900
I am very fortunate to be
able to introduce Sylvia Ann

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.670
Hewlett, who's here today
speaking about her recently

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.100
published book, "Forget a
Mentor, Find a Sponsor."

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.170
So just quickly, what the
run of show is going to be,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.026
we're going to
have Sylvia come up

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.150
and she's going to introduce
us to this distinction

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.520
between mentorship
and sponsorship,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.040
and tell you how
sponsorship may be

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.585
your fastest ticket to the top.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:34.960
Following her
presentation, we're

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.560
going to do a very brief Q&amp;A
for about 15 or 20 minutes.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.120
So in terms of introduction,
just very quickly,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.800
Sylvia is an economist
and founder and CEO

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.950
of a New York-based
think tank called

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.770
the Center for
Talent Innovation.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.850
She founded and
chaired a task force

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.880
for talent innovation for
75 multinational companies,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.970
of which Google is one, that
are focused on fully realizing

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.290
the new streams of talent
in the global marketplace.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.750
Sylvia is author of 10
"Harvard Business Review"

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.760
articles and 10 critically
acclaimed books including

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.260
"Off-ramps and On-ramps" as
well as "When the Bough Breaks."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.650
She's no stranger to Google.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.280
She's a longtime partner and
has been here many times before.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.960
So today she is back
by popular demand.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.590
Sylvia?

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.970
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Well,
it is fabulous to be back.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.840
And I want to begin
today with a little bit

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.310
about my own personal
journey because I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.210
think I bring a particular
passion to this work

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.630
because it so much
resonates to my own life.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.520
So I grew up in the
Welsh mining valleys,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.610
a very neglected and rather
bleak part of the UK.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.240
In fact, when I was growing
up, the local unemployment rate

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.020
was 38%.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.490
The coal mines
were closing down.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.440
And I was a part
of a working class

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.980
family that was six daughters.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.280
I spent a lot of my
childhood praying for the boy

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.200
because my working class bloke
of a rather wonderful father

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.780
desperately wanted a son.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.505
So when my mom was 45
years old and gave birth

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:25.170
to her sixth daughter,
she officially gave up.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.300
And my dad decided he'd better
do something with his girls.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.870
The most you could do as a
girl child in the Welsh mining

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.380
valleys was marry
an unemployed miner.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.810
So not too appealing
in lots of ways.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.370
So what he did when I
was 13 is he took me

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.290
by bus to Cambridge University.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.460
And he basically
saw me, I think,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.220
as a young person
with some promise.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.070
And he knew what young people
of promise needed was a dream.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.070
So he showed me
what he had heard

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.570
was one of the most beautiful
and opportunity-packed campuses

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.530
in Europe.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.060
And he just said to me, if you
work hard, you can go here.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.130
It was a very
audacious challenge

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.300
because I went to a
very lousy school which

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.109
had been in existence
for 200 years

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.400
and no one had ever been to
either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.100
So why should I be different?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.880
But he had in the
back of his mind

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.490
a sense that times
were changing.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.422
A women's movement was
getting off the ground.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:29.130
And there was a Labor
government in power

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.100
which was forcing the
ancient universities

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.780
to open their doors much more
widely to some different folks,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.130
in particular girls and
kids from the wrong side

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.740
of the tracks.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.870
And I certainly got to
qualify on both those scores.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.100
So I did go back to Wales.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780
Obviously, I worked like crazy.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.900
I was very motivated.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.010
But quite frankly,
I would not have

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.340
gotten into that
university had it not been

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.210
for the change of the rules,
the attitudes, and the culture.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.820
And I think what I
learned from that

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.490
is that really no one,
no matter how promising,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.420
really pulls themselves up
by their own bootstraps.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.690
We all need heavy-duty
lifting from outside.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.649
And this task force I
founded 10 years ago-- which

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.830
now has 75 companies and
it's wonderful to be working

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.680
with Google-- is really
about fully realizing

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.920
the talents of all the new
kids on the block, women,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.680
multicultural folks,
gay individuals, folks

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.510
from emerging markets, Gen Ys.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.770
Because many of us have
different value propositions.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.460
We have different
things that incentivize

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.100
us, et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.850
And we cannot any longer
work with an old paradigm.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.370
So let me share with you this
particular piece of work.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.890
We've done some amazing work.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.630
We did a whole study, for
instance, on extreme jobs.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.210
How do you make
them sustainable?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.630
What is an extreme job?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.140
We did a huge study last year on
what we call the power of out.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.670
What happens when
gay individuals can

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.630
claim their full
identity at work?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.100
And in Silicon Valley, only
43% of gay professionals

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.330
are actually out in the
workplace, a rather staggering

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.150
thought.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.020
So we look at the talent
issues right across the gamut.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.412
And this is the task force.

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:33.870
We have some
extraordinary members.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.760
It's very global.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.550
We see the talent conversation
as a global conversation

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.990
and not an American
conversation.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.920
So we have Genpak, and
we have [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.100
We have all kinds of players.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.710
A recent addition, which
is a strange addition, some

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.740
of the multilateral
institutions are

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.340
joining us, the
IMF for instance,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.980
which desperately needs
to diversify, and the CIA.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.570
We're not quite sure
why the CIA joined.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.250
It's all classified.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.640
But we suspect that they
know that if they're

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.970
going to be effective
in this world,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.030
they better do a better
job of reflecting

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.500
the face of their
mission and sending

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.000
a bunch of 50-year-old pale
males to some of the arenas

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.285
that they're in as
leaders ain't gonna work.

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:29.660
So they're trying to learn
from the private sector, which

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.670
is fascinating.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.230
And actually the numbers
show that the private sector

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.800
is doing better than the public
sector in all kinds of ways

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.000
in terms of these
talent changes.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.090
So these are some of
the companies that

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.930
underwrote this
particular piece of work.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.040
And what I'm going
to start with here

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.300
is the challenge behind this
piece of work on sponsorship.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.500
So here's the deal.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.180
There's been enormous progress
in the lower and middle rungs

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.690
of career ladders.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.860
But life at the top hasn't
changed much at all.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.410
For instance, one figure I
feel is indicative of it all,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.900
only 8% of the top earners
in this economy are female.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.496
That figure was precisely
the same 15 years ago.

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:16.120
So there's been all
this change in what

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.760
I call the marzipan layer,
that rich but very sticky

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.910
layer below the top, but not a
whole lot of change at the top.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.100
And people of color are
also stuck and stalled

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.300
at the middle levels.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.580
So what we did was
try and figure out

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.565
how people got to the top.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:42.550
And it's about how power is
transferred in the workplace.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.930
And basically what has
happened through time--

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.770
and we're not newly
discovering this,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.650
we're just newly
quantifying it--

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.290
senior leaders have
replicated themselves.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.740
They've tapped on the shoulder
someone in the next level

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.700
down who they feel
most comfortable with.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.590
Whether they went to school,
they behave the same,

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.120
they maybe go to the
same church or synagogue,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.970
there is a comfort zone.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.040
Leadership replicates itself.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.340
So the idea is to actually
describe what's going on

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.270
and make it more
accessible to folks

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.920
who didn't necessarily come
from sponsor-rich environments.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.090
Folks like me.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:30.670
There weren't too many leaders
in those valleys I grew up in.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.220
So in our data we
find that there

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.669
are three things a sponsor
does that really distinguishes

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.809
this person from a mentor,
an old-style mentor.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.340
First off, the
leader really needs

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.000
to know you, needs to
understand your value,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.020
and be willing to
take a bet on you.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.980
Because you'll be walking
around with their brand

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.820
on your forehead.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.520
So you've got to be
able to grow this

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.500
as an organic,
work-driven relationship.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.700
It's got to be real.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.670
Secondly, that person who
is almost by definition

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.660
a more senior person
in the organization

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.490
needs to publicly advocate
for that next position,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.820
for that next
stretch opportunity

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.390
so that you can show your
promise to the world.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.700
And finally, they have
to be in your corner

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.530
so you can take some risks
because nothing gets done

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.340
that's amazing in the workplace
without a great deal of risk

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.270
and therefore failure.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.880
It's often said, for
instance, that people of color

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.760
are risk averse at work.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.340
We find that that's not true.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.120
They're merely not suicidal.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.520
So few of them have
sponsors, so few of them

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.870
have a senior person that has
their back, that it's actually

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.050
very dangerous to take a risk.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.830
So that's the third
thing that a sponsor

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:10.060
does that is extremely important
in terms of your traction.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.900
Now the stuff on
the right is stuff

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.250
that sponsors do but
mentors often do,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.630
too-- the guidance, the
contacts, the advice.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.210
I mean, that's something
that has always

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.760
been on offer in
progressive companies.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.150
Turning to the other
side of the equation,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:34.570
one of the big, distinguishing
realities about the sponsorship

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.420
relationship is that
it's deeply reciprocal.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.300
You almost have to
give before you get.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.110
In other words, you need
to earn sponsorship.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.360
How do you do it?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.472
What makes it very likely
that you are the person who

00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:52.900
will get tapped on the
shoulder for this opportunity?

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.030
Well, again, in the data
there are three things.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.820
First up, performance,
of course.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.440
That's central.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.260
Trustworthiness,
loyalty to the team,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.660
to the leader because
no one is going

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.170
to take a bet on you unless
you're incredibly reliable.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.060
Thirdly, you better
have some currency

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.950
that makes you create
value-added, something

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.450
that the leader does
not have, something

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.250
that the team does not have.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.710
I mean, it could be
cultural fluency.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.880
It could be amazing
knowledge of-- I

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.830
don't know-- the New Jersey
market or a third language.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.750
Name it, it's out there.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.210
Figuring out your currency,
lifting it up, shouting it

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.460
from the rooftops, making
it apparent what's additive,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.860
what's unique about
your contribution,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.350
enormously powerful
in terms of making

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.910
you indispensable to leaders.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.620
So what we're describing
here is something

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.460
which is very profoundly
a two-way street.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.710
And this, of course, is very
different from mentoring.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.850
Because traditional mentoring
is a very passive thing.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.430
I mean, what does a mentee do?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.900
They sit.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.670
They smile.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.140
They say, thank you.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.250
They take some notes, perhaps.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.840
Make an appointment for
coffee in two months.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.440
But you don't have
skin in the game.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.920
It's something that's
being given to you.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.550
It's paying it forward.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.490
Probably you'll all
do it, whether it's

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.970
interns that are in the
office for the summer.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.390
Or in my case, I've
got endless students

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.780
that I have mentored
over the years.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.460
What we find is that
when there is confusion

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.640
as to what is mentoring
and what is sponsorship,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.750
you can get the balance
wrong in your life.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.530
For instance, we find
that women and people

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.870
of color over-mentor.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.370
It's very easy to have
17 people that you're

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.850
mentoring because there
is such a yearning

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.650
for that kind of support.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.670
But unless you're also
sponsoring two or three

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.776
people who are fabulous and
really delivering for you,

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:12.560
you stall out.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.510
We find leaders who
sponsor well are much more

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.450
likely to get the
next, more senior slot.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.130
It propels them forward.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.050
People who become
isolated and don't sponsor

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.350
don't have this kind of powerful
posse of younger folks shoving

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.190
and pushing and helping you.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.340
So what we say
about this research

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.560
is that any point
in your career you

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.800
should be doing
both things, seeking

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.760
to refresh your sponsors to
get yourself to the next level

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.570
and proactively investing
in just two or three

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.340
people on your team, perhaps,
who you value particularly

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.960
and you have very high
expectations of in terms

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.240
of what they deliver for you.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.820
And then, obviously,
the pay it forward

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.040
and the gift of mentoring
you can also do,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.180
but not exclusively.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.530
So I want to just tell
one story about why

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.270
it's important to sponsor
really from a pretty

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.050
early age in the workplace.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.300
One of the powerful
interviews I did for this book

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.900
was with the head of an
engineering firm on the East

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.670
Coast.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.070
So he said, I totally get
this sponsoring thing.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.392
When I interview
people who have gone

00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:35.850
through the whole
selection process

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.820
and are being considered as
one of my direct reports,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.400
I will always ask
this key question

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.910
which is, how many people
do you have in your pocket?

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.580
Meaning, how many people that
you sponsored over the years

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.230
and are now dotted around
this company in key positions?

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.060
So if I asked you to do
something totally impossible

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.110
next week which involved
liaising across three

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.710
geographies and
five functions, you

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.250
could actually deliver because
there are folks out there who

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.020
owe you one, and
think you're fabulous,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.090
and would put your
project first.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.380
And he said, I'm not
interested in any one

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.980
who doesn't have deep pockets.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.570
And these days,
given our global span

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.360
and the face of our
consumer, they'd

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.260
better be deep, diverse pockets.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.660
And of course, we might
not choose that language.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:38.380
But it is a deeply productive
alliance with a senior person.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.620
This is not meant to
be a burden on anyone.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.930
And it's muscles that we
need to develop and flex

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.970
if we are going
to be successful.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.450
OK, so let's look at the data.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.170
The data rests on four different
surveys, representative samples

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.330
of mid-level and senior
executives across this economy.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.270
We also did a ton of
online focus groups

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.760
which were anonymous,
and a lot of interviews.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.840
So if you look
across the economy,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.350
obviously not everyone
will get sponsors

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.390
because it is the
leadership track.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.150
It is the fast track.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:24.460
So 19% of men, in
general, get sponsorship.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.230
The thing is that men,
particularly white men,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.520
are much more likely to have
this relationship at work

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.810
than women or people of color.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:40.190
The gap on the ethnic background
front is particularly wide.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.290
As you can see, Caucasians 63%
more likely to have a sponsor.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.340
And we find that
the stickler here--

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.550
remember that second
thing that goes on?

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.820
This trust, this reliability,
this loyalty thing?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:00.940
It seems that trust, the sense
that you can really, totally

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.520
rely on this person to
come through for you,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.910
doesn't cross lines of
gender or race very readily.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:15.410
It has to be something that
is learned, that is a goal,

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.220
is something that's
sought after.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.400
Because the natural
tendency is a mini me thing.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.530
You select and groom
for leadership someone

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.010
who is in your
prime comfort zone.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.180
OK, so we're looking
at what sponsors

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.580
do in terms of our data.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.870
Did we find that this
is pretty dramatic data?

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.670
Men and women with
sponsors, much more likely

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.610
to ask for and get a pay raise.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.050
Well, why not?

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.120
There's someone on
that committee deciding

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:59.080
on bonuses or pay grades
who is speaking out for you.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.560
Secondly, men and women
with sponsors much more

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.940
likely to stick around.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.030
And again, why not?

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.270
There's someone who's giving
you career opportunities, who's

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.080
telling you that you've got
what it takes, that you're

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.770
valuable to the company,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.330
But think of this figure.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.780
Women who've just had
a child are 38% more

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.000
likely to both come back
to work and stay back

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.490
at work if they have a sponsor.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.510
So the impact is huge.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.070
And then it impacts ambition.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.600
And we find, for instance,
the 35-year-olds,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.520
38-year-olds do not
downsize their dreams

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.380
if they're sponsored.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.820
They're able to sustain their
ambition through midlife.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.030
Because again, there's traction.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.110
They can see that
there's a pathway where

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:05.280
they are advancing with really
important folks on their side.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.930
And finally, the progression
figures are extremely clear.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.340
And remember in this data we're
using the definition that I

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.130
shared with you.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.940
And it is this rather
rigorous definition

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.620
of what this senior
person is doing for you

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.952
and what you're doing for them.

00:19:23.952 --> 00:19:25.410
But right across
the board, there's

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:30.210
a huge impact of
sponsorship on whether you

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.320
get to the next
rung on the ladder.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.650
OK, let's talk about
some of the tripwires

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.390
because obviously
it's not a coincidence

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.980
that particularly women and
multicultural folks somehow

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.070
miss out on this relationship.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.860
So let's talk about
the first tripwire.

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:57.730
Again, leaders often
tell us in the research

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:04.990
they find it hard to choose
a woman because somehow she

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.450
is not seen as a
potential leader.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.110
She isn't seen as
leadership material.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.710
And there's all this
silly stuff going on.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.160
In other words, there's
this very narrow window

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.690
of what is deemed acceptable
in the leadership model.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.600
So it's awfully easy
for a woman to be

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.860
seen as too
opinionated, too bossy.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.570
The B word comes out.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.930
Or she's seen as too quiet,
too retiring, too passive.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.100
Just a little window
where she's just right.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.690
And we find that
if a man is quiet,

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.055
he's seen as a still waters run
deep type, all kinds of stuff

00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:47.680
going on there.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.320
He's just not sharing.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.920
A woman is just seen as
probably just not up to snuff.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.610
On dress, too
provocative, too frumpy.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.890
I had a CEO give me a whole
lecture about the frump

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:12.330
factor in his company and how
distressing it was to him.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.830
Too aggrandizing, we
can be too show-offy.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.590
We are too pushy.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.140
Or we're too self-depreciating.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.290
And then the one I love, we're
too young or we're too old.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.240
There's three years in
there when we're just right.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.120
Men get 17 years.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.790
So I'll tell you what those
three years are afterwards.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.136
But more seriously, I
think what that data--

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:43.760
and I wish I could
say it was old data.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.740
It's not old data.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.180
It's like a year ago.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.200
What it shows is the
needs-- and probably Google

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.100
is rather good at this--
expanding our vision of what

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.620
leaders look like, talk
like, and behave like.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:04.230
Because to use those kinds
of implicit screening devices

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.990
is a ridiculous notion
because obviously it

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:12.690
has so little to do with the
performance or the contribution

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.650
of individuals.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.160
But this is distressing.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.930
35% of African
American individuals

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.060
in the middle levels
of their companies

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.810
feel that it is impossible
to get to the top.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.710
And it has a huge impact on
behavior because we find--

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:38.830
and this is a real figure-- 43%
of very high potential, valued,

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.360
long track record, African
American individuals

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.820
at age 40-ish leave for
entrepreneurial activities.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.920
They do not stay in
corporations because of that.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.650
They assume that they're
on a slow road to nowhere.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.020
OK, so what we have done--
and this is very much what

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.780
the book's about--
you don't need

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.090
a program or some
massive initiative.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.210
I mean, companies
can help by creating

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.920
a culture of sponsorship perhaps
by helping you create pathways

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.150
to sponsorship.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.550
But it's also true
that as an individual

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.410
you can go make this
happen for yourself.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.150
So there is a journey.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.110
There are tactics.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.470
There are things you have to
have centrally in your mind.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.610
And one thing I do
want to just point out

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.920
is that we absolutely
need to be operating

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.940
on both sides of this
equation all the time.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.200
So let me pick out a
couple of these things

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.560
because you do have the
book, so all of it's there.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.820
First off, as you
figure out which

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.560
of the kind of power
brokers in your life

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.824
might be the one to get in front
of and impress the hell out of,

00:23:59.824 --> 00:24:02.000
you can't make that
decision until you

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.470
know where you're going.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:11.940
So creating this vision of
the kind of agency, impact,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.230
and influence, and position
that you might ultimately want

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.740
is a pretty important exercise.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.570
And one story which I love
which stuck in my mind, when

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.120
Walt Disney built that amazing
theme park in Florida all

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.610
those years ago-- I
think it was 1967--

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.070
he knew he had to
build the castle first.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.470
Because that's
where the magic is.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.550
So that's what he did.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.710
There was this
medieval fantasy castle

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.990
with the turrets and the flags.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.530
And for the 30,000
workers who were

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.720
grappling with the
mangrove swamps

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.560
and trying to build those
tunnels and lakes and all

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.320
the rest of it, it was
pretty amazing to know

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.870
what they were building and
this kind of paradise for kids

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.280
that it was going to be.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:10.140
And it was a huge reason for why
engagement was incredibly high

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.000
and that project was
delivered on time, on budget.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.050
So build your castle first.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:23.520
Career journeys are full of
difficult chunks of time.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.330
To maintain one's
motivation, one's,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.080
I guess, focus, one's
drive, one's vision,

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.840
it's pretty important to be
able to embrace and touch

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:44.040
and almost smell the role
that you ultimately want.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.850
So I just want to pick
out a couple of things.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.350
When you scan the horizon
for some possible sponsors,

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.620
there's some classic
mistakes people make.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:01.820
You do not need to look for
someone who looks like you

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.070
or acts like you.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.230
We find one thing
that is very true,

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:12.250
particularly of women,
is that they seek out

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.730
collaborative leaders, leaders
that are inclusive, leaders

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.620
that value push-back,
all that kind of stuff.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.540
And they love it if that leader
also happens to be a woman.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.400
But what do you imagine
you need to in a sponsor?

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.010
Because you can
find role models.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.010
You can find mentors.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.200
What do you really,
really need in a sponsor?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.870
Does any of that stuff matter?

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.000
Does it matter?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.968
AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:39.968 --> 00:26:41.420
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: No?

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.560
What we say is that
you need someone

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.450
who has a voice on the
decision-making table that

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.080
affects you going down the line.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.900
You need someone
who has the power

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.500
to make a difference
in your career.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.790
Now you need to
respect that person.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.710
You need to think that they are
amazingly good at what they do.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.980
But you don't need to like them.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.940
You probably have to understand
that they have integrity.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.330
But this is a
transactional relationship.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:18.800
As one key leader told me,
he said, I don't do empathy.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.550
That's what these other
relationships are for.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.590
Find a friend or a mentor.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.920
Don't confuse these two things.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.910
Because when we
do this research,

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.740
we find that many
women are looking

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.400
for this particular
personality that they can super

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.690
relate to, who's
married with kids.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.560
So you've got your pool
down to about 1% of leaders.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.500
In other words,
you're so restricting

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.550
the potential
candidates for this.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:59.370
So see it as an alliance where
you totally join missions,

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.730
if you like, and you
both forge ahead.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:08.370
Don't treat it as something
that's full of, as I said,

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.340
empathy.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.020
Let me also just emphasize
the last thing on this list,

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.240
leading with a yes.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.950
And maybe this is so obvious
in the Google environment.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:24.460
But we found again one
thing that sponsors totally

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:30.510
require is this kind
of gung-ho, leaping

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.190
at opportunities
kind of attitude.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.630
And again, a little story, a
CFO who I spent a lot of time

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.240
with in interviews
for this book,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.110
he was trying to figure out
who to throw his weight behind,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.590
as he put it, in terms of
selecting the person who

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.210
would take over his role.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.550
He was retiring.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.710
And there were nine finalists
because there always

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:59.040
are a lot of candidates, whether
it's official or unofficial,

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.140
for any sought after position.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.410
And the one he really
felt he wanted to support

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.810
was the only woman on the list.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.550
He knew her well.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.090
He'd sponsored her.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.950
But for this
particular position,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.420
because it was a
big leap for her,

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.250
he wasn't sure she
was hungry enough.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.940
So he gave her a test.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.210
He walked into her office
one Monday morning and said,

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.170
Janet, do I have an
opportunity for you.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.070
I need someone to go
to Omaha for six weeks

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.319
and troubleshoot this client.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:35.860
The whole thing is
falling to pieces.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.500
We're losing a lot
of money, et cetera.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.060
Take a team in and fix it.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:46.490
So Janet looked up from her
desk and said, fantastic.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.290
When do I start?

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.080
Now the next morning,
she remembered

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.410
she had a one-year-old
and a few other clients,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.150
a few other
responsibilities in life.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.580
And she went back and she
re-negotiated the terms.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.900
She was still white hot.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.050
She still totally felt she could
do it and was going to do it.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.000
It was not that she was going
back with second thoughts.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.910
But she said, look, let me
go in for four-day spurts.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.990
I've got all these
other things going on.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.740
I'll put my number two there.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.590
We'll handle it.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.500
And he was thrilled.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.874
Because, he said,
actually that's

00:30:18.874 --> 00:30:20.650
what anyone would have done.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.270
No one worth their
salt can really

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.470
go to Omaha for six weeks.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.540
You better have some other
important things in your life.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.300
And it would be
what anyone would

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.480
do who was really
an A candidate.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.960
But he said so many
women in his experience

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.880
would lead with
ambivalence, would

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.350
be way too honest about how
they couldn't do it perfectly.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.740
They would wring
their hands and talk

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.770
about the one-year-old
and stuff like that.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.700
He said, bad idea.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.540
If you have ambivalence,
share it with your mentor.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:02.670
Your sponsor needs to
understand that you want this.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.960
So again, some lessons.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.830
I mean, the number of mistakes
I've made in my career

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.050
are legion.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.580
I wish I'd had this
data when I was 30.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.220
The roadmap for
sponsors is fascinating

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:23.090
because it has a lot to do
with profoundly understanding

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.790
what's in it for you.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.920
And one thing we find
in this is very tricky.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:36.360
Asian Americans, women,
people from other countries

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.902
oftentimes don't sponsor at all.

00:31:39.902 --> 00:31:41.485
Why do you imagine
they don't sponsor?

00:31:45.058 --> 00:31:46.974
AUDIENCE: Because they
haven't been sponsored?

00:31:46.974 --> 00:31:47.448
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Pardon?

00:31:47.448 --> 00:31:48.610
AUDIENCE: They haven't
been sponsored.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.110
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: They don't
understand the game in a way,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.760
right.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.190
But they feel that it's
sticking their neck out.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.400
And who would they sponsor?

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.060
If they sponsored someone like
them, that would be risky,

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.500
they think.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.630
That there will
be such scrutiny.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.310
A Brazilian sponsoring
a Brazilian?

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.670
Or a woman sponsoring another
woman in a small team?

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:16.400
So they shrink from doing that.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.990
And yet, that is the thing
that they would like to do.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.150
And oftentimes they
don't sponsor anyone.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.280
So there were lots of
stories of heartache

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.610
as they turned away
from sponsorship.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.320
And it's one reason why
they tend to over-mentor.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.700
Because that is very risk-free.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.580
But it does mean that they
dissipate a lot of energy

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.190
because no one should
have 27 mentees.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.900
That's a silly thing to do.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.155
It really undermines
your own power

00:32:48.155 --> 00:32:50.890
if you're giving
that kind of time.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:56.560
So again, there
is a huge learning

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.230
in-- so those who
have proteges, again,

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.190
much more likely to progress.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.830
So there's just one
last thing I want

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.650
to share before opening it up
to questions, a piece of work

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.960
that we have just finished.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:20.100
It's called "Innovation,
Diversity, and Market Growth."

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.510
It's coming out in the
[INAUDIBLE] next month.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.560
It's a huge study of
14 sectors, 40 case

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.380
examples, all kinds of data.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.590
What we are able to
do in this new work

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:40.970
is show precisely how the
power of difference on teams

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.180
unlocks innovation
and drives growth.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.470
So let me just go into it
a little bit because it's

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:57.970
why we need to care about
why we should progress

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.300
a fair representation
of individuals who cover

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.670
the spectrum of difference
in terms of identity,

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.030
in terms of experience,
in terms of perspective.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.489
So at the core of this work, we
looked very hard at diversity.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.110
What is it?

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.400
We discovered there are
two kinds that really

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.949
matter when it
comes to innovation.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:26.510
First off, you need a certain
amount of inherent diversity.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:30.790
By inherent, I mean baked in,
the stuff you're born with.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.179
You're a woman or a man.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:37.270
Your sexual identity is
a certain way, et cetera.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:42.489
Or you grew up as an Asian
person, et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.830
We have eight dimensions of
diversity that are inherent,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.920
that are immutable.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.190
And you need at least some
of that around the table.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.590
Because otherwise you do not see
certain market opportunities,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:05.150
that there is not a visceral
connect to unmet needs,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:11.240
to unexplored opportunities
in the market.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.160
But in addition to that you
need what we call acquired

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.710
diversity, which is a bunch
of behaviors that create

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:28.510
a speak-up culture, make it
safe to put out-of-the-box ideas

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:34.790
that maybe the leaders are
incredibly unfamiliar with

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.400
on the table.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.960
Because obviously, if you
come from a very different

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.980
background or got a very
different disciplinary or skill

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.990
set, you are putting
stuff on the table

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.130
that is not familiar to leaders.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.920
So these attributes of
acquired diversity--

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.200
and there are five behaviors
that particularly count-- are

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.470
the other ingredient.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.200
So the fabulous thing
is that companies

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.340
that have both things going
on, both the inherent diversity

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.160
and the acquired
diversity, really

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.470
do unlock market
share and market

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:14.090
growth because they are
much better at innovation.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.190
It's the kind of
talent conditions

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.250
that you like for
innovation to happen.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.070
And then the vast
majority of companies

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.260
don't have one or the other.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.810
Maybe both.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.580
But one doesn't
do it because you

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.270
can have a team that's
most impressively diverse.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:39.470
But if you have a command
and control bully culture,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.830
all of that's going
to remain latent.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.510
It does not express itself.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.920
So this new study,
go to my website.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.510
It's all very available.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.675
It was published last month.

00:36:53.675 --> 00:36:58.210
It is a fantastic
study, I think,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.590
in terms of why we
need to care, in terms

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.620
of creating the kind
of wonderful diversity

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.480
that we have in this room
around the leadership

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.010
tables of this country.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.750
So I'll leave it at that.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.225
And I would like to
take some questions.

00:37:19.225 --> 00:37:32.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.341
It does.

00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:37.940
I guess I'm going
wider than that.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.080
Obviously, individuals who
are in management roles

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.490
should be particularly
self-aware on this front

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:51.940
and understand the power of both
looking up and looking down,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.470
and making sure you have
these vital relationships.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:59.240
But it's certainly not
limited to managers.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.840
It's the way to forge success.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.840
And it's true for
entrepreneurs, too,

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.570
because what do
entrepreneurs need?

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:08.580
They need power brokers.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.900
They need to finance.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.710
They need people to
believe in their ideas.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.650
They need people to back them.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.640
It's true of life.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.560
One thing that I
feel very strongly

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.610
is what I learned
from this research,

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.970
because obviously I'm
at a point in life

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.470
where I'm not necessarily
climbing the ladder anymore.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.310
So this is how it changed
my behavior, this research.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:40.920
First off, it made me
very mindful of sponsoring

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.360
very deliberately two or
three particularly outstanding

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.480
younger people, and
not over-mentoring,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.860
which is a danger in my life.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.550
I'm a professor
in my spare time.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.670
And the number of
folks who want me

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.050
to write them recommendations
and that kind of thing.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.120
And I certainly do a
certain amount of it.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.830
But what I found
was that I was not

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.170
making the deliberate
investments in younger people

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:09.980
who could contribute enormously
to my agency and my influence.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.170
But the other thing
I learned is that I

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.330
figured that I needed
my next castle.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.600
You always need your
next castle unless you're

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.960
85 and really checking out.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.600
So what was my next castle?

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.853
So I thought about that.

00:39:27.853 --> 00:39:31.790
And I realized I
had another castle.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.260
And I wanted to have more
influence in public policy.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.950
It was a place I'd started.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.520
It matters to me.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.105
I'd just done this amazing
work for the private sector.

00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:44.220
And I wanted to
have more influence.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:49.740
So I dusted off my Rolodex
or my contact list, whatever.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:56.210
And I looked for who
I knew in Washington

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.880
who could open doors.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.810
I was looking for a
new kind of sponsor.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:06.440
So I realized I knew someone
from 13 years ago who's

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.060
currently head of the Council
of Economic Advisers, someone

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.900
called Alan Kreuger.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.937
And I called him.

00:40:11.937 --> 00:40:13.020
I did a bunch of homework.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.106
And I learned from my own
research how to approach this.

00:40:17.106 --> 00:40:22.240
So I called up Alan and I
said, Alan, how can I help you?

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.960
Can I deliver some value?

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.270
I know you're doing X, Y,
and Z. And I have this work.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.510
And this is what I
could do for you.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.310
He nearly fell of his seat.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.430
He was so thrilled.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:39.310
Most calls from old friends
are really asking for favors.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.130
So don't do that.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.510
Figure out what you can
give that is valuable.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.520
And so I did do a
bunch of stuff for him.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.906
And sponsorship flowed.

00:40:51.906 --> 00:40:53.280
He opened a whole
bunch of doors.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.500
I ended up on an
advisory committee.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.070
I got what I, in the
end, really wanted out

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.140
of this relationship.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.610
I mean, not that I begrudged
the stuff I was doing for him.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.580
But I learned so much
from this research

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.990
in terms of as a protege
in this situation,

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.680
how to make that happen.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:22.370
So there is something magical
about just the mindset which

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.470
is not just limited to managers.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.180
Well, that's what the
roadmap really is all about.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.520
And there are also
a bunch of tactics

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.470
how you get in front of folks
because that is an issue.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.610
Because you could be already
with a most extraordinary

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.020
stream of value,
but how do you get

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.730
to first base kind of thing?

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.940
So there are various tactics.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:55.240
In many organizations,
you can ask for a mentor.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.132
And be careful and clever
in terms of who you ask for.

00:41:58.132 --> 00:42:00.090
Because that's seen as
a pretty light fingered,

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.750
easy thing to do.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:07.200
And then turn it
into sponsorship

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:14.390
by using a very deliberate,
intentional strategy of vesting

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.320
energies.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.170
Another thing which
really works is

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.150
that if there's professional
associations or ERGs, or even

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.855
local not-for-profit boards
that many of your leaders

00:42:25.855 --> 00:42:29.470
are involved in do
some major piece

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.210
of investing in your community.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.950
And that's a very good way
to showcase your emerging

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:41.020
leaderly kind of
qualities and to get

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:45.520
to know some much more
senior folks as peers.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.990
And, again, you can't fake it.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.420
You have to choose something
you're genuinely interested in

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.990
because it makes
no sense otherwise.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.190
But again, if we look
at the strategies

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:00.360
that pay off-- the
book is full of them--

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.340
there are some
very simple things

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.564
that can bring off the
initial connection.

00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:09.730
You certainly should not
turn up at someone's office

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.780
that you don't know and
say, will you sponsor me?

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.310
I mean, that is
not going to work

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.520
because they have
to believe in you.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.509
Because they're taking a risk.

00:43:19.509 --> 00:43:20.800
And they have skin in the game.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:28.140
I think most white male leaders
are not trying to avoid you.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.780
It's just that in
their line of sight

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.110
it's easier to make the
choices that they typically

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.870
have done in the past.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:38.895
Much of it's subliminal.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:52.284
No, not at all, especially,
I think, on this campus.

00:43:52.284 --> 00:43:54.130
AUDIENCE: So what
are those years?

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:56.830
SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: Well, across
the economy, it's 38 to 41.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.580
You've got a big
runway in front of you.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:12.043
[APPLAUSE]
