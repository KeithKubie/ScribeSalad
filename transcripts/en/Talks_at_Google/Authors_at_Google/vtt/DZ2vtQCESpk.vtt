00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.019
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody, welcome to Authors@Google,
I'm please to introduce Garr Reynolds today.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.250
He actually said he was going to do an introduction
of his own, so I'll keep this one really short.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.750
But, Garr is a leading authority on presentation,
design, and delivery.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.630
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: You're reading that. What is
that?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
&gt;&gt; I am; so to cut to the chase. He is the
creator of the Web's most popular blog on

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.339
presentation design, presentation Zen as we
see here. And I did want to talk about it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.570
on a personal note that he's definitely influenced
my sense of design and I probably given this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.570
Website a few more hits by sending all the
people that I work with there and given that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.960
do hundreds of PowerPoint and presently presentation
everyday, I think what he has to say is definitely,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.480
sorely needed and with that I’ll give you
a welcome.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.170
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Oh, thank you very much; I have
my mic, thank you. Give it up ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.830
Katrina Thank you, first of all I do want
to say, thanks to everyone for coming, but

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.220
not just a small thank you but a really big
thank you, because I know you're very, very

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.140
busy and it's also sort of lunch time, so
I'll talk for about 45 minutes, 50 minutes

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.870
or so. And then I’d like a good Q&amp;A as well.
And I have only four books left that I can

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.530
give away free, so if you ask a question you
get a book, right? So that's how we're going

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.960
to do it today. So, a little bit of the self-introduction,
I come from here, originally, well, specifically

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.590
here, which is Oregon in the United States,
anyone from Oregon? Anyone been to Oregon?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.951
Okay, thanks for participating. So, this is
sort of been my life for the past 20 years,

00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:39.070
basically, Hawaii, Oregon, Cupertino, Palo
Alto and Japan and Japan is where I live now.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.200
Anyone been to Japan, anyone from Japan? Nobody
from Japan. So, this is where I live specifically,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.110
if you want to come over later. This is what
it looks like, outside my house. So, you can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.970
see the old and the new, it is a sort of my
environment. This is outside my house as well.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.830
So again, sort of the noise I'm around, I'm
around a lot of noise as well and kind of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.090
learn from that. I used to be a traditional
salary man, you know salary man, right? The

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.990
guy that wears a tie, I haven't worn a tie,
since I left Sumitomo fortunately. And currently,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.860
I'm associate professor of marketing and management
for Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka. I also

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.160
run a design group call Design Matters and
we have--every month we have little Ted-like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.040
presentations. Different designers and business
people come in, do their presentations in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.640
the Apple Store Theater. We're agnostic, because
it doesn't have to be Apple related of course,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.310
but that's something really cool, it's kind
of hard to see on this slides. You can see

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.540
it better on the net, but I still play music.
How many musicians do we have in the audience,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.600
few people? So, I'm actually kind of a jazz
guy and I still play just for fun, now of

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.510
course, even in Starbucks, they don't pay
well but I get lots of coffee. But there's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.959
a relation to this because the art of presentation
to me is very similar to The Art of Jazz.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.520
Are there any Jazz fans here? A few people,
right. And Sir Ken Robinson is a great presenter,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.640
maybe you've heard of him. Anybody heard of
Sir Ken Robinson? I'm just trying to get a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.550
feel for the audience, a few of you know.
He's an expert in creativity, and he's a wonderful

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.520
presenter, he doesn't use slides. He has a
few ideas and he sorts of writes down on a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.989
card and then he knows it. But he says, that
presentation is because there--there's a lot

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.760
improvisation in it, but it's very similar
to jazz and I agree with that. And I want

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.310
to show you something, I don't know if you
know this guy, Bill Strickland. He's an entrepreneur,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.349
a very famous guy; you can see this presentation
on the Ted sit, ted.com. But he actually did

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.850
a presentation talking about, you know, his
story, which is an amazing story. It's a business

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.140
presentation, PowerPoint up here, and then
he got Herbie Hancock on the piano, and Herbie

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.900
is not only into music but as he listens to
Bill, he sorts of adjusting to music, to go

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.850
with that, if it's louder, it's softer. No,
I'm not suggesting that you get, you know,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.510
Herbie Hancock with you for your presentations,
but it's just another example of ways that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.340
you can sort of present different. And you
don't have to present with slides, of course,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.720
that's just what I'm doing here today. But
there are many different ways that we can

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.010
present. More self-introduction, I used to
work here, you know where this is, right?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.260
Cupertino and I have to give presentations
like you. How many of you have to give sort

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.880
stand-up presentations with PowerPoint or
something else quite a bit? So maybe half

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.220
of you, so I had to do that, as you know,
in my job, managing user groups, what the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.010
heck happened? Well, this is very Zen in a
way, I guess. So we're not getting the feed,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.169
oh, I saw myself. So, there I am giving a
presentation, here I am now giving the presentation,

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.920
and this is when I was working at Apple, sometimes
very formal, sometimes quite informal. This

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.790
is a more formal situation. So, many different
kinds of situation that I was out presenting,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.550
and the thing about Apple audiences, maybe
you know, is they're quite demanding, they're

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.690
sort of enthusiastic. They're into the product,
the audiences are very smart, and so you have

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.490
to prepare well, so I work really hard to
prepare, often the night before. Well, you

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.970
got to keep up, you know, learning stuff,
get new information and stay awake, right?

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.460
And work hard to preparing eventually, it
goes into the computer. And then I made presentations,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.440
situations like this, and it was a lot of
fun and I learned a lot. Actually, one of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.910
the reasons I joined Apple; that sort of attracted
me to leave Japan was Steve Job's ability

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.860
to present. That's always been my interest
and I wanted to sort of see how they do it,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.169
how they prepare for the Mac Worlds, he’s
a very inspirational figure, at least for

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.960
me. When he presents internally in the company,
he doesn't use slides of course, but pulls

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.770
up a stool, you know, and just has a conversation
and he is very, very conversational. But when

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.610
I was living in the States, I realized that
presentation was huge, and then if you could

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.740
really master this, it's isn't everything,
it's one thing, but it's one thing that can

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.360
make a big difference in your life, you know,
as a business person. But as I went around

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.330
the U.S., I found actually, that most very
creative, very smart people were not really

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.080
good at giving presentations and a lot of
meetings were pretty boring and it kind of

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.100
felt like we were wasting time. Anyone ever
been in a boring presentation? Raise your

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.220
hands. Few people? Hopefully not today, but
you know, maybe, so you can be blogging this

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.030
right now. This guy sucks, get off the stage.
Okay, why does it matter? Who thinks presentations

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.960
matter? Anyone? It matters, right? It's not
everything, but it's one thing. Now, I look

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.091
at all of you as leaders, now you may not
be a CEO someday, or a vice president or a

00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:29.630
director, but you all are leaders or many
of you want to be a leader of some type. And

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.840
if you're going to be a leader, you have to
be able to tell your story, right? You have

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.120
to be able to communicate. Usually, if you
want to rise, for example, to the level of

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.630
president, you would want to be a great communicator.
Usually, it works out that way, right? Not

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.070
always. Now this--I love jazz, so I like to
quote some jazz guys, the great Art Blakey

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.169
said, "If you're not appearing, you're disappearing."
And it's true within a company too, one way

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.710
to get out there and tell your story is to
volunteer for presentations. Things like I'm

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.560
doing now, and I'm sure internally too you
have many opportunities to do that. And this

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.569
reminds me of the--sort of a mean, maybe you've
heard of this before by Guy Kawasaki. You

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.789
all know Guy Kawasaki, maybe you've heard
of him, but he has this, oh, this is Guy,

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.070
actually, this is in the backyard of his house
in Africa, it's kind of hard to see on this

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.430
screen. But some of you know he has written
about eight books. These are his recent books.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.150
But I think it was in the rules, oh, you can
also see the Guy wrote, if you get the book,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.400
hopefully, you've gotten it free today. He
wrote the foreword, but it's not actually

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.419
written, you'll have to get the book to see
how he did it. But, Guy always says, eat like

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.979
a bird and poop like an elephant. And that’s
sort of my philosophy and that's why I'm here.

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.790
That's the spirit, we call it, the pooping
spirit and that's what I come here today with.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.640
And what does that mean? Well, birds actually,
eat a lot and of course, elephants, you know,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.180
they do their thing, a lot. Well, what does
that mean? It means, to get out there, like

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.530
you're doing consuming information, knowledge,
growing, I mean, Google is great for that,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.560
giving all these great opportunities to expand
yourself and then spread it around, right?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.301
Give it away. And it's infectious, and it
changes the world, right? So, I think that

00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:04.360
sort of a good means, so remember that, right?
Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant, makes

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.070
the world a better place. And that's why I'm
here today. So, why does it matter? It matters

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.120
I think to all of us because, it all matters,
right? The little things matter and that sometimes

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.440
the difference between winning and losing,
it certainly it isn't sports at the highest

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.099
level and in business, right? What's the difference?
Often in those very, very small details, right?

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:27.539
The competition is great, that's why we call
them competition. So, presentation isn't everything,

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:33.159
but it's one way that we can make a big difference.
Here's an example; oh, can you think, I should

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:37.459
ask you, can you think of an example, someone
famous who was not known for presenting well,

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:42.529
and he had a story and then he learned how
to present better and then suddenly the same

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:46.619
story he has been telling for many years,
kind of took hold, can you think of anyone?

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:52.179
&gt;&gt; Al Gore
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: What? Brilliant, it's like I've

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:57.639
known you my whole life. So, yeah, Al Gore
is my example. You all know him of course,

00:08:57.639 --> 00:09:00.819
and you know him from this movie and many
of you have--maybe have seen this, he sort

00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:06.019
of presents this way, no bullet points, he
said, somewhat technical topic but to non-technical

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:11.319
audience, to the sort of a lay audience, right?
But his front and center, you know, simple

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:16.040
graphics behind him, but he's in the front,
telling the story. But this the Al Gore of,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.290
oh, remember this guy, do you remember that
phone, by the way? Not that long ago, but

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.389
what were some of the things we said about
Al Gore in those days. He's a nice guy, all

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:31.379
of that, but you might have said, stiff, robot-like,
whatever, no one said, what a great presenter

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:37.089
that guy is. I can't wait to hear him speak.
But, you know, he sort of reinvented himself,

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:40.279
I guess, but he didn't learn a new story,
it's the same story he's been telling for

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:44.290
a long time. What he did though, is he got
together with Duarte Design. How many people

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.300
know Duarte? Probably the biggest design firm
when it comes to presentation anywhere, certainly

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.129
in the valley. They're just across the road
here; this is what their office looks like.

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:57.639
Started by Nancy and Mark Duarte, they have
about 60 employees now. I don't work for them,

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.939
this is not a commercial. But if you have
any serious kind of presentations you want

00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:06.410
to do, go see these guys, they do the stuff
for Apple, HP, Cisco, all those guys and they're

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.259
great. So they help him sort of do it this
way, right? And before-after they’re very,

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:14.290
very effective, if you're using visuals. So
that's why, that's one of the techniques they

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.579
used, before and after, now and then and that
sort of helps. You get it instantly; you can

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:24.699
focus on the presenter, in this case Al and
his message. And of course, he really benefited

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:29.420
from that, right? Sort of becoming--the same
message becoming a better presenter, he won

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.899
an Oscar, Nobel Peace Prize and they were
even clamoring for him to run for president,

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:38.579
months ago, right? So, I'm not saying that
could have the same effect on you, but it's

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:43.100
just one example, how presenting differently
can make a difference. Do you think people

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:50.600
would be saying the same thing about Al, if
he presented it this way? I wonder. Right

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:57.319
or how about this? If he's talking about,
you know, Antarctica, maybe it's more simple--simpler

00:10:57.319 --> 00:11:02.389
to talk about it this way and then concentrate
on the data and the content, the visuals don't

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:07.009
get lost that way. So, the point is, if your
ideas matter, we know presentation matters,

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:12.049
right? Presentation matters, communication
matters, everyone knows that. But we have

00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:17.939
a problem don't we? Do you know this problem?
Have you ever experienced this problem? How

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:21.910
many people here have experienced "Death by
PowerPoint?" Anyone, here? So, you know the

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.809
pain, and I'd like to hear, these are actual
slides, from actual presentations, from actual

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:30.670
very, very smart people, it has nothing to
do with intelligence. Have you ever been in

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.040
this sort of situation? One slide after another,
you're daydreaming, I wonder what free food

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:43.350
I can get today, right? So this is the chance
when I ask you, if we have more time we could

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.999
break up into groups and all of that. But
just shout out your experience, think about

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:51.730
like, the worst presentation you've ever seen,
and that might be more than one, right? But,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.709
why? And you can just shout it out; I don't
know if we have to send the mic around, but…

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.180
&gt;&gt; If you repeat it.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: I'll repeat what you said. So,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.490
think about the bad ones, can you give an
example? And it could be like, the slides,

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:08.119
the text; the length, whatever, whatever.
&gt;&gt; I was going to say a dense slide where

00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:09.535
the presenter really just reads line by line,
exactly.

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:13.309
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Just reading slide, have you
seen that? Is that common? It's still common,

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:17.749
reading slides? People are saying yes. Thank
you, sir. Anyone else?

00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:24.060
&gt;&gt; This is more of an overall bad problem,
the person had a set of slides, decided the

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:31.270
night before it to completely change though,
and then here he's walking through the presentation,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.270
decided to go back to his original presentation
without changing the slides.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.299
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Okay, so that just had the wrong
slides up there, right?

00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:35.779
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: That's not a very elegant solution

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:38.939
is it? Okay, thank you, what else? We're talking
about bad ones you've seen.

00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:44.189
&gt;&gt; Sort of two presentations, the one is on
a slide and the other one is in the voice

00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:46.006
and they sort of don't connect, so you're
not sure which one to follow.

00:12:46.006 --> 00:12:48.739
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Oh, so the slides don't jive
to what he's talking about, if he's talking…

00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:51.259
I see, yeah, that's a good point. You, what
else?

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:54.529
&gt;&gt; Does he enough Ross Perot’s running mate
in ‘96.

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:58.429
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Wait, who was that? Ross Perot’s
running mate in 90...?

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:02.049
&gt;&gt; Edward Stockdale.
&gt;&gt; It was so bad, he just mumbled and....

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.049
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right, gridlock, is that the
gridlock guy?

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:09.499
&gt;&gt; What am I doing here?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Okay, that’s right. So being

00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:14.790
coherent is important in a presentation is
what you're saying. A given, but thank you,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.880
yeah, thanks. What else? Bad ones you've seen
and the bad ones that you think are not just

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.730
a special case but rather a sort of endemic,
anything else?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.399
&gt;&gt; Poor pacing.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Poor pacing, too fast, too slow,

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.209
right? Okay. How about the good ones you've
seen? Have you seen some really great presentations?

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.550
Complete silence
&gt;&gt; Edward Tufte

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.889
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Edward Tufte.
&gt;&gt; Probably interactive and engaging.

00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:39.549
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right, interactive and engaging.
Right, yeah, I've seen Tufte, I really love--I'm

00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:46.669
a big fan of Edward Tufte.
&gt;&gt; 

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:47.669
Guy Kawasaki. Every time I heard him, he's
so funny.

00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:50.619
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Guy Kawasaki, so, he you know,
in his case, he's funny. He doesn't appeal

00:13:50.619 --> 00:13:54.829
to everyone perhaps, but that's a thing about
humor, I think he's funny, but he gets--he's

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:58.569
not boring, no matter what you think, right?
He gets people involved, he gets people engaged.

00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:02.149
&gt;&gt; He's also very conversational.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Conversational, right.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:07.052
&gt;&gt; It's a bit mellow but Peter Norvig's PowerPoint
version of the Gettysburg Address.

00:14:07.052 --> 00:14:10.639
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Oh yeah, the Gettysburg Address
PowerPoint. You can see that, just Google

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:12.239
it. You can find it.
&gt;&gt; He works here.

00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:14.790
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Oh, he does. Okay, yeah, that's
a great one. Right.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.920
&gt;&gt; You're doing all right. You got humor.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Humor is good, I mean, if people

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.269
are laughing, they're listening. You can learn
a lot actually from comedians. Anyone here

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:27.530
like stand-up comedians, standup comedy? It
is so hard, I mean, I could never do that.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.629
Can you imagine trying to have to make people
laugh? Try to evoke emotions, but that's what

00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:36.299
we're trying to do, if you're a CEO on stage,
you still--it's the content of course, but

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:40.980
you also can't forget the emotional side of
it well, as well. So we want clarity when

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.369
we go to a presentation and we want meaning
and we want great content, we want those things.

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:50.749
But what we usually get as some of you alluded
to, we get boredom and confusion and some

00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:55.120
of you said, you feel like you waste time
sometimes, in meetings or presentations. So

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.279
I felt, I want like sort of go on a mission,
to stop bad PowerPoint and it's not the tool,

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:04.350
I mean, PowerPoint. PowerPoint is like Kleenex,
it's just a name, it just means, presentation

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.449
with some sort of multimedia. So, what could
I do? So, I still go out and give a lot of

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:12.559
free presentations, wherever I can and lot
of business people and technical people as

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:17.330
well that try to get them to think differently
about presentations. There are no panaceas,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.699
there are--each case is very, very different.
As we say in Japanese, [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN

00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:26.839
LANGUAGE] case by case, right? Each case is
a very, very different. But if we think differently

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:31.850
about it, I think it can improve things. So,
why me? So I should tell you a little bit

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.929
about the Genesis of the presentation Zen,
sort of idea. Not this Genesis by the way,

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:41.019
but different Genesis, it is related to music
though, because I'm a jazz guy, those [INDISTINCT]

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:47.449
over here, right there on the drums, so I
still play in a band, but just sort of--just

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:53.870
fun. I started playing in night clubs when
I was 17, so this is me at 17, and I did something

00:15:53.870 --> 00:16:00.149
else at 17. I made my first multimedia presentation
with some--do you remember these things? Some

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:04.420
of you probably kind of what the heck is that?
Some sort of UFO contraption, and these are

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:10.850
called slides. Thirty-five millimeters slides
and you could really make great presentations.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.399
There's--you have two carousels, beautiful
transitions, very high resolution, you have

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:20.139
a cassette tape with audio, and a silent pulse,
so it's just, beautiful stuff. It just took

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:24.730
a long time to do it, but the end result was
great and that was my first experience. This

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.839
is before computers, that you know, this is
how old I am, right? This is back in high

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:34.249
school days. So that was my first experience
of doing sort of what we do today, of having

00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:40.339
visuals and then story telling with your voice,
maybe with some sound, and of course, strong

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:45.040
visuals. Not lots of words, we never thought
to put bullet points in the slide, at least

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.439
when I was a kid, back then. So, those are
35 millimeters slides. But, what I found since

00:16:50.439 --> 00:16:54.720
then is what you found too is that a lot of
presentations sort of go like this, right?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.049
Even though, the inventors of PowerPoint really
never designed it to be used this way. How

00:17:00.049 --> 00:17:04.360
many of you know Seth Godin? A few of you
know? Yeah, he has got a lot of great books

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.319
out there, this is his latest book which I
highly recommend, but there's a slide he did

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:13.610
many, many years ago, and he talks about spreading
ideas and that's what we're trying to do or

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.439
I'm trying to do with presenting this sort
of differently. And he says, the more people

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:21.240
that know your idea the more powerful it becomes,
right? So, that's why you--we just give it

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.480
away and try to spread the virus and that’s
sort of what I'm trying to do. So I made a

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.730
Website about four years ago, and put a lot
of information about presenting differently,

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.299
but the thing is about Websites, is they're
pretty static, I found. Yeah, you go to a

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:36.990
lot of work to make one and then, you know,
people come, they come two or three times,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.399
but they never come back, neither way to do
a conversation. So, I was kind of late to

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:45.590
the game, but about three and a half years
ago, I started the blog and then it just turned

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.610
into this big thing and allowed me to have
a conversation with people. This is the Presentation

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:54.559
Zen blog; then it became a book. But you might
be saying, what is Presentation Zen? What

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:59.259
is Zen, you know; got to do with it, right?
Zen means different thing. You know, in Japan,

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:03.559
we don't even talk about Zen, Zen is really
very Japanese, it's at the heart of Japanese

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:07.590
cultures in many ways, but we don't verbalize
it, that’s sort of a more Western thing

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.730
to talk about it. But it means many things
to different people, but to me, I'm talking

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.529
about Zen in terms of simplicity, right? But
simplicity ain't easy. Actually, simplicity

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:23.179
is very hard. Google is extremely simple for
me to use, it's unbelievably great and simple.

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:26.919
But of course, it's a very, very complex to
get to that level of simplicity for people

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:32.460
like me to use, right? And of course, Da Vinci
said it many years ago. So my idea of Zen,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.880
what I talk about Zen in the book, is Restraint,
Simplicity and Naturalness, right? So restraint

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.130
in preparation, you can't do everything. You
have an hour, you have 20 minutes, whatever

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.520
it is, you can't do everything, so you have
to cut some parts and let that go and focus

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.390
on what's important. And then simplicity in
design, simplicity means many things, it means,

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.039
subtraction often more than addition, but
it means many different kinds of things when

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:59.500
it comes to design and then, naturalness in
delivery. Conversationally, you mentioned

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.200
Guy Kawasaki, and others, Steve Job is great
at that. I've seen Dr. Smith present, only

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.990
a few times, but what I've seen, he seems
great, very, very natural. I think I have

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.639
a picture of him coming up later. But how
would you finish this sentence. This is Dr.

00:19:12.639 --> 00:19:18.091
Kawana, who passed away about 15 years ago,
but he's an architect of Zen gardens or tea

00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:22.600
gardens. And how would you finish this sentence,
what does it mean to you? Simplicity means

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.380
what to you?
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't finish the sentence, that’s

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.259
simplicity.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: That's good, simplicity means

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:36.080
beautiful. Perfect, what else? If you are
to finish the sentence.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.249
&gt;&gt; Effortless.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Effortless.

00:19:38.249 --> 00:19:43.809
&gt;&gt; Clear.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Clear, clarity, what else?

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:45.970
&gt;&gt; Minimal.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Minimal.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.940
&gt;&gt; Core.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Core, good one. That's in the

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.279
book a little bit too as well. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Real.

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:54.532
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Real.
&gt;&gt; Easy to grasp and understand.

00:19:54.532 --> 00:19:58.600
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Easy to grasp, real, yeah. This
is how he finished the sentence, right? Maximum

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.899
effect with minimum means, I mean, that sort
of a good--sort of a good mantra. How can

00:20:02.899 --> 00:20:07.679
I get maximum effect with a minimum of effort,
that doesn't mean, laziness. But I mean, you

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:11.470
know, minimum of means, sometimes that means,
a minimum of money, you know, whatever it

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.700
is, right? So a little bit about my influences,
because the kind of things I talked about

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.700
my influences, because the kind of things
that I talked about don't necessarily save

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.410
time and not conventional perhaps, but I come
sort of from a different place for the past

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:27.649
20 years or so, except when I worked at Apple
and when I was in Hawaii for awhile in Grad

00:20:27.649 --> 00:20:31.240
School. You know, I've been in Asia, right?
So, I live in Japan, this is where I live,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.929
this is my environment. It's a very, very
urban environment, I live in an urban environment

00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:41.450
but also the countryside, where there's a
lot of simplicity and a lot of beauty of the

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.879
Shinto or Fudo, anyone been on a Japanese
bath, right? You can just see design everywhere,

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:50.980
right? In a tea ceremony or Sado, Ikebana,
Sumi-e, of course, the Zen gardens; there's

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.779
all sort of place you can see design. Living
in such a crazy urban center like this, this

00:20:55.779 --> 00:21:01.450
is in Tokyo, but look at the design, everywhere,
right? Even here, you can learn how a full

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.799
bleed photo bleeding off makes things and
since they're trying to make it look big,

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:10.570
it's big; dynamic text contrast. You can see
design concepts everywhere, if you open your

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.879
eyes. So, when I'm waiting for the train,
even, I see slides everywhere. And I noticed,

00:21:14.879 --> 00:21:19.231
"Well, that might be a good slide. Well, that
might be a good slide." And I just--I'm always

00:21:19.231 --> 00:21:23.789
thinking in these terms, right, or this is
just a poster in the window of a department

00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:28.600
store. Hmm, might be a good slide, right,
if I'm talking about this meal. You can see

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.870
really crazy kind of things too. Do you know
this product, they don't call it this in the

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:39.039
States, you know, this one. Say that--say
that three times fast, McWrap, McWrap, McWrap,

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:45.840
right, not a good choice for a name. Fortunately,
this is in Japan, so it doesn't carry over.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.669
And then graphically, if you just remove the
M and the W, which is sort of mere images

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:55.600
of each other. Anyway, I hope McDonalds doesn't
sue me. But you can see it, you can see it

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.049
everywhere. A Nike sign across from the Apple
store, very simple, a few words, and the graphic.

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:04.570
And again, this is just a one way, especially;
this lens has helped the marketing, for example.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:09.529
But whatever you are doing, you can keep things
simpler. Just walking in an--this is near

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:14.570
Obama, seriously, this is a place called Obama,
Japan. This place--and I'm going to see Obama

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:20.409
next week, not the presidential candidate
but the town. This is near there. And even

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:25.520
just walking around here with my wife; it's
cold, and so, we had some tea, two glasses

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.830
or two cups of Ocha and just the way the cakes
are presented, and the flower, and it's not

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.549
big deal. This is not a fancy place. It's
just a regular kind of tea shop on the street.

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:39.039
And you can kind of see symmetry of balance
and all this kind of stuff. So, if you open

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:44.149
your eyes, it's everywhere. Having dinner
for example, some raw fish on the ice because

00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:48.629
there's snow all around us, right? This--this
right here is going to be boiled, so--that's

00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:52.840
water, right? It has a little like candle
thing underneath it. But, so the function

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.120
is, if you put water in, it would be hard
for the waitress who is on kimono to carry.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.039
So, as a solid, it's really good, so it has
a function but it's also beautiful because

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:05.530
this beautiful sphere, which is like a snowball,
right? And I'm explaining all of these to

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:11.000
my wife who is a professional designer, and
she thinks I'm nuts, right. If you have ever

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.399
been married you know what I'm talking about,
so, okay. But the point is--the point is the

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:19.860
lessons are all around us, if we open our
eyes. And the first chapter of the book, I

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.549
talk about Obento. How many people eat Obentos.
Sometimes Obentos are popular, very healthy.

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:31.880
And I sort of use that as an analogy. Obento,
beautifully, simply packaged, right, all the

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.470
content is delicious and nutritious and it's
just enough. How much? Not too much. Not too

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:43.590
little. And it's designed beautifully but
nothing goes to waste, right? It's just all

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.669
right there, and I thought, "Why can't presentations
be like that?" Right, nothing superfluous,

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:52.889
everything has a reason and beauty matters
but it's also the content, especially the

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:59.009
content that matters. So, design is all around.
But remember, you don't have to use slides,

00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:04.879
of course. But if you do use slides, you want
to avoid something like this, actual presentation

00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:10.129
in Tokyo. Have you ever seen something like
this? No? Really? This is the actual thing,

00:24:10.129 --> 00:24:13.429
and so you have to be wondering, "Why not
jus send an attachment? Why not--if we're

00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:15.549
just going to read, send the document, cancel
the meeting."

00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:19.100
&gt;&gt; Is there a meeting from the slide?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Yes, yeah, I know. So, you see,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.559
it seems unbelievable. God bless them. And
a very, very smart guy, I'm sure. This guy,

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:31.990
you know, so we'll move on. So we know the
current approach to presenting isn't working.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.529
So, what's the solution? I mean, you have
many ideas and each case is different. There

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:41.899
are no panaceas as I said. But we often don't
think of creativity when it comes to presenting

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:46.240
like our really important presentations often
because we don't have time. But if we're talking

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.159
about simplicity, simplicity sort of needs
creativity to get to that. And again, quoting

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:56.130
the great, the great Charles Mingus, the late
Charles Mingus, as he says, making the simple

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:02.320
complicated is commonplace, but making the
complicated awesomely simple, man, that takes

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.039
creativity. That's hard to do. Anyone can
be complicated, and noisy, and messy, it's

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:11.889
hard to make things simple and clear. So some
of you, it seems most of you didn't know about

00:25:11.889 --> 00:25:16.940
it this, as popular as this. So, most of the
world doesn't know about Ted, but Katrina,

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.609
would you say this is pretty cool?
&gt;&gt; KATRINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:21.909
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: There's so many great lessons
to learn here for free. You can download it,

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:25.789
put it on your iPod or whatever. There's some
great presentations. I'll show you a clip

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:31.370
of one. Ted.com and you'll see some amazing
talks. To go to the conference, it's sort

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.710
of an invitation only, really hard to get
to, $6,000 to a $10,000 for three days is

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.340
so. But what's great about them is they record
everything, with three cameras. They do a

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.340
really good job, and then they just put it
on online. Throughout the year, you'll get

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.720
to see the presentations. So this is what
their Website looks like in the past. Sir

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.009
Ken Robinson is one of the people who has
a great presentation. I highly recommend you

00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:56.309
go see this one. But he was talking about
creativity and saying that, you know, he's

00:25:56.309 --> 00:26:00.380
talking about children and how, you know,
with children, they're not afraid to make

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.970
mistakes. And he's not saying that making
a mistake is the same thing as being creative,

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:08.499
but as he says that if you're not willing
to be wrong, if you're not willing to make

00:26:08.499 --> 00:26:11.700
mistakes, you can never, never be creative.
And, of course, you guys get that, you guys

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.799
get that at Google. But this is a lesson that
we sort of have to remind people of. We have

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:21.100
to remind them of the child's mind or the
beginner's mind. You know, in Japan, in the

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.179
elementary schools, if you were teaching and
you ask the student or ask the class, "Who

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:29.259
knows the answer?" All the hands would go
up, right. So, you choose one. "Kenji, what's

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:34.770
the answer?" "I don't know." See. "Why did
you raise your hand?" "I'm involved." But

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:40.880
then, if you've been to Japan, you know what
I'm talking about. But then junior high and

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.100
high school and exam pressure and it's all
about the exam, then we're afraid to make

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.690
mistakes. We don't reward mistakes, we punish
mistakes. That's why you haven't seen a lot

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.880
of entrepreneurism in Japan until recently.
Recently, there's a lot more, since the bubble,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.570
you know, broke 10 years ago, you see more.
But being an entrepreneur is risky. You have

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.950
to take a chance. So, you know, this is a
sort of a good mantra and maybe you’ve heard

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.999
this quote before the--in the beginner's mind,
there are many possibilities, but in the expert's

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:12.070
mind there are few. So we are all experts.
You are an expert. But what this means is

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:16.659
to, although, you are an expert, to think
sometimes like a child, the creativity of

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:21.960
a child that to look for a different angles
and not be afraid to make mistakes. This is

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.119
a picture I keep on my desk. She's a friend's
daughter, just reminds me. A live bird, she

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:31.279
walks around with--that's inspiring to me.
You know, you're not supposed to do that.

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:36.409
Why not? All right, children aren't afraid
to make mistakes. So with the time that we

00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:42.150
have left, I have some tips. I mean we could
talk all day about different tips but I want

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.490
to hear, you know, from you as well. So I
have just a few things, broke it down in terms

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:51.280
of three. So a little bit about how to prepare
and then some--talk about design a little

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.740
bit and delivery. So when it comes to preparation,
when I say and what I say in the book is it

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.769
at first you have to step back and find some
alone time. And you might, there might be

00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:06.060
other people around but somehow you've got
to give yourself in a different space so that

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.529
you can focus on what's important and what's
not, rather than jumping right into the software.

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:15.480
Because when you do this, then you can ask
yourself, you know, the "so what" or as we

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.929
say in Japanese [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
Well, what does this mean? It isn't just a

00:28:18.929 --> 00:28:22.799
what, the content is important. Obviously,
that's what it's about. But it's also the

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:26.360
so what. What does this mean? What are we
going to do with this information or knowledge,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.570
right? And this is the time when you really
focus on this idea of inclusion and exclusion.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.920
What do we keep? What do we remove for now?
And that's a very sort of Zen idea too. This

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.309
is a great book I recommend, "The Zen of Creativity."
All right, make a choice about what's important

00:28:41.309 --> 00:28:46.759
and then let go of the rest. You have to let
go, for now, right, in a presentation. Or

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:50.150
sometimes just when you're building software
of whatever it is. You have to let go of that

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:54.460
so that you can focus on what's important.
And it’s related to jazz too, as Dizzy says,

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.190
right, "It's taken me all my life to learn
what not to play." Sometimes it's not just

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:04.240
the notes, it's the notes that you avoid,
right? And that's what story is about as well,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.779
right. I mean, stories cannot be so long and
it can't be so complicated that people don't

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:11.980
get the heart of it, they don't get the meaning.
So there are two books I recommend. This is

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.820
the first one. How many people have this book,
"Made to Stick" by the Heath brothers. You

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.669
also get this, so buy a 100 of them and give
them away or have these guys in, get the Heath

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:26.440
brothers or one of them in here, Chip or Dan
which one is in Stanford. Great book. Just

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:32.410
amazing stuff about how to tell sticky stories
or sticky messages, right, it could be advertising.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.059
It could be presentation. It could be leadership.
It could be anything. And they have six key

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:39.820
principles that they go through, so I'll share
them with you now, maybe you can save money

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.559
on the book. But the six key principles, the
essence of the book is that all key messages

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:51.929
have simplicity; unexpectedness; concreteness,
not just abstraction but also something very,

00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:56.749
very concrete; credibility, you guys have
that instantly, right, if you're presenting

00:29:56.749 --> 00:30:01.159
outside. I mean, Google, one of the greatest
companies on the planet. So that's a lot of

00:30:01.159 --> 00:30:05.960
credibility right there. Emotion; and you
talked about that with Guy and some others,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.330
you got to have emotion in it, right. Emotion
isn't everything but it's a necessary thing.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:16.570
We're presenting to human beings after all.
Story, again, right. So simplicity, unexpectedness,

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:23.129
concreteness, credibility--which you have
loads of--emotion, and story. So I have an

00:30:23.129 --> 00:30:29.360
example here, this is a presentation. It's
18 minutes, best one I've seen in years. This

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.809
is the best presentation at Ted this year,
people are saying, Ben Sanders is the other

00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:39.590
one. She's a--Dr. Taylor is brain scientist
who had a stroke many years ago. Now, it took

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:44.639
her eight years to recover. A pretty, you
know, a very bad stroke. And as a brain scientist

00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:47.639
she learned a lot from that. But this is just
something. I won't show you the whole thing,

00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:52.139
but just this clip. She had slides, not too
many, but the visuals are very simple, about

00:30:52.139 --> 00:30:56.590
the brain and all that. The slides helped.
She was very engaging, very emotional, and

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.249
this is something very visual. Let's watch
this.

00:30:58.249 --> 00:31:03.470
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR: If you've ever seen a human brain,
it's obvious that the two hemispheres are

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:08.099
completely separate from one another. And
I have brought for you a real human brain.

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:17.119
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Listen to the crowd.
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR: Thank you.

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:22.779
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR: So this is a real human brain.

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:27.730
This is the front of the brain, the back of
the brain with the spinal cord hanging down,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:33.470
and this is how it would be positioned inside
of my head. And when you look at the brain,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:38.869
it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices
are completely separate from one another.

00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:45.070
For those of you who understand computers,
our right hemisphere functions like a parallel

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.520
processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.320
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Okay. You get the idea. And then
so she has that as a powerful visual. She

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.179
also has slides, and then she has the visuals
that she creates through her narrative. So

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:05.730
out of these, these elements--her presentation
has all of these. It's very, very sticky and

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.419
people are talking about it. I'm talking about
it. And certainly having a real brain, pulling

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:13.470
that--I thought it was going to be a plastic
one because I've seen Dan Pink do that with

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:17.460
the brain and it's a plastic one and he dropped
it, and ooh, but that's okay because it's

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.009
sort of comedy at that point. But when it’s
a real brain, so you saw the audience go,

00:32:21.009 --> 00:32:26.481
"Yeah, a plastic brain," real brain. That's
unexpected, right? And that's just one example

00:32:26.481 --> 00:32:29.929
of sticky. This is the other one. How many
people have read "A Whole New Mind?" Okay,

00:32:29.929 --> 00:32:34.769
so order a hundreds of these and just spread
them out. Great, great book about how the

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:40.000
world's changed and creativity, Dan Pink is
the author of two best-sellers. This is his

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.970
second one. But as he says too, six key things
he talks about, six key aptitudes that we

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:50.629
all need to be successful moving forward.
It is the--one of them is the ability to tell

00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:54.679
a story, to understand design, to do design,
but story. Again, it's right there, right.

00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:59.460
We are storytellers. But when you're preparing
you presentation and we talked a little bit

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.350
about this, don't start at the computer. I
know there are many books and Microsoft will

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.210
tell you, it's sort of just common start.
I have a presentation tomorrow. Open the computer,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:14.379
let me jot down some ideas. But as you know,
that, you know, the development of the iPod

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:19.279
or software or anything at first, you don't
develop it right at the computer. You come

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:23.850
to a meeting; you have whiteboards or paper,
sticky notes, whatever. It's really, really

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:28.909
useful to get a way and plan analog. Even
my book--I planned analog in Hawaii. Sorry

00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:32.649
about the shorts that's kind of--but I was
on the beach in that. But even the book, which

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:36.529
is, you know, I designed it, an in design,
it written word tram. It’s a very digital

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:41.139
sort of experience, of course. But the plan,
you know, was very messy and very analog at

00:33:41.139 --> 00:33:46.850
first. And then that helps clarify everything
and with presentations too, right? I do it

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.929
this way. You may have your own method. This
is after the brainstorming when you identify

00:33:50.929 --> 00:33:55.529
the core. Someone said the core. So I have
a core of what's important. If people can

00:33:55.529 --> 00:34:00.669
remember only one thing and you're lucky if
they do, if it's a long presentation. And

00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:05.070
then usually three's; three is a good number.
Three or four, my drama is often three. But

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.580
what is it that you really want to say. You
can't say everything. And sometimes you don't

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.700
have to go to this link but some people prefer
to actually at least have some with the slides

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.780
down as their sort of brainstorming. Printing
out the slides and writing them down here,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.619
at least the beginning parts. And you could
see how--well, then we can make slides from

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:26.069
this quite easily. Once we have it down in
an analog world. And when you do a sort of

00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:30.580
analog, then if the computer breaks, or blows
up, or whatever, it doesn't matter. You can

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.690
just go on. You know your story. And if you're
pitching for it, you know, venture capital

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.270
and you have 20 minutes and your computer
freezes, you can't say, "Excuse me. Let me

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.059
reboot this." It'd be all over, so you just--it'd
be your reaction though, it could really win

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:47.579
you points. Computers freeze, we know that.
It could happen. So you just say, "It doesn't

00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:51.760
matter. Here's my story, here's what I want
to tell you." And if you did that in the analog

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.790
phase, then you would really know your story,
right? But you might be saying that this guy

00:34:55.790 --> 00:35:00.620
is nuts. This takes a lot of time, what he’s
talking about. I'm just saying you have to

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.790
find the time. Somehow, you got to find the
time. Probably, we could find more time by

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.359
canceling a lot of presentations, right, and
just have a discussion or a meeting or a talk,

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:16.109
whatever, or send an attachment, read this,
check the box, whatever. Then, we'd have more

00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:19.411
time to focus on the presentations that are
important in front of the customers or whatever

00:35:19.411 --> 00:35:24.070
it is, right. So that's a little bit about
the prep. So to take away is just experiment

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.799
with the idea of closing the computer and
going some place else with some paper and

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:33.780
a pen. So when it comes to visual simplicity,
we're talking about it easy slides. If I say

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:39.280
Zen aesthetic which we never talk about in
the context of slides, but why not, we often

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.710
talk about it. And now in the context of web
design, why not? We can learn from many different

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.829
places. So what comes to mind when you hear
Zen aesthetic? These are the--like, and relating

00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:52.830
this to something like slides or Websites.
&gt;&gt; It would be like natural materials.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.020
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Natural--right, very natural.
Like the wappy-sappy stuff, imperfection.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.440
&gt;&gt; White space.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: White space or empty space, yes,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.830
hallelujah. Empty space; and Google is great
at that, isn't it? I won't say--there are

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.650
other search engines, but I--of course, I
love Google. I just love the empty space,

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.380
you know, that's refreshing and, of course,
everyone talks about that. What else?

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.869
&gt;&gt; Exact placement of developments.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Exact placement or careful, purposeful,

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:23.150
placement, that’s not accidental or random
but there's a reason. Yeah, like a Zen garden

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:30.040
or ikebana. To the untrained guy, it's just,
done. But it takes years and years of training

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:36.480
to do that. Thank you. What else? What comes
to mind?

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.890
&gt;&gt; Presence.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Presence and being in the moment,

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.119
yeah. But all of these things you thought
about before, right? Simplicity, clarity,

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:47.260
unclutteredness; certainly that relates to
Web design, it's hard to do. It's very easy

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:51.630
to add on more things. So, design is important
but I don't think this is design. This is

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.890
great. I love birthday cakes and Christmas
trees, but I tend to think a bit more as sort

00:36:54.890 --> 00:37:00.010
of decoration which is also good, but that
sort of on top. Design is more soul deep.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:04.920
You really fill a lot of thought into it and,
you know, and a long effort into what it's

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.480
going to look like. But you might say, "I'm
not a designer," as a business person. But

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.780
people like Tom Peters say, tough, you are
a designer. We're all designers in a sense,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.099
maybe small deal. We need to be more design
mindful. Learn about design so that we can

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:24.020
better work with actual designers, right,
and it's all design. So we know design matters,

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.640
but a lot of presentations look something
like this, this is fake latent. But have you

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.490
ever seen a presentation like this, coming
in? Seriously, still today, right? And it's

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.960
very therapeutic. If you can't sleep, just
put this on. Ya-da-da put a footer for some

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.310
reason which no one can possibly read and
a Website and page number although it's not

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.839
a book, and some clip art if you order something
that you can--because, you know what, there's

00:37:46.839 --> 00:37:53.210
empty space and you want to fill that, because
we can. So, you know the rule; the rule is,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:58.770
of course, the 1-7-7 rule that all the books--most
of the books talk about. One concept, one

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.250
idea per slide, seven lines of text, and seven
words per line. But the problem is that's

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:08.230
what this is. This follows that rule. So could
you imagine today, you're may be sleepy now,

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:11.869
but could you imagine if all my slides look
like this, it repeated basically what I was

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:17.839
saying. Design is important, Google is great
at design. Could you imagine? You would all

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:22.440
be asleep, right? So never read your slides.
I had a great video from Guy Kawasaki, but

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.180
I cut it out, where he says, "If you read
slides, the audience is going to quickly figure

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:33.010
out that you're a bozo." All right? So--but
that's Guy. But what he means is, if you don't--if

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.930
you're reading your slides it’s because
you don't know your material, you don't need

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:40.160
lots of stuff up there and he’s seen more
presentations, more bad presentations than

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.480
about anyone, right? He's--I mean, people
are pitching to him all the time. So don't

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:49.720
read your slide. This is something from a
year and a half ago, I guess, the last Macworld

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.609
in '07. And so I--this is something I compiled
and put on my blog talking about this guy.

00:38:54.609 --> 00:38:58.220
I don't like to say bad things about people,
so I won't mention names. But the top three

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:03.170
guys did a really good, the middle two only
had, like, three minutes on stage. So we don't

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:08.130
need a long history of anything, just come
up very energetic, really great. And the third

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:15.069
or the fourth person down here was reading
cards. And, you know, he was reading cards.

00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:18.420
And it's just--you could see people--actually,
a lot of people were live blogging at the

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.690
time and they were saying, "Who is this guy?
Total snooze fest," all the stuff. You just

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.770
can't read notes. You don't need that. If
you know your story, you shouldn't need that.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.260
And of course, two guys in the middle did
a great job with that. Only three minutes,

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.820
they knew what they wanted to say. That guy
on top also knew what he wanted to say. He

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.349
had props but he didn't have bullet points
to remind them. He knew the history, right?

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:42.200
So, don't do this. We know that, right? We
can't do something like that. So here's an

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.119
idea. Go back to your office this afternoon,
find an old presentation. Maybe it looks like

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:50.760
this, you have the notes view, a bunch of
bullet points up there. Remove those, put

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.380
them down in notes view where no one can see
them and maybe you make six slides now because

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.740
there were six key points. And then you can
put one key thing up there and maybe one visual

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:05.240
that--it's not decoration but that somehow
supports the point. Then the audience sees

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.020
something very simple, all right? And then
you have your notes if you want them. You

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.890
can print them out for practicing, but you
can keep it very, very simple. Well, the audience

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.880
see it's simple because they're listening
to you and you're talking to them, right?

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.530
So what about images? Where do you get them?
How many people know iStockphoto? iStockphoto.com.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:26.760
Actually, if you get the book, you can get
$150 worth of credits in a sense. In other

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.589
words, you can get ten free high risk photos
that appear in this book. So it's just a little

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:36.260
thing to add value. Well, I really love these
guys. And they've been a big supporter of

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.799
me for many years. So words and image, this
you--have you ever seen a slide like this,

00:40:41.799 --> 00:40:45.299
this is something going through some very
simple data, actually, just on obesity rates

00:40:45.299 --> 00:40:50.410
across about 30 countries or so. So this would
not be a very good slide. It wouldn't be a

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:54.920
very good handout either. But the data is
interesting, so instead of doing it this way,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.619
I don't want to tell you all about this, and
so, I put that in a handout to compare other

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:03.490
countries. I just want to talk about Japan
and this would be the USA for example. So

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.910
I don't want to do the whole thing. I just
want to focus on what's important, or it might

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:11.460
be something like this, right? Or perhaps
something like this. Again, it’s the same

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.839
stuff I'm talking about. But it's a more visceral,
more visual way. But in the hand-out, I give

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:21.560
all the details and I may even pass the handout
during Q&amp;A or maybe even now so that you can

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:28.119
refer to that later during the Q&amp;A. This is--one
in Hara Hachi bu. Anyone know Hara Hachi bu?

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:31.859
If I was going to talk about it, if I had
a slide like this to introduce the idea, you're

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:36.200
already reading ahead so you're already getting
there, right? So what would I do with that

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.799
way? So this is not uncommon and then the
Website there which you could never possibly

00:41:40.799 --> 00:41:44.660
write down. But this is my handout, right?
Except, this is not a very good handout, there's

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.620
not much information there. So, instead, I
might do something like this to introduce

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.460
the idea of Hara Hachi bu, what is it. It
just means to eat until you're 80% full and

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.530
then you--that's it. That's all you eat. You
actually can lose a lot of weight, stay very

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:01.200
healthy. It's wonderful and very easy to do
in Japan, actually. So these are just some

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.609
samples. I might do something like this. What
does it mean? It doesn't mean waste food,

00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:10.730
by the way, only take 80% of what you need
and not waste. Anyway, that's just one idea,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:16.089
one example. Again, Hara Hachi bu here, so
this is on the train, before, after. Before

00:42:16.089 --> 00:42:21.480
after, it's a simple idea. But visually, boom,
you got it and I highly recommend it. You

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.170
can use it for meetings, use it for presentations.
If you get an hour, take 15 minutes. If the

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:30.510
meeting, you know, if you got 18 minutes,
take 17, never go over. So you can apply it

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.451
to many things. Of course, before, after is
very effective. This was an actual slide.

00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:40.000
I won't say who. But someone use this recently
last year. It's hard to believe. We could

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.740
take this kind of thing. It looks much better
this way, very easy to understand, same data,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.670
actually. Very easy to compare--instantly,
you don't have to use a pie chart for this

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:53.150
kind of data. If we--we don't need this, but
if you want--again, this is emotion now. But

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.311
if you want, they'll put emotion into that
narrative save the planet, you know, whatever

00:42:57.311 --> 00:43:01.569
it is, that's fine. Here are some examples,
and these are all tongue in cheek. There are

00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:05.020
no real methods. But on my Website over the
years, we've talked about different methods,

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:10.530
the golden method, Takahashi method, the whatever
method. And I don't have a method. The book

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.579
talks about an approach, which is more like
a philosophy or a general, you know, approach

00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:19.760
to it. There are many different methods that
can work for you. I call this a Jobsian Method.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.710
It isn't really--by the way, he's done it
for many years, of course. It's a very, very

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:27.829
simple visual, very conversational. There
is some data, but it's, you know, it's displayed

00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:34.000
quite easily. But even his developer conferences
which is more technical audience, still visually,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.030
it's quite simple, right? He uses quotes sometimes,
but no bullet points or very rarely would

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:43.849
there be a few bullet points. Microsoft method,
it's not a real method. And Bill is getting

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:47.600
better, I really like Bill and he's getting
the message, he's getting better with his

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:53.840
visuals. But not too long ago or something
more like this, right? Or like this. It doesn't--well,

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.710
he's a very smart guy, a remarkable guy. So
it would be great if he was a remarkable presenter

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:04.400
as well. This is an old Microsoft slide, actual
slide. But--and I wonder where they got their

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:15.280
inspiration. And then I remember my... Remember
that? Not too bad. Well, that's Google. I

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.950
love that stuff, by the way. It's great, 100%
sugar. So the Lessig Method, who knows Lawrence

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.400
Lessig? A few people, law professor down at
Stanford has a very unique, it’s his method.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:30.599
I'm not saying it should your method, but
for him it works just the way he does it.

00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:34.510
And if you--and most professors, by the way,
cannot present to save their life. And I am

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:39.340
one, so there, right? So I think that's where
a lot of us learn how to present badly is

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.789
because we all go to college and we see our
professors do it. But he has a different way,

00:44:42.789 --> 00:44:49.130
Larry Lessig. So, very visual, he has a lot
of content in his story. But he tells his

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:54.310
story, right? And I want to show you something
here on Remix. I'm going to show you--I have

00:44:54.310 --> 00:45:00.089
a video of a guy making a presentation with
a video in his presentation. It's kind of

00:45:00.089 --> 00:45:04.550
weird. We might go back in time if I do this
real fast. But I, you know, so this is an

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.780
example. If you're talking about something,
I could do bullet points or try to explain

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.410
to an older audience what does Remix mean.
What does that mean for copyrights, all this

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:15.410
kind of stuff, right? It's a new world. It's
a remix world that we live in now. Well, I

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:20.000
could do that in bullet points, but why not
just show some examples. And so, that's what

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.030
Lawrence said. So let me just show you this
one. Maybe you haven't seen this one, maybe

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:38.819
you have. It's very short.
&gt;&gt; My love, there's only you in my life, the

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:44.309
only thing that's right.
&gt;&gt; My first love, you're every breath that

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:48.809
I take. You're every step I make.
&gt;&gt; And I...

00:45:48.809 --> 00:46:00.020
&gt;&gt; I...
&gt;&gt; I want to share all my love with you, no

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:12.210
one else will do.
&gt;&gt; And your eyes...

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:33.119
&gt;&gt; Your eyes, your eyes...
&gt;&gt; They tell me how much you care. Oh.

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:43.980
&gt;&gt; So this is Remix, right? And it's important
to emphasize that what this is not is not

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:49.869
what we called piracy. I'm not talking about
justifying. People taking others people's

00:46:49.869 --> 00:46:54.480
content in wholesale and distributing it without
the permission of the copyright owner. I'm

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.589
talk...
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Okay. So that was very effective

00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:59.960
and it, you know, engage the audience so that
at the end of his presentation, it gets people

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.650
awake. It's also a great example of what he's
talking about. It's visceral, it's emotional,

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.319
people laugh. But it's not for no reason.
It actually supported his point with his remix

00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:12.579
and then he goes on. That's a free cultural
presentation. One of his last ones you can

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:17.030
get. Just Google it, you can find it. It's
totally worth your time to watch this. This

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:22.310
is kind of similar, the Takahashi Method in
Japan. This guy is a programmer. He specializes

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:28.650
in Ruby on Rails and some other things. But
Japanese is actually very visual and he's

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.280
not a very good presenter. A lot of, you know,
he's kind of a shy person. So he came up with

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.520
this method to--and he actually has a book
on the Takahashi method. This is [SPEAKS FOREIGN

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.940
LANGUAGE] just means big presentation. So
this would be the whole slide. It's actually

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.230
HTML. It doesn't use PowerPoint. But this
means the history. So when he's talking about

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:49.080
his method, here's the history, he's talking
about history. This word means history. Harry

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.920
says, "I didn't have PowerPoint," as he's
talking about it, right? Harry says, "Make

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.890
your letters really, really big. I mean, super
big, man." That's what it says. "I mean, really

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:01.650
big," this is another way of saying really
big, right? And when he has four points, he

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:06.750
go got four points. First, and just goes on
and on like this. Twenty minutes, about 300

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:11.329
slides. But for his audience, it works. They're
all programmers, it's very engaging, lots

00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:16.590
of humor. But it's not just comedy. It supports
what he's talking about, right? Again, Harry

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:21.690
said it's very easy to see. It's also very
simple, practical, cheap to do, right? The

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:25.980
Darth Vader Method, I thought if Darth gave
a presentation with PowerPoint, what would

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:30.140
it look like? And I thought it might look
something like this, right? So you just go

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:38.000
through the points and probably not as convincing;
the force is with you, you can destroy the

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.670
emperor, that parenthetical, and then in sub-bullet,
it's your destiny. He repeats that, which

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.609
is good. Repeat that as your destiny. And
then there's a website down at the end if

00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:51.970
you didn't get that. And I thought of the
juxtaposition, how would Yoda do it differently?

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:57.940
And I thought it would be much simpler, right?
Front and center, not in the dark, very naked

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.230
approach or [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] as we
say in Japanese. Naked communication, nothing

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:06.000
to hide, right, he's an old man, can't walk
very well. Right out there in front, empty

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.710
slate with endless possibilities, it could
be there. So that's quite juxtaposition, Yoda

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:18.029
and Darth, right? So where do you follow in
there? And that we should make a scale, right?

00:49:18.029 --> 00:49:21.410
Okay, and just a few things about delivering
and then we'll wrap it up for some questions.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.900
The thing about a presentation, the more formal
ones with slides is that it's not just the

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:30.000
content. I mean, it's not just the logic part
of the content. We need emotion too. Logic

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.640
is not enough. Of course, it's unnecessary
condition, but it usually isn't sufficient.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.609
We need emotion too. And it’s nothing new.
Aristotle was talking about this long, long

00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:43.420
time ago, right? We need the emotion and we
need the logical, and the passion, and the

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:49.569
enthusiasm. And when I think of enthusiasm
and passion, I think of this guy. So, obviously,

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:51.499
you guys knew all this. You've seen this a
million times.

00:49:51.499 --> 00:49:53.540
&gt;&gt; Developers, developers, developers...
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: But you cannot fake that kind

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.930
of sweat.
&gt;&gt; Developers, developers, developers...

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:59.740
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: That's--and I'm not suggesting
you present this way. But for him, it works.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:06.799
It's who is and you can't fake the sweat and
it's not boring. You know this man. I will

00:50:06.799 --> 00:50:11.779
show the other one. You know that. Anyone
see that for the first time? Is that the first

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:14.760
time? I think you all know--first--well then,
go Google it. You can watch it some more.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.180
There are some better ones than that. He's
consistent--but I like--maybe you saw this,

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:26.119
this next guy. This is really, really an odd
couple, for sure, to be on stage. But it worked

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:30.579
somehow. And Steve was Steve. So here's a
little example of him doing something a bit

00:50:30.579 --> 00:50:35.420
different. Someone asked him if he do whatnot
just developers, but how about web developers

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:42.850
too? Okay. Somehow, we lost the audio from
that. That's too bad. Whatever he's shouting.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:47.369
He's saying Web developers, Web developers,
Web developers. Well, that's too bad. Anyway,

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:51.190
he's not afraid. He's a very good sport. Just
get out there and let it hang out, right?

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:56.020
Why not? So I hope we get the audio back because
I wanted to end on something. I have a last--a

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.560
bit of audio. The other thing that Steve kind
of does [INDISTINCT] but certainly Steve Jobs

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.211
does as well is when he's presenting, he's
presenting. You have to be in the moment;

00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:08.740
not some place else, just here. Be somewhere
else later, right? Have you ever been to a

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.430
presentation where maybe the person is pre-occupied
or it was very last minute kind of thing?

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.710
Have you ever have that happen? I never got
the audio back. So being here right now, in

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.579
the moment--and this is also related to jazz.
Think about the great Charlie Parker said

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:25.960
the same thing, right? "Master your instrument.
Master the music." You know, you got to practice

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.420
and practice, but then you forget all that
shitake and just play. When you play, you

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.410
just play, you don't think, "Is this a B flat,
is this--are they going to like it," you just

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.779
play. And that's what jazz is. Of course,
you put in a lot of practice, a lot of rehearsal

00:51:38.779 --> 00:51:41.810
to get, you know, with your acts to get it
down. And then there are just little things

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.930
you can do. Keep the lights on, move away
from the podium, try to connect with people.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:50.090
Use a remote control. And that's not the actual
size, but usually they're quite small. Use

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:53.970
the smallest one you can, right? I wish someone
would invent a kind of you just sort of slips

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:58.241
on your finger. You know, like a--you know,
just a piece of rubber and you could forward

00:51:58.241 --> 00:52:02.440
back. Wouldn't that be cool? Why not? I don't
need this thing. Small as possible, you just

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.869
want to go forward, basically, right? A few
more examples from Ted. Ted is great. So I

00:52:06.869 --> 00:52:10.890
highly recommend you go to the Ted site. Some
people present they just get a chair and sit

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:15.650
down, connect with the audience. These are
different ones. Majora Carter did one a couple

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.271
of years ago. She was a bit nervous but she
had such a great story. She'd done a wonderful

00:52:19.271 --> 00:52:23.710
job in spite of her nerves, and it's understandable
that she would be nervous in that situation.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:28.760
But it's a great job. Very visual, visual
with slide, but also visual in her story about

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.020
what the kind of work she does. And this is
the last one I'd like to end with, because

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:38.960
some people say, "Well, but about data, how
do you present data?" So this is simple data.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:47.309
You know, Gatt Miter--thanks. In fact, I saw
it out here in front. And he--Hans Rosling,

00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:53.119
co-developed it. And he here has a simple
data set, but just watch how he sort of interacts

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.380
with this simple data and then we'll end it
here. Hopefully...

00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.420
&gt;&gt; ROSLING: And they said the world is still
we and them. And "we" is western world and

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:05.349
"them" is third world. And what do you mean
with western world? I said, "Well, that's

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:10.299
long life and small family. And the third
world, it's short life and large family."

00:53:10.299 --> 00:53:15.799
So this is what I could display here. I put
fertility rate here, number of children per

00:53:15.799 --> 00:53:20.289
woman--one, two, three, four, up to about
eight children per woman. We have very good

00:53:20.289 --> 00:53:26.010
data since 1962, 1960 about, on the size of
families in the old country. The arrow margin

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.680
means narrow. Here, I put life expectancy
at birth. From 30 years in some countries

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.260
up to about 70 years. And in 1962, there was
really a group of conference here that was

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:41.560
industrialized countries and they had small
families and long lives. And these were the

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:46.190
developing countries. They have large families
and they have relatively short lives. Now,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:51.109
what does happen since 1962? We want to see
the change. Are these students right? It's

00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:55.320
still two types of countries or have this
developing countries got smaller families

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.740
and they live here or have they got longer
lives and live up there? Let's see. We stop

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.160
the world. And this is all new statistic that
has been available. Here we go. Can you see

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.960
that? It's shining and they're moving against
better healthcare. They're improving there.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.531
Or the green Latin-American countries, they
are moving towards smaller families. The yellow

00:54:12.531 --> 00:54:16.360
ones here are the Arabic countries and they
get larger families, but they--no, longer

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.460
life, but not larger families. The Africans
are the green down here, but still remain

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:24.819
here. This is India, Indonesia is moving on
pretty fast. And then in the 80s, here, you

00:54:24.819 --> 00:54:29.170
have Bangladesh still among the African conference
there. But for Bangladesh, it's a miracle

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:34.420
that happens in the 80s. Imam starts to promote
family planning and then move up into that

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:40.650
corner. And in 90, we have the terrible HIV
epidemic that takes down the life expectancy

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:45.700
of the African countries and all the rest
of them all moves up into the corner where

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.410
we have long lives and small family and we
have a completely new world.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:54.329
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: So that guy is a great presenter.
And very excited about the data. And you don't

00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:58.390
forget it, so what his point? Again, he's
talking to students who sort of believe something

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:06.290
differently. But what is the point? The world
today is basically, right, longer life, smaller

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:12.309
families except--there is an exception, and,
you know, a good part of the African continent.

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:16.789
And to my student, my Japanese students, they're
surprised about that AIDS is still a problem

00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:19.390
because we don't hear about this, it's not
in the news, so therefore it must be cured,

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:25.049
but visually, they get it. Wow, AIDS is still
a big problem, yet the rest of the world essentially

00:55:25.049 --> 00:55:29.160
has moved forward at, you know, at a very
rapid phase, so that's just one example. We'll

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.809
end at there. So, we sort of touched on a
few aspects of presentation. But the point

00:55:33.809 --> 00:55:38.519
to remember is that PowerPoint is just a tool.
Whether you use K Node or Flash or whatever

00:55:38.519 --> 00:55:43.131
you use, these are just tools. You are the
presentation. You don't have to use slides,

00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:48.119
but you if do, try to use it in a way that
augments you and think of these kinds of things.

00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:53.240
It's all about the story, right, in a more
naked approach, right, that were just exposed

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.780
or out there, were humane, but it open visual,
natural, honest, right, creative, bring it

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.750
all that in, right? So, we have a few moments,
so we can take some questions and see if they

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:10.099
would like the microphone.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. First, I want to say thank you. I'm

00:56:10.099 --> 00:56:18.059
definitely inspired. I don't, like--I don't
necessarily always want to give a presentation,

00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:20.999
but that actually makes me want to get up
and talk, and so, yeah.

00:56:20.999 --> 00:56:22.760
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: There you are. And you're doing
it.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:27.829
&gt;&gt; So, okay, so, for questions, we have to
use the mic. And I'm just going to bring the

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:30.880
mic around so just raise your hands and…
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: You know, for the first-four

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.329
get books, but I'll stick around. I know,
you know, some of you have work to do. I mean,

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:39.589
it's Friday, but I'll stick around. I'm leaving
tomorrow, but until then I have to go, all

00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:41.689
right. I really appreciate you're coming out.
You were first.

00:56:41.689 --> 00:56:42.760
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Oh, that's okay. You'll get a

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.380
book too.
&gt;&gt; I have a really quick question. What tool

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.230
were you using? And if you were going to start
a presentation that's a week--a week before

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.590
the talk?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: A week before, yeah.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:54.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But, it could be reasonable because--I
mean, with PowerPoint you can't just slam

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:59.980
to get it fast, that's one of the things that
comes up. But, what tool are you using? And--I

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.160
mean, is it--is it coming on time--time that
it takes to do something like this?

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.480
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Like, I said, it just, each case
is different and it depends on how much time

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.839
you have. A week isn't very much. If it's
extremely important presentation as Dr. Schmidt

00:57:11.839 --> 00:57:14.559
said, "This is big, you got to prepare it
for me," well, I put all my time into that.

00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:18.869
A week is enough time, by for that would be
how many hours, 50 hours of work. It takes

00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:23.059
a long time. But the first thing is to get
off the grid, you know, and get away from

00:57:23.059 --> 00:57:26.340
the computer and really get down the story.
What is the story? What is it that I want

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.540
to say? What's important? Then it becomes
quite easy, then to storyboard. You can storyboard

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.650
into PowerPoint if you want to do it that
way and skip this sort of more analog, the

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:39.119
longer analog approach, that's fine. The actual
tool is keynote, but it doesn't matter. I

00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:42.000
mean, that's really my point. I don't care
what you use, and you don't need to lay this

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.319
PowerPoint either. How many by the way have
PowerPoint 2007 or Office 2007, is that most

00:57:47.319 --> 00:57:51.750
people? Still some of you are using the older.
And there's some Apple people here and some

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:56.191
Mac users. So--but it really doesn't--it really
doesn't matter. Flash should be great. Actually,

00:57:56.191 --> 00:58:00.460
I love to use Flash because for me since I'm
not really good at, you know, it would take

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:05.329
long time, but if I had someone who could
work with me, Flash is just--is wonderful.

00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:13.069
But this is a very easy tool to use.
&gt;&gt; Sir, my question is based on an experience

00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:17.480
I have when I tried to use an approach similar
to this a few years ago in a different company.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:23.500
I want to emphasize different company. And
the feedback I got from management was that

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:30.500
the presentations have to contain all of the
words so that somebody else could repeat it

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:35.549
just by reading slides. And they were uncomfortable
even with having all the content and the notes,

00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:39.940
how do you explain to that mindset?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: You know, it's a very common

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.810
approach, right? And they do that at Apple,
I mean, in every company to give it to the

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.530
engineers in the field to make sure they do
those six points that you put in the slide,

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:52.720
you put in the notes, but to be sure, let's
put it up there. It doesn't mean it's effective.

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.390
It's just--it's culture. Not everything about
our culture is efficient or good. We need

00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.670
to change parts of the culture too. So at
this--and it's hard. You're going to come

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:05.390
up--you're going to need resistance. But in
a lot of e-mail everyday from people where,

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:09.769
you know, it worked for, but it doesn't work
in every case. I tend to hear the positive

00:59:09.769 --> 00:59:15.870
reports. But, you know, I say, we got to strive
forward and try to change things 30 years

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:19.400
ago on how do people present. I mean, there
were OHP sheets, you know, the overheads.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:24.740
But mostly, you know, in my parent's generation,
they had meetings, and the might write something,

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.980
right, or they would talk and they didn't
need bullet points. How we do it for centuries

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:33.480
without bullet points? Why now we need bullet
points, which contained too little or too

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:40.680
much, right? So you can't read and listen
at the same time. So just "gambatte," as we

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:46.249
say in Japanese, "never give up." You need
a book. Thank you.

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:56.011
&gt;&gt; I have a question. What if you have something
very complex, say, an algorithm that you want

00:59:56.011 --> 01:00:01.900
to present the fine details of it? Do you
have any advice if something or at least it

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.197
seems to me as it it’s very complex, and
at the same time you have a very limited time

01:00:06.197 --> 01:00:10.460
to show it, how not to do that stuff and all
the details and just overwhelm the audience?

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.460
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: I wouldn’t use a slide. I mean,
slide are very low resolution, aren't they,

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.069
compared to paper. So if it's something like
that and people need to see the whole thing,

01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:22.050
then, just hand out a paper. Even in a standard
presentation, it breaks things up too rather

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.480
than saying turn page to 10, you might actually
just have people now look at this document

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.241
and then we talk about it. So again, this
isn't for every case. It's very low resolution.

01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:36.359
So if you actually need all of that data--I
mean, you need to have it, I'd say, you know,

01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:41.620
it's a handout. And that top key would definitely
agree with that as well.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.259
&gt;&gt; Have your other cases.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:00:45.259 --> 01:00:51.279
&gt;&gt; And as non-native speaker, I constantly
worry about my exams. So I tend to put some

01:00:51.279 --> 01:00:56.029
bullets on my slides, do you think that's
a good idea? And in general, do you have any

01:00:56.029 --> 01:01:00.390
advice for a non-native speaker? Thank you.
&gt;&gt; It's a good question. And it's--like, I

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:05.710
said, every case is different. And the thing
is about the slides, they are not for us as

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:10.049
presented, they are for the audience, right,
and it's suppose to help us, but help our

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:15.539
message. So, I understand--believe me, I understand
the pain. If I was doing one in Japanese,

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:20.000
what I have to do is I don't put it there,
but I put it in the notes view. You know how

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.309
you can in PowerPoint or keynote. I can actually
have notes, you see different image here.

01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:27.930
It's still not ideal, but at least it's better.
Since my Japanese is not good enough, I have

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:33.339
to read Japanese sometimes. So I would be--I'll
be doing more of this traditional thing. But

01:01:33.339 --> 01:01:36.511
I don't recommend that because--and you're
glued to the PC, right, or you want to try

01:01:36.511 --> 01:01:41.349
to get away from it. All I can say is I do
work with young Japanese students whose English

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:45.390
is not so developed yet. And they're shocked
that they can do it this way. First, they

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:48.829
are very nervous about doing it, but they
find it, you know, going to analog, getting

01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:54.049
their story down is actually easier because
they don't have to memories things. It's sort

01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:58.839
of liberating in a way because now they really
know their story, this visual sort of instantly

01:01:58.839 --> 01:02:02.120
reminds them, "Oh, yeah, this is the point
I want to say." The grammar doesn't have to

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.660
be perfect. Once they let that go, just tell
the story and what does it mean. And actually

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:12.369
their confidence goes up, it's sort of liberating,
seriously. So I know it look like it's crazy

01:02:12.369 --> 01:02:16.339
but try it, and I think you'll be happy with
the results. You can keep the notes. I mean,

01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:20.769
just print them out just in case, all right,
in case you have a total, you know, blow out,

01:02:20.769 --> 01:02:23.769
it could happen. Probably you would never
use the notes, but just because they're there,

01:02:23.769 --> 01:02:27.781
it gives you a little sort of security in
it. But thank you very much. You get the book.

01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:31.769
Could you pass it? Would you mind passing
the book back? Thank you. That's the last

01:02:31.769 --> 01:02:35.950
book, I'm sorry, which I have more--I have
a bottle of water that hasn't been open yet

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.609
so that you get everything free, so--it doesn't
matter. But it doesn't have much about how

01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:42.250
you does it, but if you're thirsty, you can
get this bottle of water.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.840
&gt;&gt; I'll pass on the bottle of water.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Okay.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.600
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks. You told a lot of about of
stories and, you know, a lot of good presenters--a

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:55.480
lot of good presenters I've seen, you know,
have a story and a message as part of their

01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.109
presentation. But in addition to that, they
have, you know, chain of stories or sub-stories

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:07.940
that support some point that they're making.
And I was wondering in a preparation for a

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.150
presentation, are you coming up? Are you thinking
about the stories then? Or you’ve kind of

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:16.081
trained yourself to, you know, in life when
something happens and, you know, that would

01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:21.980
be a great story to tell that would make this
point in a presentation I might give at some

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.130
point.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: It's a good point. And I think

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:28.660
it gets easier the older I get where you get
more experienced. And just opening your eyes,

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.299
and that's why it's great to go, you know,
go to seminars, try new things. If you've

01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:35.760
never done martial arts, do martial arts,
become a designer, you know, whatever. You

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.470
just--the more you get out, the more sort
of stories that you'd learn and that you get.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:44.930
So, I mean, that's basically how it happens.
During the brainstorming that was when I--you

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.549
get the ideas and, "Oh, this is would really
be good to support that, and see, I might

01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:53.089
jot something down." It's quite messy in those
stages, but being able to brainstorm like

01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:59.220
that, it brings those stories out for sure.
Thank you. I'm sorry I don't have a present

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.480
for you. There you are.
&gt;&gt; No book, too late. I've seen Larry Lessig

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.500
as well, and I'm curious. I have very mixed
reaction to this approach. And I think the,

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:18.130
sort of the mix part comes from the potential
for propaganda, to hide the ball and to not

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:23.390
be transparent because the standard clunky
PowerPoint is I say something and you see

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:25.461
it. It's there.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right.

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:31.910
&gt;&gt; The dynamic in these a lot is this complex
fluidity of speech and image and the effect

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:37.809
of it can be very much to mislead because
you say one thing comforting image on there.

01:04:37.809 --> 01:04:42.529
And I'm just curious, you're--and so, in other
words it's a very powerful and thus dangerous

01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:43.819
tool.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right, you got, absolutely.

01:04:43.819 --> 01:04:46.799
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious sort of your thoughts
about that dimension to this.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:49.880
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: No, it's an excellent point isn't
it? And that true, I mean, advertising, for

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.410
example, is very powerful isn't it? I mean,
just look at it, look what we buy, the crap

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.609
that we buy. I mean these are very powerful,
the image and narrative. But, like, anything

01:04:57.609 --> 01:05:03.049
else, like the internets, the computers for
good are used for evil. So, you know, do no

01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:08.809
evil is sort of my mantra, so you absolutely
can hide things. And I think a lot of--especially

01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:14.809
a lot of marketing presentations do that.
And one way to be more transparent besides

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:19.059
to actually just really having that philosophy
of doing, you know, evil, is giving a hand-out

01:05:19.059 --> 01:05:22.730
that has more of the details, that's it’s
all right there and not hiding anything. You

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:26.759
can see it, right? And in Lessig’s [INDISTINCT]
case, I know it doesn't work for everyone,

01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:32.320
and it does kind of go fast--wait, I'm not
accustomed to that--but for him, it works.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.849
I think if he didn't have that he would be
a less engaging speaker. They're kind of his

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:41.750
notes, although they don't seem like his notes
because he's developed his own style. But

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:45.579
your point is really, really good. And that's
the trouble. If you have someone who does

01:05:45.579 --> 01:05:50.410
something like this and then they aren't transparent,
they're actually trying to be duplicitous,

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.349
they're trying to sort of hide something,
then, and that gives this kind of approach

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:58.650
a bad name, doesn't it? And people will blame
the method rather than it's actually the motivation

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:02.820
behind it. And I actually think that bullet
points can--yeah, it's written down, but it's

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:07.910
so confusing that it actually can be more.
It's easier to actually sometimes hide the

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.460
truth. I mean, look at the--well, I won't
get into it, maybe we’ll at least point

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:15.750
out but look at the slides on the Iraq war
for example, you know, you've seen all this,

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:19.210
right? I mean there are tons of them that
explain, they're trying, and, you know, what

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:24.710
does this mean, right? It's so complicated.
But, anyway, thank you. That's excellent point.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.270
Last question, yes, sir.
&gt;&gt; I don't have a mic.

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:31.359
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: I'm sorry. That's Katrina’s
fault, its' not my fault. And then we'll do

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:32.359
this.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:06:32.359 --> 01:06:36.609
&gt;&gt; Quick question. I used to do a lot of teaching,
so like I'm having a lot of source code on

01:06:36.609 --> 01:06:42.299
slides. What is an effective way to teach
using this kind of technique especially for

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:45.049
computer source codes?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right. So, it's common. And does

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:48.676
that work for you to build the code, sort
of animate and then build it to show it.

01:06:48.676 --> 01:06:51.789
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really helps the audience.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Yeah, and they also have a hand-out

01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:57.240
of it, right. I send them the attachment.
I think it's at the same principle. I mean,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.190
how much? Not too much. It's only as much
as you need. I remember my undergrad was in

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:07.869
Philosophy. And the class I think the weakest
thing was logic only because it was symbolic

01:07:07.869 --> 01:07:12.470
logic, it was basically--because the equations
were so long. And I said, "I got it. I got

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:18.150
it. I got it. I don't got it," right? So,
if there's a way to somehow simplify not,

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:22.760
you know, make it dumb, like in politicians
do a lot of this where they dumb down things,

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.480
I don't mean that. But how much is necessary?
And then if building it helps rather than

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.710
the whole thing, blah, which is sometimes
overwhelming, can you build it in steps that

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:36.599
helps people get it more easily? That might
work. In that case, PowerPoint is very useful

01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:40.190
I guess.
&gt;&gt; Do you mind if we squeeze in one more question

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.569
we had?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Yes, sure.

01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:45.770
&gt;&gt; I notice you draw a lot of your inspiration
from the Japanese culture, and I was wondering

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:50.660
if you draw inspirations from other culture
whether it's necessary to actually move to

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.660
that location since you draw inspiration from
that culture, and if you plan to move again

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.130
in the future?
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: I highly recommend moving to

01:07:56.130 --> 01:08:00.720
Japan if, you know, seriously, to anyone,
if you're a young college student and you

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.000
have a chance to do to study abroad, you got
to Japan. My other favorite which I haven't

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.319
been to, but I've always wanted to go, and
I put this on my blog and I'll be going in

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:15.420
August is India. And of all innocence, I am
been a student of Zen Buddhism and Mahayana

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.830
Buddhism, it still has a truths in India.
And I've always has been fascinated. I mean,

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:24.040
when you go to a place, it's so completely
different. That just sort of--it blows your

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:28.700
mind. And, you know, I never would have--to
tell you the truth, I love working for Apple,

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:34.660
but I wasn't sort of stimulated enough because
I'm from America. And when I live in Asia,

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.180
it's everything is different, and you notice
things. You would be a foreign national in

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.950
a foreign country, you notice things, and
then other people don't, right? I'm sure foreigners

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:47.660
come here--foreign nationals come here and
notice things, right? We don't usually talk

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.240
about individualism here. Isn't it a great
that we’re all individualistic? We don't

01:08:52.240 --> 01:09:00.980
do that, right? Sorry. Apologies to John Stewart.
Yeah, yes--I'm sorry.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.970
&gt;&gt; Okay. Finally, my question is sometimes
you're up there and you don't know where to

01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:09.520
put your hands or kind of--how do you use
body to emphasize something. I've been seeing

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.890
you it's you using your hands quite often.
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: Right. You know, you would be

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:18.750
yourself. If you were something--again, if
you were Steve Ballmer, then be Steve Ballmer,

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:22.400
that's what works for him. So I think you
can't he mechanically, you can't fake it.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.310
And, you know, you've seen boring presentations,
but most people are not boring, right? I mean,

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:35.680
they date, you know. They're getting along
with somebody, right? So it can't be 99% of

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.910
presentation suck according to Guy in the
forward, but 99% of the people are not boring

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:45.231
or, you know, unintelligent. It can't be.
So we get up here, we get nervous. It's very

01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:49.810
unnatural to give a presentation, right, which
probably in our brain stem is to get into

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.430
the crowd, get in the middle and go with the
groups so that the lions can't attack us,

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:57.900
right? I mean, it's a very rare bread of person
that can stand up and do it well. I don't

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.850
think it comes naturally to anyone. Job is
great at it, but he practices a lot. And there's

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:06.160
a level--it's always a level of nerves. Even
I, you know, of course I have it now right

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.760
now, it's much, I'm much less sort of, you
know, intense if I'm just sitting down with

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.870
the few people. So just do what comes naturally.
I tend to do this a lot. Get your hands on

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:21.680
your pockets, you know, the old thing that
would help. But it can't be mechanical, right?

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.430
We have great market share increase, right?
Our problems are not small, they are large.

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:32.540
I mean, that becomes a little silly, so don't
worry about it. All right, that's what I'm

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.730
saying. Just be natural. Get a coach, you
have videos, do a presentation. Have someone

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:42.230
to take a video. You don't even need a coach.
Once you see it, "Oh, what I'm doing?" Right?

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.610
Seriously, I learned how to play tennis better
not by getting the coach but by videotaping

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:50.430
myself once. And then I saw it, "Why you bat
up in the air? Why you turned"--and I know

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.090
what to do. So just see yourself and then
you'll notice.

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:56.010
&gt;&gt; It's not that Bill Gates is criticized
for using his head, or he's like…

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:59.470
&gt;&gt; REYNOLDS: I know. You know, I do. I really
like Bill Gates especially when he's not so

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:04.060
much for the software he developed before,
what he's doing now with his foundation. I

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.060
think he's an amazing person obviously. And
I wish someone would work with him. His visuals

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.910
are getting better. I think they're getting
that message if you saw him at the--I forget

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:15.870
what it was, in January, whatever that one
was, the very simple visuals. But, yes, there's

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:22.450
that sort of Mr. Burn's (ph) thing, you know,
going there. Excellent, [INDISTINCT]. But--so

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:25.700
that, there are little things, and I'm sure
I have habits, we all have little habits with

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.310
a coach, you know, could help us with. That
is one little thing what you do your hands.

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:37.740
This is not good. You're cold, you're negative,
right, or mad. So hands in pocket, they say

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:43.699
not to do that. I say just relax, be yourself.
Thank you. So, thank you. Thanks.
