00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.372
- David?

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.473
David, David?

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.108 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh god, Finn
Wolfhard made me do it!

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.276
- It's me, it's Josh, it's Josh!

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.211
- Josh!

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.346 align:start size:69% position:31%
Josh!
(laughing)

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.482
What's up, man, what's up?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.916
- What's up with you,
what are you doing?

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Just a little guerilla
marketing for my one man show.

David Harbour, an artistic
exploration of sound,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:30.730 align:start size:97% position:3%
light, and the soullessness
of celebrity culture.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.998
- Oh.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.233
- Hey, you should come
see a dress rehearsal!

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.168
I need honest feedback.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.069
- Yeah, of course.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.370
- Great.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.338
- Just tell me where
and when, I'm there.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:39.406
- Do you know that alley?

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.041
The one next to the other alley?

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, are you a
friend of David's too?

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.096
(laughing)

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.465
(coughing)

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.401
(slow eerie music)

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.875
- I'm now going to tell you

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:22.015
about the first time
that I masturbated.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.484
- Jesus.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.486
(playful rhythmic music)

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:30.123
- Celeb-you-tain-ment,

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.791
celeb-you tainted.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.196
(rattling)

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.831
Can you dig it?

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.534 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh.
(light drumming)

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.136
Is this me?

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.939
Oh, wait, oh no!

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.607
Does it hurt you?

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.143
Is that painful to you?

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.978
Is it painful to you?

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:56.149
Celebrity deification is
a scourge of our society!

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.685
Read Chomsky, read Ã‘iÃ±ek.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.725
So, how was the first act?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.762
(laughs)

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.197
What do you think?

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.999
- Well, it's very

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.900
avant-garde
- Awesome

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.135 align:start size:72% position:28%
Awesome.
- Avant-garde

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:15.969
- Yeah.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.903
- It's unusual.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.771
- You like it, that's cool.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.739
- Just being honest.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.040
- Second act is
- It's weird.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You know, more
Stranger Things stuff.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.677
It's like I'm kind of pandering

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.379
to the fans, you know.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.515
- Sometimes pandering
is a good thing to do.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.517
- You're alive, Papa!

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.417
I hate you!

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.221
Well you're a brat.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.958
B-R-A-T, brat.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.793
(cries)

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.463
(cries)

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.398
(sobs)

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.338
(moans)

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.446
That was the second act,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.648
what do you think?

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:02.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You want my honest
feedback, right?

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.583
- Yeah, sure.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.885
- I liked when you
played both roles.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.187
- You got them.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.488
- Yeah, I got that.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.523
I do think you're getting,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
some of the dialogue
a little wrong.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:13.893
- Mind powers go.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.764
- I also think some
of your recollections

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.732
about the Stranger
Things characters

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.167
is a little off.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.068
- Name's Jack.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.104
Jack Demogorgon.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.308
I'm a monster

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.542
from the inside out.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.013
You know, they don't let me
read the full scripts, Josh.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.349
- And then, there's the dancing.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.085
(dramatic music)

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.866
- That's about my
new film Hellboy,

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.435
and about the futility of fame.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.737
- I didn't get that from that.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.872
I gotta go man.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.807
- Wait wait wait wait.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.308
No because I have a puppet show

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.611
about rampant consumerism

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.479
and the time the Joe Keery

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.083 align:start size:81% position:19%
stole my Golden
Globe gift basket.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.718
- I've been here
six hours, okay?

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:12.552
- Yeah, I know.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.453
- No, I'm sorry man.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.887 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Josh
- No, mm-mm.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:15.989
- We're almost halfway through.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.657 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He doesn't
understand you, David.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.493
- You know what,

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.728
I'm starting to think

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.929
you might not be the
right manager for me.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.998
(laughs)

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.934
(coughs)

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.940
(cries)
