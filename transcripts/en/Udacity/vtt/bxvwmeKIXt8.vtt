00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So one other thing we spent almost no time on in the beginning

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and a lot of time on now is spam prevention.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So you think on a site like reddit, where it's like the Wild West, there's no rules,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
like anybody can submit anything, that it would just be quickly overrun with spam.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You'd be surprised. Now that reddit is big, yes. Reddit receives lots of spam.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But at the time you kind of--If you understand spammers' motivations, it's really easy to prevent.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A spammer's motivation is basically they want links,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but an easy way to prevent their links from providing any value

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is to add an attribute to your anchor tag that looks like this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So if you have a link with this extra attribute, rel=nofollow, it basically tells Google

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this link shouldn't be followed for search quality purposes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because the way Google works, right, is it looks at a given page

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and however many pages elsewhere on the Internet link to that page gives that page some authority.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And you can basically say I don't want to give this link any authority.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So every link on reddit has rel=nofollow until it has a certain number of points,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because we didn't want to put rel=nofollow on all links because we like the way the Internet works.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And we figured if a link was good on reddit, that link should have some authority.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Understanding that spammers all they really want are links

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to increase the authority of their page to get more traffic there really helps.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this is one thing we did. Another thing we did was...Spam is rarely cemented by an individual by hand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There's almost always automated tools.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Looking at the behaviors of these bots that were submitting contents to reddit.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
They always had these kind of gaps, behavior gaps, that humans would never do.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For example, a bunch of users will all use the same password.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Before we were hashing passwords, it was really easy for us to tell. They were all using the same passwords.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If there were 100 users all submitting crap but they had the same password, it was all spam,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and we could just remove it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And that worked out really nice. Eventually we started, you know, hashing passwords, and we lost that ability.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But we had learned some other tricks along the way.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One is that the users didn't understand the site.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They would always submit a link and then comment on their own link.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And users, legitimate users, rarely commented on their own link as the first comment.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so we would just look for links that had 1 comment by the same author and mark it as spammers.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Spammers on a community site that behaves differently from other sites online,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
noticing that these peopel use the site in weird ways was enough to catch most spam.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We didn't have to do any fancy, like, look for Viagra or look for suspicious-looking links.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
A lot of these behavior heuristics worked really, really well.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Submissionary. This is another heuristic. Legitimate users didn't submit that often.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Or if they did, the time between submissions was stagnated,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and spammers would often just submit a bunch of links at the same time.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We look for those signs and ban the links.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The most important thing that reddit did, and still does, is don't let them know when they're caught.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When we'd ban a submission on reddit, that user would still see their submission on our hot page or on their user page.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If their vote doesn't count, it would still look like it would count,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and if you try to figure out on reddit if you vote counts or not,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
it's really difficult to tell because on reddit there's a delay between when you click that button and when we update the score.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm not going to get into the details, but suffice it to say, it's really, really hard.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And we've done this, we've spent a lot of time, making it so that users don't know when they're caught.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I've had to do this on ASCII Chan and on my blog as well

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
because a lot of you guys have submitted a bunch of crap to ASCII Chan and my blog that I didn't want to appear.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
A lot of that stuff is just sitting in memcache and only you see it,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but if you were to change computers, you would find that that submission disappears.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I think being subtle about when you've detected that somebody is spamming is really, really important.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's not the only solution, but security through obscurity works really, really well if you keep things obscure enough.
