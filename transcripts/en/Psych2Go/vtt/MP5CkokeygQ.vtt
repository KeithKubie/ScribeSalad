00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.440
Are you spending the night in watching this video, because you don't have any plans?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.780
I know what that's like, and I'm here to let you know that you aren't alone.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.660
Thousands of people watching this probably wish they were sitting next to someone like you.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.629
Being socially awkward might seem like it's a big part of who you are, but here's a small secret.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.799
It's only big because it's what 
you focus on. In reality, there's more to you
than what you give yourself credit for.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.860
Here are five ways to make friends when you're socially awkward.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.080
Why show up at a bar you never go to, when you can use your everyday settings?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.040
If you study in school full-time and work on the weekends, you can make friends with your classmates and co-workers.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.340
Cliques often prevent people from getting to know each other, but there are ways to overcome these social walls. 
It starts with an open mind.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.700
Judge someone for the content of their character, not based on the music they listen to, nor what they wear.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.269
When you start with something familiar, you'll all feel comfortable, and maybe strike up a conversation about a common interest.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.700
If you're worried about being out of place,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.800
don't be. People don't admit this a lot, but the truth is: life can be incredibly boring, seeing and hearing the same things every day.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.800
Maybe you're exactly what
someone needs to spice things up.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.220
Different interests come in handy when others can learn a thing or two from you, and vice versa.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.380
And it robs people of happiness and open doors.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.360
Instead, practice vulnerability. I know how hard it can be when rejection is feared.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.080
But you never know until you try. In fact, you can never succeed if you don't try.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.360
Telling yourself you're not good 
enough to talk to someone will only prevent 
you from building connections with others.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.620
Make a list of all of your strengths and talents, and tape it to your mirror.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.540
Each day before you leave for school or work, read it to remind yourself that you're special.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.280
Sounds like a no-brainer, right? But etiquette is timeless, classy, and makes you an approachable person.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.620
People are usually turned off by selfish, self-absorbed individuals, who only talk about themselves.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.480
If you're shy, you might be scared to
lend a helping hand or comfort someone,
when you see that they're having a bad day.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.080
But compassion is a way to someone's heart. So the next time the person who sits next to you in chemistry

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.420
fails a test you aced, take the leap and offer help. It's hard for people to resist light, during dark times.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.580
Overnight success is a myth, and so is the whole scenario of meeting someone who just gets it.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.280
If it were always that easy, we wouldn't have room to grow. Know that the best friendships take time.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.780
It's okay to move slow, and don't compare the friendships you're forming with someone else's.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.120
Everyone's story unfolds differently.
Instead of stressing out about why you haven't made matching bracelets or had sleepovers yet,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.140
embrace the present for what it is, and practice vulnerability.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.340
Expect yourself to make mistakes, you're only human after all.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.460
Remember, people don't need perfection.
They only need to feel understood and
loved, in order to make connections.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.820
See the best in others, and be encouraging of their dreams.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.940
But have the guts
to let someone see you fall down sometimes.
Tell them about the fears that keep you up at night.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.580
They'll be relieved because, chances are, they have them too. Good friendships always add value for both parties.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.360
Accept that the both of you have strengths and weaknesses, but when you come together, a special bond is formed.
