the segregation and mapping the natural

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:27.700
the segregation and mapping the natural

that that you know somebody is talking
about segregation you can actually

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:33.330
about segregation you can actually
 

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.300

you know they're using these words but

you know they're using these words but
 

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.250
you know they're using these words but
what they're talking about is this so

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.260
what they're talking about is this so
 

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.900
what they're talking about is this so
creating a sort of mapping of natural

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:42.910
creating a sort of mapping of natural
 

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.940
creating a sort of mapping of natural
language uses an advantage of indexing
