00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.250
It’s clear that a great many of us eat too
much. And in response, a huge industry has

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.020
grown up which advises us to consume more
quinoa, pomegranate and fennel salad and,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.230
as often as we can, kale and apple soup. But
this is entirely to misunderstand why we start

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.430
eating excessive amounts. It has nothing to
do food, and therefore trying to change our

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.180
diet isn’t the most logical place to focus
our efforts. We eat too much because what

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.890
we’re really hungry for isn’t available.
Of course, it looks as if everything we could

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.670
want should be to hand. Our supermarkets and
delis are iconic temples of consumer society.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.440
Our restaurants spare no effort trying to
satisfy us.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.129
Could sir or madam be tempted by lobster thermidor?
Or a selection of regional vegetables drizzled

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.019
with olive oil sourced from a tiny farm in
the Pyrenees? But if we could really choose

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.950
anything, wouldn’t we want a slightly different
menu? For example: Unstressed conversation

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.380
of father, marinaded in mutual forgiveness.
Tenderised maternal love* (* suitable for

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.600
those on a criticism-free diet).

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.420
Ripe friendship served on wry banter accompanied
by a side serving of affectionate teasing.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.079
Fresh conversation, liberally sprinkled with
poignant anecdotes (for two). Sexual appreciation

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
with all the trimmings (our sommelier recommends,
as the ideal accompaniment, a glass of full-bodied

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.180
Chateau Fantaisie). And for dessert, perhaps
A generous scoop of honeyed insight.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.460
In other words, it isn’t food we crave.
The menus of our actual restaurants (however

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.359
chic) prompt us only in very limited and restricted
directions. They understand – and respond

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.200
– to only a desperately narrow segment of
our true appetites. Collectively, we speak

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.850
so much of food, and so little of what we
properly need. It isn’t pizza, Spanish cheese

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.150
or Argentinian steak. We need friendship where
we can confess our darkest anxieties and be

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.709
heard and forgiven; we need help in calming
down at key moments, reassured that we can

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.920
withstand the very worst that may be coming
our way. We are lonely and angry within our

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.330
own families and are crying out for redemption
and cathartic honesty. We need someone who

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.410
can help us discover our real talents in the
workplace and offer us a guide to realise

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
our true potential. We know that, when reaching for a tube of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.610
potato chips or biting into yet another burrito
that the problem doesn’t lie there. We just

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.120
don’t know where else to turn and there
is, at least, a short-term satisfaction to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.050
be found. We eat too much because we hate
ourselves too intensely to have the necessary

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.769
respect for our own bodies. Our tragedy isn’t
our unconstrained appetite. But rather, the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.500
difficulty we have in getting access to the
emotional and psychological things that would

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.390
nourish our broken souls. The diet industry
has latched onto the symptoms of our unhappiness,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.730
not their causes – and therefore the solutions
it offers can only ever be temporary and fragile.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.240
It can’t make us lastingly thin because
it is not engaging with what made us manically

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.349
fat. A couple of hundred years ago it was
almost impossible for most people to find

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.099
anything very pleasant to eat. Since then,
a vast quantity of human ingenuity has been

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.209
devoted to enticing the palate. We have succeeded
beyond our wildest expectations. But in so

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.209
many other areas, we have hardly begun to
supply ourselves reliably with what we long

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.959
to consume, which are, to put it plainly:
understanding, tenderness, forgiveness, reconciliation

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.540
and closeness. We eat too much not because
we are (as we brutally accuse ourselves) greedy,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.880
but because we live in a world where the shelves
are still bare of the real ingredients we crave.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.600
At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.  To that end we have

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.680
also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
