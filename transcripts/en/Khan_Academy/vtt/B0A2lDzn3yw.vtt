00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.240
- [Instructor] The table
gives selected values

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.040
of the continuous function f.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.310
All right, fair enough.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.770
Can we use the intermediate value theorem

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.930
to say that the equation f
of x equal is equal to zero

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.320
has a solution where four

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.710
is less than or equal to x
is less than or equal to six?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.860
If so, write a justification.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.030
So, pause this video and see
if you can think about this

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.210
on your own before we do it together.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.683
Okay, well let's just
visualize what's going on

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:27.230
and visually think about the
intermediate value theorem.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.350
So, if that's my y-axis there

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.350
and then let's say that this is my x-axis

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.170
right over here.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470
We've been given some points over here.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.370
We know when x is equal to
zero, f of x is equal to zero.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.240
Let me draw those.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.910
So, we have that point.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.930
When x is equal to two,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.580
y or f of x, y equals f of x

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.520
is gonna be equal to a negative two.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.600
So, we have a negative
two right over there.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.410
When x is equal to four, so, three, four,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.910
f of x is equal to three.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.550
One, two, three.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.110
I'm doing it on a slightly different scale

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.890
so that I can show everything.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.440
And when x is equal to six, so, five, six,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.130
f of x is equal to seven.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.840
Three, four,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.720
five, six, seven.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.280
So, right over here.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300
Now, they also tell us that
our function is continuous.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.930
So, one intuitive way of
thinking about continuity

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.430
is I can connect all of these dots

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.120
without lifting my pencil.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.470
So, the function might look,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.060
I'm just gonna make up some stuff,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.440
it might look something,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.880
anything like what I just drew just now.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.870
And it could have even wilder fluctuations

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.390
but that is what my f looks like.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.100
Now, the intermediate value theorem

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.560
says hey, pick a closed interval.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.930
And here, we're picking
the closed interval

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.990
from four to six, so let me look at that.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.810
So, this is one, two, three, four here,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.040
this is six here,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160
so we're gonna look at
this closed interval.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.620
And the intermediate
value theorem tells us

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.710
that look, if we're continuous
over that closed interval,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.600
our function f is gonna
take on every value

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.360
between f of four, which in this case,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.713
so, this is f of four, is equal to three,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.563
and f of six, which is equal to seven.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.130
f of six,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.280
which is equal to seven.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.170
And so, if someone said hey,
is there gonna be a solution

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.330
to f of x is equal to, say,
five over this interval?

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.420
Yes.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.210
Over this interval, for some x,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.870
you're going to have f
of x being equal to five.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.350
But they're not asking us for an f of x

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.850
equaling something
between these two values.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.210
They're asking us for
an f of x equaling zero.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.880
Zero isn't between f of four and f of six,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.260
and so we cannot use the
intermediate value theorem here.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.910
And so, if we wanted to write it out,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.140
we could say f is continuous

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.860
but zero is not

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.090
between f of four

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.350
and f of six.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.350
So, the intermediate value
theorem does not apply.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.350
All right, let's do the second one.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.410
So here they say, can we use
the intermediate value theorem

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.410
to say that there is a value
c such that f of c equals zero

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.590
and two is less than or equal to c

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.850
is less than or equal to four?

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.893
If so, write a justification.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.760
We are given that f is continuous,
so let write that down.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.570
We are given

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.180
that f is continuous,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.860
and if you wanna be over that interval,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.970
but they're telling us
it's continuous in general.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.560
And then we can just
look at what is the value

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.400
of the function at these end points?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.830
Our interval goes from two to four,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.430
so we're talking about this
closed interval right over here.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.210
We know that f of two

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.070
is going to be equal to negative two.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.910
We see it on that table.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.163
And what's f of four?

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:11.540
f of four is equal to three.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.720
So, zero

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.430
is between

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.530
f of two and f of four.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.390
And you can see it visually here.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.475
There's no way to draw between
this point and that point

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:30.130
without picking up your pen,
without crossing the x-axis,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.070
without having to point

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.080
where your function is equal to zero.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.410
And so, we can say

00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:42.990
according to the
intermediate value theorem,

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.670
there is

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.250
a value c

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.320
such that

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.120
f of c is equal to zero

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.141
and two is less than or equal to c

00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:00.740
is less than or equal to four.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.820
So, all we're saying is hey,
there must be a value c,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.893
and the way I drew it here,
that c value is right over

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:09.250
where c is between two and four,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.810
where f of c is equal to zero.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.856
And this seems all mathy

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:14.990
and a little bit confusing sometimes

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.910
but it's saying something very intuitive.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.970
If I had to go from
this point to that point

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.000
without picking up my pen,
I am going to at least cross

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.963
every value between f of two
and f of four at least once.
