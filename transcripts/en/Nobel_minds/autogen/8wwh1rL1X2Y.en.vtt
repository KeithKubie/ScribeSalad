there was no sign on that bus to tell
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
there was no sign on that bus to tell

you where it was going to take you all

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
those signs on the bus has disappeared
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.089 align:start position:0%
those signs on the bus has disappeared
so<00:00:21.090><c> you'd</c><00:00:21.269><c> get</c><00:00:21.480><c> into</c><00:00:21.779><c> the</c><00:00:21.900><c> bus</c><00:00:22.080><c> without</c><00:00:22.619><c> having</c>

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
might take you to your school but it

might take you to your parents workplace
 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
might take you to your parents workplace
so<00:00:30.029><c> imagine</c><00:00:30.630><c> that</c><00:00:31.050><c> you'd</c><00:00:31.500><c> be</c><00:00:31.710><c> Miss</c><00:00:31.949><c> sorted</c><00:00:32.430><c> and</c>

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 align:start position:0%
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 align:start position:0%
so imagine that you'd be Miss sorted and
that's<00:00:33.180><c> a</c><00:00:33.330><c> little</c><00:00:33.570><c> bit</c><00:00:33.690><c> what</c><00:00:33.900><c> this</c><00:00:34.110><c> process</c><00:00:34.590><c> is</c>

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit what this process is
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.550 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit what this process is
because<00:00:35.790><c> of</c><00:00:35.820><c> this</c><00:00:36.030><c> process</c><00:00:36.300><c> the</c><00:00:36.870><c> passengers</c>

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
because of this process the passengers
 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
because of this process the passengers
the<00:00:37.830><c> cargo</c><00:00:38.250><c> they</c><00:00:38.730><c> get</c><00:00:38.940><c> to</c><00:00:39.090><c> the</c><00:00:39.210><c> right</c><00:00:39.450><c> place</c>

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
the cargo they get to the right place

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 align:start position:0%
the school at the right time so you're
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
the school at the right time so you're

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so this whole process
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.940 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so this whole process
helps<00:00:49.740><c> the</c><00:00:49.950><c> cell</c><00:00:50.190><c> sort</c><00:00:51.080><c> proteins</c><00:00:52.080><c> so</c><00:00:52.830><c> the</c>

helps the cell sort proteins so the
