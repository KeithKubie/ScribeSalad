00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.109
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.821
DAVID MITBY: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:11.320
I'm David.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.760
I'm a PM here at Google
working on app ads.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.860
I really love having I/O
right here in our backyard.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.100
It is not even just
Google's backyard.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.570
It's actually kind of
mine because I've actually

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.130
lived here in Mountain
View for about 16 years.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.259
And so when I see those tall,
white peaks of the Shoreline

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.620
Amphitheater tent, it
really kind of signals

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.140
home to me whether
I am at a concert

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130
over there, landing at
the San Jose airport

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.560
and I see it off
in the distance,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.450
or enjoying a nice bike
ride on the great trails

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.670
that we have right
around this amphitheater.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.480
And when I see that Shoreline
tent, the really iconic tent,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.550
especially in the weeks and
months that are leading up

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.800
to I/O, I get really excited
about all the product

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
announcements that we're
planning to make here,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.920
and I also think for-- and
probably more importantly,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.180
to all the great conversations
that we get to have with you,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.530
engineers, developers,
marketers, product leaders

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.422
from all around the world.

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:12.880
One of the big
themes that's really

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.450
been coming up in
the conversations

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.980
that I've been
having is how mobile

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.500
is changing everything and
particularly mobile apps.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.250
I think back to when I first saw
that Shoreline Amphitheater 16

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.900
years ago when I moved to
Mountain View, the phone

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.450
in my pocket didn't
even have a data plan,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.070
or even almost seven years ago
when I joined Google here just

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.970
down the street, I had just
a few apps on my phone.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.280
And I was still doing
most of my transactions

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.480
on my laptop, even desktop.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.700
I was going to physical
locations to do business.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.200
And I think to the last
year or certainly two years

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.380
everything has
completely changed.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.480
I can't remember the
last time I actually

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.170
went to my bank or my insurance
company or even an ATM,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.990
cashing checks on your phone.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160
If I need supplies, just
a few taps on my finger

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.910
and usually within the same
day they show up at my house.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.430
You need a ride, a
couple of taps and a car

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.140
shows up to take you to
where you need to go.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170
I have young kids and so
their personal favorite

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.150
is now the ability,
with just a tap or two,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.630
have a pizza show
up at your door.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.730
They love that, much
sometimes to my dismay.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.430
But it's just so
amazingly transformative

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.610
to see this change that's
happening around us,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.200
and it's happening so fast and
yet for my young kids' life,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.862
it's just all they've known.

00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:42.070
This is the world they live
in, and they've just come

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.736
to expect this kind of reality.

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:46.110
And so it's, I think, easy to
take that for granted, even

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.180
though it's happening--

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.360
as it's happening so fast.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.480
That's really why I love
working on mobile apps

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.370
and why I've chosen to
really focus on mobile apps

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.670
here at Google.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.950
Mobile apps present such
an opportunity for you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.530
to weave your products
into people's daily lives

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.370
and scale your businesses to
millions or even billions--

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.445
I'll say billions a lot today--

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:11.000
of people faster
than ever before.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.710
We actually
announced yesterday--

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.284
if you think about the scale
of this transformation,

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:16.700
we announced
yesterday that people

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.460
have downloaded 82 billion apps
from the Play Store last year.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.270
And the business
opportunities are growing.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.850
We've also seen that the
number of buyers in Google Play

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.650
is growing by nearly 30
percent year over year.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.377
So the opportunity is just
absolutely tremendous.

00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:36.710
And of course, you all get that.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.340
That's why you're here.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.210
But since that opportunity
is true for everyone,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.109
the question really becomes,
how do you rise above the noise

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:44.775
and get noticed?

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.730
Building a successful business
really takes more than just

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.930
making an awesome app.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.520
That's really increasingly
become kind of table stakes.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.710
I even know this firsthand.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.376
When I started doing
mobile development,

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:01.640
it was on J2ME feature
phones back in the day.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.540
This was before
there was app stores.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.330
There was no way to do ads, to
market your apps to anybody.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.880
We got, like, 3,000
users and wasn't

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760
able to really go
anywhere with the app.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.870
And even today, as the
opportunities have grown,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.870
it's still--

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.990
the world is littered
with so many apps that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.000
never really take off because
they're not able to find users

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.167
or make money.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:24.000
And a lot of that is
because the competition

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.780
has gotten so fierce.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.920
We've also measured that there
are-- the number of developers

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.860
with over one million installs
a month has grown by 35%

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.300
year on year.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.700
So what this means is there's
a lot more competition

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.910
for people's attention
and their dollars.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.760
And so you really have to
find a way to stand out

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.400
and while leaning on technology
to deliver more of the results

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.560
that you care about.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.970
This is where Google
can really help you.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.230
We have over half
a dozen properties

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.690
that each have over a
billion active users,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.340
and so really
Google has the power

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.930
to find your users with
both simplicity and scale.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.320
So today Belinda,
Rob, and I are going

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.150
to share strategies and
innovations that help you find

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.230
and keep more of your
best app customers.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.510
Our presentation will
answer these questions

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.370
like, how do you grow
your user base quickly?

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.420
How do you find more
of your best customers?

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.170
How should you pay for them?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.890
And how to make sure that
even after the install,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.050
you can keep those users coming
back over and over to your app

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.525
and actually really making
a profit off your customers.

00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:35.900
I'll kick things
off a little bit

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.640
by talking about growth, which
is such an essential part

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.440
of building a successful app.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.440
You obviously didn't put
all that time and money

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.570
into developing your app just
to let it sit on the shelf.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.290
So how do you put your apps
in the hands of more people

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.260
quickly?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.290
Where and how can
you reach them?

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.730
For more and more of you, the
answer is starting with Google.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.350
We recently shared that
Google has helped developers

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.730
and marketers just
like you drive over

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.930
five billion installs
via ads to date

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.690
for their mobile applications.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.780
And our products aim
to place your app

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.440
in front of the right user
at exactly the right time.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.400
A great example of how we can
do this is with Google Play.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.710
So earlier this week
we also announced

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.770
that Android now reaches
two billion active users

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.350
every month, and the
Google Play Store

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.070
is available in 190 countries.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.170
Really astounding scale.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.130
Obviously Android users are
turning to the PlayStore

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.255
when they want to find a
great app or a great game.

00:06:43.255 --> 00:06:46.390
And in addition to sometimes
going in and searching

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.900
for an application,
increasingly users

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.690
are actually getting
into the store,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.836
browsing around, and finding app
recommendations surface to them

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:56.210
and getting their
apps as they're

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.110
browsing in the PlayStore.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.110
We've obviously
noticed this trend.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.070
And so to make sure we're
helping those users discover

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.410
your apps while
they're browsing,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.760
we this week introduced
new ad placements

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.240
on the home and app listing
pages in the Google PlayStore.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.020
These new placements
are exclusively

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.830
available through our
Universal App Campaigns, which

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.140
I'll talk a bunch
more on, and really

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.920
help you find the
users right when

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.280
they're ready and
willing to find your app.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.130
And of course,
Google Play is just

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.300
one of the many
channels at Google

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.700
where users are finding apps.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.350
They're finding apps and they're
watching videos on YouTube,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.150
when they're checking emails,
when they're checking the news.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.820
And this is why we built a
product we call Universal App

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.900
Campaigns, which we
affectionately call UAC,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.660
to automatically reach
the billions of users,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.300
whether they're in Google
Play, they're on google.com,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.940
watching videos on YouTube,
checking mail on Gmail

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.470
or anywhere in the over
two million sites and apps

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.830
in the Google Display Network.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.310
UAC really can simplify how you
reach your users when they're

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.490
ready to install the app.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.580
For those of you who have
tried this prior to UAC,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.413
you know that if you're
trying to find users

00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:17.260
on, say, google.com, you
have to go in and figure out

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.120
which keywords are your
customers going to search for,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.802
what kinds of
cost-per-click should you

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:22.760
pay for those keywords.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.449
It's a very challenging process.

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:25.740
And that's just for google.com.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.500
If you want to extend
that to, say, YouTube,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.080
you have to think about which
audiences, which demographics

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.289
may resonate with your app, and
then show them those videos.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.094
If you want to run on
the Display Network,

00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:38.510
you might be
thinking about things

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.000
like what contacts matter
for your users, which apps,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.830
which sites should
I be running on.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.160
It's very tedious and complex
to do that across the board.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.310
And so you're either
taking a lot of time

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.250
or you're missing out
on a lot of opportunity.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.050
And so we decided with
UAC, rather than having

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.640
to manage all these
multiple campaigns

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.480
and doing all this manual
optimization across all

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.800
the different
channels and contexts,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.090
UAC will automatically
do this for you

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.110
with a single campaign that
does all the heavy lifting.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.030
A big theme here
at I/O, of course,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.400
is AI and Machine Learning,
and there's no exception

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.350
when it comes to ads.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.070
We've really extended
this technology

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.590
and brought it to
ads, and that's

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.310
the heart and soul of UAC
that makes us able to,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.290
with a single campaign and
with very easy settings,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.590
actually reach your users
across the Google ecosystem.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.450
The reason this
works is because UAC

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.370
is able to get smarter
with every ad impression

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.540
and see how your users are
interacting with your app

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.500
and what's working
and what's not.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.540
I'll give an example,
maybe your ad

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.830
is really resonating on
travel videos on YouTube.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.520
So of course, then
the system will

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.290
make sure it's showing on
more channels like that,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.880
or maybe this new
play ad is really

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.220
working out for you,
well, skew budget to that.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.620
So it automatically
happens using data.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.460
It's using all these
countless signals in real time

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.600
to continuously refine
your ads and make sure

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.870
that you're reaching the
right users at the right time

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.170
in the right place.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.885
So my favorite example
of what UAC does

00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:19.720
is figuring out
automatically that users

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.770
who have phones that
have low battery life

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.970
actually tend to not
install that many apps,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.660
certainly not going to
install a really intense game.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.970
But they do install
utilities, particularly

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.560
like battery savers.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.590
And all the AI and
Machine Learning models

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.119
just figure this
out automatically

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:37.910
and make sure that the
right users are then

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.410
getting the right ads.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.710
Or learn things like
weather apps are not

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.220
that popular in places where
the weather doesn't vary.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.260
So in places like
Mountain View, you

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.600
might not see that
many ads for weather

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.767
apps from UAC, at least
not this time of year

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:53.850
with this kind of weather.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.230
Universal App Campaigns
are really making it easier

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.850
for real companies, like HBO,
to really get their shows,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.150
like Game of Thrones, Veep,
or my personal favorite,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.270
of course, Silicon Valley in the
hands of their customers using

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.020
their HBO Now app.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.320
Their vice president
of user acquisition,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.320
Diana Pessin here is showing how
she's seen that Universal App

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.110
Campaigns make it so much
easier for her and her team

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.210
to reach the right
customers, cutting

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.660
the time it took to create these
campaigns from upwards of two

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.280
hours to down to
just 15 minutes,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.222
and they're seeing great
results at the same time.

00:11:33.222 --> 00:11:35.680
Obviously she, and I'm sure
you, can think of better things

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.360
to do with the hour
and 45 minutes you

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.050
save, whether it's building the
next great feature in your app

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.425
or working on your
business model

00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:44.414
or just taking a bike
ride, as I like to do

00:11:44.414 --> 00:11:45.580
right here around Shoreline.

00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:49.760
Universal App
Campaigns are really

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.760
transforming the way
developers and marketers are

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.180
growing their apps.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.620
So with UAC, you can put
Google's Machine Learning

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.510
to work for you and deliver
more trusted, invaluable results

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.890
for your business.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.660
But it doesn't just
stop with the install.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.412
It's all about getting
engaged users, driving value.

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:08.370
And so now I'm going to
turn it over to Belinda

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.260
here to talk about how Google
is helping you do that, driving

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.850
engagement and value while
making really profitable growth

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.610
decisions.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.110
Thank you.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.483
BELINDA LANGNER: Great, awesome.

00:12:17.483 --> 00:12:18.660
Thanks so much, David.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.550
Hi, everyone.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.000
I'm Belinda, and I'm a PM
here working on Universal App

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.552
Campaigns and app ads.

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:26.260
And while I haven't
been in Mountain View

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.010
as long as David
has, I certainly

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.690
have been working on app
ads for quite awhile.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.980
And I remember even
just a couple years ago

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.870
when we started this most of you
guys were asking me questions

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.530
like, hey, how do I get
my app installed, right?

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.050
How do I get my app on
the homepage of users?

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.470
How do I become number
one in the top charts?

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.290
As David shared,
finding new users is

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.070
the critical part of
growing a successful app,

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.170
but growing that user base
and getting in the top charts,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.420
they're great, but it
isn't the same thing

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.476
as building a
profitable business.

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:00.100
I was doing office hours earlier
today, and a bunch of you guys

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.170
have been coming over.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.711
And again, the questions have
changed so much over the years.

00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:05.350
And now the question
is, well, how do

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.830
I continue to grow my business?

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.137
And what we've been talking
about with a lot of you--

00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:11.720
and feel free to
come over later too--

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.900
is that you need more engaged
customers to help you monetize,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.090
and you need to be smart about
how you acquire these users

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.436
and how much you pay for them.

00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:23.060
So I'm going to share
a little bit more

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.450
today about how Google is
helping you achieve both

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.610
of these goals, and by using
the knowledge you already

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.110
have about the great engaged
users you've already built up

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.075
and how you can continue to find
more of your best customers.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.670
So like we've been
talking about,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.710
you want users to not
just install the app,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.340
but take additional steps
to engage of the app

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.550
that you and your team have
worked so hard to build.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.640
You have so many cool
features in your app.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.700
Don't let it just
sit on the phone.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.750
You want people to take actions,
like booking a room so they

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.537
have a great weekend
getaway, or to slay a dragon

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:01.120
and beat the next level in the
really cool game that you built

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.850
out, or even just placing a
really great order for food

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.530
right after this talk is
over, because well, we happen

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.580
to be right before lunch.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.240
So that's why last year we
introduced a new bidding option

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.360
for Universal App
Campaigns to help

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.870
you move beyond the install
and really focus and optimize

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.760
for those in-app convergence,
whatever that means

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.960
for you and your business.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.930
And the goal is
really still the same.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.170
We're still trying
to find you users.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.940
We're trying to
find you new users.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.170
But rather than focus on
things like what kinds of users

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.840
might eventually end up in your
app and do the right things,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.470
we want you to just focus
on the actual events

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.690
that the users are actually
doing in your apps,

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.320
engaging with the
features you built out.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.110
So the key thing for you to do
that is to fill in this blank

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.170
here.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.060
What actions do you
want users to take

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.880
after they install your app?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.750
Once you do that,
once you decide

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.440
that you want them
to slay some dragons

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.310
or that you want them to
place a food order delivery,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.830
you can then define those
actions as convergence

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.570
and AdWords, and Google
actually evaluates

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.670
all the unique signals
that we have in real time,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.500
combined with your
information, continuously

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.450
refining your ads
so that we show them

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.080
and promote your app
in the right place,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.840
at the right price, across
all of Google's properties.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.090
And this has been working
for app developers.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.440
So I'm not sure how many of
you are familiar with Pixonic,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.430
but they have this really
cool game called War Robots.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.100
And it's a neat,
multi-player robot game,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.590
and you really can't go
wrong with robots, right?

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.100
So by running UAC,
they ran a number

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.740
of campaigns optimizing for both
new installs and in-app users.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.550
With this strategy,
they were able to scale

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:54.660
across 20 countries globally
and do so with a 63% higher ROI.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.550
That is a lot of
fighting robots.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.570
UAC is really
transforming the way

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.630
that developers, such as
Pixonic, and marketers

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.750
are acquiring the right
users, and it's also

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.260
changing how they work with
Google to promote their app.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.400
In fact, one in four
app advertising dollars

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.150
today are already being spent
promoting in-app convergence

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.620
since we launched this new
bidding strategy in September.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.280
And I'm really happy to say that
Google is helping developers

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.940
such as yourselves drive
over three billion events

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.110
per quarter, three billion.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.920
That is more purchases
made, more levels

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.620
beat, more subscriptions, more
people taking more actions,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.910
engaging with your
app, and really growing

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.340
to love the features that you
have worked so hard to build.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.620
All those blood,
sweat, and tears,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.920
all those late nights in
the office are worth it.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.890
And we're hoping to accelerate
the delivery of this

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.130
to the developer community
such as yourselves

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.460
with even more enhanced
bidding strategies in UAC

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.210
that I'm going to go
ahead and talk about

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.359
and dive a little deeper into.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.650
So in order to make
sure that you're

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.160
being smart with their
acquisition dollars,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.770
we're introducing two
new bidding strategies

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.040
in Universal App
Campaigns, Target CPA,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.079
cost-per-acquisition, and Target
ROAS, return on ads spends.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.319
Simply put, these
strategies that you pay more

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.600
for users who are likely
to spend more, and pay less

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.320
for users who are
likely to spend less.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.000
So let's go ahead and talk a
little bit more about them.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.610
So we'll start with Target CPA
or Target cost-per-acquisition.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.790
TCPA allows advertisers
to define the amount

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.580
that you want to pay for a
user who is likely to install

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.870
and perform a specific event.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.250
So for a game like
Panda Pop here,

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.270
there's a number of events
that they care about.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.690
They care about people beating
certain levels, completed

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.800
tutorial.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.800
They want to make sure that
people are saving baby pandas,

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.420
and they also maybe want to
promote some of the rainbow

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.220
bubbles that they offer and
get more people to buy those.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.390
So for Panda Pop,
they could bid,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.140
for example, $10 for
an in-app purchase,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.260
for people to buy
more rainbow bubbles,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.540
or maybe they'll bid $5 for
a user who beats level one.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.060
Then Universal App Campaigns
will take that information,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.710
bid automatically
across all the channels,

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.260
to acquire users who
are likely to complete

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.330
that certain action, whether
it's beating level one

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.860
or buying more rainbow bubbles.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.840
So for many of you, though,
events and convergence

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.700
don't tell the full story.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.800
It's great that someone
buys them rainbow bubbles,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.320
but some users buy a
lot of rainbow bubbles

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.030
and some buy a lot less.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.280
So it's ultimately
about the revenue

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.520
that's generated from
these users with your app.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.410
And that's why in addition
to just setting a Target CPA,

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.880
UAC advertisers will
now be able to bid

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.690
on Target ROAS for each
new app user acquired.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.690
Target ROAS bidding
allows you to bid

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.400
more for users who are
even more valuable to you,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.930
to distinguish between
users who only buy once

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.760
and users who buy multiple
times, between users who

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.000
buy smaller purchases
and between users

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.870
who buy larger purchases.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.300
So I'll just give
an example here.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.090
My brother and I, we really like
playing Trivia Crack together.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.440
He lives over in DC and
I'm here in California.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.240
So it's a great way
for us to sort of keep

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.090
our sibling rivalry going.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.520
We're really competitive,
and I'm the older sister.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.800
So I really want to make sure
that I'm beating my brother.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.500
I can't let him win, right?

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.800
So I definitely buy a few
power-ups in Trivia Crack.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.521
My brother, however,
is really busy,

00:19:45.521 --> 00:19:48.020
and he doesn't really want to
deal with seeing ads too much.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.765
And so he has actually bought an
ad-free version of Trivia Crack

00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:53.710
so that he can
playing all the time.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.630
While we both made purchases
within Trivia Crack,

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.150
we have made different
levels of purchases.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.770
And so we are actually
valuable in different ways.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.310
And so Trivia Crack should
pay perhaps a little bit more

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.770
to acquire me since I'll
keep buying more power-ups

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.570
while my brother is
pretty much done.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.550
He's just not going to
win anymore against me.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.090
So Google is built to understand
how valuable these users are

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.740
based on how they engage,
how they converge,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.280
and how they spend
time within your app.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.280
And Google has a
breadth of channels

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.700
to find more users that you
want to engage with your app

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.200
at scale.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.050
So these options, Target
CPA and Target ROAS,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.640
will be available later this
year for both iOS and Android

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.410
within UAC, and we're excited
to see how you use them

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.000
and how you get more users
to engage with your app.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.100
But the shift to
engagement and value

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.210
makes real time
data and insights

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.590
even more important than ever.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.620
Your first-party data is
informing the decisions

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.100
that you're making to
grow your business,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.920
to decide which new
feature to build out,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.800
which features to invest in
more, where are people really

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.460
growing to love your app.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.420
And this becomes even
more difficult, though,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.520
as you have more touch points to
think about and more customers

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.050
to keep track of.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.470
And so Google has been
helping with Google Analytics

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.990
for Firebase, which
is a free tool that

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.606
allows you to track
your users real time

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:22.230
and what they're
doing within your app.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.550
We also realize,
though, that many of you

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.810
have other measurement
partners that you're using,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.290
and so we want to make
sure that you have

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.170
and we're committed to support
an open ecosystem of partners

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.010
that work well with our media.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.750
So we're really happy to say
that we have been working

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.200
with seven app
attribution partners

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.890
to make measurement more
consistent and reliable

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.930
for app advertisers
such as yourselves.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.560
Additionally, we also
want to make sure

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.670
that we streamlined the
process and a setup flow

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.030
for getting your data from
these app attribution partners

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.810
into AdWords.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.620
So right now if you want to
get your data integrated,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.080
it's really easy
to do, and you'll

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.570
be able to do that more quickly
and smoothly than ever before.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.700
With easier access
to this data, you

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.280
can now make quicker and
smarter growth decisions,

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.930
and really focus on your app
and improving it and growing

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.770
even more.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.450
And by combining this data
with Universal App Campaigns,

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.640
you now have a trusted way
to combine the insights

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.700
that you know and all
the work that you've

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.890
done to the power of
Google's Machine Learning.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.860
And this has been
making a huge difference

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.340
in our customers' bottom lines.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.170
Stash Invest is a
leading investment app,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.480
and they were an early beta
tester of the app attribution

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.070
partner API.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.910
They use a newly available
granular data with their ad

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.000
campaigns and Google's
Machine Learning

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.930
to find more users who are
likely to register and install

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.580
and open an account.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.340
And this led to an 18% increase
in post-install convergence

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:04.840
rates.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.080
So now we've covered
how to grow your app,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.630
how to find more
valuable users, how

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.010
to get more people to
engage with all the features

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.260
that you built out.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.420
But even if you get the right
users to install that app,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.280
take that action,
you want to make

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.260
sure you have a strategy
for continually driving

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.940
re-engagement in
your app over time.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.090
It's not just that
first purchase, but all

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.120
the other subsequent purchases.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.045
So I'm going to go ahead and
hand the rock baton over to Rob

00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:37.420
to tell you more about how
you can build a successful app

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.695
business by keeping users
coming back time and time again.

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:41.195
Thanks.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.630
ROB AIKINS: Thanks, Belinda.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.320
Hi, everyone.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.770
I'm Rob, and I'm a product
manager here at Google,

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.120
working on our app
engagement products.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.600
As Belinda mentioned,
I'm going to share

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.600
how Google is
innovating in many ways

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.110
to keep users
engaged in your app.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.050
Naturally, we spend
a lot of time working

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.860
on the experience in our app.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.990
We want to make sure
our apps are the best.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.590
This is somewhat obvious.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.200
The question is, how do
we delight users when

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.140
they are outside of our app?

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.745
I think this is best
illustrated with an example.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.660
Imagine you have
the same business

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.360
you have now or the
same app, but imagine

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.680
you also have a brick and
mortar store with a big window.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.130
Now, ask yourself, what should
you showcase in that window

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.180
so that when someone is walking
by, they stop and take a look?

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.640
What would you show to make
them not only take a look

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.030
but come in and make a purchase?

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.290
How would that change
for every single user?

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.660
This is a simplified example,
but the general philosophy

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.790
can make a big difference in
how you re-engage your users.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.120
Getting users to
come back to your app

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.760
is all about connecting
those users with the products

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.950
that you provide that
they care about and love,

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.460
whether it's power-ups in
a game, deals on a hotel,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.920
or the latest line of sneakers.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.950
And doing this well requires
a customized message

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.100
and a personalized touch.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.680
You need to understand how users
interact with your business

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.260
and what items in your
catalog they prefer,

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.730
as well as what actions
they take in order

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.525
to make a purchase.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.800
Take e-commerce platform
Jet, for example.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.320
The Jet mobile app
gives users an easy way

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.270
to browse products, view
prices, and purchase items

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.240
with the tap of a finger.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.760
Let's look at the
way Lauren Picasso,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.090
director of marketing at Jet,
thinks about re-engaging users.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:00.090
She says, we're always looking
for delightful and relevant

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.140
ways to reach our customers
and bring them back

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.070
to engage in our app.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.680
The marketing implications
of all of this

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.960
is you want to have insights
about your customers,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.890
and you want to be able to
reach them in a timely manner

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.900
with personalized messages
that compel them to act.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.540
And you want to do this for
all of your great products

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.695
and services that your
users care about at scale.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.300
Google is helping you get
more users back into your apps

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.440
with innovations in our
re-engagement solutions.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.220
I'm happy to announce that
AdWords advertisers can soon

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.470
extend their dynamic remarketing
campaigns to re-engage

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.695
their app users
with relevant ads

00:26:42.695 --> 00:26:47.330
as they browse over two million
websites and apps on our Google

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.900
Display Network.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.120
Let's imagine a hypothetical
example with Sam.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.500
Sam wants to go to New
York for the weekend.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.400
She's looking at flights while
in line at a coffee shop.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.060
She doesn't finish the purchase
because her latte gets ready.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.370
But with App
Dynamic Remarketing,

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.680
you can reach Sam with a
relevant and timely message

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.610
to remind her to book the trip.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.540
This is a great
experience for Sam,

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.450
and this is great
for your business

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:21.210
because now she's booking that
flight inside of your app.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.130
The fee-based
nature of these ads

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.000
mean that they're
perfect for businesses

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.390
that have a large
catalog of products,

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.755
whether that's running shoes,
hotel deals, or flight deals.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.130
Wish is a retail app
that makes shopping fun.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.030
Wish is part of our App
Dynamic Remarketing beta,

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.490
and they were impressed with the
high engagement and relevance

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.650
of the ads that were offered.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.860
According to Peter, who's the
co-founder and CEO of Wish,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.440
these ads help stretch
his team's budget further.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.060
He says, being able to show
customized ads to our users,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.110
based on past
interests, helps us

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.070
make the most of
every cent we invest.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.960
But it's not just relevance
of ads that we're going for

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.250
and ad engagement.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.740
It's really about
business impacts.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.150
MakeMyTrip is a popular flight
booking service based in India.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.920
People come to their
site and their app

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.790
to access great travel deals.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.320
MakeMyTrip also took
part in our beta,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.130
and our results suggest that
dynamic remarketing ads really

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.250
worked well for their app.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:38.430
Google's App Dynamic
Remarketing ads

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.385
saw five times
higher convergence.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.650
These are the actions that
drive MakeMyTrip's business,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.350
especially in a mobile
first market like India.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.482
We are encouraged with
the results of our beta,

00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:54.940
and over the coming
months, we will

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.980
be rolling out these innovations
to AdWords advertisers

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.590
globally.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.810
But driving engagement
you want from your apps

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.530
goes beyond just
reaching the right users

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.430
with the right message.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.720
It requires delivering a
frictionless user experience

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.270
no matter where the
user's accessing your app.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.520
As part of our
appification of our ads,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.440
we will soon be making
it easier for people

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.770
to take actions in your app
from Google Mobile search ads.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.960
We're providing new in--

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.290
we will be providing new
innovations for companies

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.870
that use ab links in their
Android adds to deep link users

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.820
to relevant content.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.890
And for ads we'll make this work
for all versions of Android,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.060
not just Android--

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.760
not just Marshmallow
and forward.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.160
In another hypothetical
example, a Wish user Tom

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.220
would be able to click on
a search ad on google.com

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.225
and go back to the
page in the Wish app

00:29:51.225 --> 00:29:54.710
that they were looking
at buying something,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.730
and because their
information is already there,

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.380
all of their preferences
there, he has a very easy time

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.190
to make that convergence,
and drive additional value

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.690
for your business.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.940
With re-engagement ads, we'll
be able to find users and bring

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.250
them back to your app.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.370
We'll be able to drive
additional value beyond just

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.720
the install and
make sure that you

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.510
get the most out of the
users that have your app.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.090
In closing, we've
come a long ways

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.350
from the days of interacting
with brands solely

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.300
in real world environments.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.080
Today we have the
opportunity to engage

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.940
with our users
across the world just

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.030
from the palm of
their hands, and we

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.040
have relationships
that span years,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.660
instead of days or months.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.270
You have a massive opportunity
to reach more customers

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:48.050
and drive more revenue and
value through your mobile app,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.960
and building
successful apps that

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.080
support your business doesn't
have to be hard work anymore.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.590
We want to make it easier for
you to bring your unique app

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.330
data, and our intent signals
and context knowledge

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.400
in a way that lets you
delight your customers

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.230
and find them at the right time.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.350
The good news is not only do
we have access to more customer

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:13.690
signals and data than ever, we
have the most critical piece

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.680
and that is the ability
to use all of this data.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.160
Machine Learning and
Google's innovative products

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.900
like Universal App Campaigns
and our re-engagement solutions

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.770
allow us to bring the right
message to the right user

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.390
at the right time.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.150
And this makes it easy to get
them to where they want to go,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.830
and that's into your
apps to make purchases.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.470
So app technology is
really becoming the enabler

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.620
that it was promised to be
and not just another channel

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.404
that you have to figure out.

00:31:42.404 --> 00:31:44.570
We look forward to seeing
how you can take advantage

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.610
of all of our recent
innovations to connect

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.940
to more of your
users and drive more

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.080
value from your mobile apps.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.520
On behalf of Belinda
and David and myself,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.027
I'd like to thank
you for your time,

00:31:58.027 --> 00:31:59.610
and we'll now open
it up to questions.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.360
