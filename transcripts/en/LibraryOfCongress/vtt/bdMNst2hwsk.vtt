&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.170
I hope you're having a good
time at the Book Festival.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.880
My name is Nora Krug, and I am
a book world editor and writer

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160
at the Washington Post,
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.020
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.750
First I want to give a word
of thanks to the cochairman

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.440
of the festival,
David Rubenstein

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.370
and the other generous sponsors
who've made this event possible.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.350
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.100
please note the information
in your program.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.740
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.330
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.290
to the microphone, you'll
be included in the videotape

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.100
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.330
Our guest this afternoon
is Sylvia Acevedo.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.060
She will be signing
at 4 PM over there.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.670
But for now we get to
meet her in person.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.850
Sylvia is a woman of
many hats and glasses.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.660
She is an engineer,
a businesswoman,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.890
and as you probably know her
best, as chief executive officer

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.670
of the Girl Scouts
of the United States.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.970
[applause].

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.560
Among her many philanthropic
contributions has been providing

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890
thousands of pairs of
glasses to children

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.870
who needed their
vision corrected.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.790
But long before that,
Sylvia spent her childhood

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.410
in Las Cruces, New Mexico,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.470
a place where she could
see a lot of stars.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.950
And it was those stars that
inspired her to make a rocket

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.300
that would earn her a
brownie science badge.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.450
The rocket didn't
actually get to the stars,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990
but her interest
in science grew.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.470
And despite some challenges in
her life, she stuck with it.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.910
She ended up at Stanford,
becoming one

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.200
of the first Hispanic
students, male or female,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.190
to earn a graduate engineering
degree from the university.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.020
She went on to fulfill
her childhood dream

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.130
and actually become
a rocket scientist

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.300
at the Jet Propulsion Labs.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.020
She later worked as an engineer

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.830
at IBM before becoming
an executive

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.250
at several Fortune 100
companies -- Apple and Dell.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.810
And in May of 2017,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.540
this longtime Girl
Scout became the CEO,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.920
and her life was transformed
by Girl Scouts and she has gone

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.560
on to transform Girl Scouts
itself by adding some science,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.740
technology, and engineering
to the program.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.250
And now she's added another
thing, which she is an author.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.610
And this week her memoir,
"Path to the Stars," comes out.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.170
It is a heartfelt story
about Sylvia's childhood

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.660
and shows how both the good and
the not so good that happened

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.210
to her led her to accomplish
all of the many things

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.950
that I have just described.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.810
It's a beautiful and inspiring
story that I'm going to share

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.700
with my own nine-year-old
daughter,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.110
and I hope that you
will share with yours.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.030
And now to tell you more
about her life and her book

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.510
and Girl Scouts is
Sylvia Acevedo.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.250
[ Applause ]

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.730
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Thank
you very much, Nora.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.140
All right, Girl Scout
families, let's hear it.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.440
[cheers]. That's wonderful.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.290
We have so many go-getters,
innovators, risk-takers,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.000
and leaders and the
families that love them.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.640
So thank very much
for coming today.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.320
So today I want to tell you
a little bit about my story,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.840
my book, "Path to the Stars."

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.100
There we go.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.060
So one of the things about
me is all my family was born

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.360
in Mexico.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.030
My parents were born in Mexico.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.330
My mom was born in Mexico.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.950
My dad was born in
El Paso, Texas.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.780
But my dad joined the military
and he was officer in the Army,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.540
and he was stationed

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.190
in Ellsworth Air Force
Base in South Dakota.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.460
And so what is up there?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.030
That's right, Mount Rushmore.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.890
I was born right
by Mount Rushmore.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.380
So my parents were so excited
about being in South Dakota,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.620
they bought all these different
things, like sugar bowls,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.630
cookie bowls that had that image

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.720
of the presidents
on Mount Rushmore.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.400
And so from when I
was a really girl,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.050
the image of the presidents
and the United States was just

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.840
in my heart and in my head.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.200
But then after that, my
parents decided to move back

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
to where they were from.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.170
And so -- can you
play the mic --

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.990
I mean, play the video please?

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.390
So we moved to a
universe which seemed

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.590
so far away from South Dakota.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.260
We moved all the
way to the desert

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.680
in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.980
Here we go.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.060
We moved to this
town, Las Cruces.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.090
And you can see,
it's the desert.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.950
There's only one desert
dryer than that desert,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.540
and that's the Sahara Desert.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.430
So it's really dry.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.170
But I loved it.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.860
I loved my family.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.030
I loved my friends in
that really small town.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.770
And when you wonder how
small the town was, you know,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.240
when you had to write
a letter to somebody,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.770
you just put their name and the
street, you didn't even have

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.150
to put a zip code, the
town was that small.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.320
And I loved that town because
you could see the stars.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.290
And we had these
beautiful Oregon mountains,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.420
and so you could just see
this really pretty scenery.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.640
And everything about my family
was happiness and light.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.510
But then one day my
brother, older brother,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.330
and my younger sister
and I were playing,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.110
and everything was fine.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.520
But the next day my
brother went to school

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.080
and my sister didn't wake up.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.030
And when I went to touch
her forehead, she was very,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.040
very hot and nonresponsive.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.970
And I went and got my mother.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.360
And my mother went
and touched my sister

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.040
and realized she was so sick.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.150
And we didn't have a
phone in the house.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.900
My mother didn't drive a car.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.810
And here she had a daughter
lifeless in her arms.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.340
She went running
down the street,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.320
knocking on doors,
crying to people.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.620
[foreign language] Help me!

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.750
Help me, please!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.770
Finally somebody found her and
got in a car and took my mom

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.060
and my sister to the hospital.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.710
There was a meningitis
epidemic that had swept

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.210
through our home and
our neighborhood.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.760
It's a serious disease,
some people die.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.830
I was worried my sister would
die, but she didn't die.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.070
But that insatiably hot fever
-- if any of you have kids --

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.280
your moms worry when
you have a fever,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.240
they worry because if
your brain gets too hot,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.050
your brain is forever changed.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.390
And that's what happened
to my sister.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.070
My sister, the one who was
the smartest of us all,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.760
the one who could light
up a room with her energy.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.420
She had become special

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.230
but in the Special
Olympics kind of way.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.100
And so for my mother that
moment was really hard.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.690
And she looked around and she
said, the only neighborhood --

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.740
the only neighborhood
where kids got sick

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.440
and there was a meningitis
epidemic was our neighborhood,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.980
the neighborhood
with dirt streets.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.900
And so for my mother, she
said, we're going to move.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.080
And at that point my
mother said to my father,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.100
I'm going to learn
to drive a car.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.330
And then once she learned to
drive a car, she started driving

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.980
around and finding
another neighborhood,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.340
a neighborhood with
paved streets.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.310
And so we did move, she
found a new neighborhood

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.960
with paved streets.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.350
And how many of you have
ever moved in the middle

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.440
of a school year to
a brand-new school?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440
Anybody have that experience?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.740
There's a few.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.090
Is that fun?

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.520
Not at all, not at all.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.320
And so at that moment
-- why is it not fun?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.030
Somebody said it.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.430
Because everybody's
already made friends, right.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.570
And so you come in the
middle of the school year

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.020
and everyone has
already made friends.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.350
And so I hated that school.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.400
And my teacher did
this very funny thing.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.770
My new teacher, she put
all the smart kids by her,

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.980
and then the ones that
didn't do as well,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.340
you got seated further away.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.560
So when I entered
the new classroom,

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.960
they put my desk
the furthest away.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.860
And the boy in front of
me turned around and said,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.330
now you are the dumbest
one in class.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.140
I hated that.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.140
So I would run home
from school every day.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.930
But one day, as I was
running home from school,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.570
this girl kept following me.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.780
And I would run faster and
she'd catch up with me,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.360
and she was very persistent.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.910
She was a go-getter.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.570
She was a Brownie.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.750
And she said, why don't you
come to Brownies with me?

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.320
And I said, no.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000
And she said, well,
we're in front

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.230
of your house, go
ask your mother.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.300
So I went in to ask my mom.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.700
Mom, can I go?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.650
Have you ever asked
your mom a question

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.110
like you want the
answer to be no?

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:22.770
So I said, mom, you don't have
to say yes, but this girl,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.000
she wants me to go
to this activity.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.300
You don't have to say yes.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.600
But my mother was excited,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.250
because for the first time I
was showing some enthusiasm

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.130
around something
at the new school.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.890
So she just wanted to
know where I would be,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.430
and she said yes, go ahead.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.110
So I went to that program
and I fell in love.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.350
And there I was being a Brownie.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.510
You can see, look
at how old I was.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.450
I was missing a tooth, right.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.310
I didn't care much
about fashion.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.560
Look at my tie, right.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.240
But what I discovered at
Girl Scouts and in Brownies,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.440
that there were girls
like me, girls that liked

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.130
to do fun things, that
liked to do active things.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.430
We did bike rides.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.730
We did camping.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.540
We did all sorts of fun things.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.040
And it really opened
up my mind and my eyes.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.520
And I liked it so much
that the next year I wanted

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.340
to join again.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.460
But then when I saw that all
the fun things we had planned,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.800
I said to my troop leader,
my family can't afford it.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.160
You see, my family lived
paycheck to paycheck.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.460
We lived in near poverty.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.760
We didn't have savings.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.850
And I said, how am I
going to afford this?

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.440
And my troop leader looked
at me and said, don't worry,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.870
you know what we're going to do?

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.550
We're going to sell cookies.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.840
And the cookie program
changed my life.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.590
The reason is, is that when
you're raised in poverty

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.800
or near poverty or living
paycheck to paycheck,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.380
you don't know how to
create opportunity.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.210
And what the cookie
program taught me

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.060
and what my troop leader
taught me is, you set goals,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.220
and then you breakdown that
goal into smaller parts.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.840
And then once you have
the smaller parts,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.170
you do those little things.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.690
And pretty soon you've
achieved your goal.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.840
And also, you set your budget.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.230
And all those things
taught me so much.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.410
The other thing that
she taught me is never

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.150
to give up and persistence.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.840
So she taught me a life lesson
that I keep to this day.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.780
Never walk away from a sale

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.120
until you've heard
no three times.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.990
So the first time I
started selling cookies,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.890
I went to everyone I knew -- I
went to people in my church --

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.860
they all bought, but I
still hadn't made my goal.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.420
I needed to sell more cookies.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.590
So I realized I was going
to have to talk to people

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.890
that I'd only seen

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.620
in the neighborhood
but never talked to.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.170
So I went to the
neighbor and I asked her

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.430
if she would buy
cookies and she said, no.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.300
And no one had ever
said no to me.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.750
And I said, uh-oh.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.350
But what had my troop
leader said?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.070
You can't walk until away
until you hear no three times.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.280
So then I said, is there
anybody else at that house

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.730
that would want to buy cookies?

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.930
And she said no.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.200
And I stayed there,
and she looked

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.130
at me like, I've said no, go.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.000
And I looked at her like,
I've only heard no two times.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.730
So I look around her and
I look at her, and I said,

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.540
is there anybody's day
that you would make

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.820
if you bought a Girl
Scout cookie?

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.270
And she said -- okay,
she bought a box, okay?

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.510
So that taught me an important
lesson in persistence,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.000
a lesson that I carried
my entire life.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.090
The other thing is, I
learned about counting

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.800
up my cookies and
my cookie cash.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.040
And that really taught me a
love of numbers and of science.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.310
And one of the great
things about Girl Scouts is

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.160
that my troop leader saw
me looking at the stars.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.460
And so when she saw me looking

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.070
at the stars, she
remembered that.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.150
And later on she asked me, why
don't you earn a science badge?

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:07.000
And I decided to make a science
badge by making an Estes rocket.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.390
And so to earn my science
badge, I made an Estes rocket.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.330
And what I learned is you have
to get the chemicals right,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.630
which are like the ingredients.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.800
You have to get the
sequence right and you have

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.100
to get the heat right.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.880
And when you do that, the rocket
finally went into the sky.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.350
And that's a lot like cooking.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.080
Cooking, you have to get
the ingredients right.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.900
You have to get the order right.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.200
You got to get the heat right.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.110
And then you'll have success.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.190
The other thing I learned in
Girl Scouts is I loved math,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.000
and I didn't know that before.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.830
But as I counted
up my cookie cash,

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.590
I counted up my cookie
dollars, I realized,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.660
that was a lot of fun.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.690
And then I also learned
to make things.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.130
I wanted to make a duffel bag.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.570
But there was no pattern
for making a duffel bag.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.650
So my mother said to me, how are
you going to make a duffel bag,

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.960
especially a duffel bag
that has round ends?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.530
And I said, don't worry,
mom, I did the math.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.190
So I made the drawings, and then
I used this thing called pi,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.410
and that tells you what
the circumference is.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.510
And my mother said to me,
I'm glad you like math, meha.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.490
So I was able to make
that great duffel bag.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.120
And from those experiences
I learned so much

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.910
in Girl Scouts, but
so did my mother.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.960
My mother, who only spoke
Spanish, through Girl Scouts,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.930
my troop leaders befriended her.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.440
They taught her English and
then they also taught her

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.440
that she could become a citizen.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.000
So she had a green card

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.430
but my father had never
encouraged her to be a citizen.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.680
And my troop leaders
encouraged her to be a citizen.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.990
So when I jumped up and
bridged from Brownie to Junior,

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.520
my mother had a bridging
ceremony herself,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.130
and she became a US citizen.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.000
My mom also ran a
Girl Scout troop

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.240
for my sister's developmentally
disabled class.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.390
So my sister was able to
be a Girl Scout as well.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.060
Now, one of the great things
I've learned later on is,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.390
how do people escape when they
sometimes grow up in poverty

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.620
or their families don't
have a lot of money.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.940
What I've learned is Girl Scouts
taught me there's four ways

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.210
to get out of poverty, and
Girl Scouts did all four

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.510
of those for me.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.810
It helped me set a goal.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:37.580
I had a caring adult, that troop
leader who looked out for me.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.170
It taught me that I had an
amazing skill, which is math.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.480
My math skills because of
Girl Scouts became so strong

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.600
that I kept taking
math and I was able

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.900
to be a rocket scientist.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.380
And then also I learned I
didn't have to live that way,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.770
that it was too painful to
stay, and I could get out.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.540
So when I was in fourth grade --

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.600
I don't know how
many of you see this.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.890
That's Stanford University.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.450
But I saw a picture like that
when I was in fourth grade.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.750
And I said to my teacher,
I want to go there.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.340
And my teacher walked
up to me and she said,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.640
that's Stanford University,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.180
that's one of the best
places in the world.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.310
And she said, and you're a
smart girl, you can go there.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.520
So fourth grade, I decided I
was going to go to Stanford.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.210
And as it turns out, not
only did I go to Stanford,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.000
I was able to graduate
from Stanford University.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.830
And I've had amazing
experiences.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.640
I was actually -- I worked
as a rocket scientist.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.090
There I am working
on the Davis gun

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.470
in the Tonopah Desert
at the test range.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.910
Here I am loading up
a missile as well.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.340
And then I worked at NASA

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.520
at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratories in Pasadena.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.980
And I worked on two missions.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.940
One was the Voyager II,
which went by Jupiter

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.160
and its moon Lo and Europa.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.870
And so I got to do all
this amazing analysis.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.360
It was the first time we
ever saw these great images

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.290
of Jupiter up close.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.670
And I got to see them --

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.380
you know, was one of the
first people to see them,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.370
and that was so exciting.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.670
The other thing was I worked

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.310
on a mission called
Solar Polar Solar Probe.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.440
It's just recently been
renamed Parker Solar Probe,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.900
and it just launched
a few weeks ago.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.150
And I worked on that
project decades ago.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.910
And it was so great to
see it finally launch.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.780
Because when you work on
something that's going

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.990
to the sun, you have to
think about so many things.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.290
Like think about it.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.400
What is the sun?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.700
It's solar.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.300
It's hot. So how do you have a
spacecraft that gets that close?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.600
How about radiation?

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.920
How about solar wind?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.120
What if it gets hit
by asteroids?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.420
There are all these
things that you have

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.250
to think and factor into that.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.600
And so took decades.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.540
And that was so much
fun to be part

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.100
of the initial planning
phases of it.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.010
So I've had a great
experience of being --

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.780
because from being a
little girl, I've been able

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.930
to be a rocket scientist
and I've been able

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.900
to fly through the sky.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.790
I've been able to go para
jumping with the Golden Knights.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.860
Imagine being three
miles high in the sky

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.390
and jumping from a plane.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.950
It was an exciting experience.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:35.720
And who would've thought
that that girl born

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.780
by Mount Rushmore would grow

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.870
up to have all these
amazing experiences?

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.640
And I knew I was able to have
these amazing experiences

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.000
because I was a Girl Scout.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.540
And now I'm the CEO of
the Girl Scout of the USA.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:58.710
[applause].

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.310
So I know we have lot of the
Girl Scouts in the audience.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.570
And I wanted to make sure we
have some time for questions.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.450
And I know we have
young Girl Scouts

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.510
and we have alumni Girl Scouts
and we have people who care

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.260
about Girl Scouts or just care
about the rising generation.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.160
So you please go up to the mics.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.780
Now, one of the questions people
ask me is: How about boys,

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.080
do they like the book?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.070
And I have to say boys
like the book as well.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.040
There's stories about
basketball.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.470
There's stories about cars.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.240
There's stories about rockets.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.960
So they tend to like it as well.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.980
I see we have a crowd,
so go ahead.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.570
&gt;&gt; Why do you write?

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.990
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Why do I write?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.030
I love that question!

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.660
What happened was, I was talking
to kids like you, and there were

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.780
so many of them that wanted
to talk to me about my story,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.010
that I realized the only
way I could reach so many

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.560
of them was if I wrote a book.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.530
And so the book could be
in every school in America,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.350
so they could be inspired.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.220
It's a good question, thank you.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.840
Over here?

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.620
&gt;&gt; What difficulties
did you have to overcome

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.050
in order to get into NASA?

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.350
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Great question.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.790
The challenges of getting in.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.850
So first of all, your math has
to be really, really good, okay.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.310
So you have to keep
taking hard math classes.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.900
The other thing is when you
work in an all-male environment,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.230
you have to be ready for that.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.780
So how many of you saw
the movie Hidden Figures?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.080
A lot of you.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.910
Do you remember the
bathroom scene?

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.750
Okay, so what I like to say is,
they at least had a bathroom.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.060
When I started working,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.150
there were not even
any bathrooms for me.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.820
So one of the challenges I
had to overcome was to figure

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.230
out where the closest
women's bathrooms were.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.930
And they were far away, so I
had to bring a bike in to work

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.290
and drink just a
little bit of water.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.790
And when I had to go to the
bathroom, I would hurry up

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.580
and go to those other places.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.480
It took six weeks, but then
finally the other engineers

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.390
decided, okay, she's not
going to quit, she's got to,

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.290
you know -- we're going
to bring in a bathroom.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.940
So they brought me my own
bathroom that said hers on it.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.770
So you have to be persistent.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.270
You have to be resilient,
you know.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.700
And, for example, a lot of
the equipment didn't fit me,

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.650
like you'd have to
wear overalls.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.300
Like if you saw that picture
of me working on the Davis gun,

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.410
you might not have noticed
but I had to put duct tape,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.710
because it didn't fit me.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.620
It wasn't made for
somebody my size.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.920
But I never gave up.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.270
I was persistent.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.230
Okay, another question.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm one of
the older Girl Scouts.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.850
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Hi there.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.150
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Sylvia too.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.820
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Oh, great name.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:47.810
&gt;&gt; So we adults know that
young people hear what we say,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.610
but they learn more
from what we do.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.730
So what did you learn --
what one thing did you learn

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.950
from the people you
saw and heard

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.800
from that shaped you today?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.680
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: So, you know,
I really learned persistence.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.670
I think I was talking
about that story

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.520
where my troop leader wouldn't
let us walk away from a sale

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.710
until we heard no three times.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.140
And I saw her do that as well.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.080
So it's so important to
not just say be persistent

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.570
but model it as well.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.050
Very good question.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.350
Over here.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.850
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
type of Girl Scout cookie?

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.700
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: My
favorite type of --

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.510
that's a really good question!

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.580
So I will tell you, when
my mother was a cookie --

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.020
she ran the cookie campaign.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.070
And one year we had to be the
cookie cupboard at our house.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.740
And we didn't have a garage,
so we moved our furniture

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.790
to the backyard, and our
entire house was stacked

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.240
floor-to-ceiling
with cookie boxes.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.690
And to walk down our hall,
you had to walk sideways.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.430
But there was one cookie
that I wanted to be

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.630
in my bedroom stacked
floor-to-ceiling,

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.330
and that would be -- thin mints!

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.630
It's thin mints!

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.680
Good question.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.470
Okay.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.770
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.070
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Hi.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.770
&gt;&gt; Alumni Girl Scout
and troop leader.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.420
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Yes, thank you.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.340
&gt;&gt; What is one piece of
advice that you would give

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.460
to our current Girl Scouts

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.610
so that they can
succeed in their life?

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.670
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: So first
thing that you can do to succeed

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.810
in your life is be a Girl Scout.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.700
I mean, half of all of our
female elected officials

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.750
in America were Girl Scouts.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.490
Three-fourths of our
senators, Girl Scouts.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.040
Almost every female
governor, a Girl Scout.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.340
[cheering].

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.360
And almost every
astronaut in space,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.680
female astronauts, a Girl Scout.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.250
When I go to Silicon Valley,

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.470
almost all the female
leaders, Girl Scouts.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.770
So the one thing I would say

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.370
that you have an amazing
advantage in Girl Scout

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.910
that you don't have in any other
youth organization is getting

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.230
your gold award.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.000
If you get your gold
award, that's like helping

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.390
to write your college essay.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.070
And there's all these
scholarships available.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.430
This man came to my office and
he wanted to give me a hug.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.600
And I said, fine, but why?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.200
And then he said, because my
daughter's gold award project

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.790
was so good, it was
her college essay,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.610
and she got a four-year
scholarship at one

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.470
of the top universities
in America all paid

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.480
for because of her gold award.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.240
So the gold award gets
your kid into college,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.820
top colleges, with scholarships.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.120
So I would really
encourage them to do that.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.020
Okay, next one.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.420
&gt;&gt; What was the name of the girl

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.420
that inspired you
to be a Girl Scout?

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.720
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Oh, what was the name

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.020
of the girl that invited me?

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.340
Actually, I know her name.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.840
Her name is Sylvia Black.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.660
So we've got a lot
of Sylvias going on.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.960
But I remember her.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.260
Thank you.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.410
&gt;&gt; What changed your mind
about going to Brownies?

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.710
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Great question,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.390
I write about that in the book.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.480
Because once I was there --

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.190
remember, my sister had been
sick, my family had gone

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.550
through a big trauma
and tragedy.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:12.780
And when we were doing a craft
project, making sit upons --

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.570
so we were cutting
fabric and newspapers

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.110
and weaving them together
so we'd have something

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.770
to sit upon -- how many
of you know sit upons?

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.480
Okay, great, you know sit upons.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.680
Well, we were sitting in the
circle and I handed the scissors

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.010
to the girl pointy edge first.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.640
And our troop leader stopped
and she asked the Brownies

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.090
to demonstrate the safe
way to pass scissors,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.400
which is always not
the pointy edge, right.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.000
And so they did that
and they also told me,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.300
never run with scissors.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.930
Okay, so I never knew
there was any rules

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.050
about passing scissors, much
less one and two rules, right.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.430
So at that moment I realized,
if Girl Scouts cared enough

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.980
about me about how
I pass scissors,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.640
imagine how much more
they would care about me.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.880
And it turns out they
cared about me so much,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.180
and it changed my life.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.600
So that was the moment I said,
I'm going to be in Girl Scouts.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.960
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Thank you.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.260
&gt;&gt; I forget.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.560
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: It's okay.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.190
I'm glad you're a Girl Scout.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.490
Yes?

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.790
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.090
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Hi.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.330
&gt;&gt; What changed your
life about doing math?

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.340
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: What changed
my life about doing math?

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.860
That I really enjoyed counting.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.290
But when was in Girl Scouts,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.650
I didn't realize
math had a purpose.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.090
And so when I was
counting my cookie cash

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.600
and counting the
number of boxes I sold,

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.170
I realized that math could
help me reach my goals.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.300
And that made math fun for me.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.260
So after that, I
realized math was fun.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.460
And so math became a way that I
learned I could make my goals.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.510
So that, when I was in
Girl Scouts around fourth

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.200
or fifth grade, that helped me.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.370
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: I know
her, her name is Amanda.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.630
And Amanda wants to be an
astronaut, right, Amanda?

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.300
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.600
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Yay!

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.860
&gt;&gt; So did you see
Voyager II launch?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.200
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Okay, no, I didn't get

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.730
to watch Voyager II launch.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:17.210
It was already in orbit when
I started working at JPL.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.660
But thank you, good
question, Amanda.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.050
&gt;&gt; How did you build the rocket?

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.350
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Okay, good question.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.350
How did I build the
rocket, the Estes Rocket?

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.790
It came in a kit, and I actually
had to buy several kits,

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.900
because I did it wrong the
first two or three times.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.050
And my parents made me use my
allowance, so it took me a while

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.350
to actually earn that badge.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.540
Because you to be careful.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.320
And I learned that you had to
read the directions just right,

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.210
and you had to get
the heat just right,

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.240
and then you put
the kit together.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.960
And when I did that, I finally
was able to get it to launch.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.260
But very good question.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.560
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.100
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Thank you.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.920
&gt;&gt; Which kind of
cookies do you like?

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.450
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: She asked
what kind of cookies do I like.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.320
I like all cookies, I
like all the cookies.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.620
I do have a little bit

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.490
of a favorite preference
for thin mints.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.740
But I'll eat a Girl
Scout cookie anytime.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.450
Good question.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.980
&gt;&gt; Why did you want to
be a rocket scientist?

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.810
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: Why did I
want to be a rocket scientist?

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:26.320
You know, when I was making
my rocket for Girl Scouts,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.300
you know, it took
me several times.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.360
And the thing that
amazed me was,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.090
how come it doesn't just launch?

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:37.000
How come it can't just get
up off the desert sand?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.560
And so I learned about
this thing called gravity.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.870
And so to me I became
fascinated with,

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.360
how do you break gravity's grip?

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.420
And so the rest of my life,
I was always thinking,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.120
how do I break gravity's grip?

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.980
And then I thought rocket
scientists, that's what they do.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.330
So that's why I went to work at
NASA at JPL, working on that.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.190
I didn't want to
be an astronaut.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.040
All right, we have time for
a couple more questions.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.330
&gt;&gt; When did you start
being an author?

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.720
And what was the first
badge that you got?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.000
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Okay, great questions.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.080
I started being an author four
years ago, when I was talking

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.810
to kids and they wanted to get
my book and I knew I needed

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.200
to reach more of them.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.570
And I think my first
badge was a cycling badge.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.870
Great question.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.210
Okay, coming up to end.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.050
&gt;&gt; Since you liked
the stars so much,

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.300
why weren't you an astronaut?

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.970
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: You
know, I was more interested

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:34.220
in how do you get a rocket to
leave earth and breaking gravity

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.420
than actually being
up in the space.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.020
That was a different
interest of mine.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.430
I was never interested in being
a rocket -- I mean an astronaut.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.960
It's just a different interest.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.970
And I'm glad I did what I did.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.480
I have friends that
are astronauts,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.470
and that's fantastic,
but I'm glad

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.710
that I lived the
life that I did.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.770
All right.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.070
&gt;&gt; Last one.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.990
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo:
Last one, okay.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.380
Go ahead. All right, so
we're going to wrap it up.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.380
So what I want to thank you.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.670
The book is in English
and Spanish.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.570
In Spanish it's "Camino a las
Estrellas, Path to the Stars."

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.580
Make sure you have
it in your libraries.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.260
Make sure that you get it.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.250
I hope that it inspires to
have your own dreams come true

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.680
and your own path to the stars.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.980
Thank you very much.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.410
[cheering].

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.580
And because we're so many girls,

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.270
why don't we do Make
New Friends?

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.070
How's that?

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.370
All right, ready?

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.670
1, 2, 3.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.970
&gt;&gt; [Group Singing -
Make New Friends]:

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.230
Make new friends,
but keep the old.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.730
One is silver, the
other is gold.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:46.040
A circle is round,
it has no end.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.660
That's how long, I
will be your friend.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.890
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Acevedo: All right,
thank you very much, everybody!

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.680
See you at the book signing.
