00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.660
A man is with his female partner; foreplay is going well.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.960
It's time for more. But suddenly, a problem occurs.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.460
She looks at him expecting him to increase his efforts, but nothing happens.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.740
He has suffered what the French writer, Stendhal, termed, 'a fiasco'.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.920
He feels ashamed and desperate.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.920
He sees himself as a laughing stock, not quite a man, not fit for a relationship.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.680
His partner is worried too.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.120
She suspects he doesn't find her attractive anymore, never really loved her,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.640
or is perhaps, deep down, gay.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.540
If it happens repeatedly, she might start to wonder if they should even be together…

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.880
In a great many cases, the cause of impotence is not physical, but psychological;

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.740
and it isn't a lack of desire-- it's a mis-founded notion of respect.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.980
The man, certainly, is turned on, but his desire is joined up with a fear.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.940
He's worried, somewhere inside, that he's imposing something unwelcome and dirty

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.120
on a partner who couldn't really possibly want something so crude as much as he does.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.360
Sex seems, somewhere in his unconscious, sinister and debased--

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.720
something one might share with an acquaintance one doesn't really know or respect much,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.220
or can explore alone with a porn site.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.220
But it wouldn't be fitting for a soulmate one properly loves.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.100
After an entirely erroneous, but nevertheless, powerful sense of kindness and consideration

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.140
for the beloved's imagined feelings,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.680
the man holds back from pursuing what he'd really like,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.040
and takes early retirement for his own sexuality.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.780
One of the most basic facts about the relationship between children and their parents

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.860
is that there is love, but can be no sex.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.200
A young boy receives care, consideration, and tenderness from his mother,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.920
but of course, nothing remotely sexual.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.160
From this very sensible arrangement, one problematic idea is born.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.180
The thought that a mother, and more broadly, women who are as lovable and admirable as she is

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.740
must be without sexual desire.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.520
However naïve that sounds, that's how it can seem to a young boy who gets a lot of things wrong,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.720
and whose attitudes have a surprising afterlife, even in the adult mind.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.840
A mother may be witty, clever, and very attentive to a boy's needs,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500
but she doesn't, surely, have any libido.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.660
This necessary and beautifully protective illusion is what can lead men to suspect

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.960
that the more a woman has a status akin to their mother, the less likely she is to be fully sexual.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.500
The answer to this admittedly, hugely naïve, but properly distressing fear

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.420
is to reassure the impotent males' unconscious of a basic fact--

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.860
that of course his mother was a sexual being.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.860
She, like almost all women, loved sex, probably had plenty of it, and even more in fantasy.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.640
It was simply that out of care and consideration for her son, she didn't let on;

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.140
out of love, she tactfully made out:

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.420
she was, as it were, a virgin.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.160
Rather than simply seeing impotence as a problem to be treated with pills,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.920
we can recognize that it's primarily a condition to be addressed by an idea.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.360
The thought that rough, crude, intense, unihibited sex isn't simply a low, demeaning activity

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.380
that men are interested in, and nice women aren't.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.200
It's a hugely positive, psychologically enriching, and not at all sinister process that everyone,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.500
male and female, benefits from.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.020
The emotions around sexuality that seem so opposed to civilized, respectable life--

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.860
the ruthlessness, crudeness, and occasional moments of brutishness--

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.240
are not negative.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.120
They are utterly compatible with kindness and love, more generally.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.180
When impotence strikes, it may be time, in the nicest way

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.980
for the male unconscious to enter fully into adulthood,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.400
and recognize and honor the plain truths of male, and female, sexuality.
