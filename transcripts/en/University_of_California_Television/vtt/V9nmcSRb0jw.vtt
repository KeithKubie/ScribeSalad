00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:11.270
- [David] The basic problem I address here
is one of how did languages come to do

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.570
what they do in terms of taking small
meaningless units and combining them to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.620
make meaningful words. So using some
English examples: sat, sit, sad. Each time

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.330
I change one of the sounds we get a
different word. Sat, bat, fat, same thing.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.550
So what I'm going to argue for is that
this is a commentatorial system and by

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.460
looking at sign language evidence, we can
see what things are like in some ways

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:03.580
before such a system evolves and get some
clues about how such a system evolves.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.920
I'm going to be using primarily data from
American Sign Language and a lot of people

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:19.380
when they see signs they say, "Oh, it's
all iconic." And a lot of the signs look

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.300
iconic, i.e.that you could guess the
meaning from seeing the sign. So, for

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:34.650
example, drink, bird, house, all of those
you can get a pretty good idea of the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.120
meaning from the sign itself.
However, those look like. . . they look

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.910
like gestures. You're gesturing something
about the meaning. But really in a mature

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:58.630
sign language like American Sign Language,
it has the same type of combinatoriality

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:07.000
within the word that I illustrated with
those examples from English.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.840
And the signs consist of smaller parts
combined in different ways to produce

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.300
different signs with different meanings.
To find out what these smaller parts are

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.790
we have to find examples of signs that
differ in only one respect. And I'm going

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.800
to show you some examples now where we can
identify the smaller parts of the signs by

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.720
comparing signs that differ in only one
respect. And at the same time be

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.000
illustrating a second point that in most
you cases you cannot guess the meaning

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.790
from seeing the sign if you don't already
know the language. So, first I'll show

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:00.990
some signs that differ only in handshake
versus, versus.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.190
And unless you know the language you
probably don't know that this means

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.130
change, this means translate, and this
means interpret. Similarly, bird which I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:23.150
showed you, print or publish, 20. These
show that the place of articulation,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.370
there'll be a lot of that later, makes a
difference. So bird articulated at the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.630
edge of the lip, print or publish on the
other hand.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:49.580
And signs can differ only in movement,
name, short, knife, egg.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.190
All of those I don't think you would guess
the meaning from seeing them the first

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.340
time and illustrate how signs can differ
in movement. And we'll concentrate on

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:08.460
these three things. So each sign consists
of a hand shape, a place of articulation,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.540
and a movement. There's also sometimes
orientation plays a role. I will set those

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.400
cases aside since they won't be essential
to the points that are made here.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.660
Each sign language has an inventory of
hand shapes, places of articulation, and

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.480
movements, and it's a combinatorial
phonological system that puts them

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:43.490
together yielding different signs with
different meanings. Some signs are fully

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:53.460
iconic. So bird, all of its smaller parts
which I'll call formatives, all of its

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:01.830
formatives contribute to the iconicity.
The hand shape is L, the movement: the

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.630
index touches the thumb twice, place of
articulation, POA, is at the edge of the

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.810
lip.
And all three of those contribute to the

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.380
iconicity and bird shares hand shape and
movement as I showed you before with

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:27.050
print/publish, or 20. And the place of
articulation is the same as in drink or in

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:37.090
famous also at the edge of the lips.
So bird is fully iconic, all of these

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:44.740
contribute to the iconicity. Some signs
are partially iconic and then an example

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.800
of that is heart one. I'll be talking
altogether about two signs, heart. This is

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:56.650
an older form, later we'll see a newer
form. So that is this heart, very iconic.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.310
The movement: a heart shape. Place of
articulation, left side of chest about

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:11.390
where the heart is located.
But there is an arbitrary element, the

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.870
hand shape is this open eight hand shape
which has nothing to do with heart. It's

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:24.540
completely arbitrary. Some signers
interprets the heart shape the way I've

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.080
been doing it more or less the heart shape
you see on Valentines, for some it's an

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:36.070
oval, for some it's a circle.
An important distinction throughout this

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:47.610
talk is the distinction between gestures
and signs. And so, I've coined a notation

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.330
here to keep them different. On the left
is a gesture. Trace a heart shape over

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:59.670
region of the heart which could be done
with any finger or fingers or combination

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:07.470
as opposed to the sign. So the gesture is
in these double angled brackets, a sign

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:16.670
has these three formatives and each of
those is enclosed in square brackets. Very

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:23.670
important here is the gestural hypothesis
that iconic signs evolved from holistic

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:31.100
gestures. So that the sign heart on the
right evolved from the gesture on the

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:41.770
left. And a piece of evidence for that, if
that is the case that the sign heart one

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:47.880
evolved from the gesture heart, this
hypothesis makes a prediction that early

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.310
on there would have been variation in the
finger or fingers used to trace the heart

00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:01.520
shape since that hand shape plays no role
in the gesture itself which is just trace

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.170
the heart shape.
It doesn't say anything about which finger

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:13.300
or fingers. And in fact there is evidence
that that is correct, that there was

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:20.270
variation early on. I'm indebted to
Brandon Scates for bringing to my

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.630
attention that an 1884 book, "Deaf mutes
describe a small surface over heart and

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:33.600
pointing downwards," saying nothing about
which finger or fingers. And Higgins,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.850
1923, "Right index points to heart or
right thumb and index trace shape of heart

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.950
in region of heart or both index tips
trace shape of heart." And notice that

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:50.140
none of these are the open eight hand
shape used for heart in ASL.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:58.860
So this is one kind of evidence for the
gestural origin of the sign heart. Now,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:09.340
what distinguishes one sign from another?
And I'm going to show you two signs now

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:22.110
that differ only in place of articulation.
And this one means Canada, this one means

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:30.060
Yom Kippur.
And the only difference is whether I do it

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.820
at the place of articulation on my right
side here of the chest or the left side.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.980
Okay. Now, for those of you who do not
know ASL, I'm going to do a sign and you

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:54.010
tell me which it means. Canada or Yom
Kippur?

00:11:54.190 --> 00:12:01.770
How many say Canada? How many say Yom
Kippur? Okay. It looks about evenly split

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:09.190
to the extent I can see.
Well, actually this means Canada, but

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.640
before I said this means Canada and this
means Yom Kippur, why doesn't this mean

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:21.610
Yom Kippur? I'm doing it with my left
hand. Before, I did it with my right hand.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.920
What this shows is that the relevant
distinction is not between right and left

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:36.500
on the chest. And I'll introduce the terms
ipsilateral. This is Latin, ipsi is same,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:45.370
lateral is side. An ipsilateral sign or
sign's place of articulation is on the

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:53.560
same side as the articulating hand.
Contralateral signs are articulated on the

00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:00.160
opposite side. So Canada, ipsilateral and
I'm right-handed. This is Canada, this is

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:08.230
Yom Kippur. A left-handed person, this is
Canada, this is Yom Kippur. The crucial

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:18.230
thing is whether it's ipsilateral or
contralateral. Now, let's go back to heart

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:31.250
and I'm going to show you the other sign
for heart which I'm right-handed, so this

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:40.410
is heart. And that seems like the place of
articulation is iconically motivated. But

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:49.800
how would have a left hander sign heart?
Why? Because it's contralateral. I'm

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:56.670
right-handed I sign it over here where the
heart is located more or less. But for a

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.710
left hander, it's also contralateral so we
sign over here.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:09.000
So this is an important fact and this
illustrates the major transformation that

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:20.220
has taken place in what I'm talking about
today. Namely that the formal

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.370
characterization of place of articulation
as either ipsilateral or contralateral

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:37.510
trumps the iconicity. These things started
out iconic with the movement being iconic,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.050
the place of articulation where the heart
is located.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:50.980
But once they evolve from gestures to
signs, we now have a system where the

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:59.230
formal properties of the signs take over
and trump the original iconic motivation

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:11.350
of the form coming from the original
iconic gesture. This gives us a way of

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:18.150
seeing formal properties of signs as
opposed to the gestures from which they

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.310
derive. And right and left have no place,
but ipsilateral, contralateral are

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.680
essential. So let me show you some other
signs now where you can see the same

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:34.790
thing. So direction of movement is either
ipsilateral or contralateral. So I'll show

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:42.640
you the signs for right and left. When I
sign right, my hand moves to the right.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:49.520
When I sign left, my hand moves to the
left. But really, when I sign right, my

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:55.000
hand is moving in the ipsilateral
direction and when I sign left my hand is

00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:03.130
moving in the contralateral direction. So,
when a left-handed person signs right, the

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:08.510
hand moves in the ipsilateral direction
which is to the left.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.600
And when a left-handed person signs left,
the hand moves in the contralateral

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.240
direction which is to the right. This
shows very clearly that what's relevant is

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.070
the formal properties of the place of
articulation, not the original iconic

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.660
motivation which you see in the
right-handed signing but the left-handed

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:40.610
signing turns that on its head. Also, I
want to dispel any idea you might have

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:49.100
gotten that the gestural source of
particular signs might only have been in

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:56.940
the distant past and also that there's any
physical difference necessarily between

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.910
gestures and signs.
So the sign Yom Kippur that I've been

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:08.800
illustrating has a gestural source which
is this, which is physically exactly the

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:15.020
same as the sign. It's done in the
synagogue service on Yom Kippur. There's a

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.400
prayer, it's a communal confession of
various kinds of sins. Each type of sin,

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:28.500
as it's mentioned, the worshipers go like
this. What do the left handers do? This is

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.680
the gesture that is the source of the sign
Yom Kippur, physically identical to it.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:42.530
For left handers in the synagogue service,
it goes to the place where the heart is

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:54.780
located which is here on the left side.
But when they sign the sign Yom Kippur

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.240
which is evolved from that gesture, it's
on the opposite side, the contralateral

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:07.650
side because Yom Kippur is a contralateral
sign.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:19.280
Okay. So this difference between gestures
and signs is the key thing. The signs have

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:25.810
certain formal properties. They evolved
from gestures, but once they have these

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:35.620
formal properties they can turn out quite
differently. And we can generalize, and

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:45.690
some of the other papers have talked about
this, Mark Aranoff and Carol Padden's just

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:52.490
before this. A more general gestural
hypothesis that sign languages have their

00:18:52.670 --> 00:19:01.810
earliest stages in gestural communication
and have evolved from that to current sign

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:08.060
languages.
And a very great confirmation of this is

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.680
the Al-Sayyid Bedouin sign language that
Mark Aranoff just mentioned in his

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.070
presentation where he and three others
have been studying this new Bedouin sign

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:27.780
language in Southern Israel which does not
have a combinatorial system, a

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:37.820
combinatorial phonological system putting
parts together as we saw here. Okay, one

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.550
last point. Comparative cross-species
evidence from language experiments with

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.250
chimpanzees. These are chimpanzees that
people signed with for years and years.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:55.950
Rivas did 22 hours of video tape and
eliminated all cases where they just

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.690
repeated what the human had signed within
the previous five seconds.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:07.500
Here's the number of different signs each
of these chimps produced and their four

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:15.620
most frequent signs accounted for 58%,
45%, etc.of their total output. The main

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:22.110
thing is after years of this, why is their
vocabulary so small? The explanation: that

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:29.090
chimps learn no signs at all, only a small
set of holistic gestures. And a deeper

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:38.210
explanation for that is that they don't
have the combinatorial abilities that

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:44.940
humans have to have a combinatorial system
putting meaningful words or signs together

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:52.220
from smaller units. This suggests strongly
that these combinatorial abilities of

00:20:52.400 --> 00:21:01.670
humans developed after the split between
the human and chimpanzee lineages. Thank
