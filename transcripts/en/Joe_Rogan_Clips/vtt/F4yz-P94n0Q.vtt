1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.460
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.030
another one people got really mad about this is this weirdly the one we got the

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.750
biggest reaction to.
Um,
and uh,

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.070
to the extent that I'm a little hesitant talking about it cause it will start to

5
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.980
show storm every time I do what means?
Uh,
no,

6
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.900
actually we have not done a whole one on vaccines.
Uh,

7
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:17.400
but we really should cause it's coming back.

8
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.360
I used to think that vaccines was like kind of done as a topic and like we've

9
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:25.200
gone through it is really,
it is really backing.
It is big.
Um,
but no,

10
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.760
we didn't want on Alpha males,

11
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:31.761
we had an episode about dating and we did one on how the idea of the Alpha male

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.900
doesn't exist in humans.
Like if you talk to any anthropologist,

13
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.870
any biologist,
and you're a sociologist,
right?
And be like,

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
are humans organized in a social relationship where there's Alphas and Betas?

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
The be like,
no,
what are you talking about?
This is an unscientific idea.
Right?

16
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.100
And we just did something laying that out in a,
in a,
in the context of like,

17
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.770
people who are,
oh,
my type is,
I like Alphas,
right?
Well,

18
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.830
there's no such thing actually,
you know,
humans are some,
your dominant,

19
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.120
some situations not in others.
Right.
Um,

20
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.240
it's an overly simplistic way of looking at human relationships.

21
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.670
And I thought there was a pretty simple,
straight forward thing.

22
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.760
I was like this just a bit of pseudoscience that you hear people tossing out and

23
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.761
people went ballistic on the Internet because people have sort of like built a

24
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.050
edifice of ideology in their minds about like,
there's Alphas,

25
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.060
they're spayed is I'm an alpha.
This is what now feels like,

26
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:23.040
this is what a Beta is like,
you know?
Um,
and uh,
and way the words.
Yeah.

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.140
Clearly.
Yeah.

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.140
<v 1>Men who are more aggressive and athletic and dominant and more confident and s</v>

29
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.780
and then men who are introverted and shy and more nervous and anxious and

30
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.160
there's a scale

31
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.650
<v 0>in some,
in some situations,
you know,</v>

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.730
situations and that's what we're talking about.
Right?
And socially,
well,
yeah,

33
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:45.760
but you're a social situation could change based on what situation you're in.

34
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:46.630
You know what I mean?
Like,

35
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.510
<v 1>but,
uh,
like an athletic,</v>

36
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.930
confident male is always going to be an athletic,

37
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:56.931
confident male and an introverted anxious male who has problems with social

38
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.660
anxiety is going to be the same.
That's that.

39
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.370
<v 0>Personally,
I don't think so necessarily.
Um,
but uh,
so when we're talking about,</v>

40
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.360
we're talking about Alphas,
right?
Um,
in animals,
what is that?

41
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.370
It's a social hierarchy,
right?
Um,
when you're done animals in,

42
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.950
<v 1>take away that word,</v>

43
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
I mean w but what people are using to describe when they're saying Alphas and

44
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:22.180
Betas,
they're saying like confident,
strong,

45
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:25.530
secure people and people that are anxious and not

46
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.400
<v 0>so if you're,
so if you're trying to say,
hey,
like it's good to be confidence,</v>

47
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.380
not so great to be anxious like that,
that's fine.
Right?

48
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.410
But when people talk about Alpha males and Beta males right there,

49
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:39.220
specifically bringing in the language of like evolution of biology,
of zoology,

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.580
of evolutionary psychology,
you know,
and they'll start saying stuff like,
well,

51
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.930
there's Alphas and there's Betas and women are hardwired to be attracted to the

52
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:49.210
Alpha,
you know,
because that's what it's like in nature.

53
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.560
Like there'll be using that language.
Right?

54
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.060
And so what we're pointing out is that's not scientific,
right?
It's not active.

55
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 1>But it is true that women are hardwired to be attracted to confident athletic</v>

56
00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:58.874
men.

57
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 0>I,
well,
I don't know if</v>

58
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 1>I agree with that.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,</v>

59
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.850
you don't think that women look at like pro athletes and like big,

60
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:12.350
strong athletic men and you don't think they're drawn to that for evolutionary

61
00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:13.010
reasons?

62
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.050
<v 0>I know.
I don't actually,
I think that.
Okay.</v>

63
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.690
<v 1>Do you think that men are drawn to women with small waists and big hips and</v>

64
00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:20.310
large breasts for evolutionary reasons?

65
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.850
<v 0>Uh,
you know,
I think that's an easy,
I think what that is,</v>

66
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:28.280
is that's an easy intuition to come to if you're like looking at the way people

67
00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:29.180
behave.
Right.

68
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.510
But one of the things about evolutionary psychology is it's the most common

69
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:36.410
mistake to look at the way that people do behave and say,

70
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:39.470
the reason what the hell we behave that way is because evolution says that's the

71
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.770
best way,
right?
That's their argument.
For instance,
I'll give you an exact,

72
00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.470
that's the argument that was arguments like you like that were used for
instance,

73
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:49.400
to justify slavery.
Right?
That like,
oh,
because you know,
uh,

74
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:53.210
whites and blacks have this hierarchical relationship and American society.

75
00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:55.820
That's the way it was intended.
That's how nature intended it to be.
Right?

76
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.260
But we can't,
we can't,
we can't make that leap.

77
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.070
<v 1>The shapes of bodies,
men universally are attracted to a certain shape of bodies.</v>

78
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.490
There's men that are attracted to different ones and doing it,

79
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.170
I don't think irreversibly attracted at the same barrier,

80
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.230
but that hourglass shape has been throughout time,

81
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.140
something that men are attracted to.
I think that hourglass shape,

82
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.160
<v 0>there's something throughout our recent cultural memory that we tell each other</v>

83
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.530
that men are attracted to.
Right?
That's when that's when we're,

84
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.530
that's what we're told from an early age to this,

85
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.270
that this is the sort of women that men are attracted to.

86
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:30.310
And so a lot of men ended up adopting that.
Right.

87
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.630
But I don't think that deep down that's how men naturally are,
you know?
Yeah.

88
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.610
<v 1>I read this.
That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

89
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.050
That's so non intuitive because I'm all about things that are not intuitive.

90
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.990
Well,
where do you think it started?
Where do you think this,

91
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:48.980
this narrative of men being attracted to women with large breasts and a small

92
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.380
waist and a big ass,
where do you think that started?

93
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:55.520
Because this is like evolutionary biology is pretty much settled on the idea

94
00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:56.460
that the reason why as a,

95
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.230
the large hips would indicate that the women would be easier to give birth.

96
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.460
Having large breasts and a large acid indicates that she has,
uh,
she's,

97
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520
she's fertile and then she has ample fat storage in the right places if she's

98
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.180
going to be pregnant and carry children.

99
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.360
There's all these like evolutionary biology reasons why people are attracted to

100
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:21.090
certain things,
why women would be attracted to a tall,
muscular,

101
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:25.370
a handsome man,
good genetics,
very strong and confident can take care of her.

102
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.740
All these things are based on evolutionary biology.

103
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.220
So I don't understand why you think these are learned sort of cultural art.

104
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.350
<v 0>So my,
my question,
my question is this is an assumption that we,</v>

105
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.290
the public make about how evolutionary biology works,
right?

106
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.790
It's more of a thing that we sort of agree on.
Well we,
we as the,

107
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.460
like there's a,
there's an idea among the public that this is true.

108
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.110
I don't know if it's a scientific idea.

109
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.550
<v 1>That's what you have.</v>

110
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.300
I've had conversations with evolutionary biologists who explained the reason why

111
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.840
men are attracted to certain shapes and why women are attracted a certain
shapes.

112
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.320
This is,
this is of,
I mean this is science in a way.

113
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:05.321
I mean this is the reason why they're attracted to tall men that are muscular

114
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:10.511
and confident is because that is what's always saved you throughout history.

115
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.210
I mean co to only make sense doesn't it?
It.
Well,

116
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.210
just because it makes the point of our show,
right?

117
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.900
Is that just because something makes intuitive sense doesn't mean that it's

118
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.100
necessarily true.
Right?

119
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.180
But don't you think that in this case that this is a varied argument?

120
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.790
Like I don't think that's something that you can dismiss.

121
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.580
<v 0>I don't,
I don't dismiss it,</v>

122
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.810
but I don't assume the truth of it simply because that's what,
you know,

123
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.520
everybody agrees upon,
right?

124
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.750
<v 1>Girls like what are you into?
And you say,
if you are you into tall,</v>

125
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:46.200
muscular,
confident men who are also nice to do Jesus Christ,

126
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.160
that's going to be off the charts.
It's going to be like most of them.
I'm,

127
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.800
you know,
I'm,
I'm really not sure that's the case.
Really.

128
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.100
You had like a survey of women and the men were equally kind and equally

129
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.150
intelligent and,
and friendly.

130
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.800
You don't think that more women will be sexually attracted to these tall,

131
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.650
handsome men with great bodies.

132
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.390
<v 0>I mean,
look,
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna say that like for first of all,</v>

133
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:14.870
you're positing like a value judgment in it that the,
that the bodies are great,

134
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:17.330
right?
So like are women attracted to attractive bodies?

135
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:18.320
If that's the question then,

136
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.360
then I would say the courts more attracted to women's study.

137
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.480
Some fucking,
I'm talking about with the dad bod something.

138
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.800
Here's something that I was really influenced by Iran.

139
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.270
<v 1>What I just said though,</v>

140
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.930
that doesn't make sense to you that women would be attracted to someone who's

141
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.190
<v 0>fit.
Look,
I mean it's a,
it's a hypothetical,
right?</v>

142
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.050
Like I certainly athleticism,
right.
Is something that is attractive,
right?

143
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.840
Um,
that's something that many people find attractive,
right?

144
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.570
Not everybody finds that attractive.
Um,

145
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.070
and I don't think that we can necessarily reason backwards to like a specific

146
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.130
evolutionary relationship.
Right.
Um,

147
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.420
because the truth of what those evolutionary relationships are is like often a

148
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:02.260
lot more complicated than,
you know,
our,
our immediate intuition about it.

149
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.140
And what were you specifically pushing back against in that segment is like the

150
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:08.950
really sort of unscientific,
you know,

151
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.300
of Alpha and Beta.
Yeah,
exactly.
Where it's like,
you know,
you've got people,

152
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.410
you know,
just on internet forums,
like sort of doing amateur pseudoscience,
right?

153
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:20.860
Saying like,
this is how the relationships we had men and women are like designed

154
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:24.970
evolutionarily.
Um,
and we were just pointing out on a very,
very simple level,

155
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.040
like the Alpha and Beta social hierarchy theory,
right?
Um,

156
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.890
that like a humans are organized in a social hierarchy and Alphas are above

157
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:35.140
Betas,
not true.
Right?
Um,

158
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.520
even someone who is the person who you posited,
right?

159
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:44.320
The person who is a athletic and confidence,
right?
The,
uh,
you know,

160
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.620
the high school football quarterback,
right?
Versus the high school football nerd,

161
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.470
right.
We'll take those two people and then put them in a different situation,

162
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:53.710
right.
If those two people are like in gym class together,
right?
Of course,

163
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.780
the high school quarterback is like on the top of that social interaction,
right?

164
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.230
Um,
looking at the sort of,
you know,
classic Wolf Pack Model,

165
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:03.570
they're the one who's sort of running the show,
right.
In the other guys,

166
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.520
like hanging out in the bleachers,
talking to his friends,
right?

167
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.730
Or talking to nobody because he's a,
he's a Beta in that situation,
right?

168
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.290
If you then take that kid and then you,
you know,
send that kid to like nationals,

169
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.040
right?
Or whatever,
uh,
you know,
and that kid,
sorry,
I take the,

170
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:21.240
the quarterback character.
Um,
and you know,
he's suddenly like,
you know,

171
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:24.810
from the little podunk town,
right?
He's not from the big school.
Um,

172
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.090
he's like way down on the Totem Pole,
right?

173
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.340
That person is no longer going to be in that high social hierarchy.
Right?
Um,

174
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.630
and if you take that nerd and you put that,
you know,

175
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.360
take that kid and maybe he's the dungeon master of his,
you know,

176
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.870
dungeon and dragons group,
right?
Um,
uh,
that,

177
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.330
that kid is going to be the alpha in that situation,
right?

178
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.530
That's how humans work.
You know,

179
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:47.160
humans aren't organized in sort of like little pods that stay together for life,

180
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:49.110
and there's one person who's dominant the whole time.
Right?

181
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.330
And that's the simple point that we were making,
uh,
in that piece.
Right?
Um,

182
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.470
and people get upset.
Yeah.

183
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.440
People got upset because there are so many people who we talked about this later

184
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:01.260
on the show.
There's this idea called the backfire effect,
right?

185
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.840
Where when people are told something that they don't agree with,
um,

186
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.660
that when they,
when they,
someone has told somebody a fact,

187
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.070
when somebody has told the fact that contradicts like a really deeply held

188
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:15.330
belief,
it can often cause them to disbelieve it even when it's true.
Right.

189
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.320
In fact,
that fight back even harder.
Yeah.

190
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.310
One of the reasons that happens is because of an idea called identity protective

191
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.570
cognition.
It's,
um,

192
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.140
if the fact that is being debunked is literally part of your identity.

193
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.210
Like if something that you believe really,
really deeply,

194
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.610
it's incredibly hard for you to disbelieve it.
Right?

195
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:32.940
The classic example of this is like,
you know,
Sean Hannity,

196
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.320
Sean Hannity doesn't believe in climate change,
right?
Uh,
uh,
really?
Uh,
well,

197
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.920
you know what,
uh,
I actually don't know that specifically what Shawnee,

198
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.120
Sean had thinks about climate change.

199
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.540
Let's just say somebody who's made their whole career on climate change doesn't

200
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:49.730
exist,
right?
All their friends are in the anti climate change community,
right?
Uh,

201
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800
they met their wife at an anti climate change fundraiser.
You know what I mean?

202
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:55.500
They make their money,
they're at a new anti climate change book every year.

203
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.410
Right now,
climate change is real,
right?

204
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.160
There's no evidence I could present that person with that is going to make them

205
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:06.750
take the social risk of ending all their relationships changing their whole

206
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:10.380
life.
Right?
Uh,
because if they were to say,
okay,
you know what,
actually,

207
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:12.870
I'm convinced climate change is real,
they would lose all their friends.

208
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.850
Their wife would leave them,
they would lose their revenue stream.

209
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:18.390
They can't possibly come to that conclusion.
Right?
And so they fight back.

210
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.570
So super hard.
Right?
And so that's what ended up happening with that segment.

211
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:26.571
There's a whole group of people who have built their whole lives on the idea.

212
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.570
There's Alphas and Betas.
I'm an Alpha.
I'm not going to be a Beta.
Right?
Um,

213
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.070
and so,
and,
and maybe that Muslim positive to them,
you know,
maybe they had,

214
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.010
were in a bad place in their life and through this model of Alpha versus Beta,

215
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.780
they started working out or they started,
you know,

216
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.830
improving themselves a little bit.
Right?
Um,

217
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.300
and maybe they started acting a little bit more confidently and now they're in a

218
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:45.961
relationship.
Right?

219
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:49.590
All those things can be true with the idea of Alphas and Betas and humans not

220
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:50.490
being scientific.
Right.

221
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.340
But so when I tell them that they fight back really hard though.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

222
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.760
no.
This is,
this is real.
This is real.
You know,
and so that video,
which again,

223
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.240
I had no idea that'd be controversial.
I got the most,
or youtube response videos,

224
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.890
get the most,
you know,
furious things.

225
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.290
And the weirdest thing was people started to say,
this is political.
Like,

226
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:09.790
why is Adam Ruins everything getting political?
I'm like,

227
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.120
I don't know what the hell they're talking about or this is,
I have no idea.

228
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.650
I have no idea.
It's political.
Alphas and Betas are now political.
I mean,

229
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.690
that's what people were saying,
I guess.
Uh,
I guess,
you know,

230
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:22.790
for some people it's become that,
but because they've see it as part of like,

231
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.260
I don't know,

232
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.480
whatever argument they're in their head they're having about feminism or

233
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.470
something like that.
But to me,
I'm just like,
guys in dating right in life,

234
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.450
like this is not a real concept.

235
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.450
If you want to say I'm going to be confident tomorrow,
I'm not going to tell you,

236
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:38.020
that's not gonna help you out.
You know?
Um,
uh,
and you know,

237
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.110
I am a little bit reticent to make like a broad conclusion about evolutionary

238
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:44.600
psychology.
Right.
But I can tell you again,
go talk to any anthropologist,

239
00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:47.110
any biologist and he,
you know,
a sociologist.

240
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:51.040
Is there such a thing as Alpha males in humans in the strictest scientific sense

241
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.910
of the word in this industry.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um,
and the,
Eh,
I think they're looking,

242
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.750
<v 1>can you get in terms of like winners and losers pushovers and people who get the</v>

243
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:02.830
job done,
you know,
confident people versus people are not confident.

244
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.720
But I think you're correct.

245
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.760
And I think obviously humans operate on a giant spectrum and if you start going

246
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.330
around saying Alpha and Beta and that the idea that all alphas are the same or

247
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.350
all Betas are the same,

248
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:17.770
it's just as ridiculous as the idea of saying all the Democrats are the same.

249
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.820
Or is that Republicans,
it becomes an ideology.
Exactly.
Pro Male ideology.

250
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.900
At Cha,

251
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:28.070
I have the biggest problem with like over confident men's rights guys.

252
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:32.300
Yeah.
Cause I'm like,
listen,
we have all the rights.
Yeah.
Like

253
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.240
settled now.
Yeah.
We've got enough of them.
I had a whole bit about it.
I was like,

254
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.400
this is like divorce laws and that's it.

255
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.820
Everything else is stacked in our favor and just fucking chill out.

256
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.770
You're making us look bad.

257
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>
