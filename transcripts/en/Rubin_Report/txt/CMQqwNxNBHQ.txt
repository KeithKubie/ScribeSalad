Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Hey, I'm Ben Shapiro and welcome to a very special edition of the Rubin report. Once you replacing another, joining me today on his new set after 34 glorious days off the grid is the host of the Rubin report. Dave Ruben, welcome back and I'm sorry dude

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       or Shapiro. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone right now. Truly. I really do. I mean, first of all of your hosting my show, we're on a new set here, new chairs, new carpet, new tables, new art, do everything I have. No, I genuinely, genuinely, genuinely, I have no idea what's going on in the world since August 1st I know one thing that I found out two days ago because my dad could not control himself in an idiotic phone call. So I know one thing, I suspect it's a pretty big thing that that has happened. I know you have a list of it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       I had a list of 20 things here, 20 things that you missed it during the last month because as we all know, one month of time in Trump world is actually seven years of regular time. So, but, but let's talk first about like what it was like to actually be off the grid for for 34 days. I do it like once a week, but you did it for 34 straight days, which has got to be both wonderful. And also now you have to feel like you just jumped directly into assessed pool of crap. Well I haven't jumped in yet. I think we're about to, I will assure you is this cesspool of crap right there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       I mean, first of all, I just, I feel great. I genuinely mean that. Like

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       guys, I think because I'm going to go, I know I'm going to just, I'm going with a little bit of like a runway here and then you're,

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       we're going to, you know, take us off into the ditch. But like, just in terms of like how I feel as a human being right now, I, my mind feels clear. I feel good. I feel positive. I feel very grateful for the things that I have this last month. I mean really, I don't know that I heard the word Trump more than three times. Truly. Like you know how every conversation now that anyone has anywhere, and I'm not even just talking about the world we live in, but just everywhere. People talk about Trump all the time to talk about politics all the time. Everyone thinks world war three starting tomorrow or the Russians are just like this endless like rang core monster of insanity and I didn't have any of it for a month. I'm telling you that every interaction that I had with the human being since August 1st and today's September 4th was good.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       It was decent weather. I was talking to cashiers or waitresses or the girl at the hardware store who I've told you about who every time at this local hardware store I go to, she always goes, oh Dave, I love you, but I really love that Ben Shapiro. It turns out that the hardware store is closing and I said to her the other day, I said, well, good luck in whatever you're going to do. And she was like, ah, don't worry about it. I'm going to Grad school now. And it was just like talking to different people and I tried to do all that anyway and not be online all the time and not focus on the hate and all that monstrosity. But I just, I feel freaking clear man. I really do. And I'm psyched that we, that we did all these changes around here and Yep. Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Thank you for coming in and doing this. [inaudible] the guy who read the

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       game of Thrones books and then was waiting for the rest of the world to catch up on the red wedding. Yeah, exactly. You're going to get ready my friend.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       God, this is, this is going to be there.

Speaker 3:          00:03:07       Oh, it's, it's, it's pretty wild. But first I want to ask you about like how hard was it to actually, you know, shut yourself off to a, to actually put that phone in that safe because even for me, ideal once a week, but you know, the rest of the week I find myself, the phone's in my pocket. I'm checking Twitter almost as a reflex at this point. How hard was it to actually put it down for a month?

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       Well, first off, I want to give a little credit to the orthodox Jews out there because perhaps this Shabbat thing has, has, well I guess it's not just the orthodox thing, but has figured something out with getting off technologies. Well done guy, because I actually get a score one for God, right? Because look, I do, I try to do the weekends off in general, but I struggle with it sometimes in a lot of times if I'm on the road, you know, I've been on the road with Peterson for the last couple of months. So like if I'm on the road, it's like, yeah, what else am I going to be doing? You know, I can visit some tourist stuff and had some dinners or whatever, but I'm feeling around it. Um, you know, I did this thing last month, last year, last August, and it was, it was basically, you know, the first couple of days ago going into your pocket all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       Like literally you feel your phone there or you get those phantom vibrations, all of that stuff and you feel like you need it. Or you know what I noticed was weird. Like if you're just, if I was just waiting for somebody, like when's the last time you just like waited on a corner for somebody, you automatically look at your phone. Yup. You don't just stand there even for 10 seconds. You don't just stand there and kind of like look around or people watch you or just think or look at the sky or any of that. You literally just go to your phone that moment. So that sort of thing. I noticed that in the moments of quiet where I was doing nothing. If I was in between things you plan. Even if I was taking a shit, I'm on my phone. Usually I am and I suspect you are interior but everyone's doing it. But guess what? I was pooping phone free and then you have moments to think. I mean I know this

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       sounds suiting bay pooping, phone free and I'm sorry that we did this.

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       Yeah. Well it just look, even this like avoiding the news in general is also work because what I realized is when you're off this for a little while, we are slammed with this nonsense all the time and when I say nonsense, I don't mean the important things that I think you and I and a bunch of other people are trying to talk about and trying to deal with the difficult questions of the day and I'm sure we're going to get into some of that, but just the endless 24 hour news cycle of just dribble that keeps everybody angry at each other and and confused about truth and distracted and clicking and all that. Even avoiding CNN when you're not looking at television and don't have a phone was hard. CNN is wherever a muted television is, period. It's everywhere. Airports, it's at the gym, it's at the local.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       You're going to go to a burger joint. It's play in or a diner or whatever. Everywhere I go, I went to get my car tuned up. It's playing in the lobby there and I had to literally avoid watching, you know, cause there everything's breaking news and none of it's really breaking news. They're actually breaking news. But you know, you, I had to actually avoid that. So I was at the gym and they have all these TVs up there and I had to literally do cardio with my head down because I didn't even want to avoid that. So we're just like slammed with all of this stuff. And I think when you step away from it a little bit that I know you're very excited to get me back in, but when you step away from a little bit, it does give you a little perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       And I always also thinking about things like, I mean as I said, every interaction I had was positive. Like this idea that we live in this country of like endlessly racist, evil people. When you're out there actually talking to real people, you know, and again I do this, I tried to do as much of this as I can normally, but with then we're also in this digital thing. It's like, it's not like that. People are good. People want the same thing. It's like I, I so fundamentally believe that. And I, I've always believed that, but I really, really believe it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       Now I used to think that the hope for the country rested and you know, the 40% of the population that was following this stuff closely and the more I viewed this stuff, now I'm starting to think that the future of the country rest with the 60% who really do not follow this stuff closely.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       Well that's the thing. It's like, well what do you do then? Because part of me literally like a week ago and I knew I was about to come back, I was like, man, like why ever come back, I'll go find something else to do. I wanted to be in the NBA. Like fine. He goes, you know, and not that you, I mean, you know how much, like you really know how much I love this. And like, I think what we're doing is so important and I think I'm a better person now and all this stuff. And, and after being on tour with Peterson for months where for months I, I've been performing in front of thousands of people every night and it's this great love fest of people who are getting their lives together and disagree on what the marginal political issues are. But like all of that greatness and it's like I could see because of, because of all the evil that is out there.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       And when I say you blamed me just like the hate and all the people that want to keep you clicking and angry and distracted and, and fighting with everybody, I could see why a lot of good people that we really need would just be like, I'm out all together. I'm never going to post again. I'm never going to read this. I'm going, you know, and, and that's a real problem because then if we push out all the good people, now you have the middle majority that's endlessly just being slammed by one side. Dare I say that's partly why I think this whole intellectual, dark web thing has, has taken root and has some meaning now. It's because I think for all of our differences, which we've discussed, many of them including abortion in death penalty and a whole bunch of other things, it's like we're trying to basically live in the same society together and, and not hate each other for whatever those differences are. And as I said to you last time you were, you were sitting here, it's like on something like abortion where we disagree. It's like, you know what? Hopefully for the next 50 years we'll do this. And then maybe when I'm a little older than you, so I'm 92 and where are you going to be in 50 years?

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       Uh, I'll be 84

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       and you're 84 like maybe one of us will have moved one of us one way or another in order to eight. And I know you're looking at me going, Reuben, you're not going to move me. But you know, who knows what happens over the course of time. But the only thing that will allow them,

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       and we're looking at like, I don't know if I'd be alive in 50 faith. No, that's why I would recommend a digital detox. I'm telling you, I feel better by hartfields better. My head feels better. I know this is a little corny, but I, I genuinely do feel that way and it was also just making me want to reinvest in everything I'm doing. That's why we have a new set now and a new website and all this. It's like, I really like, I believe in this thing and I want to sort of take now these pieces that I just absorbed of the world over the last month and now apply them to all the stuff that we talk about all the time. Shapiro here. Okay, here we go. Let's go to work my friend. And this was the, uh, you were promised at Jami of News Shalvey so, all right, so I know of the story.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Yeah. What, what was the last thing that you saw on the news? Okay. So the last thing that I know of was the day that I got off the shutdown everything. The last thing that I heard was that the New York Times hired that writer, the the female Asian writer at, apparently she had tweeted a lot of anti white. Okay. So I know nothing free for all I know she doesn't have a job. Now she does have a job. She has a bigger job than ever. She has a show on CNN, she has a job, she hasn't got back to see it at other times and there was blow back on anyone who suggested that she was racist, that a lot of the left came out and said that she couldn't be racist because racism is actually discrimination plus power. Nonsense. She still has a job. Yeah, and that's totally okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Let's be very clear on this because I am familiar with and clear minded right now racism is hating someone because of their race. It has nothing to do with power. You can be black and hate white people and you're a racist and you can be white and hate Asian people in you're racist. And you can be Asian and hate Latino people just because of their skin color and you are racist. No, not according to the New York Times. The New York Times is wrong. That's the end of that story. Meanwhile, Alex Jones got banned from Facebook, so she still has a job there. So I saw a bunch of the tweets, the only one of the, the one tweet, look, I've joked, you know, before I sort of woke up politically, I used to joke about Republicans being an old white man a lot and whatever. And it was just stupid jokes.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       And I, I don't regret them because it's just part of what made me me sort of, I think they're stupid and they were short, shortsighted and maybe not very informed at that time. But what the one tweet that I did see, and I think this might've been quite literally the last thing I saw before I shut down was there was, um, something about she like hated, she loves making old white people cry or something. And I thought that that kind of strikes, uh, that kind of strikes me in a different way. You know what I mean? You know, so there was a big argument that took place over Sara Zhong, not just over her actual comments, but over whether she should be fired based on Twitter mobbing. So there was a, there's a big sort of discussion that happened about social media mobbing and people piling on and whether people ought to be fired and lose their jobs over old stuff that they've tweeted. And of course that followed in the wake of the James Gunn and stuff. But you were still here for those gems gotten from guardians of the galaxy. You Remember Brian? So that happened just as I was

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       getting along.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Exactly. So James Gunn getting guardians of the galaxy director, he lost his job because there were some old tweets of his that were, that were, you know, making jokes about pedophilia and such. Right. So there's a lot of talk about Twitter mobbing and then the terrorists young thing happened and that was a Twitter mob. And so there was a lot of talk about whether you're not, whether she should have been hired, which is a separate conversation, but whether people should lose their jobs based on people digging up crap you did 10 years ago and now coming after you.

Speaker 2:          00:12:18       So let me get this straight. So, so she still has a job despite all that stuff. Roseanne Barr does not have a job. Correct. Because of one tweet, which I actually do believe that Roseanne didn't know that Valerie Jarret was black and Rosa. That's crazy person. Roseanne is what she, yes. Right. So describe described crazy person. That's right. Right. Well it depends which person you're talking to. The right people are there. But so, but I just want to understand all this. If you're trying, cause when you stepped away, it does seem a little odd. So Rosanne sends this one tweet, which she apologized for us that she didn't know that she was black. There's no reason to think that Roseanne has a history of racism. She's always been fighting for lefty causes forever actually. So she gets fired from the number one stay calm in the country. Then this girl, sorry, one more time. Okay. Sherry. John, cause I'm out of it a little bit. She, yeah, she maintains her job. She maintains her job and gun. His gun got fired.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       Yeah, gun got fired. There was an attempt to bring him back, but that kind of failed. It turns out there were pictures of him at some like joke pedophilia themed party with the women who were over age, but the rest of school children in such. So Disney was not going to maintain his job. So

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       I don't even know what to do with all that. But I think partly I guess, and I guess this is from stepping away for a little bit, it's just this sort of, when we apply the standard answer that that I think that's what's driving people crazy. Probably mostly conservatives and people on the right because it seems to always weigh much more heavily on you.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       Please, I will can't unlearn one of the facets of this that he ministers. So Candace Owens then tweeted out everything Sara Zhang had tweeted, but with reversing the races and Twitter immediately suspended her before they realized what she was doing. No. Should they move Candace? Yeah, that was good. Okay. So meanwhile, Alex Jones gets banned from Facebook and iTunes and there's a coordinated hit on Alex Jones between, I believe it was Facebook and Youtube and iTunes to demonetize him and deny him platforms. Wow. All in the same day. All on the same day. I think it was a with me within 48 hours. So it's fun to break this stuff to you and a, and wow, wait, so justi monetizing him? Uh, no. I think youtube actually took down his entire channel. Oh Wow. Wait 10 Alex Jones is not on Youtube. Uh, I believe so. I haven't checked recently, but yes, that was the story.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       Uh, and they all did this on the same day, within 48 hours. So it was, it was, it was obviously a coordinated hit, obviously coordinated hit. Wow. And so they, they took him down. Uh, they gave various reasons why, but they didn't give any sort of objective reason why. So it wasn't like some of them said it was because he had threatened violence in the past. Some of them said that it was because he had said on palatable things in the past, but there was no clear standard. And so there are a lot of folks on the right saying, listen, even if you don't like Alex Jones, you know when people, I said those and I know Alex Jones Fan, I mean threatened me personally. Yeah. But you got to at least articulate a clear standard for how you're going to police the boundaries here. Otherwise everybody ends up in the, in the throw them overboard category because these boundaries are randomly expanding. So yeah, Alex Jones got hit. He hasn't really paid, um, any series monetary price cause he has alternative distribution channels and he's, and he's insulated himself

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       nice things. You get a massive hit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       Oh yeah. No, I mean it's, it's, you know, obviously took it seriously. Although his listenership I'm sure is up because people are tuning in because square, right.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Let you stand on this now because you know, for the last two years I've been saying relentless Lee, the answer is not government intervention. I just don't think that the government policing Facebook and Youtube and Twitter and all those things that that will help anything. I think it would muck things up even worse. It would give more power to just middle management bureaucrats. And, and since the government is not very good at anything, I don't think it would be very good at. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       So president Trump has, this is one of the other stories, president Trump, his sort of jumped into this and suggested, right. I'm still president. He's still president. Oh, okay. Congratulations to you back in time. You didn't miss it and miss the big finale. Oh, does it? I didn't Miss Number 20 there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But uh, he, he was suggesting regulations. Some other Republicans have sort of put it out there. I don't agree with regulation, but I do think that we're going to have to come up with either some market based solutions or we're going to have to, you know, recognize and force Facebook and Twitter to be treated as um, as not platforms, but as, as the actual publishers, which is the real controversy over over Facebook. Is it a platform or is it a publisher to lake over at daily wire, which I run, if we print something that is liable as we will be sued. Yeah. Illegally live will be sued. If Facebook puts up in article by us that is libelous, then Facebook doesn't get sued. It's a platform. If they're not policing, what can we put up in what cannot? At what point do you start saying, well, you're just like the daily wire or the New York Times or CNN and you start getting policed that way. I think that Facebook either needs to demonstrate, you know, what it's objective standards are or start getting treated like any other publisher in the space. Because if they're going to police, then they're policemen.

Speaker 2:          00:16:43       Yeah. So you're right and you're being consistent with, I think what your other views are in this department, but there's this piece of me that it's like, did we miss the boat in a weird way, now that I've stepped away for a bit, like with the amount of people that are watching Rogan and watching you and me and the rest of the and Sam and everybody else is like, why don't we have a network already? You're going to be like, I know there's endless discussions about it. We've had discussions about it. We've met with people I, but it's almost like there's something that almost is like, there's some other weird thing here, like the amount of power that these companies have now amassed over us is bizarre and it's like if, if the crew of us can't figure out how to do it, who, who can figure out how to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       I don't know what the answer to that is, but it does. I'm a little, I mean this is where, of course I'm for the market dictating it so it's like, yeah, it's on the last, yeah, you're like, let's get cracking. Because at the end of the day, look, forget Jones, he's irrelevant I think in the scheme of whatever, but it's like at the end of the day you get rid of him. Well now you've moved the bar, it gets a little, there's a lot of people that think that you are an extremist all by the way. So I do want to mention this real quick. So one of the, there were a couple, two or three little things that were rattling in my head about current while I was away and one of them was a few weeks before I went offline was the mark Duplass thing. Right you and for some reason it was really sticking with me while I was gone because for those that don't remember Mark Duplass, basically mark Duplass, who's a friend of mine who's been on the show who is a lefty in an extremely decent human being, a nice guy. I had breakfast with him like two weeks before the tweet was sent out. He has a really nice guy. He's trying to bridge

Speaker 3:          00:18:13       by the office. We spend an hour and a half together. You seem like a nice guy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:17       See He's just a nice guy trying to do some nice work. He mostly does those comedy stuff. So, uh, he tweeted out basically that Benji, Piero isn't the devil. That's basically what [inaudible] intentions and it was a nice guy. Yeah, that's it. And, and basically that people should take a look at you, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       Yeah. If you're looking for somebody who's honest on the other side of the aisle or something.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       Yeah. So this happened a little bit before I went off the grid,

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       but he deleted it then tweeted at now apology.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       So the mob comes after him. He then tweets this thing about how he doesn't stand for homophobic or racist views, implying basically that your race or races through all the usual nonsense. And I don't want to make this about mark cause I think he's a good guy and I don't know what pressure came to bear on him either from studios or the mob. And it scares people. You don't want to lose your job.

Speaker 3:          00:19:01       Hit him when he deleted the tweet and I said, I totally understand why you do that. I get it. And then the next morning he tweeted out that was [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       right. Good Times. That was really rattling in my head because as I've stepped away, it's like, I know, and this goes to what I said earlier, we need these middle decent people who are willing to figure some things out. And it's like they basically took him out. And when I say they, it's like, who knows what that is? Is it just the mob? Is it, you know, studios, I don't know exactly what it is, but like those are the types of people that we need. And this is why I would link it back to the Alex Jones. They're shredding the Overton window. The Overton window will continue to shrink. It's like, all right, we get wordy Jones one day and no one wants to defend Joan. So fine. Okay, he's gone. But they'll keep moving it and they'll keep saying that Shapiro's this or Ruben's that or whatever it is. And eventually, eventually we'll be on the outside of that thing too. And that's very much on my mind for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       Okay. So in other news, uh, Alexander Ocozzio Cortez continues to sort of gain steam as this. So she's gaining steam. She continues to gain sort of public promise. You made a bunch of gas while you're out. Yeah. She suggested the middle class doesn't exist anymore. She suggested that everybody in the country, even though the economic statistics are good, that's only because nobody has two jobs. Yeah. Okay. And uh, and then there was a bit of a tiff because I offered to host her on my show or debate her. Oh, right. And I offered to drop 10,000 bucks for the privilege and she suggested I was cat calling her. So that was, so that was her response was that I was cat calling her and then in their mainstream editorials in the New York Times suggesting that it was sexist for me to offer. Are you kidding? No. No. Sounds good. Times. Not, not a major story, but drove the new cycle for probably a couple of days. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:42       so you, I know you well enough. You offered to debate her. Was he offered to debate who are either one? Either one,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       whichever one you want. I said, I'm happy to have you on the Sunday special. Would you have been on for a discussion I've had on a bunch of people. I disagree with Aidan. Sam On that special. Yeah, I've had on Eric on that special, I've had an a bunch of people with whom I disagree on a variety of issues on that special. Yeah, I and a, and I said, I'll give $10,000 to charity or to your campaign or the super pack, whatever you want. Uh, and or we can do debate, whichever format you choose a, and she tweeted back that she, that there's no reason for her to respond to this is the equivalent of of men cat calling women, which is like, I don't know how they can't go home and it's equivalent

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       of men treating women equally. That's what it is, right? You're not viewing her, you're not going, I want to talk to this woman because she's a woman so I can destroy her. You're going, this is somebody who I disagree with or at least I want to explore their ideas a little bit more. We'll do it either way. You want

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       also cat calling and me. Yeah. Weird, weird moves. So that, so that was kind of a minor story and I don't want to hover on that one too much cause to somebody

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       it does go to the sort of a a bigger thing that these people are, are put out there with their ideas. That all sound good. All of this. I mean this is another thing that was rattling in my brain a lot, but all of this leftists stuff that I used to buy your for gays, your board this year for poor people, it's all bullshit. It's all epic, endless horse shit. I mean that really is all it is. You're not for gays, you're, you know what I mean? It doesn't even make sense to say you're for gays because gays think differently that it's incredible. You'll never believe this. You get 10 gays in a room. They probably have 12 different opinions. And to say that you're, you're for black people or have four black conservatives. I mean, I know you know this stuff, but again, when you step away from it, it's like be in a weird way.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       And I hate, I really hate to do this, but in a weird way. Uh, Catherine verbal, seeing who's the last guest I had on, uh, last week, but we had taped it at the end of June. Uh, July. She's an educator in, in England. She had taught in the inner cities for a long time and basically realized that all these guilty liberals were just kept throwing money at things that were keeping minorities oppressed. And she said something that really hit me, and this is the last thing that I did before I left. She was basically saying, these people are the racists, they're the modern racist. And they're always screaming that we're all the races and I don't want to become men, so I don't want to sit here and be like, Oh, you know, these lefties are all the racist by, by, by, but the, the, the racist ideas of the day are not coming from conservatives and Libertarians. They're really not. And they're certainly not coming from classical liberals. They are coming from the progressive's that actually is just true. It just is. Okay. Shapiro,

Speaker 3:          00:23:19       let's go. Okay. So let's do a bunch of Mueller updates because there was a bunch of news motherland, but you've already told me Trump is still president. So friends and storm the castle. Yeah, right, right. Oh the, the, the, the latest generic congressional ballot has Republican's down, I think it was the NBC ballot today has now 18. So do you buy that? I buy the Republicans are down. I don't, I don't think I've done 18 but I think the Republicans have some serious problems in the midterms. The, the, the, I mean Democrats, a lot of motivation to turn out and they have since the election because they feel like if they had turned out, they would want in the last election, which is true. So that's, that's been building. So here's what happened. I'm gonna lump these all together cause there's a lot. Okay. So Peter Struck that fire and over at the, over at the, uh, at the FBI.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       So Peter Struck, has everyone recalls, is the guy who was texting with his paramour Elisa page. And leading the Russia investigation and the Hillary investigation, and he was fired for essentially sullying the reputation of the FBI. So he ended up being fired. President Trump provoked security clearances for people like John Brennan, former CIA director. There were rumors that was gonna happen. Yeah, so he did that. He, he revoked his security clearance. So what do you make of that? Because I kind of, I'm not a, I'm not an intelligence analyst at the highest level is here, but the idea that that Brennan and some of these guys were taking classified information and clearly leaking it to, to the media or the Times or whatever. Like forget what the information was. Forget the Trump is president. If anyone was president and former officials who still have clearance, which is also a little unclear to me.

Speaker 3:          00:24:47       Why is a former official would clear rights. I mean, I guess the basic ideas that inform our official, if I go to you for advice, I need to be asked to be able to ask you about that stuff. And it's still a crime if you leak classified information to the press, even if you no longer worked for the government that said [inaudible] yeah, there, there shouldn't be. In my opinion, there shouldn't be like a blanket security clearance you get to maintain after you leave office. It seems silly to me. So who else was there anyone else reporting? I'm sure Brendan was probably the biggest. Brennan was the biggest one. He threatened to do it to Komi who I think no longer has clearance and a bunch of other, basically what it looked like was it coordinated political hit by Trump because Trump then went on Twitter and said like, everybody I hate should no longer have a security clearance, and two people said this is misuse of power, which of course president Trump doing everything in the dumbest possible way.

Speaker 3:          00:25:26       It sort of is, but that's Ed. Should these people have security clearances? Probably not. That was the minor news in this, in this area. That's huge in a certain respect but crazy. Here's the major news in the major news is that Michael Kahn, the President's forum personal attorney, pled guilty to eight different crimes including violation of campaign finance law. And in that plea of guilty for violation of campaign finance all at the red wedding part, he suggested that the president of the United States ordered him to violate campaign finance law. So ordered him before he was president. So just so the, so here's what happened. He goes to pay off the stormy Daniels via basically David Pecker over the national enquirer. The idea was that this was a campaign finance contribution that he, he had bought the story of stormy Daniels from the national enquirer in order to silence it, Pecker gone bought storming Daniel's story and then team Trump buys the story from David Pecker Reimburses Pecker for the story.

Speaker 3:          00:26:21       Keep it quiet. Money was that. So it was Michael Cohen's money. So it looks like a, it looks like a campaign contribution. And then Trump backfills the amount of money that Cohen paid over the course of coming months. Now, the question is whether Trump knew that he was violating campaign finance law when he did that. Right. So in other words, there are two ways he could have, just legally speaking, there are two ways that he could have avoided this being a campaign. Finance violations could flat out written the check directly and then he would have had to report it as a campaign expenditure. Presumably.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Can you write it? Why campaign expenditure? Why couldn't you have just read it?

Speaker 3:          00:26:54       Let me check. So he can know, he can read, he can write a check, but he has to report that to the FEC. Right. Or he can have Michael Cohen write a track. Um, well he, he would have to have, he would have to do it personally or he'd have to show that he basically used Colin is a pass through and then reporting to the FCC. But there was no report to the FEC. Right. So basically the idea was that they found a back channel to pay her off just so it wouldn't be reported a week before the election. And so the idea is that he was essentially avoiding the reporting of the stormy Daniels single week before the election by paying off a porn star. That's an in Michael. Colin was saying that Trump knew all of this and Trump ordered all of this. Yeah, and that's why he did all of this. So how

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       are we supposed to get any truth out of this? This is the type of thing where it's like, again, stepping away, it's like, all right, we can do all the little legal loopholes, the little minutia and look back on two years ago and who did this and that, but it's like Michael, Colin probably wants to save his butt now from certain amount of jail time, right? He's going to do whatever he can, obviously to throw Trump under the bus. I have no doubt that Trump probably did some things out more out of just like provato and stupidity. Then like intention, like do you think he really was like the crime that they're going to get Trump on? Was that a $250,000 pay out to a porn star? Like, how stupid is this whole thing?

Speaker 3:          00:28:05       Right? So there are two ways in which Trump could defend himself when he could say, listen, I path ladies all the time. So this isn't a campaign expenditure at all. Yeah. This is just me paying off ladies who we know. Is there any history of Michael Cohen doing this for him before? So there's a, there's a history of Michael and kind of threatening people before, but we haven't seen evidence that he's like paid off a bunch of ladies before. Yeah. And the other thing that, that Trump theoretically could do to avoid all of this is you could say, well, Michael cones the lawyer, I didn't tell him to violate campaign finance law. It's his job to make sure that I'm in compliance with campaign finance law. I'm an idiot. Yeah. So what do I know about campaign finance law? I just said, Michael, go, go settle this thing up.

Speaker 3:          00:28:37       I mean, that's the Hillary email excuse. Right, right, right, right, right. I'm an idiot. And it's not implausible. Right? Yeah. That's, that's a plausible defense that said, he is personal lawyer is testifying in open court that Trump told them to violate campaign finance law. Does that mean Trump gets prosecuted? Nobody's again prosecute the former president and you can't prosecute the current president of the United States just legally speaking in all likelihood. But will that be ground zero for impeachment charge? I'm sure that it will be the same day that happened by the way, because yes, we're all immediately show the same day that happened. Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager also pled guilty to eight felonies. None of them having to do with campaign Trump, but having to do with former campaign finance violations in representing the Ukrainian government and all of this kind of stuff. And then Trump starts tweeting about how Manafort's a good guy because he kept his mouth shut, which is because president Trump has diarrhea of the, of the Twitter.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       Well first off, it's a wait. So Cohen's going in there and saying Trump told him to violate campfire can be mindless. I mean that sounds actually insane. So if that's actually true, like if Trump actually sat him down, I was like, here's the check, let's violate some campaign finance. Like now we're veering into like, like true. Is that

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       possible? It's, it's, that sounds to me, it depends on the bananas, but it depends how much plausible deniability you need. Right? Right. If Trump said, here's a check for $130,000, go settle this up. And Colin said to him, what we need to report that to the FTC and said, well let's do cash. Right? And then, then, then you've got a problem. But yeah, we have to see what that looks like and it hasn't been taken that level yet. The SDNY is still checking into that. And what are you, so guy that's doing your show every, yeah, talking about this stuff every day. I know you researched the early, all of that. How you find the ability to talk about the ins and outs. Honestly, without, without giving enough room where people are just going to guess on all of these [inaudible] some of that nuance that's not going to be put on CNN and on CNN. It's he violated campaign finance law. This is a, this is a federal violation. He should go to jail. And the answer is, well that depends on the credibility of cone. It depends on Trump's defense. It depends on a lot of stuff. Trump doesn't help himself because he goes on Twitter and just says shit. Right. I mean that's his thing. But I have not seen a Trump tweet in a month. Good for your dirty. For us. That's, that's a, that's a daily relief. I'm sure. 34 fucking damn.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       Well in get ready man. Cause there's some more comments up there. So that was the big story because now that I'm like how old is that story or that this two weeks old. So it's like, is it already running out of steam? I mean everything kind of like them. Although you know, maybe it's contributing to the congressional ballot for example, because it feels like there's a level of corruption that is being exacerbated by another political story, which is to Republican Congress. People are being prosecuted for corruption right now. Duncan hunter down in, so cal in San Diego, he's being also prosecuted for looking like he basically took a bunch of campaign finance, the campaign funds and use them on personal expenditures and Chris Collins over in New York who these were the first two congressional candidate who backed Trump and Collins came forth and uh, and supposedly was engaged in some sort of insider trading deal.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       So both of them are now going to be prosecuted by the sessions DOJ, which is like president Trump's attack. Jeff sessions at the DOJ and literally this morning, tweet out that or last night tweet out that that Jeff sessions is killing Republican congressional chances by indicting Republican Congress paypal. So that's all, what's the president? He has his right to free speech. He's going to end up probably screwing himself over with all of that. Like when I'm hearing this, it's like, man, this is all just a great reason to ultimately be libertarian. Like not, it seems like none of this works, right? None of this actually works. Like if it all worked, if there was a slim trim operating government that didn't have too much power and could just move things on the margin and not try to redistribute and all of these things, it's like, and it worked and it wasn't always the old government does is investigate itself. All it does is throw money at things. Like it doesn't do anything. So all of these things, as you're telling me, I know these are important, relevant things and when I fully dive back in like six months, they may not be, and then two weeks, they may not be because, but at least understanding the issues behind them are important. Like this, this

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       general thing of like, Oh, this guy campaign finance, this guy that this is all they do, this is all they do. And if you think Democrats are somehow better than Republicans, you're wrong. They're all doing it together. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       oh, I'm sorry. I'm sort of grouping these into political and then we'll do some. And then there was a bunch of cultural stuff that's already happened. So, yeah, uh, other political stuff. The cabinet hearing is happening literally as we speak. Co Right now for the Democrats tried to shut down the hearing from the beginning by calling for an adjournment until they can read the document. Even the though they've already come out and said they're not voting for Cavenaugh. Linda Sarsour got arrested because she showed up and started yelling at a, at Cavenaugh and at the Republicans. And so it kind of devolved into the spectacle. We all knew that that would be,

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       you know, in, in the spirit of my 34 days off the grid. I'm not gonna say a word about Linda. So good for you dude. That is, Ooh, that is some inner peace. Or where do we pause though? So there's nothing they can do to stop cabinet. No, you're right. So that's going to happen. You know, you can, for the record, people can find this video somewhere. But when I was on TYT way back when and, and Harry Reid use the nuclear option, and I was still progressive, lefty liberal, blah, blah, blah, uh, I said, this is a bad move. This is a bad move. You do not want to give this kind of power cause it'll be used against ESL

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       in a bad move. It was. So there, there are two anti Trump books that have come out. The first was from Omarosa Manigault the media went nuts over this. She, she had recordings. She, she'd taken her cell phone into like throughout the west wing and recorded a bunch of conversations with pretty much everyone. Is that illegal? Um, maybe, yeah, maybe there was nothing classified on the recordings. Okay. It's basically she had nothing to sell and she sold whatever she had, but it was nonstop on Cable News for 24 hours a day for a week. Uh, and uh, maybe two weeks we're shooting to get him saying, and then he, and then he, and then he tweeted out that that Amarosa was fired. Nica Doug and what is something like that? And once he called her daughter better than it's improving grammar. But when once called their dog then it turned into, is Trump a racist because he called her a dog even though he was called half of humanity members of the canine species.

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       So yeah. So we enjoy two weeks of hours. Amount of dog is actually an upgrade over what I think about as humans at the moment. Yeah, that's exactly right. And then Bob Woodward's book comes out this week and there were a bunch of sort of typical trumpy and stories, John Kelly saying this place is miserable, the work and James Madis saying Trump is basically a nut who wanted to uh, pull completely out of South Korea and asked for preemptive military options against North Korea and various, and, and uh, I think it was Gary Cohn, like sneaking documents off of from Steph. So he wouldn't sign them. And Trump now notice to all the things that you would expect in the Trump White House. And so all that's coming out and Woodward's book, so expect Trump to tweet about that a lot this week. And then we get to some of the cultural issues. So at the Vma is bunch of stars.

Speaker 3:          00:35:23       Bash Trump. No shock there. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You're telling me Hollywood people at an awards show, we're anti Trump. I know. Shocker. That was a big one. Then this changes every pet. Now I Asia Argento is a leader in the me too. Movement was implicated in a, in her own me to scandal. So there's a 17 year old boy who had one plate son in a movie, I guess, and when he was 17 and she was 36, 38, I believe, they went to a hotel rooms. She stepped him, uh, and a a parent and which is statutory rape in the state of California. And He, uh, and he said that basically been intimidated into it and she was hit with this me too. Stuff also. And then Rose McGowan came out and said, we should wait until all the evidence is in, which provided all sorts of fodder for people who say, you know, maybe we ought to wait for all the evidence to come in. So it's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Now that it's turning on on its own people and now we should wait. Right? Like Trudeau was like, we have to believe all women. Then it came for him. Now we have to wait. It comes from one of them. We two people, now we have to wait. So this is bizarre. So that happens. And, and uh, sorry, sewer this, she was part of me too. So this is, this is it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       Yeah. There's also a story with mentioning in New York University professor who was like a performance artist who is a lesbian, but she was accused of sexually harassing a gay man. Uh, and it's relatively credible.

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       A lesbian was sexually harassing a game.

Speaker 3:          00:36:38       She's not a very good lesbian. I think that cheese there, there've been several. Yeah, exactly. She'd bet it bad at the lesbianisms. So yeah, it's so that, that, and the entire academy came out to defender of course, because she's on the left and that's the way this works. Um, let's see. How was the lesbian sexually harassing a game? I mean, she was sending him sexual messages. I mean, they have the text messages. So again,

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       not good at the lesbian. I think how stupid this whole thing is. I mean, look, of course you got to get the bad guys though. The Harvey Weinsteins of course the people that genuinely do the bad things that you have to get them. But the thing that we're creating here where people are going to be afraid of their own shadows. And you know, we're in la here. I have a friend who's been in, in uh, the battle, want to give away too much, who's been in the Biz on the, on the other side of the camera for a long time, who's a white male in his probably late fifties. He's done extremely good work for a long time. He's working on a million TV shows that, you know, well, he's, now, you know, the way it works with these shows is you usually work a season or two and then you move on to something else.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       Or there's huge gaps in between seasons or what were some times you just work for a studio and they throw you in all these different places. He's telling me now that he's being told by executives that as a white male, as a straight white male, that basically he should either start looking for other work or just don't expect to work anymore. I mean think how actually dangerous that is like dangerous people who have, this is a good, decent man who has worked his whole life, who was an extremely professional, competent person. But even if he was completely incompetent, right. You should not hire and bring competence but not higher. No, don't not hire him because

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       Henry Cavill, I mean I think this is before you left, you remember Henry Cavill said about dating they, I was having that he's only going to date women. He knows because he's afraid that he's going to get caught in a me too situation just because he's rich and famous and he got killed for that and I don't blame him for that. I mean, honestly I can't blame somebody. Like if you're famous and you have money to check, like the pence rule works well for, for everybody, right? Yeah. Pence role like this it, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       Again, Susan harassing me. But one other thing on this, you know, they also don't realize how backwards is actually gonna work because, so for example, I was just telling you, we, we just hired a new full time here. So I have a new assistant, Helen, who's wonderful. And when we were hiring, it did pop in my brain for a second. But I would not want to hire a gay man. I don't want to be, not because I'm going to harass them, I'm not going to harass them. But why would I hire someone who might one day turn on me and that'd be like Dave harassed me. Now I happen to be gay. So it seems that I made, if I was gonna harass someone, it would be a gay man. Right. But I guess it could be a straight man to or whatever. But it's like, you know, so in a weird way and

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       well, my mom, it was him. I know. It's like you come up with a working woman and she say, I mean, she literally worked, all my dad stayed home. And I remember when I was young, she said, if ever you have an assistant hire like a blue haired old lady. Yeah. Specifically if you're saying this like 20 years, that's better way looking for. All right. So let's see what else happened while you were out? Oh, well, okay. So this was, this was a big controversy. So Molly Tibbits, uh, was a 20 year old Iowan student at University of Iowa and she was kidnapped and murdered by a guy who turned out to be an illegal immigrant. And this became a major cost celeb because president Trump commented about it, talking specifically about border policy. A lot of people on the right and jumped on it perfectly about where was this?

Speaker 3:          00:39:45       I was in Iowa. Okay. And the, and the left suggesting of course they had nothing to do with illegal immigration. It was bad to talk about it. We should never talk about this sort of thing. You know, the same left that says every time there's a mass shooting, we have to talk about gun control. Now that you say when it comes to this, you can't talk about illegal immigration. President Trump tweeted incessantly about it. He cut a bunch of videos like from the White House lawn and talking about it. And this became kind of political fodder. The family said like, we don't want any part of this, please don't politicize it. She was on the left for families on the left. Um, and uh, it turned into a bit of a Brouhaha.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       Yeah. So where are we at with this now? Like, hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       I mean the investigation at the guy has been arrested, he's gonna go to jail presumably. Uh, but the sort of battle is less over what happened in the case. And Moreover, the politicization of particular situations. Like should we be talking about broad based policy based on individual circumstances? Uh, is it cynical to do so? When is it appropriate to do so? So it sort of generated that conversation. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       I mean this is one of the ones where it's like, this is exactly why I do this show to talk about ideas and not every little instance of a thing that happens. Now, of course this, this sounds absolutely horrific, but the way, like one thing that I really don't miss after being away is like the three days that everyone cares and then we don't care. Net neutrality is going to destroy the world. We scream about it for three days, then we forget about children being separated. We scream about it for days and it's also like everyone's screaming, not doing all the people that are, even the people that are getting 20,000 retweets on all the things that they're tweeting out. It's like, do, are you doing anything about it? Now I get it. It's important to share your thoughts and to talk. Um, but one of the things that I really want to do over the course of the next year is figuring out how do we put some of this stuff into action because all we do is go from one crisis to another. We pick this, it gets politicized by Trump for immigration purposes. It gets politicized over the other guys for open borders or whatever it is. And it's like nothing better after that. Actually, we just, we just kicked the can down the road to hell like that. That Ah,

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       so we have a couple more kind of minor ones and then there are a couple major ones to finish up with. Okay. But on the other minor ones, Ron Desantis candidate in Florida, so he won his gubernatorial primary. Okay. But the guy who ran against him, uh, if could one that primary on the democratic side is going to be Andrew Gillum, uh, who's a black guy. And when desantis laid an interview very early on talking about how Gilliam was a good candidate who had out debated folks, uh, and he said, you know, we have a good economy now. We don't need the guy who's a socialist. Cause Gillum is very far to the left. Yeah. Element. He says we don't need somebody who's a socialist to come into and sort of monkey things up for the state of Florida. And this became a 48 hour new cycle in which the, this was accused of being a racist for using the phrase monkey it up in regards to socialism, screwing with the capitalist economy. But he'd use the phrase monkey as a verb and therefore he was obviously race baiting and, and dog whistling to the evil racist too. Now we're gonna realize Andrew Gillum is a black,

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       right, so allow me play this simple son to my Jewish friend here. Um, is there any evidence that he's an actual racist beyond this common? Okay, so this is like, remember when Howard Cosell, it's a little before our time, but Howard Cosell got fired I think by CBS news because during a football game, even though he was the thought of really is the greatest sports broadcast or a regeneration, he said, well, there was a, uh, a blah, it happened to be a black football player. I like, uh, a running back or a, um, I think it was a running back, jumped over a guy and he said something about like, he's monkeying over him or something like that. And everyone started calling him racist. Now this is well before our days of now, everybody's a racist and he got fired because of that. It turned out that that's what he called his grandchildren all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:43:13       If I'm remembering the story correctly, he was always saying, oh, your monkeys, your jumping all over each other and blah, blah blah. So this thing about a word and that if we can get you on a word, we now know what your whole, cause it's not all your political ethos that we know what your whole humanity is, man. That is, that is so dangerous. Everyone has mucked up a word every now and again. And that, you know, everyone's intentions all the time. I mean, this is one of the things that when when, uh, Sam Harris was first getting attacked relentlessly by the left, it was like, they always would go after the way he, it would be a toe. He said that word that way. Or if we said this word, but you know, you, if you would have put a comma there and it's like, man, you guys, you want to live in a world where we will all be afraid to speak because we will all get to the point where, I mean, again, it gets back to where we started, but all the good people will check out. You will never want to have a political conversation with anyone. The the areas for us to just be human. I know you've talked about this a little bit to just be, okay. It's why I can't watch sports center anymore

Speaker 3:          00:44:14       so we can get to this story. See, right. Here's the big sports story. So yesterday go, Nike released its new ad campaign, the 30 year anniversary of just do it. It's face Colin Kaepernick and it slogan and believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything, Hashtag just do it. So he's the new fee. He hasn't played in the NFL for two years. Yeah, he is. Uh, he obviously is famous for, for kneeling, for the flag, but apparently he sacrificed everything. He's, uh, he's going to get multimillions of dollars in his own line of clothes, uh, in, in the Nike brand is of course is create a great consternation. So that's, that's the big story. The last 24 hours.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       I mean, does this just prove, and I think a few other people, I think, um, uh, what's his name? Oh Man, I'm blanking. I'll get, I'll get in a second. Um, that, that this social justice thing just ruins everything. Like it really did ruin, uh, ESPN. Yup. And that every time they travel. Yeah. I'm sorry, clay traffic. That's really how removed I am. One second. I can't remember friend's name. Um, that he just ruins everything that, that you're handing out sportsman of the year awards to Caitlyn Jenner and you're doing all of these things in the idea that you're being tolerant and good and you're actually doing nothing that has anything to do with what your mission statement is. What is Nike's mission statement? It's to put shoes and I guess, you know, sports shirts on people so they can be the best athletes they can be. And I'm not saying they should be completely a political like they should. And again, they can do whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:45:40       Well, it's a capitalist. I mean it's a capitalist move. And if you look at the statistics, either work does this water, this whole drive. First of all, it's viral marketing. Second of all, Nielsen shows that the people who are most likely to engage in viral marketing on behalf of brands are actually black folks in the United States. Yeah. And I did 44% more likely, I think according to Nielsen and black folks in the United States are also significantly more likely to be buying clothing as a then then nonwhite folks in the United States according to a study from University of Chicago, like clothing, like expensive clothing. Okay. Per per income level or income level. Is there's an interesting something to talk about their, yeah, they, they've done studies on, it's really interesting. Yeah. And uh, you know, is that a legacy of, of one of the theories on that is that it's a legacy of if you can't afford to show how rich you are buying an expensive cars, did you buy an expensive pair of shoes?

Speaker 3:          00:46:31       It's 300 bucks as opposed to $35,000, for example. Um, but it's, but there's, there's a lot there. And obviously in terms of disproportionate sports, watching a young black men watch a lot more sports than people of other races. So it makes a fair bit of marketing sense. But the funny part is the left falling into the trap of now backing a massive international company. Yeah. Right. That is most famous for running sweatshops in Asia. It's a capital, it's a really, again, that's basically the story, but it's also obviously happening because Trump's president right now, this happened two years ago, if Hillary Clinton or president, they would not be doing this with Colin Kaepernick.

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       Yeah. It's so, it's so interesting because so last night it was my last night, right. And I have,

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       I now you're sad. Right. And I'm gonna want to miss my hope. I hope we've almost sufficiently ruined your life,

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       I think. I think you have chance to ruin it a little bit. No, but this is what it's all about. Right? This is why I got off the [inaudible]. Right. This is why I want to do this with you. But, but, so the only thing that I did do, so it's not that I watch no TV, but I watch movies or watch Netflix or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       So last night I watched, um, Avengers, infinity war. I hadn't seen it before. I thought the movie was spectacular basically. I'm sure you've written up probably, you've probably written a critique of it. I don't want to go too far into that, but my only critique wise, we all know they're not dead. So that's exactly right. Yeah. It's like no, Spiderman didn't just die, but okay. Black Panther, their $1 billion. Right. So for property investment completely right, but putting that aside, I thought it was a pretty great movie in the way they could link everything together. The way I link this back to what we're talking about right now is, so mark Ruffalo, who plays the hulk in it, he's a huge lefty, progressive, whatever, and he's babbling on politics all the time and on Twitter and whatever. And I, you know, I don't like attacking people, so I don't really want to make this about him, but I think he's a pretty bad actor in general.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       Like I find him very irritating as the hulk. I thought Edward Norton was a lot better in the, in the previous incarnation, but after being away from everything for a while, watching him knowing that here's this guy that like really like politically I just think is just so annoying and gets all these retweets on like stupid stuff and just share as all these what I think are really bad ideas and whatever. And of course he can do it, but like I was, every scene that he was in, I was like, Ugh, like it actually kind of like I love you. Like, and then David said something which was interesting. He was like, he's like, you know, actors, of course they can do whatever they want, but it's like if these guys would just shut up and you didn't know anything about them, then they'd be doing their craft properly.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       You know, like, and I think there's probably like people that do that, that really avoiding the studio theory for literally decades. Let's keep that personal life away from the papers and just the only thing you see on the screen is the person on the screen. Yeah. Or some of them could be more famous for some like, like a Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Like there's like a, there's like a separate area. You see how his career like took kitchen ups and downs because of Brad Pitt oily stuff and now with jelly and all this, right. But like these old button but that's more about their relationships and whatever. So that's one thing. But these overtly political people all the time, especially, you know, I haven't thought about any of these people in a long time, but a lot of the comedians that I used to like that have now gone off the deep end.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Uh, politically it's like you guys have ruined what I thought of your comedy because of the way you act and behave all the time. Hey Lucy Kay's back. No shit getting crap for it and really wait. What do you mean back? Like he performed stand up club. Okay, well that that would be the natural way to start. And how did it go? He got a standing o but people on the left were very, very, very upset because he's not allowed to come back yet because he hasn't served his proper penance. Wow. So, so what, so for a guy like you, so conservative, I know obviously the actions that he did, I'm sure you find reprehensible and all that, but I know you do believe in forgiveness and I also think that there are levels of reprehensible. So I think that what he did is pretty reprehensible.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       But what he did is not in the Harvey Weinstein category of reprehensible from, from what I can see. Right. So when you argue then that a guy like Harvey Weinstein, there's no, I know he's probably not getting [inaudible] actual rapists. Nobody's watching actual rape against the Lucy Kay right there. They're arguing that he brought women into his room and then jacked off in front of them and then people associate with say jacked off, but you want to say fuck on camera. That's, that's your policy. And then I loosen virtually all my policies, put him on your show, it's your show. So I curse a little bit. I was like, shit on your shot, you want to say fuck, you'll say shit. And it's policy. Right. Exactly. It's like it's like network TV. So it's uh, but uh, yeah, I think that in that if there's a market for him to come back, there's a market for him to come back.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       I mean that's, that's my general feeling for this. And if people want to sue him than they should to him. And if people want to like, this is how, this is why we have a system of torts. This is why we have a system. I mean, he apologized for it. Presumably these women, if they think that they can find evidence that they were actively denied jobs because of the Lucy Kay, they can see, let me go funny. Right, exactly. Yeah. But this idea that we're going to put people into kind of excommunication until they come back and then we, again, it's this variable excommunication right? If you're, if you're Mel Gibson, it's a certain amount of time and if it's a certain amount of time, can we used the kits like eight months and for Mel Gibson, it's like eight years and then eventually you come back and daddy's home or something.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       But is it, but I find all, I have decent medic fields by the way. Yeah. Okay. But there's something interesting there because it's like if you don't like Louis Ck, let's say you don't like him as like, if you don't like him as a comic, don't go to shows. I like them as a person. Don't go to shows if you don't like what he did. Don't go to his show. It don't appear. Don't give him two drinks and the cover charge, all that. Just don't do it. But this is so fundamentally why I believe that live and let live is the only way to actually have a functioning society that all you can do is defend our ability to be different. That's basically it, because otherwise it should, the man never be allowed to work again. I mean, they, they say a lot of people say yes, right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       So shoot his wife be allowed to work, should his children, you know what I mean? It's like, all right, this, this is sort of like this wind is repentance actually take place because Bill Clinton is still held in wide as team for doing a lot worse than, than Louis c. K that's the crazy, well they did until we'll get to that. Here's it. So there's, we have three more headlines, so you're good. Okay. So headline number one, uh, is a Risa Franklin died. So that was a oh really? Yes. That was a big story. And she had a huge funeral. Uh, it was a 10 hour funeral, I believe. Something like that. It was really insane. And they just got like every great singer to a bunch of singers in there. And uh, the, the kind of headline, the, the politically oriented headlines, Al Sharpton got up and bash Trump and then there was a, and then Bill Clinton was sitting on stage next to, in order to his, he had been to his right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       So it was Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton. Louis Farrakhan. Ah, Shit. Yeah. Sitting, sitting next to all three of them. So that was one Clinton related headline. The other Clinton related headline was more humorous, which was Clinton who is a dirty old man. It was a dirty old man when he was a dirty young man. Uh, Ariana Grande's saying and when she came up, yeah, there's video of him legitimately checking her out like up and down, full on, smiling, giggling, like, like really going after it. I need find you somebody who looks at you the way Bill Clinton looks like. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       So let's, let's pause on that one. Cause we all know Bill Clinton likes women. Let's just pause on that. Let's go to the other ones. Forget Jesse Jackson obviously and forget Al Sharpton. I have whatever, forget that they're both both antisemites but the lesser amount Korean antisemites they're, you know, I think Jews have learned one thing over the millennia. It's kind of like you got to pick the big anti Semite to deal with good whatever. But like what he was on to see two or three seats away from Louis Farrakhan. Yeah. After this is to, I mean only it was only two or three months ago. Those insane tweets about Jews being the devil and all that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       Yeah, man. So he was it. So you use there and then that was juxtaposed with,

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       wait, wait, wait, did, was there any, so of course conservative media called him out. Was there anything nobody else cared, so nothing. He probably didn't even make it on NBC nightly news. Not as far as I know it was, it was sort of just seen as part of the thing. You know, they're all the funerals together. This is the bullshit that people can't take anymore. This double standard, epic nonsense that every time a Trump supporter does something, everyone on the right should apologize or whatever. And that this type of bullshit the ex president sits with. What I would argue is the, probably the foremost, I was going to say preeminent, the Anti Semite threats. So that's probably to a dance, right? But like legitimately like a disgusting human being who it's by, by choosing to group up any group of people in a specific way is the very definition of prejudice and racism and all that. This is what the left is supposed to be against. This is their whole thing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:47       But that's what was going on. So that was just, what was it that happened on the same day as the other big story was that John Mccain died. So that was, I'm sure the one that you heard.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Okay, so this is the one that, I didn't know this until about two days ago and I was on the phone with my dad and I said, I said, you know, we were talking about being off the grid and I said, you know, and I have, I don't know anything. And he was as if he just like, I don't know what has happened is healthy and just see, but he goes, but you know, John Mccain died and I was like,

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       so they, but did you know about [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       as you know? So I know, I know nothing other than he does. So first off, I don't even know when he died. They said justify or, sure. Two

Speaker 3:          00:55:17       weeks, a week and a half ago. We can only die to Saturday before last. Okay. So [inaudible] Sabbath and, and that was the news. So sorry, he passed away. Uh, president Trump obviously not a fan. And the first thing that it's a Trump didn't issue any official statement for two days. And then he, the, the basic rule of thumb is that when a sitting senator dies, you lower the, the flags to half staff until the person is actually buried. Uh, Trump did the statutory minimum. He lowered the flag for 24 hours, and then he raised it back up again. All the other federal flags were lower, but you could see a picture over the White House of the flag back up at full staff. And then at the Washington monument, which can see behind it, you see all of them down at half staff. He then reversed himself rate, lowered the flag again, issued a statement.

Speaker 3:          00:56:02       And then at Mccain's funeral, uh, he was not invited because Mccain didn't horn in there, which I can't really blame McCain for that. And then at the funeral did, George W spoke, Obama spoke, Megan Mccain spoke, all three of them took shots of Trump. So Megan Mccain, so Megan Mccain said, uh, we didn't need to make America great again. America is already great and kind of really went hard after Trump. Wow. And then, uh, Obama got up and he said, know our country was about all these things here we can have the American creed and we can, and we're all part of the same America and taking pretty obvious mail shots at Trump. And then Bush did some of the same sort of stuff. Wow. All right. So that was it. So that was yesterday or something,

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       a couple of things there. First I find the flag thing. I mean this is the tight look, you know, I think I've been pretty freaking fair on Trump and I get a ton of shit for it. I think you've been pretty fair on him. You get a ton of ship port, this type of thing. Like this flag thing like that. It's just like the non is childish. That's just the child is nonsense that looks like this should not be, it's your, should not be. This is, this is ridiculous. So let's just move past that one. That's it. First off, just quickly on Megan Mccain, you know, I gotta tell you, I know Megan A. Little bit. Yeah, we've met a couple of times and I, you know, there's a, there's a clip of her about it probably about six years ago, if not more at this point on real time.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       Did you ever see this where, um, she says something, she's in, she gets in an argument. Paul Begala, uh, is he a democratic strategists are seeing it, yes. Is on the other side. And they get into an argument and she says, Oh, you're just attacking me because I'm young and I don't know everything about World War II or something. He's like, I wasn't alive during the French revolution, but I know about that. And it gets huge applause and it's a great line. And it's like you can't use your excuse of, um, if you're, if you're a pundit or a whatever, then be upon it. You can't. The second that, you know, it gets hot in the kitchen, you can't be like, well, I'm young, I'm not supposed to be here. So I, that's why I was very unimpressed. That was the first time I probably ever saw her publicly and I was very unimpressed with her. I've gotten to know her a little bit and I'd watched some clips on the view and my mom keeps calling me and telling me that she's seen conservative. And I gotta tell you, I'm very impressed by her.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       Actually. I'm very nation. I used to be very much at odds and in the last I'd say year and a half, we become good at least friends. Yeah. I'm glad to hear that. That's because of this. I mean, I think the cheese shifted. Yeah. We've all shifted since we were young, but I think that juice, she's shifted too, so, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       Wait, let me ask you anything. So, uh, I assume that the day he died that there was the endless, like people are dancing on his grave now. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:19       So then that there was a, there was some of that, but mostly the left was praising him because he was the antitrust throws it. So after spending most of his life crapping all over him, right. The guy when he was racist, when he ran for president and incompetent and old, you know, and right, exactly. Then he was a great hero because he was an anti Trump and so his entire life was defined by the fact that he and Trump didn't get along. So there was a lot of that, uh, you know, my own take on this was that the, the funeral, well, I understand Meghan Mccain's, a grieving daughter. She had stayed over, she wants, but that said, is it a smell? Let's say that you actively want to undercut president Trump. Let's say that that's actually your goal. Your goal at this funeral is that you want to, is that you, you don't like what Trump stands for and you want to undercut him.

Speaker 3:          00:58:56       Almost the worst thing you can do is get George Shelby Bush, Barack Obama and Megan Mccain up there bashing Trump. And the reason for that is because the, there is this, what Trump is a response to is a sense that there are a bunch of elites who get together in back rooms and party with each other and then they pretend to disagree with each other for the cameras. But in reality the crew, which is kind of true, right? But in reality they're back slapping each other and they're all best friends and are civil and we all get along and and then are kind of the commoners out here where like, wait a second, these issues actually matter to me. Why do I care about your golf club? I don't care about George h w being friends with Clinton. I want to know like who wins this political argument because it affects me, right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:31       I don't care about like how you guys get along. And so it was this feeling like there a video that was going around to George w handing Michelle Obama a piece of candy. And I was like, well, this is what politics used to be, and I just kept thinking, no, it didn't. I'm old enough to remember when Barack Obama was labeling George W. Bush essentially a war criminal, and so you're going to do this whole, Trump is a departure from everything that politics has ever been. It just felt really disingenuous. Not because the criticism of Trump was, was uncalled for because I think some of it is called for, but because it was creating this image of politics that didn't exist and then contracting Trump with this image of politics, that's not actually right.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Real so. Isn't that an interesting example of why the 24 hour news cycle or whatever you call Twitter now or 24 hour news cycle sounds crazy, but we need somebody else. This hyperspeed insanity of why it really, it's, it's a threat to our ability to think clearly about things because the very people who you hate it, eight years ago, all these were not now. I'm not saying it was warranted than, yeah, I regret I will. I don't know that I've ever said this publicly. I regret not voting for Mccain in retrospect. I think that we'd be in a very different place right now. And I think he was, I think he was the, he may be the last decent man that we had running for president at least for a long time as a decent guy. Ron. Oh, Ron. Okay, so all right. That might've been a little bit of hyperbole, but if you remember, he always wanted to go, hi. He made her come here.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       High level mean he refused to go with the Jeremiah Wright stuff. He called off his campaign in the last month because of the economic collapse.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       Okay. So I'll, I'll modify that money without commenting on Romney specifically. Like I think by all, by all measures, Mccain for whatever his flaws may be, and maybe he was a little more of a neocon than, than I would care for her or whatever else it is. It's like if you don't think he was a decent man who really loved his country, like you're, you're actually crazy. And this goes to when you demonize people to the nth degree who don't deserve demonization, then you get the real demon. And I'm not even saying Trump is the real demon, but the way they flip history. So it's like you hated him forever and you, you want it to destroy this guy forever. Now he hates your new demon cause you're always finding new demons. So now we got a new good guy and it's like, that's not, that's partly because we cannot remember history anymore because we're slammed with three day news stories that, you know, I said it's 24 hour news cycle, but it's really, it's, it's more of like a three day thing. We care for three days and then expunge, you know, and I think that that now is becoming like the real threat right now.

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       Okay. So final news story for you, and this would be the one that really has ruined everybody's Day, but

Speaker 2:          01:01:57       that's great. So there's, so there's a big scandal. We don't have a bruise on his head anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:02:02       I'll hold the bottle of wine there. But yeah, the, uh, you're not gonna have wine for this one and it's, so basically there was a big scandal in Pennsylvania. There was a state attorney general report that suggested that over the course of 30 years, 1000 children who've been molested by Catholic priests and that these kit and that these priests had then been around. And then following on that, there's a guy named Archbishop Vergano. Uh, and uh, he was the people in Lindsay, I believe, to the United States and he came forward with an 11 page letter in which she accused essentially the entire Vatican hierarchy of being complicit in covering off trout molestation, child rape, uh, and what he suggested was a growing weed in his terms, homosexual subculture in the church when she means by which he meant that there was there particular cardinals who had been accused of actually used to do sing seminarians and all of this sort of thing.

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       Yeah. Let's just pause for one second. [inaudible] linked those two things, but I don't mean to sound Glib here, but how is this sort of new, so it's only new in that he is accusing Pope Francis of actively covering it up. Oh, okay. So he's saying that there's a cardinal McCarrick who was, who was complicit, who was apparently accused of child molestation or at least molestation of underage seminarians, basically. Uh, and this and this guy, artificial Degano said Pope Francis not only knew about it, he reinstated McCarrick embedded, acted basically put the guy in in silence and prayer and that Francis had brought the guy back and made him a public figure again, it had done so with multiple other similar figures. Uh, and because Francis, the accusation is soft on homosexuality inside the Catholic Church, that's his accusation, but Ganos uh, and then by extension soft on people who had been molested seminarians and also happened to be homosexual, uh, or practicing homosexuality. So,

Speaker 2:          01:03:42       so I, uh, okay. So all right.

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       [inaudible] they conflated here. So a couple of things being completed. One is, uh, people are suggesting that, um, the reason that this is all happening is because anti gay feelings in the church are leading people to go after Francis or leading people to go after McCarrick. I, and that's a weird argument because really what we should all be able to say is that a few things can be true. One, there's no statistical linkage between homosexuality and child molestation. Right. Obviously to that, a disproportionate number of the people who have been molested inside the Catholic church had been young boys. Yeah. Which is also true. It's four out of five and three that any pope who covers this crap up should be criminally liable basically. And the media, it's like paternal, I mean, exactly. And you know, this exist in pretty much every major institution, secular or religious. There's always an attempt to cover up sins inside that particular institution. This is true for every religious institution that I know about. Pretty sure it's true for every institution. Public schools, like legitimately every institution button.

Speaker 2:          01:04:45       So you tried to cover up the whole, uh, you know, trying to take out Bernie thing that was driving.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       So, the, so the, but the, the part of this story, the twist to the story where the good part that's new is not only that for, it's a Francis stayed silent, he's refused to respond to any of the allegations. Uh, it's, the allegation has been backed by a bunch of other testimony. Bishops are basically going to war with one another for the first time in 500 years. Like they're openly criticizing each other. Wow. And the, and I think the, the most shocking thing is that the media are running full scale editorials attacking the quote unquote ultra conservative wing within the Catholic Church for going after Francis. So the same media that back in 2003 was going after John Paul two. Yeah. And saying, and benedict and saying these guys are responsible for all of this and they should, now they're defending Francis specifically because they think that this is a conservative attempt to ask Frances because Frances a liberal pub.

Speaker 2:          01:05:36       So, okay. So basically the media is trying to, he's because he's a little more pro gay, so to speak, whatever that

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       all that middle environmentalist and he's more of a selection in general legal immigration and all that stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       So the media oddly is trying to protect him, man. I mean this again it goes to this thing of like we are enemies will be our friends the second we need them and then we'll throw them out and what, I mean this is just sounds

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       awful. It's awful. Yeah. I mean it's like a 500 years. It could cause a 500 years can schism in the church like the worst schism in the church since maybe the Protestant reformation. Yeah. Because there's like an entire wing of the church because you can't impeach the pope. There's entire, we'll get the church going. The Vatican hierarchy covered this stuff up because they cover this stuff up and now he's being defended by a bunch of people who aren't real fond of Catholics in general. Yeah. But somehow have now found enthusiasm for Pope Francis.

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       If you were, if you were Catholic and, and you were a real believer, but obviously didn't stand for any of this of course. But let's just say you're the average Catholic out there. Who's a good, decent person. You happen to be older believer, I would assume the way you believe in Judaism, it's okay. So let's say, let's say you're that now Judaism, I know it doesn't have a structure like that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       That's all I'm doing is any rabbi [inaudible]. I mean, I don't know. I'll see you in the Jewish community. I don't know who Catholic doctrine warranty. You don't have papal infallibility and Judaism. Yeah. Any rabbi who complicit in the cover up of child molestation should immediately go to jail. Yeah. I mean like the, the, I have no tolerance for this kind of bullshit. And the, and the fact that this is not only being tolerated but forwarded by certain members of the press is an astonishing thing. And it's the same people who are getting spotlight an Oscar, right? Five years ago. Right, right. Because it was so important to uncover all this stuff happening within the church and now it's no guy hands off. I mean, France is really important figure and the fact that all these people are attacking him, we can't take it seriously for political reasons. We have to, we have to suggest that it's just a hit job against Francis.

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       Do you think there's like sort of like, this is just another extension of, as we've, over the last couple of years, just watched all of these institutions crumble. Like we've watched mainstream media crumble. We're watching our political institutions, I don't know that they're quite crumbling, but they're, they're [inaudible], they're teetering certainly. But shifting in nature and also like the legislative branch is basically becoming a useless, nothing is as worse as we're right as we're, as we're handing everything over to the king. Uh, another good reason to be for small government, either classical liberal or libertarian, etc. Um, but that, that this with the church without, without making it too specific about these specific things, that it's just another one of these things that these giant institutions that used to be able to control narrative control gatekeeping and all of that, they actually cannot withstand things anymore. Sort of, I mean this is where I've been sort of critical at the Internet and the way we're all behaving on there, but like truth does find a way.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       So then we watch these institutions try to attack the people because the people have a better essence of what the truth is then be institutions or am I getting something there? And that's exactly right in the, in the fact that it's the most shocking performance by the press that I've seen, including anything with regard to Trump to shift to shift on a dime and start going, well you know what, let's go check out these allegations of child molestation cause we really liked this pope. It's like, Whoa, that's, that's, that's pretty amazing stuff. And I'm talking not, I'm not talking about the editorial boards, I'm talking about objective news coverage, objective news coverage. Yeah. There was a headline in the New York Times that said Pope Francis takes high road as conservatives pounds, man over allegations of covering up sexual abuse of seminarians in, in mind. First it's, it's, it's totally wild.

Speaker 1:          01:08:59       I mean, I think we, this is just part and parcel with what we've watched sort of happen to the New York Times over the last couple of years. I mean, you know, I've said this many times, but I, I'm pretty sure the New York Times didn't cover Bret Weinstein at evergreen once in the pages of the paper, but did three or four editorials about it. You know, they, they constantly do this type of thing where it's like they're editorializing their entire coverage often by what they're not covering. And so to watch this was an important institution, I think for a long time kind of crumble like that. And I, this gets us back to that story 20 this gets us back to story one where now you're going to bring in people to actually, instead, this is where when people say, Dave, you attack the left too much. You don't have to talk the right.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       It's like the right, this isn't about institutional power anymore at some, at some old Trump's the president, I get it. But like the left has all this media power and all everything else, and you're willingly bringing in people that truly are racist. Or if without calling these people specifically racist, have, have terrible ideas. And you're saying this is, this is part of what mainstream should be. So you're mainstreaming what would a really radical ideas. All righty. Yes. Yeah. Got You. Got You. There it is. Okay. So submit your questions for me and for Dave on Patrion and super chat right now. We're going to take a quick break and then we'll be right back with those questions. Oh Man.

Speaker 4:          01:10:37       Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:10:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:11:30       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:12:01       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       [inaudible] whoa.

Speaker 5:          01:13:04       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:13:58       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:14:09       [inaudible] okay,

Speaker 2:          01:15:15       well we're back at the Ben Shapiro report. That's all right. I'm hosting today because Dave is just back and if you missed it earlier, we went through all of the news. So Dave is markedly more depressed than he was an hour and a half ago, which makes me happy since I'm a status. So let's run a tight ship. By the way, when I do the breaks in between the interview in the live show, it ends up being like, I always say we'll be back in 30 seconds. It's like seven minutes. You were like, well come on. I mean we've got to make money. So it's fast and you move. That's exactly right. So we've got patrion questions and super chat questions. So let's start with the patriarch question. Dave, do you think there's any turning back from the politicization of literally everything fun or is this the new norm now? I think for now it is the new norm and I think that we have to get through this and I think we can get through it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       I'm telling you, as I said to you an hour ago, I spent the last month talking to real people all over the place. Ray, I would literally on the street, like if I just saw it, like if I was just standing there, I just talked to, I was just talking to me, but I really felt like I could be a little more connected to people. People don't want everything to be politicized all the time. They don't want, why do you watch sports? It's not for politics. Why do you watch the Avengers? It's not for politics. Why any most of the things you do, it's not for politics. And the fact that they've let this creep into everything too. It's, it's just another, and when I say day it's like there's this a morphous thing. I'm not a sports media. Yeah. And I don't know that it's, it's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:16:32       You know, a fully, I think there is some level of coordination in different ways, but like I'm not saying there's like a group of four or five guys sitting in a room like how do we divide America and destroy everything? Maybe there is, I don't know, but like this endless thing where we just are going to hate each other all the time. And this is why I've said it before, but like this is why I truly, truly believe, I believe it now more than ever, identity politics is the biggest threat that a free society has and is particularly our free society because we've done the melting pot better than anybody. We did a melting pot, we did it right. We blended this thing right. Everyone still wants to come here for a better. All these celebrities that always tweet, they're going to leave. Nobody ever leaves.

Speaker 2:          01:17:13       And the same people who will tell you what a racist, evil, patriarchal, homophobic, transphobic society America is. They're the same people who want open borders because they want apparently everyone to come in and share in the Harz. So I think it's truly, it is a threat. But yes, I think we will get past it. And the reason I'm hopeful is because when we look at all of the mainstream media that's peddling this stuff crumbling, and we look at the amount of people that are listening to long form conversations and getting what their ideas are. I mean, when I go to these Peterson things and people come up to me and say, you know, I, I started watching your show and then I saw Shapiro on there and Harris and Peterson and blah blah blah. And I started thinking about things differently and then I bought Peterson's book. And you know what, I I stopped smoking weed or

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       yeah. Yeah. I'm not even saying smoking weed is bad. I know we have a difference of opinion on the lines based on this stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       So I really believe that while you can't see it, if you just look at that online tier, that in reality, I think there is something incredibly good happening.

Speaker 1:          01:18:09       Okay. So here's the super chat question for you. Uh, let's see. Um, it says love the do this one's interesting. Love the two of you. You both converted as socialist into a libertarian conservative, awful about Russian Shapiro. Will you bake Ruben a wedding cake? Okay, so my answer is I'm married already, right? But an adverse, or I buy my anniversary last week and anniversary cake would have been nice. Right? So I, so the answer is no. And the reason I won't is because it's a religious Jew. I, yeah. I do not participate in activities that I believe are sinful. But again, we live in a free country and Dave knows this. He doesn't have to care what I think about sin. And as long as I'm not bothering Dave, I don't see why it's a problem. Yeah, it will. I will. I did. Does Dave have a husband? Yeah. I mean like, okay. And Are we friends? Yeah. And Are we gonna go out to dinner sometime in the near future? Yeah. But there's a difference between me just being friends with Dave and me actively participating in an event that I feel is religiously sinful. And I think this is how most religious Christians in most religious Jews feel. And while at awkward, yeah, we're still friends in spite of it, which is why we're friends, friends, in spite of it, then it'd be a bad thing

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       when I, when I did your interview show, which by the way, I mean, yeah, you Jack, the idea of an interview show front of me, it's all right. It's true, but nobody has done it before me. Um, but what you said that to me in, and I truly mean this, like if you think what I'm doing is sinful, like I,

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       I know it sounds Glib, but I don't care. I you is, you don't have to care, right. Free Country, right? Like that's the thing. And it's like, look, look, there is,

Speaker 2:          01:19:41       of course someone's going to go, well wait a minute. If you really think his marriage is sinful are saying, of course they'll, they'll may be a place that in the nature of our friendship maybe that we can't quite get to, that I would be able to get to with someone that didn't think for sure. That is very possible. And, and it, and it goes both ways, right? Like I then look at you and I go, well why

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       that's a kid. You don't want me teaching your kid about the nature of family perhaps, right? I mean like, like there are some lead, but I just put, you're probably a pretty good dad. Like, you know what I mean? Like we, but why is it that we're able to do this? And most people can't do this? That's what I'm curious about. Hold on. And we can have our own lives. I mean that's, that's real. And I think part of friendship by the way is that like we go home at night and we just have our own lives. Yeah. I'm not married to you. Right. And like that's like my wife and I have to agree on these issues. You and I don't have to agree on these issues in order for us to share a common space together. And that's really the important thing that your wife and you have to agree on these, on all of these issues or just the sort of, the more foundational and the foundational ones.

Speaker 1:          01:20:35       But I do think that how you raise your kids religiously and with regards to things like sexual morality does actually have to be at the root of, of how you teach your kids. So if you have deep, if you have deep divisions with your spouse on these issues, I think that, and you're looking to build a family anyway, then I think that these are issues where building on a bad foundation is a bad move. So let me, okay, so if you wouldn't bake me a cake, that's okay. Now because it's 50, 50, I can't bake you a cake with David's trouble chef. And He would've done it coaching the whole, wow. Now I feel bad for you. You got me this clothes. Putting that aside, you can't have any bids. Kosher cake. Now, um, if we were having an anniversary party, would you come? If I was inviting all the crew that we all know and we were just an anniversary party, we're just having a party and a, and I'll even throw in some kosher food for you to make sure you don't have to bring your own know.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       I'd have to think about it. I'd have to think about it in the same way. That's interesting to me cause that's, that's a different thing. Well, not really, because again, it's if you're a religious person, and again, take it from the religious perspective that from the religious perspective, the question is, are you glorifying something that you think is sinful substituted party for something that you think was originally sinful? Can you participate in that? So from a religious point of view, that's an actual serious moral question. Yeah. What I go out to dinner with you, the answer is yes, right? Because that's not actually like, let's celebrate something that I feel that you're doing is sinful. But I'd have to, I'd have to think about that one. I'm, and I'm being in a perfectly straight forward as possible. I want you to see, that's so interesting to me cause it's like if I threw a regular party, just we were just going to a party at my house and all the guys that's [inaudible] like I bake you a cake, but it had nothing to do with the gay wedding and I would go to a party with you that has nothing to do with gay men.

Speaker 1:          01:22:09       Would you make me a regular cake? Could I just have a Thursday? Sure I'd give you my baking sucks. I'll just buy you one. I want you to Shepherd's gate like Shapiro cake and then I'm going to write it. Then once I get a piece of crap, I mean, it's not gonna be good, but it's that it'll be there. All right. Let's see. There's a lot there were, you know what, this is what we'll keep talking about forever and it's all right. Exactly. All right. Let's see. Um, so Ben, huge fan. Why do Asians overwhelmingly support the left in spite of their cultural values and how do we change this? Also, how are you explaining each of your kids why it's wrong to lie? Are you using religion or reason? Uh, so the, uh, on the first question, why do Asians overwhelmingly support the left?

Speaker 1:          01:22:45       I think that there is a misperception that is bolstered by a republican inability to talk about issues of race, which is that you have to overcome the, the basic presumption that Republicans are evil racists. And once you get over that presumption, then people tend to vote more conservative, but then his genes might vote for their own economic interests. Right. And for their own college education interest. I mean, it's the left that's trying to ban Asians from higher education to places like Harvard, but the right has a reputation as being racist. And it is not forwarded by intemperate remarks from the president of the United States on these sorts of issues. And the right also, you know, should be willing to ignorance. I think that there's this weird conversation about race that goes something like this. People on the left say there's been historic racism in American society and people in the right read that as what you're saying is there's historic racism in American society and that means you want affirmative action.

Speaker 1:          01:23:35       And so people on the right goal, I don't even want to talk about that. And the people and let's say, well, you don't want to talk about that because you're a racist. Because what they read the right saying is, I don't want to talk about it at all because you're a racist. When the conversation really should go like this left as there's historic racism in American society and go, right. And then the, and the law says, and now I want affirmative action. You say, nope. And then you have a conversation about the actual policy. But we conflate the questions because we're all reading each other's minds. And that's a dangerous game. Well, it's interesting because one of the things that people say to me all the time when I, when I do public speaking events, talk to people after, they will always say, you know, I was, I, the huge amount of people say to me, I was a lefty.

Speaker 1:          01:24:07       I was just like you, I, I s then evolved sort of the way you did. And I can't tell you the amount of friends that I have that now think I'm a racist because I believe in low taxes or blah blah blah. And it's like the way they've been able to conflate policy with racism is crazy because they think the average lefty out there, and I'm just doing something broad for the purposes of a conversation, thinks that if you say low taxes, you mean you don't want to give money to poor people. Now that is actually true, but that doesn't mean it's racist. You think that there are better ways to help poor people than just taking money from some and giving it to others. So they've really, there's an incredible trick that they've pulled there. That these are not racist. The amount of conservative and Libertarian, uh, college things that I go to and all these things and I never meet racist or I'm meeting some pretty damn shady racist because I can't figure out that they're racist and they keep, they keep inviting me.

Speaker 1:          01:25:00       So, alright, let's see. Um, uh, on that second question, how am I explaining to my kids why it's wrong to lie religion or reason? I mean, the answer typically is both, right? You say that God doesn't want you to lie because you are and, and Bait. And why doesn't God want you to lie is the reasonable question and the answers. God doesn't want you to lie because it is a, is a fundamental disrespect of another person as made in God's image. I think that virtually all of Western civilization is built on one verse in the Bible, that human beings are made in God's image and from their springs in enormous amounts of good. There are things in religion that have brought about an enormous amount of bad, but that is one aspect of religion that I don't think you can get to simply through scientific materialism.

Speaker 1:          01:25:34       But this is a Sam Harris. We've had, this is, this is the Sam you, Sam Jordan wanted, that's what it all whittles down to that can science and reason in your own consciousness to get you there at a, at a human. Speaking of which was a patron of question four, it says, Dave, did you find out what they, what the dark enlightenment is? The, Oh, you know, someone asked me about the dark enlightenment once on a Patrion feed and I, I think maybe somebody sent me some info. I honestly, I think, I think basically the idea of the dark enlightenment for, for those who are sort of unaware, is that what, what

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       you know, um, pinker will do is he'll basically say all the good stuff that I liked from the enlightenment, the enlightenment and everything else is the counter alignment and dark and light man is basically, well, no Roussel was part of the enlightenment to, he just happened to suck. And so that's it. And so trying to look at the downsides and the upsides of the enlightenment is actually a worthwhile.

Speaker 2:          01:26:19       So this is sorta like, I remember right before I left, um, there were a couple people like really attacking the enlightenment as this racist movement. So this is sort of that,

Speaker 3:          01:26:28       that, but also like the, there's a, there's a perspective on the enlightenment that basically says that the enlightenments move toward individual values and away from was, was simultaneously a move away from virtue. So if you look at sort of more ancient philosophy, ancient philosophy says that your goal as a human being is to act in accordance with natural law, natural law being the things that [inaudible] reason dictates. Essentially. This is sort of the Aristotelian, yeah, natural law argument. I, and then in the, in the sort of modern period people say, well, but everybody has a different idea of what's good for them. So this libertarian idea and so what we need is limited institutions so that people can do whatever they want. And so the idea of the dark enlightenment basically is that if you take that libertarian ideal to its extreme where there is no social fabric that combines us anymore than you either end up with sort of this atomism where everybody is on their own. There's no shared sense of, of belonging and those who knows your sense of values. And on the other hand, if you believe that reason, rules everything but that individual human beings don't mean anything, then marks is a part of this enlightenment. Ideal to our reason is the head and we, all we have to do is reorganize society along the lines that we see fit and we can create a better man.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       Right. So I mean the other side of the enlightenment, right. I got it. So, so you know that I obviously I mostly believe in that libertarian idea [inaudible] right. So I believe in it within the prism of, I think that's how human flourishing and human freedom we'll expand the most. Not, I believe you have to be left basically to your own ideas but I don't want to live in Mad Max at the same time. And I understand, right? This is where

Speaker 3:          01:27:57       this is restricting in critique, right? Patrick Deneen has a book called why liberalism failed and his basic critique is that we aired too much on the side of liberty without in a focus on the social fabric that if you don't focus on the social fabric, you don't focus on virtue. You only focus on, right. While you end up with is a bunch of people who are non virtuous who think everything. Is that right?

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       You know, it's funny. I mean, you know, my thoughts on most of these political issues and we just spent the last hour and a half talking a lot about virtue and a lot about the social fabric. So whatever that is there for it, that's where, that's where I'm at.

Speaker 3:          01:28:24       Okay. Here's a patriotic question. Uh, let's see. Uh hmm. Okay. What, if any success could president Trump have where the media would give him credit without a backhand dilution or anything else? Do you think there's anything Trump could do with the media? Would give him credit?

Speaker 2:          01:28:38       Not really. I mean, they've painted it. Look, they've painted him as Hitler. I mean, I, the first video that I did the day after the election, sitting in my backyard, I said, you know, the risk here is that, and I was even saying this before the election, if you keep calling someone Hitler, you can never acknowledged when anything is good and that that will keep pushing you further one way and potentially pushing the other person the other way. Or at least the supporters that you, because you can't be like, oh, well the economy's doing well, good for Hitler. You know what I mean? Like everything that you do that's good is actually worse for you. Right. Actually evil. And this is also where you get this sort of a guy who I, you know, I agreed with for most of my life why now have some disagreements with, but I had nothing but respect for Bill Maher.

Speaker 2:          01:29:18       You know, a couple of months ago when he was talking, you know, cause he has real Trump derangement syndrome and he was saying this thing about how if we, if the economy has to fail to get rid of this guy, that's what we need. And it's like, yeah, that's easy to say when you probably have a hundred million bucks and I'm not, I love Bill Maher and I hope he'll sit in this seat one day and I'll be there. And you know, yeah, but you were on a show not too long ago, but, but I don't want to be in a position where you root for the failure of the country because you want the failure of this one man. If he, if he failed, you know, Sam did a piece right after the election. As much as Sam hates Trump, he said, look, now he's the pilot of the plane, so if you want the plane to crash while you're on it, so that, that, that ain't great.

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       Right. So I would say there's probably nothing that they would really ever give him credit for. But I think at the same time what they create is most people in this country two years into a Trump presidency, if you remove the tweets and the Co, like if you remove, just like the generic sort of screaming thing all the time. Yeah. Well what actually is happening, the economy is still pretty good. Like we're not, does anyone think Trump's going to start in nation building? I actually think some of our alliances are stronger. Even everyone else says they're weaker. I think some of the trade stuff actually could start working our, in our advantage. I don't, I don't know exactly, but I don't think there's anything that they could really, you can't, I mean I think you probably mostly agree with that. I definitely agree with that.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       Okay. So I won't, I won't ask you this one cause I think that's a good question. Is from your a super chat. Yeah. So talk about the art and the studio. What's the new art? Oh, I'm glad that came up. So a, a spectacular artist, her name is right there. Uh, Kaitlyn rose, Janet, uh, painted this painting that's behind you. And then the painting that's behind me is sort of inspired from that. And one of the things that she did, she knows how much I love coffee. So you can see sort of the texture, the texture, right. Minor. That's actual coffee grinds that are in there. Um, I think her website is Kaitlyn rose, c a y l I n rows, janet.com. And she's done like, there's tons of artwork in my house that, that she's done. We have this huge millennium park claim. What coffee do you like? What's your call? Do you have a coffee? Well, I have a, I do French press and I grinded in the morning and the whole thing. Yeah. What, what do you do?

Speaker 2:          01:31:26       Yeah. I mean I haven't expressed it, but that's, that's really fair to guess. I don't find this press with that. I could see, I could see you drinking Keurig cause you will. Cause you're saying you wouldn't put the effort into that. I didn't drink coffee until like a month ago. Oh wait, you've been talking this fast for all these years without a goat cheese and I was getting no sleep one week and I had coffee in my show is marketing and I was like, okay, well then I guess I have to check myself to cocaine. This is possible. And I were, even though you won't make me a cake, I will brew you a cup of coffee. I appreciate it. Thank you man. That's all I'm asking from you. Also, leave me alone if I don't want

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       are two things. By the way, I equate quick note on that. I would also mention that like in Judaism, it's not just like gay marriage that's off limits. It's intermarriage. That's off limit. So if a member of my family were to intermarry like marry somebody who's not Jewish, I wouldn't go to the wedding. Realize it. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:32:14       This is like an issue. So even if that we, let's say it was your sister for example. Um, even though I know she just got married and I met the guy who does that, right. Nice guy. Um, even if that would do irreparable damage with your sister.

Speaker 3:          01:32:24       Well, you're the in, in, in know my view, the, the irreparable damage is being done by the fact that like if you're brought up in a certain, with a certain sense of values and rules and then you abandon those values and rules, then uh, you know, that's, that's an irreverent, it's so interesting, right?

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       I, I really intellectually, I really kind of understand that and I think that we are living in a society that's because of the loss of what clarity is where we, that's part of why the fraying is happening. But it's like when we went out to dinner that IDW night and we were at that steak house and we all had these, Joe got this like, you know, giant Tomahawk. That was for two people. He hated himself of course. And Jordan had like the biggest steak I've ever seen and uh, Eric and I split this porter house and it was so freaking delicious and you brought your dinner right cause you're kosher so you're obviously not gonna be there and you wouldn't even need on their plates and all that. And I respect you making that decision for yourself. I, I, I truly do. I truly do. And I have family members who are closer. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:33:19       As a religious person. Yeah. There is a, there is a constant conflict between your role as a religious person and what you may feel in your heart. Right. So the fact is that I want to keep by everywhere. Yeah. There are certain rules about like when I'm supposed to wear a Yamaka, like if I walk into a place and I'm not obviously carrying my own lunch. Yeah. It's actually a problem because people might think the restaurant is kosher for example now. And then they're going to eat there because they saw this famous orthodox Jews walking into a non kosher restaurant. So that's something that you have to take into account is that how much are you conveying that your religion approves of a particular activity when you actually engage in the particular activity and that that applies to a wide variety of them.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       It's so interesting to me though because when I came home that night, I swear you can ask David after I was like, I was sitting there and I, I can Ben Bright, I think he brought a burger. You're eating your burger and I'm, I know how delicious this steak is. And it's like, I really was like, why would Ben deny himself just this truly, truly smell delicious delicious thing book. But you do. And that it doesn't

Speaker 3:          01:34:18       because it's talking about holistic lifestyle in which you make choices about what you want to participate in and what you don't, but that doesn't change even necessarily how you feel about the people who are engaged in particular activities is just saying like, I as a religious person cannot stamp within premature like that. This is okay with me as a religious person. But that doesn't mean that I care about you any less. For example, or I would care about my sister any less. Right. If she did something that I didn't like

Speaker 2:          01:34:39       just in terms of importance. Uh, I'm going to move the stake away. I'm not going to force you to say I still, I think I'll be able to get you to smoke a joint at some point and I definitely am going to be able to get you say fuck on camera though.

Speaker 3:          01:34:51       I like your posts. Your so called the last one is actually not that far a leap. If, if I, I had a blue version of my

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       show we'd be on believable of my show would be on Real Shapiro. Perhaps some of the people we've been talking to have some ideas for some new shows and maybe there was something already in the world would be pretty wild. Yeah. Okay, so a couple of more here. Let's see. Um, okay, this is, this is a good one. Super Chat question. I'm sorry. I want to find all the best ones here for it. We're doing it live. Yeah, exactly. I'm trying to read these. Okay, so the ancient Greek proverb, if you go to work, you better finish it or you'll leave it to your grandchildren, which I don't think he's actually from the ancient Greek. You think we didn't finish the war of ideas against Marxism in the Cold War, and that is why we have a rise of Marxism on college campuses today. I'll let you feel their first.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       I think that my basic answer would be yes, we sort of let this stuff fester as if it was the cool stuff, but I don't know what the completion of a war of ideas is. Like you stamp things out to the point that no one can speak of them. That's not what we want. So, so it's almost an unanswerable question. I think Jonah Goldberg's answer on this is basically correct, which is that there's a human tendency to buck against freedom and that human tendency is why can't we control the world around us? Why can't we get together and solve all of our problems? Why is it that what free markets are counterintuitive? The idea, if you leave everybody alone, your life is going to be better, is really good for intuitive. Usually the idea is if I can control everybody around me, then my life will be better cause I can get them to do all the things I want them to do.

Speaker 1:          01:36:19       I don't want to control anybody, right? But I want my little piece of the Pie and I'm going to do good work here. But that's it. But that's it. That's a cultivated idea most as a child, right? Or like when I look at my children, my children want to control everything around them, right? Including me and what, and if you believe that if we all get together, we can build this giant edifice together. Why can't you just get on board? Just get onboard. Then Marxism has a certain kind of particular draw. Especially when you look at the fact that they're rich people that are poor people. When you say to people, well, right, they're going to be some rich people in some poor people, but overall we're getting richer. That is more counterintuitive than why can I just steal that guy's money? Put it in my pocket and I'm better off.

Speaker 1:          01:36:54       And so I don't think that Marxism can never be fully stamped out. That said, I think the conservative movement has failed markedly to make good arguments against Marxism and they've basically made arguments on the basis of efficacy rather than morality. They've said basically Marxism, it's moral idea, it just is bad and administration. And I think Marxism is deeply immoral idea. That's also terrible in administration. So do you think that's also why guys like like me and you get so much hate because someone like me, I'm, I was once something, I had a certain set of ideas I've shown you can escape and survive and now there clearly is a massive movement behind that. I mean I know it, I know it is real or the amount of young people that are waking up and are going this thing that they're going to sh jammed down your throat in college and in high school is not good. It is not real. It is not true. And there aren't many examples of people escaping. There was David Horowitz, you know, 30 years ago or whatever, but there's not very modern examples. So that's why for the, for the, it's not like I put out a lot of hate, but I seem to get a lot of online hate. And I think that's the reason that I think partly for you it's, it's similar to a different degree. You

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       get it because you're willing to talk to people like me and Sam and whoever else. So they're going the real hardcore people that hate all that stuff don't want you to do it, even though they love you, but they don't want you to do it because they think that might be okay.

Speaker 3:          01:38:09       A little awkward. Gelati exactly. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So somebody wants you to do a Trump impersonation for the memes. Very important.

Speaker 2:          01:38:14       Oh. Um, what is it

Speaker 1:          01:38:17       do I do? I'm so as lady dies paper, I don't even know what he does anymore. You're fired. I Dunno. It's like, no,

Speaker 3:          01:38:25       I got to work on that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. They, did you have any, do you do any good impersonations? You don't get good impression?

Speaker 2:          01:38:29       Uh, not I, you know what, I'll come back with some DC. I used to do a great Cosby impression, but then he became the greatest

Speaker 1:          01:38:36       Syria naked. Naked. Do you'll sleep wake of the Trump glut cake. Will the children okay. Close enough. Close enough. There's, there's only so much we can do here. Uh, it says we put [inaudible] him is going to go south so fast.

Speaker 3:          01:38:54       Hi Ben. In Dave, can you define what rights are? I think there's a disconnect between the left and the right on what rights are.

Speaker 2:          01:39:00       Well, I believe you are, you are born free. You have the right to end in this country. You have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And then the bill of rights lays out what your other rights are. The government has to protect those rights. It did not give you those rights. And I think that's the most important thing. The government did not give me my freedom. The government can take away my freedom, but he did not give it to me. So we have rights that are very clearly laid out. And again, this is why I don't want big government, big government in every way will trample on those rights. We've a beautiful system of rights, free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to privacy, all of those things. These are incredibly powerful things, but it's not because the right, the government gave those rights to us. It's protecting what I think. So I know this is where conservatives usually would say these are God given rights. I think you can just say they're there. They're huge innately human rights that you, you are as a human being. It is your birthright. You are born free. Can someone grab you right out of the uh, out of the womb and put you in jail? Yes. But you were born free. I think that's how I,

Speaker 3:          01:40:01       you said this, the basic Locky and argument for, for the philosophers in the room is that basically you are born with particular rights and these rights adhere to you by virtue of you not having to get something from someone else. So you have a right to speak free because that's not an imposition on anybody else. Right. And negative rate versus a positive rate as the typical language that is used. Conservatives believe in negative rights. People on the left believe in positive rights. This would be like the right to education where you can take to the sky that you have right to education. But unless you're actually forcing a teacher to teach, right, then there's no right, right. The same thing, right to housing, right to healthcare. The left is very big into the clarion.

Speaker 2:          01:40:33       Good. I believe you were right though.

Speaker 3:          01:40:35       Now we got him started on the impressions and it's not going to stop it. Yes, that's right. So the, so the idea there is that in a state of nature where no one else is around, you have these particular rights. You have the right to make it to, to gotten labor. You have the right to, to control your labor. You have the right to speak freely, have the right to free assembly to worship God how you want. You have the right to do all of these things because you're not imposing on anybody else in the minute that you're imposing on anybody else. It's no longer right. So the baking cake example is actually a good one. There are folks on the left who say you have a right to go into somebody's shop in demanded service from them. The answer is you don't have a right to go into somebody's shop and Amanda Service from them.

Speaker 3:          01:41:05       Maybe you'd prefer if they give you that service. Maybe it's smarter if they give you that service. Maybe it's more moral if they give you that service, but you don't have the right to go and demand service from anyone, from anyone else because rights are things that I am not demanding from you. Then flip side of that is duties, which is because you have a right to life. I have a, I have a duty not to kill you, but I would have that duty not to kill you regardless of whatever you call that. Right. Okay, so while you were gone, apparently there are a bunch of people who have been asking about whether you are indeed funded by then a ferry is evil, terrible Koch brothers. Oh Lord. So let's give you the opportunity to answer why you were in the pay of the shekel masters. Right. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:41:39       First off, well, if anyone wants to know if this thing is, I did it or not, I think, there you go. Okay. I'm glad you asked actually. Cause this is just endless dribble that is, you know, this is partly one of the things about just online nonsense. It's like you could spend all day defending yourself about untrue claims and the attacks that we get in personally attacks and a trike often [inaudible] Sam, when I had him on last time a couple months ago, he said for the two years that he was under endless assault, he almost views all his defense as wasted time because often, nope. The truth, the truth will set you free. It'll, it'll, um, it's the right thing, the truth. But often if you're, if you're debating against or your protagonists are attackers don't care about truth, then you're just feeding them by giving them anything. You're just feeding more insanity, which is why I haven't, I think I've, maybe I've even addressed this public.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       I'm not even sure. Okay. So here's the deal. And I'd been completely transparent about this the entire time. It's so stupid. So learn liberty, which is they produce one show of ours a month. They've given us incredible professors like Deirdre mccloskey and Randy Barnett and Steve Davies and Shawn Hopwood and people from all. And Fatty is Russell people from all over the political map. They produced one show a month. They give us a list of professors. I can pick any of them and if I don't like any of them I can pick anyone else. They've given us people all over the political map. They sponsored our episode with Phil to Franco, the youtuber. They had never even met him or had any interaction with him. They just liked him. So I said, learn liberty at the top. This episode is brought to you by learn liberty or our friends that you learn liberty or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:43:05       And then they donated, they were going to give him a little bit of money. He didn't even want it. They donated it to a, to a cause that he cares about. Um, so I think what has happened here is that learn liberty is a, uh, subsidiary or in partnership with Institute for Humane Studies, which I think is through George Mason University. And I believe that David Koch, one of the Koch Brothers is on the board there and must give some money to it. I know for a fact that the person who has funded our relationship, my relationship with learn liberty isn't anonymous woman. And I know that because they told me that she's anonymous and that it's a woman and I personally wrote her a thank you note. I want to be 100% spectacularly crystal clear. They have had no control over our content. I ask whatever questions I want. We never edit for content.

Speaker 2:          01:43:53       We did once in my hundreds of interviews. It was with a celebrity for a reason that is completely irrelevant and not important. They have never told me anything to say. They, there is nothing. There is literally nothing untoward here. And I've, and I've always, I always start the episode by saying we're funded or were, we're in partnership with learn liberty. So we're funded by learn liberty for that one episode. Anyway. This is just endless dribble. And I, it's almost like you can see I'm sort of, yeah, it's like I don't even want to talk about it cause it's like this is all bullshit. This is all distracting bullshit. And it's like that's all nonsense. And the amount that we get from them by the way pales in comparison to, to what we're trying to build on Patrion and everything else. So it's like, no, no one has ever told me to say anything.

Speaker 2:          01:44:36       No one has even ever asked me to say anything. I've never had contact with the cokes. No one has ever said anything. And by the way, I would love to interview the cokes. I would have literally no problem. The Cokes Fund, um, the, the Cokes Fund, uh, you know, Lincoln Center and I think they put money towards PBS and all sorts of actual, yeah. So like I don't have a problem with any of that. So just to be crystal clear for anyone listening to this or for any of these people that just relentlessly hate me or whatever, I am not funded by the Koch brothers. That's what you're saying is you're funded by the Koch brothers. [inaudible] there are millions, there are millions of people in this country who are, who donate to nonprofits. And it's like if you work with a nonprofit, you might be in vendor in coots and obviously control.

Speaker 2:          01:45:15       It's just, it's just so dumb. I hope we cleaned that up, but you know, I know it'll just give endless, here's, here's another super chat question. Yeah. Play prognosticator what our president Trump's chances of reelection in 2020 I would say basic short of some sort of impeachment thing. And I have to catch up on a little bit of the news that you enlightened me on. I would say basically pretty good if, if the left's decision to go down the road of identity politics and Social Democrats, Socialists, Democrats, whatever the hell they're called now. But the, the Bernie Keith Ellison Wing, which is an, which is basically an extremist wing of a party. Uh, then they're going to be in a lot of trouble if the, if is there any blue dog Democrat left, if that thing could come back, a sensible liberal, believe me, I could vote for someone who's probably a little more big government than I am.

Speaker 2:          01:46:00       I wish, and I talked about it for years. I want my, I used to say my guys, I wanted my side, the left the Democrats to wake up. There's no sign whatsoever that they're going to wake up. Uh, potentially. Look, if they get slammed in the midterms, then maybe they wake up, but you, you're predicting that they won't. I suspect it's not going to be that bad actually if you're a republican, because I don't think there's anyone who voted for Trump that suddenly looks at the left and thinks that they're better, but their numbers may just be depressed. They may just not show up. And that's always what happens in midterms. And it's never good for the incumbent presidents party and all that stuff. But I suspect generally what they're offering is, so it really is fringe. And the only reason we don't think it's fringe is because the mainstream media jams it down our throat every day.

Speaker 2:          01:46:44       And if we can get that message out to people, and I think you're a particularly effective at it, but we needed to also get to people that won't listen to Ben Shapiro, right. We need to get to people that'll listen to me or, or whoever else, people that listen to Joe Rogan or whatever, even though I know we all have a lot of crossover. Uh, if that message could get out there, this thing that's being sold to you as so obvious and good and the government can fix everything and Blah, blah, blah, if we can show them that is a fringe idea, here are some better ways to freedom, then I think, um, we're forget Trump for a second. I just think that that's a much better path for a health.

Speaker 3:          01:47:16       He says, I'm out in the political prognostication business and so lost $10,000 for the last election. By the way, I was

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       you the night of the election, which I've told many people, well actually I think we've talked about it publicly, but watching you that night, you know

Speaker 3:          01:47:29       who's that? It was entertaining.

Speaker 2:          01:47:29       It was like, it was like being with like eight different people try to burst out upon. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:47:34       it was very wild. So yeah. You know, I'm, I'm more skeptical at president Trump is headed in a good path just because his approval ratings are so low and there's only a referendum on him once every four years. So I think that, you know, 2018 is shaping up pretty ugly for Republicans. The turnout numbers don't look good or Democrats are over representing pretty much everywhere in the early elections. Do I think it's going to be like a 60 seat blowout? No, but I think that there's a good shot. Democrats went about 35 seats in the house. Again, I could be completely wrong here. Right. So is the scariest. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       Part of that though, that lets, okay, so let's say the Democrats take back the house.

Speaker 3:          01:48:04       It's just endless investigations. I think it's done for a couple of years. Also, here's the thing, president Trump is riding on excellent news for the past couple of years. He's at like 42% in the polls, usually 43% in the polls. He benefited number one from Gary Johnson and Jill Stein winning a combined, I think six, 7% of the vote in the last election cycle. But also he has benefited now from a great economy and no major foreign policy crisis. We're overdue for some sort of economic downturn and there's one every eight to 10 years in the country. It's been since 2008. Uh, so I'm a little, you know, God, God willing, we avoid it and it just continues to be strong because it'd be good for the country, but if they,

Speaker 2:          01:48:42       the, the idea that the president is so in charge of,

Speaker 3:          01:48:44       he's not, he's not in charge of nearly any of the economy. Yeah, it's, it's the, I think the president can put a serious damper on the economy, but I don't think that the president can be held responsible for the performance of a particular economy. Again, when people say Obama was great for the economy, it's like we'll sell. Was the Republican congress great for the economy because they were there since 2010 all of that said, you know, I, I think Democrats are going to turn out in droves in, in 2020 in a way they didn't in 2016 the real story of 2016 to May was, no one showed up to vote for Hillary Clinton. Like we're all focused on Trump because he's the center of the universe. Right? But the reality is that was a referendum on Hillary, not a referendum on Trump. Trump's approval rating for absolutely stable.

Speaker 3:          01:49:19       They were always between 40 and 44%. Hillary's bouncing around from 40 to 50 because people would say, oh, well maybe she'll be good, and then they'd look at her like, Oh God, isn't that awful? And they just wouldn't show up. Right. You won fewer votes in the state of what Donald Trump won fewer votes in the state of Wisconsin than Mitt Romney did. In 2012 Trump won the state of Wisconsin. Romney lost the state of Wisconsin because no one showed up to vote for Hillary Clinton. I think Democratic turnout in 2020 is going to be real high. Trump has to win somewhere between 12 and 14 million additional votes between 2016 and 2020 in order to win because George W had to win additional 10 million votes to win, and he only lost by 500,000 in the popular vote. So how can that, how can Republicans win? Democrats can be awful. Right? I mean, that's, that's what you're basically saying. Yeah. And so it's always a head to head match up. Yeah. If Democrats were on Kamala Harris, Trump will win. If Democrats were on Elizabeth Warren, I think Trump probably lens, uh, if they were on Kirsten Gillibrand who will definitely one, if they run Joe Biden, I think it's an uphill run for president Trump in the election. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:12       Bad is that you'd need to bring in this, I don't know how old,

Speaker 3:          01:50:15       7,270 I'll be 78. Oh God. He'll be 78. Trump will be 74 and the two of them will just club each other with their canes. Don't like the, uh, you know how many tennis balls we'll go through running on the bottom of those walkers. Yeah. Okay. Here's, here's one. As a practicing Jew and as an atheist, what are both of your thoughts on the swing towards sexual freedom and sexual freedom? Pre-Marriage? Has It negatively effected longterm relationships? Can I hit this one?

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       Yeah. Well first off I would say this is why if, okay. Practicing. So this is where I'm saying you're a practicing Jew is a little, it's hard to know what that means because I would say you're on the sort of more uh,

Speaker 3:          01:50:50       modern orthodox strict but strict side of that and that your rights, you're okay. Versus the version until I was married. Yes. Right. Okay. Okay. So you are all right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:58       Um, so I would say this, this is another reason where people should basically be for gay marriage, not from the libertarian perspective, although of course that's, I think the most honest perspective is that the government shouldn't be in your business. But also from a, if you think, you know, I think that when the Wright was really fearmongering for many years about gays and the Huckabee's and the evangelicals were always, you know, and George W. Bush because of Karl Rove, you know, used gay marriage as a wedge issue and there were saying, we'll look at the games. They're all having all these sex and they're doing all these drugs and about, well guess what? If you don't let people have the same ability to love someone that they love, if you don't let people enter the same exact legal protections as everybody else, then people are going to act out in all sorts of ways.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       Sexually, drugs, all sorts of things. I did all sorts of things. I never thought I was going to, I never really thought about marriage. I just didn't. I, I was closeted for a long time. I think I was all sorts of whacked out in in many ways. But if you take a certain subset of people and say to them, you can't have the things that other people have that will eventually maybe allow you to have a family or whatever else. And usually you can't have those, well then every, all your sex is going to be premarital. So if your answer is well, because I hear this, sometimes people will say, well gaze, she just be, you can be gay but just be celibate. You know that's one. I mean it's ridiculous and it's like you have to, this is why gays are conservatives. I think really it's the, it's happened already so it doesn't even really matter, but it's like you should be for gay marriage in a way that actually is for all the other things. You're four because you guys want a certain title, stability

Speaker 3:          01:52:36       and everything else for same sex marriage, same sex marriage is the one that you just made it even better than the, the equal rights argument cause equal rights argument. You could easily say, well, the role of marriage in between a man and woman and man, man is a little bit different just because of natural child bearing and rearing that hers the way why you guys didn't make this argument before, right? Like you weren't pounding the libertarian argument for gay marriage eight years ago. I started hitting it in about 2012 2013 so that was probably a little bit before most conservatives came around. But generally libertarians, even worse, I guess liberal real libertarian idea was basically I want the government out of everything. The government sucks at everything. But as far as the, the argument in favor of same sex marriage, if the argument is in favor of stable, you know, two person relationships as opposed to wow, promiscuity in every circumstance that is going to be superior.

Speaker 3:          01:53:25       But imagine, imagine telling the subset of people, I mean, imagine if the world was worse. Gays were the majority and straights with the room. And I said to you, you Ben, you cannot marry a woman. Well now you're going to do all sorts of things. Like it just is. I hear, I hear the argument. It's interesting cause I think we actually have a slight disagreement here. If somebody were to say that to me and my argument would be, well I don't understand why I societal institutions would make the decision for me as to whether I should live with one person or not. Well if anybody's eye meaning that like even if societies, like as as a person who is a libertarian on the government issue of marriage, my vision is, well I go to my synagogue and that provides me the Avo legitimacy. I feel like I need with my spouse, which is why I say like if gay people want to get married in their church, go for it.

Speaker 3:          01:54:05       Like a toy. But it's, but it's, you know, I, I think it's hard to make the case that promiscuity is deeply connected with lack of same sex marriage. I think that promiscuity is, is connected with personal decision making just because what you see is that there's a riot, wild raise, rising promiscuity in the straight committee. Forget the gay community. There's wild rise in rates of promise Hillary on swiping right. And that far, I guess you swipe left if you want it. No idea, dude. It's a sweater and the, I know it's all about a swipe. But if you look at the rates of single motherhood, for example, those who have been on the rise since the 1960s. And that's in a situation where straight people are allowed to get married and they have been allowed to get married to historically. So the, so correlating the institution of marriage with, with promiscuity, I think is a difficult argument to make just statistically speaking.

Speaker 3:          01:54:51       But if the argument is that that institutionalizing marriage will make people less promiscuous, then I think that's actually a, that's the best argument for same sex marriage. I think that's out there. If I were going to steal man the same sex marriage argument, that'd be the argument that you need more stable relationships. You need less instability. You need people who feel that that's actually a positive societal good to live with one person as opposed to living with a hundred other people. You know, that's, that's, uh, you know, that, that I think is the strongest argument. So are you saying you're four and forced monogamy? Oh Man, man, that, that whole thing is so stupid. It's so stupid. But, but it is, it is true that a society that every social science study ever done has shown that when people live together a long time before marriage, they tend to get divorced at higher rates than they would if they weren't, if they just gotten married, basically.

Speaker 3:          01:55:34       And the reason for that is I think that if you, if you look at the, at the research on passion and, and sort of committed love, they move in opposite directions over the course of a relationship. So when you first meet somebody, your passion level is incredibly high and your level of committed love, meaning, you know, I know this person really well, I can count on this person is really low. And then about six months in passionate logos goes like that are committed love goes like that, which is why if you've married 10 years like I have, then, you know, I'm, I'm really passionate about my wife. But to pretend that it's the same level of like sexual attention. Yeah. It's somebody that I'm dating as 10 years later with two kids. Of course, that's not true. That doesn't mean I have bad sex, like I have a wonderful sex life, but it's a different thing than it was at the very beginning.

Speaker 3:          01:56:14       Well, if you correlate in your mind that what's great about a relationship as a passion level and that, and then you lived together with somebody for six months and then you get married and then your passion level decreases, you mistake the, the correlation for the causation, say, oh, it's marriage. They caused the passion level to decline. Not the fact that I've been living with someone for awhile. Also, the fact is that the reason people aren't getting married in general and in society where you're allowed to get married, gay or straight, I is because you don't want to rate. That means that you're already got an eye on the door in many cases. And that's not a real flattering idea for a lot of folks. So, you know, pre, I think promiscuity is, first of all, I think that one of the worst lies perpetrated against women is the women in mentoree sex in exactly the same way, which is absurd.

Speaker 3:          01:56:52       The idea that promiscuity is good for women in the same way that it is, quote unquote good for men is fully insane. I don't think it's good for either from a moral perspective, from a spiritual perspective, from a health perspective, but I think that the amount of damage that is done spiritually to women, uh, who are, who are promiscuous on average, not for every individual. It's a free country, do what you want, but the, on average, the amount of psychological damage that is done to 16 year old girls who are promiscuous is not nearly the same amount of damage that it's wildly disproportionate to two men who are having,

Speaker 1:          01:57:21       right guys. Good. [inaudible] highly correlative. The guy in high school who's like banging a lot of the cheerleaders doesn't, it doesn't stick with him in a sort of psychological I, the suicide rates are not the same. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:57:32       Among, among young men who are promiscuous is not even close to the suicide rate among young, I mean leads to actual correlation between earlier sex for young women particularly, uh, and, and suicide rates. And that's because women and men, and we all used to know this, but women and men treat sex differently because women and men are not the same. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:57:47       yeah. We should do a bit, well, I want to do some big IDW panels in general and maybe do some stuff live and I think we're discussing all sorts of stuff and all that, but this would be a really rich topic for sure because it does raise questions as to like, what should we promote as a society? You know, forget about government regulation and what, what's your merchants? What are the basic, what are the basic social institutions that are necessary? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:58:06       And is it possible that we totally left up relations between the sexes and the future of longterm relationships and marriage by separating sex from marriage in a really significant way, which, which began really before even the 60s. I mean there's a, there's a decline in marriage that it started before even the advent of the sexual revolution per se. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:25       Let's see, maybe a couple of more. Yeah. Uh, okay. So, um, you're a good man. I know you have a real job and everything. Oh yeah. Yeah. And I have to go write a bunch of crap after this. So, um, let's see it and then another, another one we'll do, let's do the last one here. So, okay. Um, hm. Does a political scale with statism on the left and anarchy on the ride this from Patrion? What? Constitutional law constitutionalism wise, a bit right of center make more sense than the traditional left, right scale we use. Where does liberty lie on the traditional left, right scale?

Speaker 2:          01:58:54       Um, I feel like we could do something a little more exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:58:57       Okay. What's her letters? But I mean, why don't we both do that one in 30 seconds? It's something like a little more excitable. The 32nd answer is that statism on the left, the anarchy on the right is basically the American political scale. The, the European political scale is nationalism versus international. Right. And so, and we're shifting towards that. We are shifting toward that and it's dangerous. Like I think that the political skeleton statism is on the left and anarchy is on the right. Uh, I think that that's, that is a better scale. I think it's a more accurate scale. Yeah. I don't mean to dismiss the question. I'll do more than y'all do something on this question on Patrion itself, but, but for our big finish here, I feel like, yeah, I already come out of Benjamin. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Them. Would you agree? Would you agree with the idea that classically speaking, the left and the right have a fundamental disagreement on human nature? I Emam being inherently good or evil. Keep up the great work. Yeah, we're okay. Let's recommendation questions.

Speaker 2:          01:59:43       Do human nature. The first, let me just tell you what I believe. I believe people are basically good. I believe you are. You are born. I think I pretty much buy into Pinker's blank slate. But I think you're basically born good. There's something innately human that you want to do good. Doesn't mean we do good all the time. We all do all sorts of things. We lie and we cheat and we do this and that. And, and you have moments in your life where we can all look back and go, Whoa, you know, those couple of years I was really doing some, some self destructive shed or, or some whatever it is. Um, but I think there is something uniquely human about wanting to do good. It's how it's, how human flourishing has existed. It's not just because of the stuff that we can empirically test and all that.

Speaker 2:          02:00:30       There was something else about being human, that little spark that you see in a baby's eye when they know something's funny and they can't even speak. Like there is something else that is, that is there, that is human, that is good. And I think it's sort of your job to try to enhance that as much as possible. At least I see that as my job and I'm trying and I, I will fail often and I'll continue to fail. Um, but I'm really trying to be the best person that I can be while I am here. And I think that comes from something that's way before me that comes from something that I can't prove with tools here and measurements. Like it's just something that is, I think that's probably a little bit of what your answer is, but maybe,

Speaker 1:          02:01:14       yeah. I mean, I do too. To a lot of folks on the left. The idea that human beings are inherently good means that if we just unshackle you from the bounds of society is through the Russo idea that this was, that your innate goodness will spring forth and everything will be great. Or from the Martin idea, if you just change the economic system, then we will all be inherently better and we'll see each other as brothers as opposed to enemies. So I am of the kind of founding fathers idea, which is basically a biblical idea, which is that people are not angels and not devils. Where human beings,

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       they have capacity for good. We have capacity for evil. Uh, while I love my two and a half year old son, he's a nutcase and a, and working in adult, he would be the worst person in the world. He is, he, you know, he wants what he wants and he wants it when he wants it and he doesn't care about hitting people and you don't think he's innately good or innately evil. You think he just is as a human and it's sort of your job as a parent. This is what society's job civilization and inculcating virtue. That's your job as an adult. And I think that the danger and the belief that people are inherently good is the idea if you just free them, everything is okay. Well freedom from political institutions is one thing, but freeing them from social fabric and social institutions as a whole nother thing.

Speaker 3:          02:02:15       So this is where I would say, this is why I still consider myself a classical liberal and not a libertarian because I do think there is some role for government and it's to protect those things. And for me it's not even about the role of government. I think are libertarians really go wrong is the suggestion that social institutions are the cause of all the world's evils. That what we really need is get rid of all knocked down, all the churches knocked down all of the, the places that are inculcating virtue and [inaudible] will dictate. Right. Of course. But, but you know, somebody asked here about debating arm broke. I've invited yard on my program for specifically this cause I ran. Oh, are you guys doing it? I know, I know he wants to do, I mean I love to have him on that. I'm happy to do it here.

Speaker 3:          02:02:53       I know. Yeah. I mean I think that we disagree on less then. I think that there's some semantic games being played about, about objectivism and what exactly is self interest in all this other stuff. Let's do, no, I'm happy to. I'm happy to do that. But it's uh, but with that said, I think that recognizing the human beings are capable of evil is a deeply important thing to recognizing that you have to as an adult cultivate your children in a way that they are going to be good. So is that, is that different though than what I said? Because I believe we are born good but it doesn't mean that evil evil he or or that evil can generate through a lot of people. I, yeah, I mean I, I'm very reticent to use the language we're born good cause I don't think that babies are born with an innate, I think I've born with a basic, basic, innate moral sense, but it's really basic and non cultivated.

Speaker 3:          02:03:38       And I think that if you had a baby's mortality, if the, if the world were run by babies, we'd all be dead. And not just because they're not giving you should also because they're, they're not moral, they're not moral creatures. They want what they want when they want it. I think that that's something that has to be cultivated by, by society and reason is something that must be cultivated over time. And that's why it's a constant attempt by anyone who's good to try and say, okay, what is impacting my reason here is a passion that's impacting my reason. Is it bias that's impacting my reason? What is it that's, that's making me unreasonable about this thing and more reasonable, we are hopefully the better we are as human beings because we've actually fully considered the ramifications of the, of the policies that we're pursuing and the actions that we're taking in our daily lives.

Speaker 3:          02:04:18       So I'm, I'm very into the risks of the, what we call an in Judaism, the gates of her Ravi, you know, I mean, you know this, right? There's the HR, I told him there's the [inaudible], there's kind of the good inclination in the bat inclination and the idea in Judaism is they're constantly at war with one another. Uh, and it's your job to try and strengthen the eights or hot tub so that it overcomes the HR. I think that's the struggle of mankind. And it's a, it's a Christian notion as well. I mean, the idea of the, the fall, you know, in sin is now embedded in you. Uh, and even after, after Jesus is coming about, you still have to struggle with that. Obviously used to struggle with the, the Satan behind you basically. Um, but I think that recognizing the capacity for evil is, is perhaps the first step in becoming good. And so this is why I'm extraordinarily reticent to say man is naturally good. I think man is naturally, uh, neither. I think man is naturally driven towards self interest and asking us and tribalism and evil and man is naturally driven to, to fight that sort of stuff in, in a variety of ways. But it requires an act of will in order to overcome all of those other inclinations.

Speaker 2:          02:05:20       Yeah. And I can, I can get on board all of that. And I stilled, my fundamental belief is that people are good, but you still, you do have to cultivate it.

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       I think so. I think people in Western society are good and I think that's, that's an outgrowth of, of several thousand years of history. I think that if, if we dropped you a lot of roommates, I think if we dropped in the middle of Afghanistan, you'd be pretty often,

Speaker 2:          02:05:36       I'd be probably very different than I am right now. Uh, as Peterson always says on this topic, the devil's in the details. So, uh, well I gotta tell you, man, first off, thank you for doing this. I know you're busy as hell and I'm, and you know, you were the right guy to, to sit down again. As I say, I'm always happy to wreck your day. So, um, you know, this, it's, I'm glad that we also ended on this note because this, that conversation that we just had I think is what I think really matters. And I think that's why people are showing, you know, thousands of people are showing up to your live event. Thousands of people are showing up to these events that I'm doing with Peterson. And by the way were were, I'll do a live stream later, but we, we just extended the tour into 2019 people don't want this endless bloodshed, this mutually assured destruction. And uh, I'll keep trying to,

Speaker 3:          02:06:22       and what is obvious is that headline of the day is less important than the big ideas. And so trying to escape headline of the day is sounds like it was a good idea for you.

Speaker 2:          02:06:29       Yeah. All right, well thank you. Shapiro. I'm going to go here for one second. That's my camera right in my studio over here. All right, so here's what we're going to do. I will do a, we launched a whole bunch of stuff today, so I finally got Dave rubin.com after 10 or 15 years of trying to even all new website, we want you to all new Patrion, uh, this morning that I want to do a live stream and talk to you guys about, because I really want to start doing some, uh, some new community building. As you can see, we have a new set, we have new graphics, we have new music. I'm sure you're all commenting on all of those things. Uh, so I'll do a live stream probably in about an hour or two a. So we'll post that. And, uh, again, thanks to a Shapiro over here and we'll set up that thing with Brooke and a, what else can I pump anything else out for you? And go check on my podcast. Ben Shapiro show. Have you heard of the Ben Shapiro show? All right. Thanks for watching everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:07:14       That was great.
