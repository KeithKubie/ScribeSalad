00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.810
In the MainActivity, 
we tell the forecast fragment

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.900
to use a special today layout
if it's one pane mode.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.643
In the fragment, 
we pass on this value

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:09.926
to the forecast adapter,
if it's not null.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:13.020
The reason it could be null,
is because the activity onCreate method

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.059
will happen before the fragment
onCreateView method.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.000
And this is where 
the forecast adapter is initialized.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.100
So we set the Boolean here as well.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.820
The reason we have this code here
is because it's a public method.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.590
So, in the future it could be called
before or after this method.
