00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.580
And if you're one of the first hundred today, you'll get three meals on your first blue apron order for free. Hey

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.649
What's up guys and welcome back to another random?

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.549
Experiment with thermite now to give you a little context in this video a couple weeks ago

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.880
Jimmy Fallon's team reached out asking if I can come up with some new summer life hacks

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.159
Now being a Youtube mad scientist the first thing that came to my mind was seeing if we could light off a grill with thermite

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.000
And actually cook hot dogs and hamburgers

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.270
Now unfortunately lighting off the thermite in the studio is one thing that Jimmy Fallon is not allowed to do so for this video

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.629
I thought let's put it to the test anyway and see if barbecuing hot dogs and hamburgers

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.069
Or thermite is a viable option after all here's the basic idea behind our experiment today

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.770
We have two metallic powders iron to oxide and aluminum powder these are very very fine powders

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.899
And when we mix them together in the right ratios we create a batch of homemade thermite the burning of thermite is an extremely?

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.119
exothermic reaction releasing temperatures upwards of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.359
5,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.659
So we'll start the reaction by putting the mixture in a terracotta planter pot setting it on top of the grill and letting the Molten

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.309
Iron flow down into a Terracotta base plate down below when the bottom plates are full of Molten thermite

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.249
We're going to remove the Terra cotta pot stick on some hot dogs hamburgers and using the residual heat of that metal we're going to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.250
See if we can actually get them to grill

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.239
All right, our bachelor might is mixed up for ready to go?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.320
So we're just going to transfer it into this terracotta planter pot sit on top of the grill and let it off

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.839
So we got a blowtorch a sparkler for our time delay. Let's go ahead and light it up

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.509
fastest way to let your barbecue ever

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.119
There you go

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.850
All right, here goes let's see if it works

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.320
Come check this out. This is amazing. So we got the terracotta pot on here which I'm going to promptly remove

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.269
Looks like a little bit of our grill kind of gotten bolt in there and look at that bottom plate

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.729
You can see how all the thermite stripped down to the bottom and now we've got a plate of glowing Lava as it were

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.289
Just sitting down there at the edge. I can't actually pull this grill off. Oh yeah there goes

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.829
Look at that. That is unreal

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.279
Now right now. I think this is way too hot to put our meat on

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.820
I think this is actually burn the meat. So we're just gonna let it cool down for a few seconds

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.139
Did you see the way that that lid off and all that Molten metal flowed down to the bottom?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.660
That's the reason I had this little terracotta base and even that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.320
It's cracked into a bunch of pieces

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.189
But it has managed to keep everything one place and not burn to the bottom of our width you look at the planter pot on

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.320
The other hand this thing is so hot right now

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.739
It's actually scorching the sand that I was setting it on it's broken into pieces and there's all kinds of vitrification

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.199
Happening on the inside the other thing I noticed is we actually burn the little hole through one of our grill racks here

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600
But that's cool. I'm just going to go ahead and replace that now

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
Stick that on top

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.489
Yeah, look at that you see how that melted right through that's where the thermite was dropping, and it just melted that clean off that

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.128
Was a superhot reaction that was fantastic

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.759
And it's actually going to need a few minutes to cool down before we can put our meat on here

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.349
So while it's doing that take 10 seconds right now to drop down to the description and click the link for Blue apron?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.869
You might remember blue apron from some of my previous videos?

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870
I've worked with them before and their food is

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.980
Fantastic and definitely approve here's how it works a box shows up at your house with all the farm-fresh ingredients

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:41.920
you need in

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.049
Exactly the right proportion can make delicious chef's design recipes at home the box is refrigerated so the ingredients stay fresh even if you're not

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.119
a home when the package arrives and they deliver almost

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.239
Anywhere in the USa there are two different types of plans one that feeds two people and another that feeds four and because the recipes

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.039
you make our chef's design if you follow the directions your meals are to be great a lot of times when I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.769
Go first for shopping always buy a lot more than I need and trying to spending more to spend in the stores

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.459
So this save that money

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.089
blue Apron adds new dishes to their menu every week and each one can be put together in around 40 minutes or less and if

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.019
You use me as an example

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.578
I don't really know how to cook and I've never looked at this recipe before it only took me 45 minutes start to finish

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.209
I was so shocked that my husband was in the kitchen cooking. That's the first time I've seen it is very

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.139
Different Mary Ten Years

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.908
You can skip or council your service any time you feel like and shipping is always free

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.579
So take ten seconds right now to drop down to the description click the link for blue apron and get something delicious and nutritious

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.380
On its way to you this week all right back to the barbecue. Let's take a look at the slow-mo replay

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.389
So it looks like I caught the slow mode just as the reaction was really starting to take off and you can see it's glowing

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.750
as bright as the sun

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.679
Which makes it very hard to see what's happening here now the iron oxide is reacting with the aluminum to produce a lot of heat

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.580
It's putting off a lot of light energy

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.720
the way you can't see happening inside is all that Molten metal inside the pot is flowing down to the bottom hole cutting through the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.779
Grate and landing in that terracotta dish underneath. I have to say that's probably the most dramatic way I've ever started to barbecue

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.419
That looks absolutely fantastic

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.289
What I can't get over is how bright that reaction is it's so incredibly bright that you can't see anything else is taking place

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.230
For the light that's coming off of that kind of looks like peering into a volcano nothing, but glowing Molten is fantastic

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.659
And probably the coolest way to cook food on set that looks amazing if I were to do that again

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.739
I might use a second terracotta dish underneath, but it looks like it contained all that at the bottom

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.499
Great all right go ahead and put on some hot dogs

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180
Listen to that sizzle

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.440
So we have eight hot dogs on here

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.610
We've got three hamburger patties

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.610
And it's already starting to smell amazing

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.330
So I'm going to go ahead and put the lid back on let's wait about 10 to 15 minutes and see if there might in

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
Fact is able to cook our food

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.520
All right, it's been 20 minutes. Let's see we got oh

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.910
My goodness that looks gorgeous

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.490
absolutely

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.610
looks really good it smells delicious do

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.450
These and give him a little flip those are juicy, huh? Oh

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.270
That was good

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.340
There we go very nice very nice the little cheese on that. We go make your cheese burgers beautiful

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.470
today's couple men

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.859
Who would ready that looks so good?

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.450
oh

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.289
nice and juicy smells delicious

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.190
mmm

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.609
That is really good these things are absolutely ready fantastic

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.630
Here we are guys. We've got our hot dogs are hamburgers and everything is looking and smelling amazing

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.190
I can't believe we actually pulled this off. We started by mixing iron to oxide

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.899
Which is basically rust with aluminum powder and lighting off inside of a Terra cotta plant suspended over a barbecue

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.800
We use the residual heat from that

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.310
Exothermic reaction to go clock dogs and hamburgers to perfection and now it's time to eat them. We've got our hamburger

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.720
We've got melted cheese onion pickle tomato lettuce and all tops with a sesame seed bun

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.129
Let's eat as much as I want to try this myself ladies first

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.809
I'm going to go let my wife have the first bite here you go baby. What do you think? Oh it looks good?

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.850
I'm always up for a good meal

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.280
You have to give us your honest opinion

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.250
Take nutrition. Let's take a look inside there

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.690
Let's show them the inside of the hamburger there you see it actually did cook it cook all the way through

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.390
What you weren't sure it wasn't question you let me bite it I?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.010
Was pretty confident?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.019
Lee go take a look at this you see you got the meat in there. It's fully cooked if we break that open

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.788
Yeah, you can see it's cooked all the way through nice and juicy

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.449
absolutely delicious bon appetit

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.800
mmm

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.409
That is one delicious and juicy hamburger that's definitely one way to put a little iron in your diet

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.800
So there you have a guy's no more waiting for charcoal to get ready

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.859
We have just used iron and aluminum powder to make the world's

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.569
Fastest starting barbecue ready for cooking with in about a minute and a half hurray for science
