00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.820
Science has uncovered the origins of a lot
of things over the centuries, but one question

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:13.760
that’s still on everyone’s mind: how did
homosexuality evolve?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.880
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and over the
past 2 years of doing this show, we’ve covered

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.540
a lot of scientific breakthroughs.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.150
Finding water on Mars, birth control for men,
the relative usefulness of bras… but now,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.940
science may have solved one of its greatest
mysteries yet: how did homosexuality evolve?

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.820
Well, according to new research published
in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.460
it may have evolved in order to promote social
bonding amongst humans.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.920
This is the first study of its kind to find
discrete evidence that our need to bond with

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.280
others, actually increases our openness to
engaging in homosexual behavior.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.490
For their study, a team of researchers from
the University of Portsmouth looked at the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.590
relationship between sexual attitudes and
the hormone progesterone.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.250
What they discovered, is that the more progesterone
there is in a heterosexual woman’s saliva,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.229
the more open she is to the idea of engaging
in homosexual behaviour.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.850
Likewise, heterosexual men who are subtly
reminded about the importance of having male

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.710
friends, reported feeling more open towards
engaging in homosexual behaviour - and that

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.200
was particularly true for men with higher
levels of progesterone.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.689
But what is it about this hormone that relates
to all of this?

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.609
Well, a bit of background - progesterone is
a steroid hormone, typically found in women’s

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.329
ovaries and men’s adrenal glands.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.579
In the same way that oxytocin is considered
to be the “love hormone,” progesterone

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.460
is basically the “friend” version of that.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.659
It’s one of the main hormones responsible
for caring and friendly behavior, which is

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.509
why your levels of progesterone tend to rise
when you’re having a close interaction with

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.509
a friend.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.060
Obviously, from an evolutionary standpoint,
it’s beneficial for humans to form social

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
bonds.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880
So from that perspective, more progesterone
is a good a thing.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.670
But then comes the topic of reproduction - which
for humans, is basically the logical endpoint

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.670
of sexual behavior.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.779
Or at least, we think it is.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:02.319
According to lead author Diana Fleischman,
sexual behavior hasn’t always been just

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.310
about reproducing - it’s also about forming
and maintaining social bonds.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.459
And there’s certainly evidence in other
species, demonstrating that recreational sex

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.590
isn’t limited to just humans.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.310
Great apes, for example, have historically
engaged in homosexual behavior as a way of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.050
forging new friendships.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.349
While we are on the topic of forging friendships,
I wanna veer off for a minute and let you

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.209
guys know that today will officially be my
last day on Dnews.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.099
For those of you who follow me on Twitter,
this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.569
- since I announced a few weeks ago that I
would be leaving Discovery at the end of November.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.569
But I just wanna say, for the record, what
an absolute pleasure it has been working on

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.850
this show - it has been such an amazing experience
getting to host what I consider to be one

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.150
of the best YouTube channels out there - no
bias.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.650
Not to mention, being able to work alongside
such an amazingly talented team, both on-screen

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.819
and behind the scenes, has been incredibly
inspiring.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.280
I especially wanna thank you guys, our viewers,
for welcoming me onto the show and into your

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
homes.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
I know it’s always hard to accept when awesome
hosts like Anthony leave, and someone else

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
weird and new replaces them - but you guys
have been so wonderful to me these past 8

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.680
months, and I will forever cherish my time
with Dnews.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.319
Of course, if you would like to keep up with
me outside of the show, I encourage you to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.290

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.200
As always, if you guys have any questions,
comments, fun memories, embarrassing moments

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.290
of me you’d like to reminisce about, please

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.010
Otherwise, thanks for watching!

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:39.370
I’ll miss you guys.
