00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.100
Hi, English mariner John Strong.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.460
Hi, Anthony Cary,
5th Viscount of Falkland.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.520
I would very much like for you to go to Chile and locate
the wreck of a Spanish treasure ship for me.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.420
Okay.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.800
(♪ cheerful music ♪)

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.680
Hey! I found some islands!

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.280
(♪ intro music ♪)

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.380
The English were probably not
the first to discover the Falklands,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.940
but they were the
first to write it down.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.520
They found it to be cold, wet and
miserable. "Just like home!"

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.060
So they established a colony in 1765,
unaware that the French had also

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.420
discovered the islands, and
done the same a year earlier.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.200
And, for a while, the two were unaware of
each others' existence, until, presumably,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.760
there was an awkward moment
where they ran into each other.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.160
Then the Spanish showed up, and told the
French that a couple of hundred years earlier,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.200
the Pope drew a line on a map and said,
"All of this belongs to Portugal,"

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.580
"and all of this belongs to Spain," and
that the island was in Spain's territory

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.440
and they would like the French
to hand over their settlement.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
Now, since the two were good friends, and
Spain was willing to pay in cash money,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.580
the French obliged, but since they were still a little
bitter about the recent Seven Years' war thing,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.120
they made sure to warn the Spanish not to let those dirty English on the other side of the island take over.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.860
So Spain went over to
the English and explained,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.840
"Pope, line on map, Spain's island".
And the English said,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.420
"Yeah right, this is our island." But the Spanish
had more guns and they kicked them off anyway.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.360
But then England threatened to go to war.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.180
So Spain went to their friends in France and said

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.680
"Hey,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.460
"It looks like stuff is about to go down

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.300
"You in on this?"

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.660
And the French minister of war said

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.160
"Yeah!"

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.860
"And we'll launch a full-scale invasion on England

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.240
"And party like it's 1066!"

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.100
But then King Louis XV said

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.700
1) You're insane

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020
And 2) You're fired

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.320
"Sorry Spain, but we're not ready for a war right now,"

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.460
So Spain had to give the English their settlement back, saying

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.620
"It's still our island,"

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.120
And the English said

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.320
"No, it's our island,"

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.040
Then some colonists in North America got a bit rowdy, so the English had to leave their settlement to go focus on that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.420
But they left behind a plaque that said

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.860
"This is totally still our island,"

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.100
So the island was in Spanish hands

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.240
But then a French guy

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.280
No, not that one

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.840
That one

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.780
Turned on the Spanish, took over most of the country, and captured King Ferdinand VII

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.880
And in response, the Spanish colonies in South America started vying for independence

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.260
So Spain had a little bit on its hands and also had to leave the islands.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.960
And for a couple decades the islands were left uninhabited, except for the penguins, some fishermen and the Gauchos

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.620
Which were basically, like, cowboys but cooler and Spanish-er

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.120
A merchant from Hamburg, living in the now-independent United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.320
Heard about the feral cattle roaming the Falklands, and thought it would be a good way to make some money

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.880
So he got permission from both Buenos Aires and the British Government to set up trade there as a 'private venture'.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.100
Some American ships came down and began hunting whales and seals around the islands, and Vernet wasn't too happy about it.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.380
So he asked Buenos Aires for some military assistance in defending the island

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.560
But Buenos Aires said "Meh, do it yourself,"

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.640
Gave him some weapons

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.180
And appointed him Governor of the island

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600
So he seized the US ships, and arrested their crews

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.440
In response, two things happened:

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.020
First, America came down and said

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.380
"Nice settlement you have there

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.160
"Would be a shame if someone destroyed it,"

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.160
And then they destroyed it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.440
Second, Britain heard Vernet had been appointed Governor

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.660
Meaning the United Provinces, actually now the Argentine Confederation

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.940
Were officially claiming the island as theirs

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.160
So Britain showed up and said

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.800
"Hey!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.840
"Didn't you see our plaque?"

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.020
And since they had more guns, they kicked them off the island.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.820
And the Falklands remained firmly in British hands for the next century

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.020
They officially became a crown colony in 1840

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.660
Port Stanley became the island's capital in 1845

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.840
The cattle hides from the island weren't worth much, so they imported sheep from Britain in 1851

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.720
Two world wars came and went, and all this time the Argentinians never rescinded their claim over the islands.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:24.000
Now it's 1976, and after a couple civil wars, a new brutal military dictatorship, sponsored by the US fight against communism, has taken control in Argentina.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.580
And by 1981, this guy (Leopoldo Galtieri) was in power

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.980
The economy had been struggling for a long time, and Galtieri had been unable to improve the situation

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.300
Now, if you ever find yourself the brutal military leader of a struggling South American country, and you start getting into hot water, here is a bit of advice that has been tried and tested throughout the centuries:

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.920
Start a war to distract everyone from their miseries!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.540
Galtieri knew how popular he would be if he could finally take back Argentina's Las Malvinas from the occupying British

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.360
There had been proposals to cut British military spending, and the ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance had been withdrawn from the area

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.220
So the Argentinians assumed that the British may not even bother doing anything about the invasion.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.380
After easily capturing the largely-uninhabited South Georgia Island

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.880
600 Argentine troops were sent to the Falklands

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.220
The small number of Royal Marines and other British Forces stationed there put up a small amount of resistance, but in the end had to surrender to the larger Argentine force

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.440
Crowds in Argentina celebrated the news, but they were wrong to assume the British would do nothing, because the person in charge of the United Kingdom at the time was this lady

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.900
Thatcher was a somewhat controversial prime minister, but whether you loved her or hated her, there was no denying she was tough

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.400
Like metal. Iron, for example

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.060
She immediately declared an exclusion zone around the islands and organised for a task force of over 100 ships to set sail for the Falklands.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.880
The United Nations expressed concern at the Argentine invasion

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.640
All south American nations, apart from Chile, backed Argentina

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.760
And since the United States had propped up the Argentine dictatorship, Reagan went to Thatcher and said

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.120
"Could you maybe just let them have the islands?"

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.340
And Thatcher said "No,"

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.580
"Okay here, have some weapons,"

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
Fighting a war over 8000 miles from home was a logistical challenge for the British

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.120
They requisitioned civilian cruise ships and containers

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.680
And they used British-owned Ascension Island as a forward base

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.980
By the time they arrived in the Falklands in May, the Argentine forces had had time to entrench themselves

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.920
The first task for the British was to gain control of the seas, which they did easily

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.620
On the 2nd May, a British submarine sank an Argentine cruiser

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.260
The sinking was controversial, as it occured outside the British Exclusion Zone

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.860
It was also the largest loss of life in a single incident during the war

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.000
And in response, the Argentine navy withdrew from the island

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.920
The next task for the British was to gain air superiority

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.000
While the Argentine Air force controlled the skies, they were able to inflict considerable damage on the Royal Navy below

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.500
Days after the sinking of the General Belgrano, two Argentine Super Étendards carried out a raid on the HMS Sheffield, and sank it with an Exocet missile

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.300
For weeks, the Argentine Air Force would continue to carry out raids and inflict heavy casualties on the Royal Navy

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.780
With British Sea Harriers doing their best to take out as many of the Argentine Aircraft as they could

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.660
While the battle in the skies raged on, San Carlos was chosen as the best landing site for the British ground forces

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.560
An SAS raid took out Argentine defences in Pebble Island

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.320
And the HMS Alacrity sailed through Falklands down to flush out any Argentine supply ships.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:02.340
The landings began on May 21st, with Argentine aircraft carrying out full-scale raids on the task force ships taking part in the landing, damaging several and sinking a few

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.320
But anti-aircraft cannons and sea Harriers shot down down many of the aircraft in what became a major turning point for air superiority

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.160
And a beach head was successfully formed.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.480
Then the ground troops began their movement out of San Carlos

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.420
Across the North towards Stanley and South toward to Argentine Stronghold at Goose Green

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.500
In the following battles, a clear trend emerged

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.040
The Argentine conscripts put up a good fight, and with the rough muddy terrain, the war was by no means easy for the British

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.560
But with highly skilled Royal Marine Commanders and Parachute Regiment troops, the British would often find themselves taking on larger numbers of Argentinian soldiers

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.120
But would still come out victorious with minimal casualties.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.660
The 14 hour long Battle for Goose Green commenced on the night of May 28th

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.780
The battle ended with a decisive British victory, with over 900 Argentinians surrendering

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.760
Then, with 5000 reinforcements arriving from the 5th infantry brigade, the British started preparing for their final assault on Stanley.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.760
In a series of hard-fought battles, they took control of the hills and mountains surrounding the towns,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.780
as the Argentine forces withdrew, with British ships shelling their positions from offshore

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.900
Utterly surrounded, on the 14th of June, the Argentinians surrendered.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.460
And the war was over.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.620
The two-month-long war claimed hundreds of lives

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.120
And left the islands strewn with minefields that still pose a problem to this day

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.900
Argentina still claims the islands,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.260
But in 2013 a referendum was held, and the islanders voted 99.8% in favor of remaining British

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.700
Plus, oil was just found near the islands, so the British probably aren't going to give them up anytime soon

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.660
*cha-ching!*
