00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.140
In the case of a fully virtualized

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.540
hypoviser, the guest operating system has no knowledge

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.870
of machine pages. It thinks that it's physical

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.980
memory is contiguous because it is thinking that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.314
it is running on bare metal, nothing has

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:19.630
been changed in the operating system to run

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.190
on top of a hypervisor in a fully

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.430
virtualized setting. And therefore, it is the responsibility

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.500
of the hypervisor to maintain the PPN to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.560
MPN mapping. In a para virtualized setting, on

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.750
the other hand, the guest operating system knows

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.220
that it is not running on bare metal.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.480
It knows that there's a hypervisor in between

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.950
it, and the real hardware. And it knows,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
therefore, that its physical memory is going to be

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.020
fragmented in the machine memory. So the mapping PPN

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.220
to MPN can be kept in either the guest OS or the Hypervisor. But, usually,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.040
it is kept in the guest operating system. We'll talk more about that later on.
