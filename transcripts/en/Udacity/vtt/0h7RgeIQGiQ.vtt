00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.000
Free as in beer refers to money.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.110
If someone buys you a beer,
it costs you nothing.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.350
Many versions of Linux are,
in fact, free for you to use.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.060
But just because you get to use it for
free, doesn't mean you get to see

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.890
the underlying source code or
modify it for your own purposes.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.190
Free as in speech refers to your
rights or liberties with the software.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.270
You're free to run the software how
you like, see how the software works,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.690
redistribute the software, and
improve upon or modify the software.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.509
This latter definition, free as in
speech, is how Linux became so popular.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.490
There are literally hundreds of versions
or distributions of Linux available.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.710
And it's because of this
latter definition of freedom,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.750
that this became possible.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.310
So with all these different
versions of Linux available,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.290
how do you pick the right one?
