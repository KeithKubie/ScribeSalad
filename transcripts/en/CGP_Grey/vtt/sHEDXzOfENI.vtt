00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.750
The United States, picks its president with
the Electoral College, 538 votes distributed

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.280
by population (mostly) to the 50 States and
DC.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.490
To become president you need to win a majority
of those votes.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.350
But, 538 is an even number, so what happens
when the race for president is tied?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.700
Don't worry, there's an 18th century solution
to the problem: if the Electoral College is

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.710
tied, the House of Representatives breaks
that tie.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.920
As the name implies, the House is filled with
representatives from each of the states.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.390
The more people in a state, the more Representatives
it has and their are 435 in total -- thankfully

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.440
an odd number and guaranteed tie breaker...
except there's a catch: each representative

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.739
doesn't get one vote, it's each *State* that
gets one vote.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.870
So, Florida's 27 representatives have to decided
amongst themselves who to support before casting

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.640
Florida's one vote to help break the tie.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
Meanwhile, thinly-populated Alaska's sole
representative, has only to consult himself

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.489
before casting Alaska's vote.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.110
This is an incredibly disproportionate system
because just ten states, California, Texas,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.360
New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.030
contain more than half the population of the
United States but get only 20% of the votes

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.470
if the race for president is tied and the
other 40 states with less than half the population

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.290
get 80% of the votes.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.290
While an exact tie is unlikely, this system
is also used if they're more than two candidates

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.080
for president and none of them gets a majority
in the Electoral College.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.939
Which is exactly what happened when four candidates
ran for president in 1824.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.960
Andrew Jackson got the most votes from Americans
and the most votes in the Electoral College,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.250
but not a majority, so the race was turned
over to the House of Representatives voting

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.310
as states who picked John Quiny Adams instead.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.590
In a modern America with more states a three-way
race can have horrifically disproportionate

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.149
results: consider a third-party candidate
who the loves the small states and who the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850
small states love in return.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.060
He gets the fewest Electoral College votes,
but enough to ensure that neither of the two

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.229
more popular candidates get a majority so
now the House decides the winner -- and those

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.140
26 smallest states representing just 17% of
the population can pick their man as president

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.869
even though 83% of Americans didn't vote for
him.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.250
It's unlikely, but it really shouldn't even
be possible.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
Anyway, all this talk of presidents has left
the Vice President unmentioned: a reasonable

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.650
person might assume, just comes along with
the President, but no.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.440
When there's a tie the *Senate* independently
picks the Vice President so the United States,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.739
could end up with a President from one party
and with a Vice President from the another,

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.569
which might make for some very uncomfortable
meetings.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.590
But even this crazy system for resolving a
tie isn't guaranteed to work because are 100

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.150
members of the senate and in the House of
Representatives they're forced to vote as

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.060
50 states and many of those states have10
or 8 representatives making the whole system

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.290
tie-tackular with all of those even numbers.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.660
So if the House can't pick the president but
the Senate has picked the Vice President then

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.910
the Vice President becomes acting president
until the House can make up its mind.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.550
But if neither the House can pick the president
nor the Senate can decide the Vice President

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.230
then the speaker of the House becomes president
until either branch of congress picks *someone*.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.951
So this systems is how the United States would
resolve a tied race for president, though

00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:25.750
it might be faster (and more fair) to just
flip a coin.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.459
Of course you could just get rid of the electoral
college, and thus this whole crazy system,

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.180
and instead have a national vote, perhaps
even with something fancy like preferential

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.980
voting, maybe that's just a crazy idea.
