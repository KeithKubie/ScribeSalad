LESLIE RITTER; During ischemic
stroke when a blood vessel is

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.830
blocked, the tissue
downstream of the blockage

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.610
actually is affected,
causing injury and death

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.635
to just a portion of the brain.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.530
NARRATOR: Leslie Ritter,
Professor at the Arizona Health

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.830
Sciences Center and Coordinator
for the Stroke Center

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.670
At University Medical Center,
wants to find better outcomes

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.500
for stroke patients.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.340
She may have an answer in the
spice we know as turmeric.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.810
 A stroke is the result of
reduced or absence of blood

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.370
to a portion of the brain.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.770
The majority of strokes are
called ischemic strokes,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060
and that happens when a blood
vessel is blocked or plugged.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.330
The treatment of choice
is to open the vessel

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.130
with either a drug,
a clot-busting drug,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.170
or some mechanical intervention.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.990
NARRATOR: When a vessel
is opened after a stroke,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.650
blood sweeps back into the brain
bringing with it white blood

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.090
cells, or leukocytes, that
adhere to the vessel walls.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
This results in acute
inflammation or collateral

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.410
damage to the vessels
and brain tissue.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.690
 So we look in our
laboratory for ways

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.010
to reduce this inflammation so
that when we do give blood back

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.720
to the brain, it's really
as good as it can be.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.970
This is a blood
vessel in the brain.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.900
When blood is returned to
the brain after a stroke,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.320
the white dots are the white
blood cells, or leukocytes,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.490
the inflammatory cells,
and after a stroke,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.420
the inflammatory cells adhere
to a significant degree,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.920
as opposed to normally.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.160
When they adhere, they
have the potential

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.710
to cause damage in
the brain vessels

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.570
and to the surrounding
brain tissue.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.640
NARRATOR: There are
no drugs to protect

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.130
the brain from this
increased inflammation.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.770
With research funding
from the state of Arizona,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.760
Dr. Ritter and UA College of
Medicine endocrinologist Janet

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.960
Funk have teamed up to see
if a botanical turmeric will

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.090
target the white blood cells.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.910
JANET FUNK: Turmeric is a
spice traditionally used

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.560
a lot in Indian cooking.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
But it's also used traditionally
in Indian medical systems.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.220
And it's used specifically
for inflammatory things.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.240
In our arthritis
research, we found out

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.790
that turmeric
prevented arthritis.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.970
So the question is,
what was it doing?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.370
But one very important
target that it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.420
went after was a really early
part of the whole cascade that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.200
leads to inflammation, and
turmeric attacks something

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.800
early on.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.220
NARRATOR: Turmeric may help in
the treatment phase of stroke,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.400
but the studies that Dr.
Ritter and Dr. Funk are doing

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.970
may prove that it has even
more positive benefits.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.550
 Turmeric, we think, may not
only have beneficial effects

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.110
during the acute phase of
stroke to reduce inflammation,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.480
but we think that
turmeric may be

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.910
effective in preventing stroke.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.820
And we would like to
translate our research

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.045
into that kind of clinical
study in the future.

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.430
NARRATOR: If more research
and clinical trials

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.790
prove that turmeric is effective
in treating inflammation,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.250
it will have added
implications for people

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.940
with chronic inflammation,
such as those with diabetes.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.020
 The folks that have
diabetes, we think

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.520
tend to have worse
stroke and worse outcomes

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.070
and rehabilitation
from stroke because

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.640
of this chronic
inflammation and then

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.290
the worsening inflammation
when the stroke occurs.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.640
