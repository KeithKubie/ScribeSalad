00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:26.200
SILVANO LUCIANI:
Hi, everybody.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.660
Welcome back to Google+
Developers Live.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.810
I'm Silvano Luciani, and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.640
for the Google+ platform.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.850
JONATHAN BERI: And I'm Jonathan
Beri, a developer

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.566
advocate on Google+.

00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:39.500
Today, we're going to talk about
some new features we

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.530
introduced to the Hangout apps
platform to create a better

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.080
developer experience, and making
it easier to develop

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.160
Hangout apps.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.480
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.970
So my favorite is that we
changed the way you can run

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.820
and test apps under
development.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.770
You would now be able to share
your apps in a normal hangout,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.050
right, Jonathan?

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.370
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.160
So let's take a look at the
new developer experience.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.990
So Silvano's going to
start up a Hangout.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.660
We actually have a new shortcut
to make it even

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.310
easier to start a Hangout.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.930
Go to hangouts.google.com/start,
and

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.100
that will fire up a Hangout, so
you don't even need to go

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.920
through chat and invite somebody
in the beginning.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.820
But he's actually going to go
ahead and include me in here,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.110
and I'm going to hop on board.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.660
So as that's getting sent over
to me, I'm going to get that

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.510
notification and jump on in.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.170
Silvano has an app that we
developed that he is a

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.450
developer on and I'm not.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.830
I'm just a normal Hangout
participant.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.880
And so when he fires that up,
the way to start that app is

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.970
even easier than before.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.820
Instead of going to the
developer console to find the

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.900
link to the Hangout, you can go
to the Add App button, and

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.200
there's a tab there where you
can find all the apps that

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.490
you're developing, whether
you're the owner and creator,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.490
or if somebody has added you
to a project to start

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.490
developing a Hangout app.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.312
Just going to fire that up.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:59.910
Right now, you guys can't see my
screen, but I can't see the

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.280
app that he's showing on the
screen, because, again, I

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.810
don't have permission.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.130
There's a button to share that
to everybody in the Hangout,

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.890
and I can start using
it, even though I've

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.070
never used it before.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.210
Cool.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.780
So now I'm in there, and you can
see my name is showing up

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.040
there, because I'm running
the app for this session.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.750
With this experience, you can
quickly enable people to come

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.840
in and test your app quickly and
easily, and it's only for

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.480
the session.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.460
So when I leave this Hangout,
I can't go ahead and muck

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.430
around with the app, and Silvano
can go ahead and tweak

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.740
it further.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.799
SILVANO LUCIANI: And if, for
example, you're hanging out

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.679
with friends, and you have an
app you're currently working

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.740
on, and you want to get some
feedback from them, it's as

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.299
easy as one click, share with
them, see what they think

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.670
about, get the feedback, and
go back working on the app.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.120
JONATHAN BERI: And then to
publish that app, it's the

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.880
same as before.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.945
You go through the developer
console, and you can make that

00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:53.620
app publicly available to
all the other users.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.900
The next big thing that we
announced at Google I/O and

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.550
that we're actively working
on is a new release flow.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.590
We have two release channels--

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.750
stable and beta.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.260
So with the stable channel,
these are APIs that you can

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.710
use in production today for
published apps, and users can

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.360
start taking advantage of.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.320
And it's very similar to
what we had today.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.880
When we released an API, it
is currently available.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.500
We introduced a new channel--
a beta channel--

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.930
that allows us to iterate more
quickly, releasing early APIs

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.150
to get developer feedback.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.460
So Silvano, let's see some of
those features from the new

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.660
beta channel.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.210
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.675
So the first one is the
possibility of adding blur to

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.090
the background.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.470
In this sample app, I have the
bottom blur my room, and then

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.490
with the slider, I can, as you
see, change the window size of

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.690
the blur to make it more
or less strong.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.020
And this is one of the first
features that we added to the

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.880
development channel.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.630
So remember, this is not
available for apps that are

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.920
publicly available.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.640
You can use it only on apps
under development.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.770
Another feature that we added
is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:11.060
So we added to the simple game
that will allow you to catch

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.920
the Chrome with you hand, and
now, as you see, it's catched,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.200
and it's in my hand.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.370
I'll just show you the
code for this.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.800
It's very easy.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.910
For the blur, you just need to
create a background blur

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.276
object, and you can do it
by calling gapi.hangout.

00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:33.170
av.effects.creat
ebackgroundblur(); and then

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.990
just set the blur window size.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.390
And what you've seen in the app
is just a slider that is

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.150
updating the sides of
the blur window.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.490
For the hand tracking, what you
can do is add a listener

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.760
to the on hand tracking
data changed event.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.340
This will be called every time
the hand is detected, and the

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.010
position of the hand change.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.260
And, for example, in this
function update hand position,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.660
we can check what happens.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.460
We check on the event if there
is a hand detected, and if the

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.290
hand is detected, we get the
position of the center.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.230
Then we have other functions in
the game that are actually

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.920
comparing the position of the
hand with the Chrome logo, and

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.980
understanding it fits in
the range of the hand.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.940
One thing that I want to show
to you is there is only one

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.460
hand that is tracked on the
screen at the moment, and you

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.890
can see we can do things
like this.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.876
But the Chrome would be always
stay on one hand.

00:11:34.876 --> 00:11:36.930
JONATHAN BERI: Now, that API
looks very similar to the

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.000
other effects APIs
that we have.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.520
Is that a final API?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.940
How is that documented?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.610
Where can we learn more
about those APIs?

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.320
SILVANO LUCIANI: So you can find
docs on the dev channel

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.620
at developers.googl
e.com/plus/hangouts/api-dev.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.890
These docs are always evolving,
because these apps--

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.625
the apps in the development
channel--

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.460
are under development.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.700
So if you're using these APIs,
come back often to check if we

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.260
made any changes.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.720
And we also we really want you
to use these APIs, and we

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.220
really want you to provide us
with feedback, and you can do

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.590
it by using our issue tracker
in the developers community.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.260
JONATHAN BERI: And we also
really want to engage with

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.350
developers to learn early,
and about their

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.600
feedback on these APIs.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.760
So we want you to use the
Google+ community we have for

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.480
the Google+ developers'
platform, especially using the

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.530
Hangouts category.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.000
And that's where you can come
and provide feedback, what you

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.540
think about the API design,
features that we're missing,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.210
and other features
you want to see.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.120
And not only is it us, the
Google Developer Relations

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.500
team working on Google+, but the
engineering team is also

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.410
in there hearing your feedback,
responding to your

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.420
questions to make the
product better.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.470
So really engage
with us there.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.945
And if you have issues, we also
we have a tag on Stack

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:57.300
Overflow that we actively
monitor, whether it's for our

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.590
Hangout apps, or other features

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.420
of the Google+ Platform.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.270
SILVANO LUCIANI: And the
tag is Google-+.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.140
JONATHAN BERI: Google-+.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.570
SILVANO LUCIANI: And
also, I already

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.300
mentioned the issue tracker.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.190
So if you're using this
development API, and you have

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.720
any suggestions for improvement
or feedback on the

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.700
usage, please use our
issue tracker.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.580
But also, if you have general
bugs, or feature requests

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.770
about the Hangouts API or any
other of the Google+ platform

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.790
functionalities, please
use the issue tracker.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.920
And also star issues and feature
requests, because we

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.000
use the number of stars
for each of those to

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.160
prioritize our work.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.600
So I think that's
all for today.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.030
Come back next Tuesday.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.960
We will be here again with a new
super interesting topic on

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.831
the Google+ platform.

00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:48.081
JONATHAN BERI: Bye.

00:13:56.222 --> 00:18:14.820
