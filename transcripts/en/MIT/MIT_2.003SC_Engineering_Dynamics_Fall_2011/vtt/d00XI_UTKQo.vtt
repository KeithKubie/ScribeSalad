00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.330
PROFESSOR: So I'm
going to give you

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.130
a quick example of what I think
is a good way to do solutions.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.405
Our approach to solutions.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.980
State the problem.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.030
I'm going to give you a
little formulaic here.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.720
Draw figures.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.440
On the first day I said I like
to think of dynamics problem.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.500
I break them down
into three categories.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.185
One is to describe the motion.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.810
What does describing
the motion mean?

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.670
Well how many-- the
number of degrees of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.790
freedom in the problem.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.450
That implies the number
of equations of motion

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.360
that you're going to need
to solve that problem.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.710
So you got to identify the
number of degrees of freedom.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.370
It also then tells you the
number of coordinates you need.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730
So this is all part of
describing the motion.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.040
It's figuring out how many
coordinates, assigning them.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.860
So assigning the coordinates.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.520
And then finally, essentially
all underneath this you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.896
essentially do the kinematics.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.097
And that's the velocities,
accelerations, so forth.

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.055
So once you have-- you've
explained the motion.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.960
And this I guess is four.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.155
Explain the correct
physical laws.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.460
You know how they apply.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.280
f equals ma.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.925
Newton's first, second, third
law of conservation of momentum

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:56.750
or whatever you want-- you
think is the appropriate thing.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.840
So explain what the physical
laws are and apply them.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.100
And finally, do the math.

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:12.120
So if you could break
problems down that way

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.450
it'll give you a
nice, logical flow.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.980
So I'm going to give you a
bit of an example problem.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.640
And I'm also going to kind
of pose a brain teaser to you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.060
at the end of this
problem today.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.660
I want to give you
something to think about.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.710
So I'm going to draw my problem.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.130
This is a block on an incline.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.820
It's got some scales
to measure your weight.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.510
And you're standing
on this thing.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.695
Riding it down the incline.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.870
And the first
question about this

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.490
is to find the position
as a function of time.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:27.450
So that's the problem.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.980
That's part a.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.670
So state the problem,
find the position.

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:46.190
So how-- well what do we do?

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.690
Well draw figures,
I've started with that.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.240
Next, describe the motion.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.140
I need a free-- We
have to figure out

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.360
how many degrees of
freedom this problem has.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.030
I'm going to just
declare no rotation.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.180
Going to treat it as a particle.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.871
So a particle has how many,
generally how many degrees of

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:07.370
freedom?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.190
How many coordinates
to completely describe

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.226
where it's at?

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.040
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.240
PROFESSOR: Three.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.880
So I may need as many
as three coordinates

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.180
to describe the
motion of this thing.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.780
And if I really doing
complete equations of motion

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.330
I need three
equations of motion.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.560
So this is two, three--
describing the motion I

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.576
have three degrees of freedom.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.075
I'm going to need
three coordinates.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.200
So in this case
here's my picture

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.560
I'm going just to set up a
Cartesian coordinate system

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.970
aligned in a helpful way.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.390
X, y, z coming out.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.910
And this is my fixed
inertial reference frame.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.820
And here's my center of mass.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.050
And basically my coordinates
are describing the position

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.130
of the center of mass.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.230
So that's pretty much the
describing the motion,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.340
what I need for now.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.250
We'll get to the velocities
and accelerations

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.666
when we get to the math part.

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:28.415
Apply the physics.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.380
I'm going to use
Newton's second law.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.260
Sum of the external forces,
mass times the acceleration.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.584
That's the physical
law I'm going to apply.

00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:00.625
Draw a free body diagram.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.870
And I'm just going
to consider the block

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.709
and the person this is the whole
collection, it's one thing.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.500
I'm just not keep
drawing the person on it,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.840
but-- so here's my
object, including

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.540
the weight of the person.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.410
And it's going to have--
here's its center of mass.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.040
Obviously in mg,
gravitational force,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.610
it's going to have
a normal force.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.492
Going to have a friction
force and how do I

00:07:44.492 --> 00:07:46.950
figure out what the friction--
which direction the friction

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.645
is?

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:51.310
I assume motion down the hill.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.070
Friction will oppose it.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.040
I draw in the arrows
in the direction

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.590
I expect the forces to act.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.965
Then I'll use the
sign convention

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:01.340
that the arrows
tell me what signs.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.780
So since my x-coordinate
is down the hill.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.080
This is y.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.320
This is x, friction x,
in the minus x direction.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.900
And I haven't-- I've left out
a key piece of information.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.710
Got to have the
angle of the slope.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:37.270
And once you have the angle
of the slope that's theta,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.840
this is theta.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.500
And I'm going to need to--
this is in a direction of one

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.120
of my coordinates
and so is this,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.120
but I need to break
the gravitational piece

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.520
into components lined
up with my coordinates.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.420
And so you have a
theta here as well.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.445
And now I can write
my equation to motion.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.350
And the nice thing
about vectors is

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.690
that when you have three
equations of motion,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.950
three coordinates, each that
are components of vectors

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.770
in the x, y and z
direction, it gives us

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.130
three equations immediately.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.590
So for example, the
summation of the forces

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.230
in this problem in
the z-direction,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.770
the external forces are sums to?

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.469
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:27.010
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.620
OK so we get a trivial
solution out of that.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.340
And we don't have
to go much further.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.760
Summation of the forces
in the y-direction

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.180
gives us some
useful information.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:50.860
And then the y-directed forces
I have an n and a minus mg

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.910
and I think it's cosine theta.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.580
Which tells me
immediately what n is.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:09.630
So from statics I get to-- and
from what we know about models

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:16.870
of friction then we know that
we can model the friction as mu

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:25.120
times n for mu mg cosine theta.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.726
So from the statics I
learn a bunch of things

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.225
that I need to know
for the problem.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:43.389
So now I get to the real
heart of the problem,

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:45.430
writing my equation of
motion in the x-direction.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.580
And the forces in
the x-direction mg

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.100
sine theta down the hill.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.920
So it's positive.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.540
Minus the friction
is up the hill.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.500
So I get mg.

00:11:18.264 --> 00:11:34.280
I'm mixing up my m's here but
there's no other m so-- this

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:40.280
basically says, that x double
dot, the m's all cancel out.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:52.470
That x double dot is g sine
theta minus mu g cosine theta.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.140
And that just happens to be
a pretty simple to solve,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.920
ordinary differential equation.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.650
This is an equation in which
the acceleration in the problem

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.290
is constant.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.000
The data's not changing.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.530
None of these
things are changing

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.497
and so you can just
solve this one.

00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:09.205
Now we're to the third
part, do the math.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.550
This one you can just integrate.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.525
And so you find out
that well, x dot then

00:12:21.525 --> 00:12:25.370
and I'm just going to
call this c some constant.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:31.340
So x dot ct plus an initial
velocity, if it had one.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.280
And x of t, what
you're looking for.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.370
And now so v0 and x0 are
just your initial conditions.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.410
More than likely 0 if
you set it up cleverly.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.890
So that's just
modeling quickly what

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.490
I think a good way to
lay out a problem is.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.230
Describing the motion,
explaining the physics,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:05.580
doing the math, drawing good
pictures, stating the problem.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.809
All right so now
the brain teaser

00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:09.100
that I want you to think about.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.725
So here's the mass of the
block plus the scales.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.290
And here's the-- here
you're standing on it.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.190
So mass of the person.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.930
You're riding this
down the hill.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.530
So this is part b.

00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:24.205
Think about that
when in the shower.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.610
If you've got a really
simple way to do it,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.110
great write it up.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.920
It's not terribly hard and it's
mostly-- I'll give you a hint.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.500
Thinking in terms of free
body diagram helps a lot.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.930
And we'll come back to
this kind of fun problem.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.890
OK, want to go--
that was part one.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.210
I want to go onto this recapping
the center of mass quickly.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:11.519
We learned a couple
of important things.

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.310
We got-- we talked
about the center of mass

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.730
because we were just talking
about Newton's three laws.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.894
From looking at the
first law, found

00:15:18.894 --> 00:15:20.810
that it's useful in
determining whether or not

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.530
you're in a inertial
frame, we used it.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.320
Second law we've
just applied it.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.960
We used to do-- get
equations of motion.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.730
Third law was about--
we used it when we're

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.150
thinking about center of mass.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.040
We used it to define what
the center of mass was.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.730
So we said the total
mass of a system,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.890
I better draw my picture.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.245
Here's my system of particles.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.910
M1 with position vectors.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.420
So a whole mess of particles
with their position vectors.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.270
This is ri with respect
to O for example.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.480
This is my O x, y, z frame.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.680
We said that this total
mass of the particles

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:11.520
somewhere out here there's a
center of mass with a position

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:22.300
vector rg with respect to O.
So the definition of my center

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:29.140
of mass is this is equal to the
summation of the m, i, r, i, o

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.170
and these are position vectors.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.760
So that's the definition
of my center of mass.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:43.215
If I take two time derivatives
of that we arrived at mt rg

00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:46.760
with the respect
to O double dot.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.500
Summation over i of my m,
i, r, i, o double dots.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.730
And then importantly
that's the summation

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:07.883
of all of the external
forces on each

00:17:07.883 --> 00:17:09.869
of these-- each one
of these by itself

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.780
satisfies Newton's
law, second law, which

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.690
he wrote about particles.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.105
Each one has a summation.

00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:17.980
I've summed these and
I'm going to sum these,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:23.920
but each one has a summation of
internal forces acting on it.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.130
These I call the f, i, j's.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.900
And we learn-- something
about the third law

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.530
tells us about that summation.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.390
The third law tells us what?

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.650
That goes to 0 and that was
that's the really powerful

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.530
piece of the third law
that we make great use of.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.190
Because this now essentially
allows us to say,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.060
that the summation
of the external

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.110
forces on an assembly
of particles,

00:17:53.110 --> 00:18:06.140
on a system of particles,
is equal to the total mass

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.820
times the acceleration
of the center of mass.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.080
And that-- what that
does in one stroke

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:22.400
takes you from Newton, who's
laws applied to particles

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.487
and allows you to apply Newton's
second law to rigid bodies.

00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:29.070
Because rigid bodies
can be thought up

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.250
a bunch of particles,
which are represented

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.520
in that simple equation.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.430
And that gets you from
particles to rigid bodies.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.190
And we all know from
physics that a summation

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.200
of the external
force on this thing

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.834
is the mass times
the acceleration

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:46.750
of the center of mass.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.730
So that's actually quite
an important powerful law.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.060
It provides this for us.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.900
Now I said I wanted to
give you a quick, very

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.970
useful application of
thinking about center of mass.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.870
I showed you the other day, I
had my carbon fiber tube here.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.120
Showed you that trick for
finding the center of mass

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.703
just by sliding your
fingers along it.

00:19:12.703 --> 00:19:14.730
And you end up at
the center of mass.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.190
Well as a practical
matter other things--

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.900
you really want to be
able find center of mass.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.290
This is a glider, a
sailplane called an LS8.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.330
I happen-- I'm a glider
flight instructor.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.660
Been flying gliders for 35
years or something like that.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.280
And I flew a glider of
this type just recently.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.980
That machine has a 49 to
one let's call it 50 to one

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.710
to make it easy, glide ratio.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.030
Means if you're a mile above
the ground in still air,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.850
you will go 50 miles before
you touch the ground.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.840
So they're really amazing
high performance machines.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.930
One of the things about all
aircraft that you actually

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.810
need to know is, you
really need to know where

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.630
the center of mass of it is.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.140
And if the center of mass
is in the wrong place

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.780
the plane will not fly properly.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.475
And so you can't just go
throw on 50 pounds of lead

00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:09.300
in the tail of that
plane and expect

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.160
to survive the next flight.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.250
So you have to know
where the center of mass

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.560
is, and in fact, you
want the center of mass

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.040
about 25% of the-- if the
wing is this wide from front

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.890
to back it's called the cord.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.600
About 25% back from
the leading edge

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.560
is about where the center
of lift of a wing is.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.110
And you want your
center of mass also

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.350
called the center of
gravity in these situations,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.890
you want it to be pretty
close to the center of lift

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.130
so that their balance in
the plane flies nicely.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:52.780
So is there a simple way to find
the center of mass of something

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.380
like a sailplane?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.060
So I'm going to drew-- this
is exactly how you do it.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.490
So I'll draw a quick picture
of my sailplane here.

00:21:11.302 --> 00:21:13.760
You usually have a little skid
or a tail wheel on the back.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.210
And to find the center of mass
you just set them on scales.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.410
You weigh it.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.340
You pick a coordinate system.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.200
Doesn't matter where it
is, as long as it's fixed.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.960
The easiest place is right
at the nose of the sailplane.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.180
So we'll make this
x, make this y.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.080
You take it and you
can take a tape measure

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:45.180
and measure the distance
from your reference point

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.200
to the position where the
wheel sits on the scales.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.720
We'll call that L1 here.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.820
And that's typically
about five feet.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.230
And back here you
have another position

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.350
to where you have your second
set of scales, that's L2.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.465
And a typical sailplane
that's about 15 feet.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.247
Apply Newton's law.

00:22:16.247 --> 00:22:17.580
This thing's not going anywhere.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.910
Sum of the forces in
the vertical direction

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.710
is equal to 0.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.390
Free body diagram.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.990
Well you have somewhere about
here, where the wing is,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.170
this is your center of mass.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:38.880
And you have m total
times g downwards there.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.715
You have two weights
pushing on the sailplane.

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:46.920
A W2 pushing up,
holding up the tail.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.040
And a W1 holding
up the main gear.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.250
And so from the sum of the
forces in the y-direction,

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.960
that had better be 0.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:14.390
So you know that W1
plus W2 minus mtg is 0.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.260
And so you find out that the
total weight of the sailplane

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.874
is no surprise, the sum of
the two weights on the scales.

00:23:23.874 --> 00:23:24.868
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.960
Let's do this, m, t, g.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.480
So the total weight
times gravity

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.820
is just the sum of the two
readings on the scales.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.200
And the second piece that you
need to do to do this problem

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.440
is, you can have an
equation that says,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.360
the sum of the external
torques with respect

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.930
to you're-- through
a fixed point O,

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.520
is equal to the mass moment
of inertia times the angular

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.530
acceleration, oftentimes
written as alpha.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.560
In this case, that's going
to be 0, it's going nowhere.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.300
So what are the external torques
with respect to this point?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.220
Well we have a right-handed
coordinate system.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.485
You have W1 up, times L1.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:23.210
W2 up, times L2
minus W1 plus W2,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:29.750
which is the total weight
of the sailplane times

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:35.760
rg, the location of
the center of mass.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.770
That's this distance
that we're looking for.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.860
So we know everything
here, except rg.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.690
So we can solve for
rg with respect to O

00:24:52.690 --> 00:25:03.680
and it's simply W1 L1 plus
W2 L2 over W1 plus W2.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:15.720
And if you run the numbers,
typically W1 600 pounds,

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:23.560
W2 the numbers I've done
here is-- might be 40 pounds.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.590
And I've already said
five feet and 15 feet.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.580
And you work the
answer and you come up

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:40.830
with 5.62 feet, which puts
this-- here is the wheel

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.650
and you're a little bit
aft of the main gear.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.240
And that's where you,
basically where you want to be.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.247
That's a real practical use of
knowing about centers of mass

00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:54.330
and how to calculate them.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:06.080
So that's the second item I
wanted to talk about today.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.370
Essentially a recap
of the center of mass.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.480
And now I want to
move on to talking

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.290
about a serious
introduction to-- we've

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.380
had the introduction,
velocities and accelerations.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.510
We have to have a
way of writing down

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:35.170
the acceleration of a mass,
a point, a dog in a rotating,

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.740
translating, reference
frame with the possibility

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.670
that in addition to
that, the dog's moving.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.230
So we want to have equations--
we want to have the ability

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.310
to write down expressions
for the velocity

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:54.110
and acceleration of a mass
moving in a translating,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.690
rotating, reference frame.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.680
So we've started this.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.080
We did pretty much did
velocities to begin with.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.080
So here's my inertial frame.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.800
Call it O or O x, y, z.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.470
Here's my rigid body out there.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:57.200
It has a point a something
else, b might be the dog.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.810
And we've described
the position of this

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.940
as the position of this
point a, with respect to O.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.640
And at this point we're going
to locate a reference frame

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.700
attached to the rigid body.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.570
And so it's going
to be called a,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.530
and I'll call it x
prime, y prime, z prime.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.350
It's attached to
the rigid body, it

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.230
rotates with the rigid
body and its attached

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.340
at some fixed point.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.860
Now what would
oftentimes would be

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.950
a smart choice for that
fixed point at point A?

00:28:35.144 --> 00:28:36.076
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.076 --> 00:28:38.492
PROFESSOR: If you're going to
write an equation expressing

00:28:38.492 --> 00:28:40.280
the motion of this.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.832
Where would you make point a?

00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:42.759
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:43.800
AUDIENCE: Center of mass.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.350
PROFESSOR: Center of mass.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.320
So very, very often, especially
when objects are free

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.820
floating around out there you're
going to make smart choices

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.770
and you're going to put
this coordinate system

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.936
right on the center of mass.

00:28:53.936 --> 00:28:56.040
But it doesn't have
to be, but it can be.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.390
So we were interested
in knowing things

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.590
about the motion of this point
in our inertial reference

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:15.080
frame, in terms of positions
of our coordinate system.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:23.190
And then also this vector
here rd, with respect to a.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:29.590
Now last time we came up with
expressions for the velocity

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:35.285
of b with respect to O.

00:29:35.285 --> 00:29:39.320
We said in general it's the
velocity of your-- where

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320
your coordinate
system's located.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.260
The translating-- the velocity
of the translating frame

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:55.780
plus the derivative of
rba, time derivative

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.430
of the position as seen from,
if you were sitting at a.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.520
And another way to
say that, or this

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.420
is a derivative taken with the
rotation rate momentarily set

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.490
equal to 0.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.370
Another way to think of it.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.180
Plus a piece that
comes from rotation.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.150
So the rotation with respect
to the fixed frame, these

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:30.010
are all vectors, the
rotation with respect

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:36.720
to the fixed frame, cross
product with r, b, a.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.460
And this-- and we
said this is actually

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.590
a general formula for the
derivative of-- this piece is

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:48.840
the derivative of a vector
in a frame, in a fixed frame.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.970
You have two pieces,
the derivative as

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.197
seen without rotation
plus the contribution that

00:30:55.197 --> 00:30:56.030
comes from rotation.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.920
When I did this center of
mass thing a second ago,

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.350
I just kind of quickly wrote
down two time derivatives

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.820
of the position vector.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.310
There's no omega cross
O's in there right?

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.960
Why could I do that?

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.520
This is actually kind of an
important distinct point.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.530
I could do that they didn't say
very specifically when I did it

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.920
was an assumption I was making.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.610
Except for perhaps they drew it.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:39.430
This was done in a
Cartesian coordinate system.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.250
And my coordinates
were x, y and z

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:47.471
and the unit vectors were
i, j, k and do they move?

00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:47.970
No.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.178
What's their time derivative?

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:50.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.761
PROFESSOR: When you don't-- when
the inner vectors don't have

00:31:52.761 --> 00:31:54.811
time derivatives you
don't get these terms.

00:31:54.811 --> 00:31:57.060
This is the only term that
contributes so I could just

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.390
write that equation.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.350
But we now have a reference
frame attached to a body

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.540
and this reference
frame is rotating.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.940
And that means that the
direction of the unit vectors

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.710
attach-- the unit vector
attached to x-prime here

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.520
is moving, it's rotating.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.700
And it's going to have
a time derivative.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.855
So we have to--
and that is given

00:32:17.855 --> 00:32:19.480
and you take those
time derivatives you

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.920
get this second piece.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.330
I'm going to give you
the answer in advance.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:32.460
The acceleration of b
with respect to O I'm

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.460
going to give you
the full 3D equation.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.240
Then we'll go back and see
a bit where it comes from.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.660
So here's-- it's the time
derivative of that velocity

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:55.376
expression with respect to time
taken in the inertial frame O,

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:55.875
x, y, z.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.911
And am I going to have
enough room to get this on?

00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.535
It'll be close.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.280
All right this has
several pieces.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:28.070
It's got a contribution of the
acceleration of a with respect

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.551
to O. That's just the
acceleration of this point.

00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:33.050
Has nothing to do with rotation,
so it's just a straight out

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.550
acceleration of my translating
frame with respect to O.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.490
That's the first piece.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:44.690
The second piece is related-- is
the derivative of this guy that

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.620
comes from the
derivative of this.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:54.010
It's the acceleration of b
with respect to a as seen

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:54.895
in this a frame.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.500
If you read the
Williams book, it's

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.940
called the relative
acceleration.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.732
It's relative to the-- if
you were sitting at point A,

00:34:06.732 --> 00:34:08.565
it's what you would see
as the acceleration.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:25.239
Plus 2 omega cross
velocity of b with respect

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:36.850
to a as seen from a plus
omega dot, the derivative

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:57.070
of the rotation rate,
cross rba plus omega cross,

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:03.590
omega cross r, b, a.

00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.110
Kind of daunting right?

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.250
A little messy.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:19.740
Basically one, two, three,
four, five different terms.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.130
And you're going to-- and they
all have names and meanings.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.370
And one of the things
that will really help you

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.420
is to get familiar,
you really need

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:36.480
to be familiar with the meaning
of each one of the terms.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.690
And it's not terribly difficult.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:43.240
This one, just the acceleration
of the translating frame.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.850
So if it's a
merry-go-round sitting

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.580
on a train and the train's
heading down the track,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.320
its acceleration of the train.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.370
Rotating frame is attached
to the merry-go-round.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.300
And if you've got the
dog on the merry-go-round

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.990
this is then the acceleration
of the dog relative to this,

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.460
the merry-go-round.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.040
This position of the
coordinate system

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.060
attached to the merry-go-round
has no rotation in it.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:17.110
This is the velocity
of that point, the dog,

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.850
as seen from the A frame.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.100
Again, you have no
sense of rotation.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.250
Rotation is not a part of this.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.050
Cross product with
the rotation rate.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.780
This is the accelerate.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:35.810
This is the angular acceleration
cross product with rba.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.910
Now that's a term--
what does that mean?

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:44.400
I'm swinging a baseball bat and
I'm accelerating this thing.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.540
Idealize it as just something
on a radius accelerating.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.030
The acceleration
of a point out here

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.520
is the radius times the
angular acceleration.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.300
So that's all this term is.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.870
And it's called the
Euler acceleration.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.702
But it's just simply
r theta double dot.

00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:08.190
This, if you multiply it out
and just think about units,

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.790
this ends up looking
like r omega squared.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.040
Have you run into that before?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.290
What's that?

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.618
Common language.

00:37:16.618 --> 00:37:18.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.010
PROFESSOR: That's as a
centrifugal-- centripetal,

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.060
this is centripetal
acceleration.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.600
So this is the centripetal
acceleration term,

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.060
that's the Euler
acceleration term,

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.025
this is the local acceleration.

00:37:30.025 --> 00:37:32.100
This is the acceleration
of your frame.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.910
This is the strange one.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.685
This is the Coriolis
acceleration.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.520
And we'll get
familiar with it too.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:48.520
So that's the full blown
3D acceleration equation.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.700
And by the way the
vector-- the velocity one

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.730
is also perfect 3D.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:38:01.170
Now in this course we won't do
much in the way of 3D dynamics

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:01.860
problems.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.793
Yes.

00:38:02.793 --> 00:38:08.070
AUDIENCE: Does the point
b on the rigid plane move?

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.195
PROFESSOR: Does the-- it may.

00:38:10.195 --> 00:38:19.450
It could be this is the-- an
asteroid out there in space

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.540
and you've got--
this is home base

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.580
and that's a guy out there
in a space suit running.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.910
So we want to be
able to describe

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:38.500
the acceleration of that guy
as seen from a fixed reference

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.710
frame.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.720
Now why would we want to
know that acceleration?

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.180
Why do we want to know
it in a fixed frame?

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:53.480
Well if you want to calculate
the forces on the person.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.200
Well how much-- what's he
have to do with his feet

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.600
to brace himself or whatever?

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.570
What are the actual forces?

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.970
You have to know the
acceleration on the person.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.030
But Newton's laws, in
order to say f equals ma,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:13.690
Newton's laws have to be applied
in inertial reference frames.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.590
Is this thing out there doing
this an a inertial reference

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.571
frame?

00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:18.070
No.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.140
So you can't
calculate the forces

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.530
without having some idea
of this inertial frame.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.750
So this is the way of
getting the acceleration

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:33.690
on-- at a location on a moving,
rotating body with respect

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.410
to an inertial frame.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:40.160
And with all the terms present.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.250
Now most discourse has
generally has addressed problems

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.740
which are in most textbooks
address only planar motion

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.270
problems.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:55.530
Planar motion basically
means that we can find

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.280
the translations to a plane.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.860
So imagine an x, and a y, and
a z upwards coordinate system

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.450
attached to the top this table.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.370
And I only allow motions
that are around the table.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.860
And I only allow motions that
have a single axis rotation.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.720
And that's lined up with z.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.210
Those are essentially
planar motion problems.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.650
And most courses in dynamics,
it lists [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.290
That's as far as they get.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.610
And the most of the
problems that you'll do

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.670
will be planar motion problems.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:33.970
But that equation reduces to the
planar motion problem as well.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.270
We will do a little bit
of 3D, because there's

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.941
a class of problems
that I really

00:40:37.941 --> 00:40:40.440
think it's important for you
to understand that just come up

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.997
all the time that
require a little 3D.

00:40:43.997 --> 00:40:45.830
And as you want to have
some things going on

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.240
out of the plane,
but we'll still

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:53.420
confine the axis of rotation
to a single direction.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:53.920
Yeah.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in a planar,

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.740
but then would you have three to
view the freedom? [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.430
PROFESSOR: That's
a great question

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.880
she said if you
had a dog running

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.630
on the merry-go-round how many
degrees of freedom do you have?

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.510
So in general rigid
bodies, each rigid body,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.100
each independent
rigid body has--

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.580
you have to describe its
location of its center of mass

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.270
and that takes how
many coordinates?

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.340
How many coordinates
I'll call them.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:28.660
PROFESSOR: Well
in general three.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:35.227
And it can now rotate
around three different axes.

00:41:35.227 --> 00:41:36.310
And that takes three more.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.740
So rigid bodies have
six degrees of freedom.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.620
And any problem when you go
to address the problem you

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.460
essentially for a rigid
body you start with six.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.270
And you start
applying constraints

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.850
to reduce it down to
the number of remaining

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.810
degrees of freedom.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.380
So if it's confined to
a plane and no z-motion

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.250
is allowed one constraint.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.470
If it is on a
plane and it's only

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.640
allowed to rotate
about the z-axis that

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.920
means you've constrained its
rotation in around y and x.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.640
So that's two more.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:16.560
And so now you're down to three
degrees of freedom left, xy

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.890
and a rotation about the z-axis.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.680
So planar motion
problems generally

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.450
have three degrees of freedom.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.230
But instant-- let's
just say we're

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.020
just interested in
just something that

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.240
rotates and doesn't translate.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.610
How many degrees of freedom
does that have then?

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.770
Just one.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.259
x and y are forced not
to-- no motion, two more

00:42:40.259 --> 00:42:41.550
constraints you're down to one.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:45.712
So lots of problems we do
are in fact single degree

00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:46.545
of freedom problems.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.640
So to do planar motion
problems we oftentimes

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.010
use polar coordinates.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.420
So I'm going to
introduce r theta.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.980
And I'm actually going to call
it cylindrical coordinates.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:26.298
And cylindrical coordinates then
you have an r, a theta and z.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.900
And let's think about well
let's see, I have a demo,

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.540
a little demo here.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.450
So here's a problem with
a single axis of rotation.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:54.570
And it's a-- there is a mass out
here and just this is a rhyme.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.260
And so think of this
think of this mass

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:03.350
out here as being a bug
walking out this rod.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:08.032
And the rod, this thing
goes round and round.

00:44:08.032 --> 00:44:09.580
It's not a
merry-go-round but it's

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.660
a merry-go-round with
a gang plank on it.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.035
It's going up at
an angle and you

00:44:14.035 --> 00:44:16.118
can walk the gang plank
while the merry-go-round's

00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:16.690
going around.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.330
So that's what we got here.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:23.540
So this is actually allowed to
change position of this mass.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:28.900
So how would I describe that
with cylindrical coordinates?

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:34.900
Let me so it's going to take--
one would be a side view.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.930
So you see your
vertical axis here

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.135
and have to have a bearing
to hold it in place.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:53.970
Here's the arm, here's the
bug walking out the arm,

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.480
has some rotation rate.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:13.440
Theta dot this is the z-axis
and the position of this point

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:22.280
is described by a r
vector, in the r hat

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.800
direction, which I
think is the unit

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.630
vectors you're used to using.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:30.375
And then this is the z-component
in the k hat direction.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:45.730
And this vector here would be r
of v with respect to what shall

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:46.230
I call it?

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:55.800
I'll make this a and
over here someplace

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:07.400
I have a fixed inertial let's
see I got to be careful here.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:13.620
I want that to be z then I
have a y going out here x, y, z

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.180
pointing upwards.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.480
And my-- this fixed
inertial system the unit

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:25.840
vectors here this would
be i hat, j hat and k hat.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.920
But these-- this rotating
system with its unit

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.360
vector little k and this
vector they're the same,

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.020
they're parallel.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.620
But looking down on this, this
is my polar coordinate system.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.560
Now I'm going to
look at my top view.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.870
I will see a projection.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.340
I'll just see the
r, this is rr hat,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.840
this is my point
B. This is theta.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.640
And I have a unit vector.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.190
So the unit vector r hat is
something-- the unit long

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.870
pointing in this direction.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.320
And the unit vector in this
direction is theta hat.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.430
And it's perpendicular
to that radius.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.330
So now I have my
three unit vectors.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.530
One pointing in the
direction of r, here's

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:29.920
also my unit vector is just to
make sure there's no confusion.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.218
This unit vector is
in this direction.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.940
K is in that direction.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.050
Theta is in that direction.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.080
And over here you still
have your-- now here's

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:54.570
my x, y, z out of the
board inertial frame.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:59.166
And this-- my inertial
frame this might be r, b, o.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.180
So in my inertial frame.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.085
I want to know
what's going on here.

00:48:07.085 --> 00:48:08.960
I want to be able to
calculate the velocities

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.876
and the accelerations.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:21.730
So the notation here gets--
can get a little confusing.

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:26.010
The rbo notation that
I've been using all along,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:30.880
that's the motion-- that's
the position vector describing

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.650
that point in my inertial frame.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:39.310
And my-- just lowercase r here,
no scrub scripts or anything,

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:44.850
that's just going to-- that's
my polar coordinate r theta

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.500
and z that happened
to be in this case,

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.120
this is a rotating frame.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.190
This is a rotating frame.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:58.870
It's the center of this
coordinate system's at a.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.720
But this thing rotates.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.400
So this is a pretty
simplified version

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.760
of this general problem.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.250
Now because it's simplified,
you can actually--

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.680
it's a lot easier to use.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.240
Also has some real limitations.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.230
You can only going just--
there's limited things

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.500
that you can describe with it.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:48.070
So let's start by describing
velocities in cylindrical

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:48.570
coordinates.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:27.800
Remember this rba is the
length of this guy here.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.710
And it's made up
of rr hat zk hat.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.585
So to express the
velocity we have

00:51:01.585 --> 00:51:03.710
to take a time derivative
of this r, b, a

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.210
and I'm going to express
it in terms of r theta nz.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.190
And to get acceleration
I have to take two time

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.210
derivatives of this, but
this is going to be expressed

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.880
in my cylindrical coordinates.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.420
This is where I'm going.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:24.660
And lots of problems--
many, many of these problems

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.240
have fixed axes of
rotations and this velocity

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.540
and this acceleration are zero.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.080
You just drop it out.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.000
I'm going to do that
just to keep this-- make

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.250
this problem a little simpler.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.890
So we can just focus
on these terms.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:45.970
So let's just let the there be
no translational of this frame.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:48.900
And that says that
Va with respect

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.679
to O the acceleration of A
with respect to O over zero.

00:51:53.679 --> 00:51:55.470
So I want you to just
focus on these terms.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.160
I don't lose anything,
I can put these back in

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.200
later if I need them.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.157
I just don't want to
keep carrying them along.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.220
So I have my--
remember my side view.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:47.140
This is r, r hat zk
hat that's my point.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.210
And my top view.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:12.990
This is my projection
just looking down on it

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.580
what I see is the length r.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:20.929
And what I see in my unit vector
going that way r direction

00:53:20.929 --> 00:53:21.970
and theta that direction.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:32.870
And this is x and the
i and a y with a j hat

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:36.640
vector looking down on it.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.660
My rotation rate mega with
respect to my inertial frame,

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.100
is sum theta dot k hat.

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.350
All right so now let's find
the velocity of b with respect

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:59.640
to O. Well it's 0, no
translation, plus--

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:06.850
and now I need a time derivative
of rb with respect to a.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:20.402
But this is then r, b, a
is r, r hat plus z k hat.

00:54:20.402 --> 00:54:22.675
And I need the time
derivative of that.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:41.980
So I get an r dot r hat plus
an r r hat dot plus a z dot k.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.840
So this is the
product of two things.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.760
They're both time dependent.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:51.380
So I have to get two pieces, k
does not change in direction.

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.330
So it has no time derivative.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.570
So I only have a z dot k.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.300
So this is a result
of doing this,

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.740
but I now have to
figure out what

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.205
is the time derivative of the
unit vector in the r direction.

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.260
So when I told-- when we worked
out this formula the other day

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.640
for the time derivative
of a rotating vector,

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.300
I mostly did it, it was kind
of an intuitive argument.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.820
So on this one
occasion I'm going

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.130
to give you an example
of actually figuring out

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.390
what the derivative of
this rotating vector is.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:39.120
And if you go read
that kinematics handout

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.920
and it does this in kind of full
blown form for-- in general.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.780
So I'm just going to
do it as one example.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:51.880
So here's our looking down on
this, the projection on the xy

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.100
plane, here's our r-vector.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.060
And here's this
unit vector and it

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:02.900
starts from-- I have a unit
vector starting from a it's

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.370
unit-- it's one long.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.930
And this is r hat.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:15.900
And it's of unit length and it's
in this particular direction.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:21.050
Now in a little bit it
time delta t, it moves.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.490
It moves to here.

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:33.480
So this is delta r hat and
what direction does it move?

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it moves in
the-- moves in the theta hat

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.090
direction.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:45.470
And the amount that it
moves is the rotation rate,

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:49.050
theta dot, delta t.

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:59.640
So delta r hat, if I
solve for this, delta t.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:04.930
And this is in the
theta hat direction,

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.185
is theta dot theta hat.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.810
So this is the
limit as t, delta t

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:24.770
goes to 0 you get the derivative
of r hat with respect to time.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:27.870
Its direction is in
the theta hat direction

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:31.980
and its magnitude is theta dot.

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.740
So that's the time derivative
of the unit vector r hat.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:40.210
Yeah.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:43.556
AUDIENCE: How does
that work with units?

00:57:43.556 --> 00:57:47.700
PROFESSOR: How does
it work with units?

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:55.640
What's left out of here is
that this is unit length

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.426
and has dimensions.

00:57:57.426 --> 00:58:02.270
It's unit length, one whatever
unit system you're working.

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.440
So that is implicitly in here.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:11.900
It's one meter theta dot and
that theta dot, the delta t,

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:12.880
the times go away.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.940
You're left with one meter times
the magnitude of theta dot.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.630
So the distance
it actually moves

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:25.370
is r theta, the r delta theta,
delta theta is theta dot delta

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.645
t and the radius
happens to be 1.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.830
So whatever unit system you're
working in it's a unit vector.

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:36.130
Has unit length.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.330
So its units are
buried right there.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:40.890
Good question.

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:45.120
OK so now we know what this is.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:50.670
So now we can come back finish
our description of the velocity

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:58.820
of b with respect to
a then is r dot r hat

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:10.795
plus z dot k hat
plus theta dot times

00:59:10.795 --> 00:59:17.050
so r times the derivative of
the unit vector r, which we just

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:21.292
figured out is theta
dot theta hat times r.

00:59:21.292 --> 00:59:25.620
R theta dot theta hat.

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:28.620
So that's my velocity
of b with respect to a.

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.640
My velocity of B with respect
to O all you have to add in

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.720
is the velocity of A
with perspective to O,

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.580
which we've let be 0 for now.

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:40.080
So for the moment this is
also d with respect to O.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.910
But this is the general
piece of the velocity

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:46.294
of b with respect to a in
polar cylindrical coordinates.

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.050
Now we could have-- so I've
actually worked it out, just

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:57.090
shown you, just drew the picture
and figured out the derivative.

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:59.850
We could have used
that magic formula.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:03.920
The formula for the derivative
of a vector in a rotating

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.420
frame.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.330
So I'll just do that
quickly to remind you

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.020
how we could have done this.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:27.620
rba with respect to time
as seen in the O frame.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:36.990
Is the partial derivative
of rba with respect

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:47.577
to time as seen in the rotating
frame, plus omega cross r, b,

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.076
a.

01:00:55.370 --> 01:01:02.030
This term is that and that.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.760
The derivative of
this rba as seen

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.440
from inside of the
rotating frame,

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.090
is just the change in length,
this is rba here from the side.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:21.389
So the change in length of
that vector, the derivative

01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:22.680
of-- the time derivative of it.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:28.290
It's the vector sum of
the r dot plus z dot.

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:36.130
So this piece comes
from this and this.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:42.840
And this piece should-- this
one here, it better be this.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.650
Well this is--
let's figure it out.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:49.140
This is omega in
the k hat direction,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:59.520
cross and rba is r
r hat plus z k hat.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.610
k cross k is 0.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:09.460
k cross r theta hat.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:15.530
K cross-- k hat cross r
hat is theta hat positive.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:21.770
r omega theta hat, same thing
as r theta dot theta hat.

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:25.310
So we could have just applied
this formula for the derivative

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.730
of a rotating
vector and we would

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.854
have gotten the same thing.

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:43.347
OK just ran out of boards.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.460
Now a quick little exercise
you could do on your own

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.510
is, we're going to need
to be able to calculate

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.092
the derivative of theta hat.

01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:29.800
Well just plug it in
that little formula.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:41.250
And the first term you'll find
out the derivative of the theta

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:48.800
hat, the length doesn't change
in time, it's a unit vector.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.920
So you only have
the second piece.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.800
So it's sum omega cross
theta and you're going

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.859
to get minus theta dot r hat.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.140
So I really want to get here.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.480
The acceleration
of b and O. That's

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.420
the real-- that's the
single piece we really

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.210
need to finish the kinematics.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.080
So we can do most any problems.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.100
Got to be able to describe
the acceleration of a point

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.770
and translating rotating frame.

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:41.960
And that's going to be the
acceleration of a with respect

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:53.970
to O, plus a time derivative of
the velocity of b with respect

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:55.250
to O.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.790
We've calculated
the velocity, we

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:05.300
need to be able to essentially
carry out this derivative.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:10.250
Two time derivatives of the
r, b, a, or a single time

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:12.870
derivative of bva.

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:18.150
Well we just
computed the velocity

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:20.310
in this-- of this
rotating frame and this

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.150
is our final expression.

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.860
So we need to compute the
time derivative of that.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:32.650
I just-- so it's
going to look like r

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:43.520
dot r hat plus over here a
term r theta dot theta hat

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:50.250
and pardon me for
doing this I think

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.740
it'll be cleaner in the end.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.180
I'm going to start with my
z dot k, keep it over here,

01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:01.500
plus r dot r hat plus this term.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.500
And this is going to
take up a lot room.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.600
Just spread out this way so it--

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.410
So let's just-- I'm going to
write down where this comes

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.860
out, this is a little
tedious, but then you'll

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.190
have seen it once hopefully
believe that it really works.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.350
So these terms, this
first term here just

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:36.650
gives you z double dot.

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:37.770
So let's write her down.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:44.870
So just z double dot k hat
time derivative of this,

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:50.780
plus an r double
dot r hat, but now I

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.740
have to take-- do it, flip it
and do the other side of it.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:07:05.460
So I get my-- how do
I want to do this?

01:07:15.909 --> 01:07:16.659
Yeah, I like this.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:29.826
So this term kept--
leads to this.

01:07:29.826 --> 01:07:35.270
This term brings you to here.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:50.410
This term, you get r dot times
theta dot theta hat plus an r

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:56.660
and now you need to take a time
derivative of theta dot theta

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.550
hat.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:07:59.810
So that's going to expand.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:02.080
So this brings you to here.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.399
Now we've done this derivative,
so we can put it in.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:59.930
So this gives us
this term over here,

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:01.449
so let's keep adding these up.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.319
Notice this gives me an r
dot theta dot theta hat.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:20.399
This gives me an r dot
theta dot theta hat.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.330
Two identical terms.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:38.649
Now this term gives me an r
theta double dot theta hat.

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:40.340
And now this-- now
we need to take

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.020
the derivative of theta
hat and that gives you

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.515
minus theta dot r hat.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:59.980
So you get a minus r but
multiplied by theta dot again

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.220
squared r hat.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.820
So I think we're about there.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.820
We're going to start
collecting things together.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:30.930
Now we have a two
r dot theta dot

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:46.750
theta hat plus an r theta double
dot theta hat, minus r theta

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.780
dot squared r half.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.880
So these things,
these derivatives,

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.730
just all kind of flowed
down and led to more terms.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:06.140
But now if we compare-- that
we get one, two, three, four,

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.960
five, I clump these together.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.250
This is the change in
length of the r vector.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.500
Stretch in the position has a
z component and a r component.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.630
This is the movement of the
coordinate system if it moves.

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:26.900
This is the Coriolis term.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:30.470
This is the Euler
acceleration and this is

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.350
the centripetal acceleration.

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:36.040
So this is the--
what happens when

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.700
you start with that
messy vector thing

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:47.320
and apply it, restrict it to a
cylindrical coordinate problem,

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.400
which is basically
planar motion.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.470
But you allow some things
in the z direction only.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:58.090
So polar coordinates is a
more limited form of that,

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.290
but it's-- every
term comes back,

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.270
every term is still in it.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:07.950
So acceleration of
the moving coordinate

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:11.080
system, change of the
length of the position

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.580
vector in the moving
coordinate system,

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:19.610
the Coriolis term the Euler
acceleration term that angular

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:25.490
acceleration speedup and
finally the centripetal term.

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:29.030
Now the way you go
about solving problems,

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:32.490
usins-- doing problems
in polar coordinates.

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:36.110
So now you're asked to
find an equation of motion.

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:40.560
This is an expression
for the acceleration

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.770
of whatever it is you're
trying to describe

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:46.370
in an inertial frame.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:51.690
So that when you say-- you
can now say f equals ma.

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.700
If you know the--
sometimes you're

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.550
given the forces in
problems and your asked

01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:59.370
to find the accelerations.

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.140
But what if you're
given the acceleration

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.610
and you're asked
to find the force?

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:06.566
All right, I give you the
simplest problem of this kind.

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.030
What's the tension
in the string?

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:17.517
Well if I know
that-- so I just say,

01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:19.850
the way you do these problems
is how many things can you

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:20.480
eliminate?

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.710
Well I wasn't moving,
this term goes away.

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:23.930
That's zero.

01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:26.370
Z wasn't involved,
it's not changing,

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:30.259
it's just constant angular
rotation, that term is 0.

01:13:30.259 --> 01:13:32.300
What's the change in length
of the string while I

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.660
was doing it?

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.410
Now if that term's 0 we're
getting easier all time.

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:41.860
How far-- how fast was
the length getting longer?

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.180
That terms gone away.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.432
Was I speeding up, or slowing
down, or constant speed?

01:13:46.432 --> 01:13:47.890
Well we'll say it's
constant speed,

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.060
ooh this problem's getting
easier all the time.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.930
I'm down to one term.

01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:53.090
f equals ma.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:10.960
Minus r theta dot squared r hat.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.750
So the force that I must have
been applying to the string

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:18.690
was in the minus r
hat direction and had

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:22.380
magnitude mr omega squared.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.010
So that's actually
all there is to it.

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.830
We're using polar coordinates
and cylindrical coordinates

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:33.210
to do second law problems.

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:35.410
So there's a couple of
problems that you're

01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:37.770
doing these kind of
things on the homework

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:40.430
set that's being put out today.

01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:44.330
So give them a try.

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:45.827
Have a good weekend.
