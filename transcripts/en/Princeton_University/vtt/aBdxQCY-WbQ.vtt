00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
        
              

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.190
        JULIAN ZELIZER: Johnson, as
        we've studied, was a creature      

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.760
        of Congress.
              

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.700
        He was a man who
        loved Congress.      

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.440
        He loved legislating.
              

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.880
        And he defined his legacy very
        much by what he could you get      

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.270
        Congress to do.
              

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.480
        I will go into class, and
        sometimes I will have a      

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.430
        perspective that I've had
        in my head on a subject.      

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.500
        And I've had many moments when
        students have changed that.      

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.650
        They've just seen the argument
        very differently, and they've      

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.800
        challenged me.
              

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.390
        JACK MARZULI: Professor
        Zelizer is very      

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.380
        connected to politics.
              

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.620
        And before I even started
        taking the      

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.770
        class, I Googled him.
              

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.750
        And you immediately get 10s
        and 10s of hits of him in      

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.410
        relevant modern political
        contexts.      

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830
        EMILY CARTER: Five years ago,
        I decided I was going to my      

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.710
        entire research program
        to work on      

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.400
        problems related to energy.
              

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.780
        I felt that my expertise in
        developing and applying      

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.980
        quantum mechanics-based methods
        could, in fact, be      

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.470
        reoriented to the planet to
        a sustainable future.      

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.920
        There has to be a huge effort in
        research into moving onto a      

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.830
        sustainable path.
              

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.570
        There's an amazing number
        of opportunities for      

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.540
        undergraduate research in energy
        and the environment.      

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.430
        I'm researching magnesium
        batteries.      

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.800
        They are an alternative to
        lithium ion batteries.      

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.650
        There's so much more magnesium,
        it's about four      

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.880
        times more abundant than lithium
        in the Earth's crust.      

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.190
        All right, great.
              

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.250
        
              

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.640
        JEFF NUNOKAWA: My role at
        Rockefeller college is to be      

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.670
        incredibly lucky recipient of
        some of the best intellectual      

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.850
        energy and social joy
        that I've ever been      

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.860
        in the midst of.
              

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.770
        We have students who are
        extraordinarily acute and      

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.270
        generous socially.
              

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.290
        We have students who are
        extraordinarily acute and      

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.920
        generous in more measurable,
        intellectual ways.      

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.000
        I like teaching Victorian
        literature because I think it      

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.270
        helps us understand a little
        bit about how much our      

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.760
        inexhaustible faith in the idea
        of romance, how rooted      

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.110
        this is in the novels of
        an earlier century.
