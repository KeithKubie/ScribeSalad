ROB PASKOWSKI: Well, thanks
everyone for coming today.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.310
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.550
My name is Rob Paskowski, and
I'm on the Google benefits team

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.780
here in Sunnyvale, California.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.780
And I focus on managing our
Google US health care strategy.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.280
The team sponsoring
this event asked

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.000
me to speak because of my
experience as a benefits

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
professional, as a leader in
the Google People Operations,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.620
but also, being a dad
and being an autism dad.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.140
So a father to nine-year-old
son with autism.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.300
So you see, my journey
as a People Operations

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.800
guy, a benefits
professional, really

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.550
did change in 2009 when my
son was diagnosed with autism.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.530
And quickly after the shock
and everything that goes,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.860
the emotions that go into
that, after helping my son get

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.640
the services he needed
and everything like that,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.470
I quickly realised that there
was a gap in the services

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.460
provided to parents who
have special needs children,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.970
both in therapy and benefits,
but also in leave programs.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.810
So I had set out on
a journey, and this

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.220
parallels some of
the work that Josh is

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.290
doing around parental benefits.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.740
But I set out on my own
journey at that point

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.580
to see how can we help other
special needs families deal

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.950
with this dilemma, whether
it's coverage for therapy,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.710
or leave benefits,
and things like that.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.190
So I set out on a mission
to develop an autism support

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.040
program and benefits program for
the company I was working out

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.140
at the time.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.470
And it worked, out worked
with consultants, worked

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.754
with the autism advocacy
groups, and with the insurance

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:32.545
carriers, as well to
put something together

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:34.044
that could really
work for families.

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:35.840
So we put in something
I was really, really

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
proud of, but then
realized that hey,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.420
this was just one organization.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.010
How can we really
change the culture

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.590
around how we support
parents in this little niche

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.765
around special needs?

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:48.890
And then I started working
with the advocacy groups

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.880
to do with more employers;
so get more employers

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.720
to understand,
hearing it from a dad,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.630
but also from a
benefits professional

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.956
that I could speak the
same language to them

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.580
and help them set up
their own program.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.380
So I was able to scale that
and help over a dozen companies

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.760
implement comprehensive
autism support

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.336
programs that leave benefits
to support their employees.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.169
And I have spoken at a
number of conferences

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.680
to help others just
dispel the myths

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.730
and really get the
true information out

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.890
there about how they can
really help their families.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.090
And the results have been
amazing that you just

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.450
have more loyal employees.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.220
There's a business
value to all the things

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.180
Josh is going to talk about.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.763
There's a business
value to the things

00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:27.620
that we've done in
the autism community

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.050
really to help those families.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.490
People will be loyal.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.590
They will bend over
backwards when you really

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.579
support them and support them in
taking care of their families.

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.370
I'm also proud of the
work we do at Google.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.036
So the work we do at
Google, we've been,

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:45.170
I think, one of the pioneers
on paternity and maternity

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.550
benefits.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.880
We continue to try to set the
standard not just for Googlers.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.670
But how we can set the
standard, and then others

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.850
will follow our lead to
offer similar programs

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.830
to their employees to
support their families.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.080
So it's not just about Google.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.130
It's how can we do something
really innovative and creative

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.080
here for our people that then
we can transport that out

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.420
to the world?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.410
So today, it's an honor to
introduce you to Josh Levs.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.440
And he's going to inspire
you about his story

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.690
and his amazing journey to
dispel some of those myths

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.350
about traditional
roles of moms and dads

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.800
and advocate for
what I was talking

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.350
about earlier, the
business value of offering

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.900
these types of paid maternity
benefits to employees.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.950
So without further delay,
I'd like to welcome Josh up

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.350
to the podium.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.600
JOSH LEVS: So I've prepared
all this on Google Slides,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.183
but I want to show
you guys something.

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:37.280
So I started off with
this YouTube video.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.738
But I'm going to show it to
you directly from the computer,

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.240
because one thing I need you
guys to fix about Google Slides

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.910
is that you can't avoid the ads.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.970
So I was giving this
speech in Tennessee.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.791
And I went to show
this video, and it

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.290
was a relatively
conservative crowd.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.410
And right before this video, all
of a sudden, an ad for Viagra

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.135
popped up.

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:52.887
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:54.470
-Being a dad, I just
loved this story.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.410
And thankfully, some
dads took action.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.190
Basically, what do they
want for Father's Day?

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.040
For the media to stop
portraying dads as buffoons,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.480
doofus dads, right?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.819
That's all we ever see.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.110
It's not just one or two shows.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.450
It's frankly, every show.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.154
And Josh Levs joins us now.

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:12.570
And Josh, you and
I are both dads.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.160
You've got little ones.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.270
I've got teenagers.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.810
And enough's enough, and I love
it that some dads stood up.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.980
-It's so true,
isn't It you can't

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.750
avoid the caricature of us, as
dads, as being just complete

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.961
idiots who can't understand
how to do anything.

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:25.460
-Nothing.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.740
-Often who don't know how to
take care of our children.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.360
-We're practically another kid
in the home in most TV shows.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.990
-But just so everyone knows,
this isn't a whine session.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.765
Now, what's so
interesting to me is

00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:35.640
that dads are doing
something about this now.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.650
They're standing
up and fighting,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.900
and I have some proof that
they're making a difference.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.650
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.090
We're going to start
off with an ad that

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.506
aired earlier this year that
was just obviously offensive.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.524
Take a look here.

00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:49.170
-To prove Huggies diapers and
wipes can handle anything,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.620
we put them to the toughest
test imaginable-- dads alone

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.420
with their babies in
one house for five days.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.680
-So in that ad, Huggies
said the biggest

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.740
test imaginable for diapers is
to leave kids alone with dad.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.365
-We can't handle
the diaper, right?

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:07.970
-Oh, of not.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.620
Ew, gross.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.370
They had another one
where the dads didn't

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.036
change the diapers throughout an
entire game on double overtime.

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:16.400
-So what happened here is a
bunch of dads got together.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.670
They started petitioning online.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.680
One guys started a petition.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.200
A lot of people
complained online.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.820
Huggies took it
really seriously.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.610
They jumped on it.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.401
They said whoa, this
was not what we meant.

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.640
They called one of the dads.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.260
They pulled two ads.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.090
They replaced them
with brand new ads,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.980
and here's one of the new ones.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.416
Take a look.

00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:30.916
-Awesome.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.120
-To prove Huggies wipes
can handle anything,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
we asked real dads to
put them to the test

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.786
with their own babies
on spaghetti night.

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:43.160
-Totally different
message there.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.460
We asked dads to put
them to the test,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.250
and you see this
happening elsewhere.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.260
-Dad's cooking, as well.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.160
He's cooking a meal.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.817
-Dad's feeding.

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.650
And so I started to
talk to some pop culture

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.660
analysts and some dads.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.510
And they're saying,
you know what?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.230
Little by little, we're
making a difference.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.240
We're combating this area.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.656
-And I agree with
you, and I don't

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:00.120
want to sound like the
whining dad either.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.200
And I'm OK with
poking fun at dad.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.700
-Yeah.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.470
-But it's every show.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.950
And you and I talked about
it from Homer Simpson,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.012
Peter Griffin.

00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:10.720
And those are funny,
but it's every show.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.210
And I want to get
your take on this.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.890
What concerns me
is my sons, what

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.140
do they watch on television?

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.350
-Right.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.266
-Whether it's the Disney
Channel, Nickelodeon,

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.090
or all shows, what
they're seeing--

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.940
and media's powerful--
that dad's an idiot.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.630
Dad's a doofus.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.540
I hope I'm giving
another example at home.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.890
Maybe not all the
time, but I'm trying.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.860
-And look, the best example
they're ever going to get

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.340
is from you, because they're
going to learn from you.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.590
But a lot of the dads I
talked to said the same thing.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.077
They said pop culture
does give kids messages.

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:39.660
Some boys out there
are going to think

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.496
that that's the low bar
he's expected to rise to.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:43.870
Some girls out
there will grow up

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.390
to become women who have
very low expectations for how

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.690
good fathers their
husbands will be,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.120
because we keep feeding
them all these portrayals

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.004
of these really lame,
really bad dads.

00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:54.670
And in fact, you used
a couple examples.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.253
There's a guy I talked to, runs
a blog called, "The Dadvocate"

00:06:57.253 --> 00:06:59.600
where he said, take a
look at Homer Simpson.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.782
He said the same thing
about Peter Griffin,

00:07:01.782 --> 00:07:02.740
some of these cartoons.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.040
Now, there are also
good dads on TV now.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.270
You've got different
portrayals on Modern Family.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.550
You have a stay-at-home
dad in "Up All Night."

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.990
So you can look at TV in
general and see more diversity.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.060
And some of the people I
talked to said actually,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.146
you're seeing a little bit
more change one step at a time.

00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:21.520
But what needs to happen is
more conversations like this.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.740
And there were dads out
there talking about it saying

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.484
we are not this stereotype.

00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:26.400
Stop doing that to us.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.292
-Is Ward Cleaver coming back?

00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:29.500
-You know what's interesting?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.360
Back in the day, we're good.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.240
Weren't dads great
back in the day?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.710
And then it was
just decades later

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.460
that they decided to
start skewering dads,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.190
and everybody decided to
do the exact same joke

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.190
of the doofus dad.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.680
It caught on just a little
too much to the point

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.480
that it's getting too hard
to find the good dads.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.990
-That's the complaint, yeah.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.720
Good stuff.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.870
-Listen, everyone can
check it out, cnn.com.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.270
We will hold story about this.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.895
This is up on Facebook
and Twitter too.

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.740
I hope everyone weighs in,
dads and moms across America.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.340
-Because not everybody
agrees with us.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.370
Hey, open conversation.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.627
Not everybody agrees with us.

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:00.210
-That's right.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.670
-Some will say we're whiners.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.450
We're not.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.936
Just want equal representation.

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:04.060
-But we will listen to you.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.810
-Good stuff, Josh.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.540
Thanks so much.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.890
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.348
JOSH LEVS: So here's
what happened.

00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:08.570
So I used to report on these.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.929
I was reporting on this
kind of thing at CNN.

00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:12.720
I was doing all these
stories about fathers

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.930
and representations of fathers.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.388
And any time I would do a story
like that some people would

00:08:16.388 --> 00:08:18.000
say to me, relax.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.230
TV makes fun of everybody.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.885
It's about caricature.

00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:21.010
This is what everyone does.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.390
But what people don't
understand or didn't understand

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.800
is that these negative
portrayals of dads

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.700
are a symptom of a
larger problem that

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.550
has very serious
consequences for us,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.910
and I'm going to tell you
about those consequences.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.875
One of them is this.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.008
This was my 4-pound
preemie baby.

00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:36.049
I was torn away from her.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.674
I couldn't care for
her, and I couldn't

00:08:37.674 --> 00:08:39.445
be home with my very sick wife.

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.820
I'm going to tell
you that story.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.832
This is another symptom
of the same problem.

00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:43.494
There's this.

00:08:43.494 --> 00:08:45.220
This is what's
happening with women

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.140
in the workforce
in this country.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.040
So what you have is the
more red, the more women.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.754
So at the beginning
of the board, what's

00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:53.170
the lowest one for
the work force,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.847
upon entering the work
force, women are almost 50%--

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.180
assuming they're going to be
a little bit more than 50%.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.220
As you go off the higher ranks,
women start to disappear.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.320
This is the S&amp;P 500.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.410
Less than 5% of
the CEOs are women.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.810
This is another symptom
of that same problem.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.060
But the worst symptom that
we have of all is this.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.960
We are the only developed
country that pulls babies away

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.560
from parents right away,
that doesn't make sure

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.880
that there's some kind of
net so that after a birth,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.680
a parent can be
home with the baby

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.149
and put food on the table for
at least a block of weeks.

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:24.690
We're the only nation
that does this.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.820
Now, I have had reason
to learn about this.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.690
And I learned some
of it the hard way.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.320
But take a look at this map.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.330
So the map here, the
countries in red-- I

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.967
say countries, even
though it's really

00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:40.726
just us and two tiny little
ones, Suriname and Papua New

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:41.830
Guinea, tiny islands.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.090
The countries in
red are the ones

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.985
that don't have paid
maternity leave programmed.

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:48.610
We hear a lot of
complaints about this,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.050
but no one ever talks about why.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.758
No one ever explains
where it comes from.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.060
Well, it all comes from the
exact same place as those ads.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.750
It comes from the "Mad Men" era.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.780
This is when our new
work culture was created.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.360
We were coming out of the war.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.260
We were creating
this new economy,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.600
and this new economy was
built on work life balance.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.136
And the balance was that men
stay at work all the time,

00:10:09.136 --> 00:10:10.796
and women stay
home all the time.

00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:12.960
It was this very
strict, genuine way

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.210
for making a new work culture.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.960
And a lot of us think that the
country has come a long way,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.220
but it actually hasn't.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.260
Our work structures were
built entirely in that era.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.670
So what you have
all over the nation

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.069
are people who are still
running companies, who still

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:28.360
believe that that's what it is.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.800
It's ingrained in us,
because it's been there now

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.720
for a few generations.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.850
And we don't think
twice about it.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.900
I have learned about this.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.690
I've been covering this
throughout my career.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.463
I started at NPR.

00:10:39.463 --> 00:10:41.046
This is major little
background on me.

00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:41.780
I've covered big businesses.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.400
I've covered around the world.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.090
So this was me doing
fact checking on CNN.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.700
And so what happened was when
I started wearing my glasses,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.826
more and more people
started taking me seriously.

00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:52.950
So I got more and more
chance-- it's so ridiculous.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.970
I started doing more chances
to do fact checking on CNN.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.290
This is TV news for you.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.889
So all these politicians
from all sides.

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:03.180
And the pundits would literally
say whatever they want,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.406
anything; whatever they want.

00:11:04.406 --> 00:11:07.030
And they would get away with it,
and no one would correct them.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.032
And that was a huge problem.

00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:10.240
So I was like, wait a second.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.930
Can we just start fact
checking these things?

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.596
So I started fact
checking these things.

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:15.680
And then I ended
up applying that

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.940
to the other, more
important part of my life.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.030
This is my career.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.760
But who I really am, in
a bigger way, is a dad.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.760
That's number one to me.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.780
And becoming a father,
becoming a parent,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.180
it's always usually dramatic.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.220
But in my case, it was
exceptionally dramatic,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.920
in our case, because in
every one of our births,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.090
we've had a wild story.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.710
This is my son; my first son.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.690
When he was two days
old, we found out

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.590
that he had a heart defect,
but a very serious heart defect

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.640
at that.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.110
And so at seven days, this
is what he looked like.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.472
And I share this picture
because yes, it's horrifying,

00:11:48.472 --> 00:11:49.430
and it was a nightmare.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.890
But this is also
beautiful, because this

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.480
is a story of humanity.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.750
We adapt to survive.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.830
This is what we do.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.730
This is why I care so much
about coming to businesses

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.010
like Google, because
this spirit of innovation

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.010
is how we come up
with stuff like this.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.461
It's how we fix things.

00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:06.710
It's also why I never listen
to cynics, because cynics

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.340
are the ones who
would say oh, we'll

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.690
never find a way to fix a tiny
little valve in a baby's heart.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.870
Innovation, to
me, is everything.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.790
And here is my kid a year later.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.600
They fixed it.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.469
So I'm constantly
reminded of how important

00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:20.760
it is to innovate, because
that's that human spark that

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.044
makes us who we are.

00:12:22.044 --> 00:12:23.210
So that was baby number one.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.620
Then with baby number
two we thought OK.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.762
This time, we'll have
relatively drama free birth.

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:27.720
But that didn't happen.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.760
So this time, my
wife and the baby

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.300
conspired to skip
labor altogether.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.500
She was three weeks
before her due date.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.440
She fell to the floor and
couldn't say anything.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.510
And suddenly, stuff started
coming out into my hands.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.280
And then I saw his head,
but his eyes were closed,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.600
and he wasn't moving.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.720
And then I saw his neck
and the umbilical cord

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.950
was wrapped around
his neck five times.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.920
And then he entirely
came out into my hand.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.336
Now, he turned out
perfectly, too.

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:55.340
Everything worked great.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.214
I'm going to share with
you all a little clip

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.690
from my 9-1-1 call that day.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.980
I did this story more
than a year later,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.160
when I felt ready that
I could handle it.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.275
Here goes.

00:13:05.275 --> 00:13:08.005
This is where I had a segment
with my colleague, Sanjay

00:13:08.005 --> 00:13:08.060
Gupta.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.190
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.170
- --four hours of labor,
which are standard.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.628
With this one, all
of a sudden, she

00:13:11.628 --> 00:13:13.810
felt something, bent
over by the bed,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.650
was feeling something
even more powerful,

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.570
got down on the floor.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:16.810
Boom.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.130
Within a couple of minutes.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.639
-So no contractions beforehand?

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.180
Because she knows
what it feels like.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.712
-She knows all the
steps very well,

00:13:22.712 --> 00:13:24.420
and she knows what
the feelings would be.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.180
This is incredibly unusual,
but it happened to her.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.160
So she's down on the floor
and says, call an ambulance.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.369
I get on the phone with 9/11.

00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:32.951
Here's a little clip
at what happened.

00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:33.596
-What do I do?

00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:34.720
I'm holding my baby's head.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.220
-OK, listen.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.910
I want you to support
the shoulders.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.410
-OK.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.261
-And hold the hips
and legs firmly.

00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:39.760
-OK.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.670
-And remember, the baby will be
slippery, so don't drop it, OK?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.270
-OK.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.960
-So is the baby completely
out, or just the head?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.830
-No, just the head.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:46.663
I'm seeing the head.

00:13:46.663 --> 00:13:47.727
It's all scrunched up.

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:48.560
But it's not crying.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.610
It's not making noise.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.930
Its eyes are shut.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.430
-OK.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.540
Have her to push hard
and get the baby out, OK?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.480
-Got to push hard,
get the baby out.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.479
Push hard, push hard.

00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:56.770
Oh my god, I'm holding my baby!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.700
It's an umbilical cord,
and there's something

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.350
wrapped around its neck.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.100
I'm taking it off.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.730
-OK, listen.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.667
Gently wipe the baby's
mouth and nose--

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:03.250
-It's choking.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.450
It's choking on the chord.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.284
Breathe baby, breathe.

00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:07.200
Breathe baby, breathe.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.241
I'm taking the chord off.

00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:10.751
-Let me give you a CPR
specialist for the baby, OK?

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:11.250
-OK.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:11.880
The baby's breathing.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.930
-Is the baby breathing?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.846
-Yeah, it's breathing.

00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:14.755
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:15.921
JOSH LEVS: So it worked out.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:18.114
And you can see in there
that there were 84 seconds

00:14:18.114 --> 00:14:18.780
that we skipped.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.010
So there was a while
before we could

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.280
see that he was breathing.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.589
This also gave me
a new commitment

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:26.380
to and appreciation
for being a journalist,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.710
because it was just so
random that I knew something.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.876
What I didn't plan there
was that the 9-1-1 operator

00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:33.750
was telling me to tie off his
umbilical cord with a shoe

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.699
lace.

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.490
And I just happened to
know that you're not

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.002
supposed to do that until you
can see the baby's breathing.

00:14:39.002 --> 00:14:40.460
So I always keep
in mind, you never

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.570
know what random fact
might actually help you.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.510
And that was because my
nephew had a traumatic birth.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.260
And they thought he
wasn't going to make it.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.060
But he did, because he
was still getting oxygen

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.060
from the umbilical cord.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.010
So anyway, all of this,
what it did was it

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.610
helped drill into
me my real values

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.720
in this life, that family
is number one; that this

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.690
is everything to me, that this
is always going to be the most

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.911
important part of who I am.

00:15:00.911 --> 00:15:02.660
And especially after
my second son's birth

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.862
I stopped overworking,
and I started

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.070
really looking for a work-life
balance, and work life

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.320
integration, and the
right way to live,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.060
and the right way to make
sure that I was there

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.810
for all the moments.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.726
Because in that moment
when he was being born,

00:15:12.726 --> 00:15:14.570
it was so obvious to
me that nothing else

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.540
matters except family, when
that's how you live your life.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.874
So after this, I started
talking to other dads

00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:25.290
about what they
were going through

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.470
and what their experiences were.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.845
And this was also
around the time

00:15:27.845 --> 00:15:30.585
after the financial crisis,
when the economy fell apart.

00:15:30.585 --> 00:15:33.020
I like to call it a
financial fiasco, actually.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.700
So I was interviewing
groups of dads.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.279
And when Father's Day
came around in 2009

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.820
it seemed like the
most obvious thing

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.050
to me, to do a bunch of
segment talking to dads.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.810
And we talked about everything.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.531
We talked about our
financial stresses,

00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:47.030
what we want for our kids, our
positions on gender equality,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.422
what we want in our careers.

00:15:48.422 --> 00:15:50.380
And the responses that
we got to these segments

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.940
were out of proportion.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.740
They were huge.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.780
People were calling us, and
writing us, and e-mailing.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.530
And I started getting calls
from other media wanting

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.149
to interview me about being a
dad in the media who interviews

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:03.190
dads, because no one had
seen anything like this.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.650
And this forced me to
realize that no one had ever

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.660
seen real dads, that
stereotypes still ruled the day.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.040
So seeing dads talk about actual
issues that we care about.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.690
It was just a new
idea to most people.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.148
All these parenting
segments on air

00:16:16.148 --> 00:16:17.980
had been about women;
maybe one token dad,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.090
maybe one token
stay-at-home dad.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.322
But having a group of dads
really open up was a new idea.

00:16:23.322 --> 00:16:25.780
So I made that a part of what
I did, and I started covering

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.696
fatherhood a lot more.

00:16:26.696 --> 00:16:28.050
And then we thought, OK.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.850
When my wife was pregnant
with baby number we were like,

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.850
this is going to be it.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.690
Third time's a
charm, drama free.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.262
And instead, she and I ended up
on the front page of "The New

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:38.470
York Times" business section.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.722
So here's what happened there.

00:16:39.722 --> 00:16:41.180
My wife was pregnant,
and we looked

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.971
at things that were
going on in our family.

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:47.480
And we knew that because of her
health and a business, a work

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.855
opportunity she
had, that I would

00:16:48.855 --> 00:16:50.521
be needed at home to
do some care giving

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:51.770
after the baby's birth.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.190
Now, to all modern couples,
that is a completely

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.717
normal and legitimate concept.

00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:58.300
There's nothing strange about
it and nothing unusual about it.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.620
More and more men are taking
time to care for our kids.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.710
Unfortunately, corporate America
has not kept up with this idea.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.760
So I was under this
incredibly weird policy

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.630
at CNN under which
anyone can get 10 paid

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.750
weeks to care for their
new baby except a man

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.290
who impregnated his own wife.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.550
So it's as weird as it sounds.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.798
So I give up my
daughter for adoption,

00:17:19.798 --> 00:17:21.589
and another guy at the
company adopted her,

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.599
he would get 10 paid weeks.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.710
If we used a surrogate, I
could get 10 paid weeks.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.510
If I had a same sex
domestic partner

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.830
and he adopted a baby but
I did not adopt his baby,

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.820
so I'm not a
co-adoptive parent, I

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.700
could still get 10 paid
weeks to care for his baby.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.440
But I, the real me-- I
couldn't get this time

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.320
to care for my baby.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.100
So I went to the benefits
department in advance.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.250
And I was like look, this
was definitely an oversight.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.580
There's no way
you intended this.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.413
There's no way you meant
for this to happen.

00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:49.470
It's not even possible.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.590
But they wouldn't
give me an answer.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.916
And months went by, no answer.

00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:53.290
And then, because
it's my family,

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.860
and we can't have
a normal birth,

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.290
my wife went in for her
35 week appointment.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.720
And she had very scary, serious
symptoms from preeclampsia,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.820
which even in 2015, if
preeclampsia becomes eclampsia,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.530
it's deadly.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.030
It's scary.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.367
So anyway, they had to induce.

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:09.700
So while we're in the hospital
room, I'm messaging work.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.640
Like hey, am I going to
get the 10 weeks or not?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.620
Because a dad like me
could only get two weeks.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.310
We were the exception.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.060
And they wouldn't
give me an answer.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.750
So 11 days later, I'm home,
holding my 4-pound premie,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.970
and taking care of my
sick wife and my two boys,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.812
and messaging work.

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.270
Am I going back to
work now or not?

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.710
And that's when they said no.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.960
That's when they said no,
you cannot have this policy.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.760
No explanation,
just straight up no.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.760
So the rest of the
story's in the book,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.560
but I'm going to tell
you all two things

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.040
that I want you
to know right now.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.110
Oh by the way, so this is
"The New York Times" story.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.620
Take a look at this though.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.000
It's funny.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.230
So I don't really like
that picture of me,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.620
because I look so angry.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.952
I look very pensive and angry.

00:18:42.952 --> 00:18:43.660
But look at this.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.360
They drew this picture.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.820
And this is a Mac computer,
so I forget how you scroll.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.361
Take a look at the
picture they drew.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:50.910
I think that's hilarious.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.100
To me, that's a much better
summary of the situation

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.810
that I was going-- go home.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.190
So that's "The New
York Times" take on it.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.900
So there are two
things that I want you

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.117
to know about what happened.

00:19:02.117 --> 00:19:04.200
And by the way, you can
see how cute she's gotten.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.470
There she is recently with me.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.680
So anyway, this was an updated
story that they did recently.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.070
So two things I want you to
know about what happened.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.410
One is that when we
took this legal action

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.640
against the policy, filing
a charge with the Equal

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.306
Employment Opportunity
Commission, which

00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:22.460
is the EEOC, the responses
that came in blew us away,

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.034
blew me away.

00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:23.950
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.544
The responses were
wild, and they

00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:27.835
came in from men's groups
and women's groups, mom blogs

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.909
and dad blogs, from
conservatives and liberals,

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:32.200
from across the racial
spectrum, the economic spectrum,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.550
from people across the country.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.860
So it was like I unleashed
the floodgates of love,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.804
all these people
saying, we support you.

00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:40.470
So as a journalist,
I became fascinated.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.346
Why do people care about
my family's little--

00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:44.761
I figured there would be some
coverage, but not like that.

00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:46.946
It was huge. "The Today
Show" was talking about us.

00:19:46.946 --> 00:19:48.820
And so I started digging
into these policies.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.200
What is it about
our situation that's

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.460
galvanizing so many people?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.668
And that's when I came to
understand that we are all,

00:19:53.668 --> 00:19:57.859
all in, that everyone who wants
to change the system so we have

00:19:57.859 --> 00:19:59.650
real gender equality
in America, that we're

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.430
all in the same boat.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.800
There's no gender
war on this stuff.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.190
We're not fighting
with each other.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.773
We're all up against
these structures,

00:20:04.773 --> 00:20:07.920
these backward structures that
are holding all of us back.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.000
So that's what I
explore in here.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.270
And this is what I focus on;
laws, workplace policies,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.910
and stigmas.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.920
These are the three
categories of things

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.160
that need to be fixed.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.620
We have these laws that
stick us in the past.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.680
We have workplace
policies in many places--

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.190
fortunately not here,
as we'll talk about--

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.356
but in many places around
the country that are still

00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:29.560
acting as gender police,
pushing women to stay home,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.647
pushing men to stay at
work, taking options away.

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.230
And the biggest
problem we have of all

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.610
is stigmas, the
stigmas that are more

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.870
powerful than anything else.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.950
Even if you change
the laws, even

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.550
if you change the
policies, you still

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.030
can't end up fixing anything
unless you fix the stigmas.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.824
Now, let's get to
some good news.

00:20:45.824 --> 00:20:47.490
There are a lot of
companies, especially

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.510
out here, in this part of the
country, that are doing really

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.301
well, that have a
policy, and you know this

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:53.670
very well-- that
have policies that

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:58.360
are allowing for men and women
to have time to do care giving.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.540
And that's really important.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.602
In fact, Google, you
can see right there,

00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:04.310
in the center of that
image, was recently

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.460
named-- this is the new
website called "Fatherly."

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.360
These guys are great.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.230
They've written about my book.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.600
I've done some pieces for them.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.190
They wrote "The 50 Best
Places to Work For New Dads."

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.740
He's Google, at number one.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.275
So what we're seeing
is-- especially

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.900
out in this part of the country,
especially in the tech sector,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.941
in Silicon Valley-- and
you can see some of these

00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:22.080
are also more
traditional businesses.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.390
But especially out here, in the
valley, in this whole region,

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.850
we have a world.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.510
We have a set up
in which people are

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.790
able to take time,
whether men or women,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.580
to care for the
children, or if there's

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.010
another kind of care giving.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.570
But we don't have that in
the rest of the country.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.030
This way of thinking
has not caught

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.970
on in the rest of the country.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.530
So we have that problem.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.531
And then we also have the
problem with our laws.

00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:46.030
Now, I mentioned
earlier that we are

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.570
the only country that doesn't
have any paid maternity leave.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.230
But no one ever talks about why.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.680
When I came to understand this,
suddenly I understood why.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.630
The reason we don't have
this is so obvious to me now.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.430
It's that our work culture is
based on that old mentality.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.810
So why would we possibly
need to pay women?

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:02.414
She's a woman.

00:22:02.414 --> 00:22:03.580
She's supposed to stay home.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.600
Who needs her money?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.414
That's the thinking
behind all of it.

00:22:06.414 --> 00:22:08.080
And the thinking for
men is why would he

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.660
possibly need paternity leave?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.290
He's a man.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.350
His role is to stay at work.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.481
It's easy to think that we've
come a long way, as a nation.

00:22:15.481 --> 00:22:17.980
But then there was an article
recently in "The Miami Herald"

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.580
in which they interviewed
a bunch of CEOs.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.120
And they asked people just about
the concept of paternity leave.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.220
It was just a
straight up question.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.969
What are your thoughts
on paternity leave?

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:27.105
And several CEOs said
it should never exist.

00:22:27.105 --> 00:22:28.980
And one of them said,
no only if the woman is

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.580
physically incapacitated, which
brings us to the next part.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.700
So we got the laws
and the policies.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.920
But by far, the biggest problem
that we have are the stigmas.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.490
Men are punished
in the workplace,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.948
in all these
traditional workplace.

00:22:41.948 --> 00:22:43.474
It happens a lot
for taking time off

00:22:43.474 --> 00:22:44.640
for any kind of care giving.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.960
And the stories that I have from
these guys are heartbreaking,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.293
and you'll see them in the book.

00:22:48.293 --> 00:22:50.280
It's wild what
they've gone through.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.710
This one man was
refused the time

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.714
that he's legally entitled
to because his boss told him,

00:22:55.714 --> 00:22:57.630
women are supposed to
take care of the babies,

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.390
unless they're in
a coma or dead.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.544
That's what his boss said.

00:23:00.544 --> 00:23:02.960
Another thing I have in the
book was I got a call at work.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.982
His wife was really scared.

00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:06.190
They were both really scared.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.564
The placenta had
stopped working.

00:23:07.564 --> 00:23:08.540
She was at 37 weeks.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.540
The baby wasn't moving.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.270
They needed to
induce right away.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.170
By the way, if anybody watching
this is pregnant, don't worry.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.640
This is all very, very unusual.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.400
It's not going to happen to you.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.802
But extremely-- all of it,
it's a lot of horror stories

00:23:18.802 --> 00:23:19.760
that I've had to learn.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.950
So anyway, so he got this
call, and he ran out.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.680
He just missed the
rest of that day

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.971
and then the rest of that week.

00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:26.654
So he just missed
two days after that,

00:23:26.654 --> 00:23:27.820
came back to work on Monday.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.770
His boss called him
in and rebuked him.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.575
How dare you take
off so much time?

00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:33.460
Don't you know you're
needed around here?

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.661
And that boss was a pregnant
woman, which surprised me

00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:38.910
when I first heard it and
surprises some other people,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.576
but it does not
surprise the lawyers who

00:23:40.576 --> 00:23:43.520
are leading this fight,
because these lawyers know

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.836
that there are gender police
who are men and women.

00:23:45.836 --> 00:23:48.460
And the thinking for some women
who are acting as gender police

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.420
is well, wait a second.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.940
I'm a woman, so
I'll take time off.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.560
But you're a man.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.726
Why would you need time off?

00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:54.154
You're supposed to stay home!

00:23:54.154 --> 00:23:55.070
That's the whole idea.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.950
That's what men do.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.440
So these are the kinds of things
that I talk about in here.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.106
But I said earlier,
there are two things

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.589
I want you to know about how
I took on this legal action.

00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:04.380
That was the first.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.670
The second is that as
a result, the company

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.560
revolutionized its policy and
made it much, much better.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.640
I knew that I was fighting
for a better business.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.980
I knew that a better policy--
because I'd been covering this,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.680
and I'd been covering
economies around the world.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.596
I knew how this works.

00:24:17.596 --> 00:24:19.261
I knew that it's
better for businesses

00:24:19.261 --> 00:24:20.260
to have better policies.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.926
You attract and retain
better employees,

00:24:21.926 --> 00:24:23.120
as you very well know.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.640
It helps you compete.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.540
The company, if
you ask them, they

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.030
will tell you that the change
they made to the policy,

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.370
it was a win-win, that it
worked really well for them.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.954
There was so much
coverage in my case.

00:24:32.954 --> 00:24:34.161
People were talking about it.

00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:36.040
The company obviously
heard the rallying cry.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.206
And they said, we've got
to do something about this.

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.530
So now, men and
women get more time,

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.620
as a result of the change.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.200
What they did was
before, a dad like

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.366
me could only get two weeks.

00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:46.680
Now, a dad like me can
get six paid weeks.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.240
Women now get paid
their six weeks

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.770
for care giving on
top of their time

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.360
for physical recovery, which
is what businesses are supposed

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.943
to do, according to
federal guideline,

00:24:55.943 --> 00:24:58.530
separate physical recovery
time from care giving time.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.570
So women are getting
the six weeks

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.490
of care giving leave,
plus six or eight weeks,

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.364
depending on the kind
of birth that they had.

00:25:03.364 --> 00:25:04.980
So the company now
has a better policy

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.390
that's paid off for
just about everybody.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.900
But while we are
seeing these changes,

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.390
we're not seeing enough of them.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.090
And there are two big ways
that we need to fix this.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.762
One is we need to do
something about the lies,

00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:20.970
because as long as people
believe that dads are lazy,

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.700
that dads don't do anything,
that dads aren't helping

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.991
with their families, people
who believe that will never

00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:27.590
support paternity leave,
will never support equality.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.750
Unfortunately my
industry, journalism,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.010
keeps blowing it all the time.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.260
And this is a perfect example.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.400
So Pew Research has messed
up a lot of stuff on this.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.650
But in my industry, I've
spent 10 years at NPR,

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.669
10 years at CNN,
everyone goes by Pew,

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:40.710
no matter what they said.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.760
So this is an example.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.050
Pew Research wrote this.
"Another Gender Gap-- Men

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.720
Spend More Time in
Leisure Activities."

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.201
And then, as a
result of that, you

00:25:47.201 --> 00:25:48.950
have all of these not
obnoxious headlines.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.360
The leisure gap-- why
women are losing their time

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.162
to just chill out.

00:25:52.162 --> 00:25:53.870
Men have more time
for fun than women do.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:54.980
And this is the
worst one of all.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.040
I found this from "Time."

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.270
The moral of the
story, whether it's

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.644
the week day or
the weekend, dads

00:25:58.644 --> 00:26:01.380
need to spend less time on the
golf course and watching TV,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.670
and more time helping their
wives take out the trash

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.620
and play with the kids; those
naughty, lazy, lame dads.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.290
If you believed
this, you would never

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.220
ever support the idea
of a man staying home,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.469
because what's he going to do?

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:13.650
He's going to sit around
till his wife gets home.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.470
Here's what the
research actually says.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.120
Pew Research looked at something
called the American Time Use

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.619
Survey.

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:19.690
This is government data.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.590
In this survey,
dads interviewed,

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.390
they broke down what
a typical day is like.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:28.340
Dads listed 20 more minutes as
being for leisure or sports.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.790
What Pew did not mention is
that moms listed 20 more minutes

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.100
as being for sleep.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.242
What we actually have
is an incredible parity.

00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:38.450
We've achieved a kind of a
egalitarianism in the home

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.920
that no one realizes
we have, because there

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920
are all these obnoxious
headlines out there that

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.930
make people think that
this is about gender war.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.840
It makes people think that if
the men would just stay up,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.923
everything would be fixed.

00:26:46.923 --> 00:26:49.480
But the men and the women
today are all in this together,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.550
and this is the reality.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.140
Unfortunately, I've tried.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.780
I tried to get
Per to correct it.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.180
I've contacted news agencies
that wrote these headlines.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.630
And so far, it's not
getting anywhere.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.090
So this is how I feel every
time I see this pop up again.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.030
I love gifs, by the way.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.960
So I explain in the
book, and I want

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.950
to show you this
one part that it's

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.158
really important for everyone
watching to understand.

00:27:09.158 --> 00:27:11.500
"Today's dads and
moms work equally

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.819
on behalf of their families.

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:15.235
When you combine paid work
with household chores and child

00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:17.760
care, they put in just about
the same amount of time."

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.430
And this is true in
every combination.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.880
If you have a working father and
a stay-at-home mom, a working

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.260
mom and a stay-at-home
dad, two working parents--

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.640
in every combination
you have overall,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.960
the amount of time being put
in on behalf of your family

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.217
is the same.

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:34.300
People have an equal
commitment to their families.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.957
Now, moms spend more of those
hours at home, on average.

00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:39.540
And that has to do
with these stigmas.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.340
They're the stigmas that men
are facing in the workplace,

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.548
and then women are facing
stigmas in both directions.

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:44.350
It's awful.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.439
Some women lose
work opportunities

00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:48.730
because they have bosses who
think they should be home,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.070
because they're women.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.370
So there are many
studies that show this.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.365
If a man whose a boss has
two employees, one's a dad,

00:27:55.365 --> 00:27:57.740
one's a mom, and there's a
really important project which

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.689
is a great opportunity, then
often he will say to the woman,

00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:01.480
no, no, no, no, no.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.330
You go home.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.070
He's got this.

00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:05.700
So women are losing out
on opportunities that way.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.300
But then women are
also getting jobs

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.760
just the way men
are when they do

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.040
have caregiving
responsibilities, which

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.090
is why it's so good to
be here because places

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.110
that are changing the culture
are what we need more of.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.720
So this is part of this.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.140
But another big thing we need
in this country and, ultimately,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.920
the best thing we
can do to fix this

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.640
is to establish laws that
make clear to everyone

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.404
that men and women
can be caregivers

00:28:28.404 --> 00:28:29.820
and that it will
benefit everyone.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.330
And the good news is that
we already have this.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.310
We're in California right now.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.850
This is one of the
places that has.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.420
Three states have
this-- paid family

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.217
leave policies, which are run
by a public system and not

00:28:40.217 --> 00:28:42.300
by individual businesses--
California, New Jersey,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.411
Rhode Island.

00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:45.410
I've looked at a lot of
policies over the years.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.360
I've covered the stimulus.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.950
I've covered so much
about businesses.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.910
I've never seen as successful
a policy in general

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.100
for businesses as this.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.490
The way it works is it
operates as an insurance policy

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.070
so people pay a tiny
little bit of their payroll

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.000
into this fund.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.690
That fund then pays you if you
need six weeks of paid family

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.696
leave, and this is not
just caring for a child.

00:29:03.696 --> 00:29:05.570
You can see the picture
I chose to use there.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.569
This is caring for an
elderly parent or a spouse

00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:09.870
or yourself after an illness.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.780
All these things are covered.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.670
And what places
have started to find

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.110
is that when they have
these public policies,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.569
women will take time off
and then so will men.

00:29:18.569 --> 00:29:20.110
And these businesses
have been forced

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.039
to see that a man can
take time off and then

00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:24.080
come back to work and be
just as good an employee

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.290
as he was before.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.236
So this new idea needs
to catch on nationally,

00:29:29.236 --> 00:29:31.110
and this is what we're
pushing for right now.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.200
I was just in New Hampshire
pushing presidential candidates

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.470
on both sides.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.470
I was in Washington having
meetings on Capitol Hill.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.901
And this is the effort
that's under way.

00:29:41.901 --> 00:29:44.150
And I'm also talking to small
businesses along the way

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.290
because, unfortunately,
there is some resistance

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.790
to getting the
public policy that we

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.876
need on a national level.

00:29:49.876 --> 00:29:51.250
Republicans in
general-- it's not

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.791
on their radar,
which is frustrating.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.950
I keep saying Republicans.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.570
This is a perfect
conservative issue.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.242
This is about a family value
and proven good for business.

00:29:59.242 --> 00:30:00.700
So why don't you
line up behind it.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.620
But because technically
it involves a tax,

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.610
I explain in here,
there are a lot

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.590
of people are concerned
about how that

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.790
will play in their districts.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.070
I'm working with
businesses in the meantime

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.900
and helping them understand
creative solutions-- things

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.122
that small businesses can do.

00:30:11.122 --> 00:30:12.830
I was just in Madison,
Wisconsin speaking

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.970
with tech entrepreneurs that
have small, small offices.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.020
But a lot of these places that
are doing creative solutions

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.400
win over their employees.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.160
A lot of employees have
told me that the number one

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.160
thing they want wasn't
some block of paid family

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.270
leave-- it was a
conversation-- to have

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.280
bosses who will say to them,
OK, we want to keep you.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.210
We value you.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.040
What can we do?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.790
How can we work together here?

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.510
When companies start to do that,
it makes all the difference

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.180
in the world.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.330
So this is some of
what I'm up to now.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.746
I'd like to share
this because I'm

00:30:40.746 --> 00:30:42.600
happy to see that the
message is spreading.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.210
That's from when I had
meetings on Capitol Hill.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.810
I'm going off to Oxford
in a couple of weeks.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.268
We're going to talk
about it there.

00:30:47.268 --> 00:30:48.664
In the top right
there, you'd see

00:30:48.664 --> 00:30:49.830
I was meeting the other day.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.150
I met the first lady of Texas.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.180
She's a Republican,
and she said to me,

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.510
these are nonpartisan issues.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.600
And it was great to
have her saying that.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.750
This is from when I
was in New Hampshire.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.960
I like to show this
picture because you

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960
can look at all
the businesses that

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.115
were sponsoring my talk
there, and so it is a sign.

00:31:03.115 --> 00:31:05.240
Businesses are ready to
have this conversation more

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.527
than people thought they were.

00:31:06.527 --> 00:31:08.860
A lot of businesses, I'm
starting consult with them now,

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.970
and they're talking to
me, and they're saying,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.360
OK, we want to
build new policies.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.943
What do we do?

00:31:11.943 --> 00:31:13.090
How do we start?

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.369
And that's exciting.

00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:15.910
And this just happened
the other day.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.201
I was pinned by the UN
He for She Movement.

00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:21.450
Now, some who will be watching
this recorded later on.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.908
Hopefully, by then,
I'll understand

00:31:22.908 --> 00:31:24.670
exactly what this means.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.290
I know that I'm supposed to help
represent this movement now.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.900
And I'm a big fan of He for She.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.566
But I'm going to find
out in a few weeks

00:31:30.566 --> 00:31:31.850
exactly how that plays out.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.995
And the fact that He for She
exists is a sign of the times.

00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:36.370
That we are the
generation of men

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.030
that were raised
by feminists who

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.910
want to advance gender equality
and make it really happen.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.230
The other thing I'm able
to do is talk to people

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.280
and talking to lawyers
now and others about how

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.850
to communicate these ideas.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.780
I know that I was in an unusual
situation with my legal case

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.760
because, yes, I had
a strong argument.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.940
But I was able to argue it.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.356
I knew how to say it because
I happen to be professionally

00:31:57.356 --> 00:31:58.330
a communicator.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.130
So I was able to turn that
into a real conversation,

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.970
and that placed pressure
on the business.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.520
So I'm talking to
groups right now

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.020
and helping them learn how to
communicate about these ideas

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.920
and how to make
this thing happen.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.340
A lot of people who work
here at Google are Gen Y,

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.510
and I have a great
quote here that is true.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.252
It speaks to what's happening
with the new workforce.

00:32:19.252 --> 00:32:20.710
This is part of
what gives me hope.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.500
Younger workers
now are expecting,

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.530
and you're seeing
when you're hiring

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.380
I'm sure, younger workers
expect to be able to have a life

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.400
outside of work, not
just caring for children,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.490
caring for anyone, and
just having a life.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.120
They might take kite
surfing twice a week.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.440
They expect the ability
to still live and not give

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.289
their entire schedules
over to the company.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:39.330
The workforce has changed.
"To attract and retain

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.240
Gen X, now Gen Y, you have to
take care of these lifestyle

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.770
needs."

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.540
That's from Cynthia
Calvert, and she

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.132
is running an agency
that works with companies

00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:48.590
to change their
policies, and she's

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.080
absolutely right about that.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.512
By the way, that picture of
Gen Y is a little too stylized.

00:32:53.512 --> 00:32:55.720
But it was the only public
domain photo I could find.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.881
So if anybody rolls their
eyes when they see that,

00:32:57.881 --> 00:32:58.380
don't worry.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.137
I did too.

00:33:00.137 --> 00:33:01.720
I like to leave
people with this idea.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.260
And then if any of you
here have questions,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.830
let me know, and if any of
you are watching afterwards,

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.038
go ahead and send them to me.

00:33:06.038 --> 00:33:08.130
I'd love to hear from
absolutely everyone.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.610
I encourage people to think
about what your first dream was

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.480
in your life, and not
an overnight dream,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.470
but your first
aspirational dream

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.520
because when people
think about this,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.936
the first thing that comes to
mind usually a lot of people

00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:24.750
tell me they want to be an
astronaut, and firefighters,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:25.750
and ballet dancers.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.560
What astronaut?

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.090
Astronaut for you?

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.300
Right.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.870
There you go.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.780
And that was my
first thought too.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.150
I was like maybe I
wanted to be a cowboy.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.220
But we're wrong.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.720
That's not what the
first dream was.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.860
We all had the same first dream.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.730
The first dream was
to be held and loved.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.770
And you see that in
the eyes of any baby.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.730
But we had that dream before
we could form memories.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:50.490
So it's primal.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:51.536
It's literally primal.

00:33:51.536 --> 00:33:52.910
It's like the
first experience we

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.820
had when we arrived
in this world

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.755
that automatic knowledge
that that's what we want.

00:33:57.755 --> 00:33:59.630
And there's a lot of
ways to experience that.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.840
It's not just about
having children.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.320
It's about having
time with friends

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.195
that you care about or
your romantic partners

00:34:04.195 --> 00:34:07.390
or whatever it is, but
ultimately making sure

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.260
that you can have
that in your life

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:16.350
however it plays out for you is,
to me, the story of humanity.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.550
So I mentioned
earlier that my son

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.645
is alive because of innovation
that innovation is everything.

00:34:22.645 --> 00:34:24.520
We're at a place that's
all about innovation.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.940
This place exists
because of innovation.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.730
To me, the positive
story of humanity

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.449
just boils down to
these two things.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.320
One, we innovate, we
adapt, and survive.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.210
And two, we love.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.960
That's what we do.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.270
That's what we are.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.270
So making sure that you
have a life in which you

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.980
can do both in which you
have work-life balance,

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.770
work-life integration,
is actually

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:45.960
the most natural thing.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.830
The whole idea of work-life
conflict is actually unnatural,

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.770
and it is forwarded by this
entire sexist structure

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.150
because the system was
designed one person here,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.980
one person there.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.854
It wasn't designed to
have one person to want

00:34:56.854 --> 00:34:58.890
to have a life in both places.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.550
So what we need to do
is listen to nature.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.915
We want to do great work,
and we want to innovate,

00:35:04.915 --> 00:35:07.580
and we want to have
that first primal dream.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.960
We want to be able to love.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.782
And to me, that's what
it is to be all in.

00:35:12.782 --> 00:35:14.990
All right, so thank you to
those of you who are here.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.031
Thank you to those of you
who are watching there.

00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:19.290
I want to end with
a happy little note.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.260
I showed you those depressing
ads at the beginning, right?

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.780
Take a look at what happened.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.650
So the most watched as of the
entire year are Super Bowl day.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:32.430
This past January
during the Super Bowl,

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.030
there were all
these pro-dad ads,

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.360
which shows that the
message is catching on.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.460
This is one of the best.

That's the way to contact me.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.620
I love to hear from everybody.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.740
And also I link
in with everyone.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.120
They say not to link
in with everyone.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.240
They say, only link in
with people you know.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.160
I don't know why they say that.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.420
I link in with
absolutely everyone.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.044
Did we link in?

00:37:09.044 --> 00:37:10.060
We linked in, right?

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:10.650
Didn't we?

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.841
Well, we need to.

00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:14.340
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
two-part question.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.490
One is, is this your
full-time thing now?

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.990
And at what point
in the journey did

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.974
you recognize this
could be-- assuming

00:37:20.974 --> 00:37:22.640
that's the answer--
the full-time thing.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.790
JOSH LEVS: Yeah, I'm now
doing this full time.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.050
Yeah it's wild what happened.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.110
My book came out
in May, and we were

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.189
hoping that it would
get some people talking.

00:37:30.189 --> 00:37:32.230
And fortunately, the
response has been incredible

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.760
just in terms of
getting invited places

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.801
to talk about this issue.

00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:36.730
People want to hear
about the issue.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.670
So, yes, I recently
officially left CNN

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.837
because I was on leave, and
it was during the book--

00:37:40.837 --> 00:37:42.753
and now I'm booked all
the way through the end

00:37:42.753 --> 00:37:43.970
of the year with events.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.010
So I'm happy to, yeah, say
I'm doing this full time.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.100
And it's working
out well so far.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.180
Now, fortunately, I get
to come places like here

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.490
and meet people this week in
San Francisco was amazing.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.320
I spoke at Twitter and
Nerd Wallet and Stanford,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.509
and I'm doing a big
conference keynote tomorrow.

00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.800
And on Friday, I'm going to GE.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800
So there's a lot
of places I want

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.970
to have these conversations.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.360
I just got back from
Austin where I was

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.490
working with Liberty Mutual.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.948
They're doing all
this great stuff.

00:38:05.948 --> 00:38:07.590
So, yes, it is.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.390
And when did I realize it.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.049
I knew it could
be an opportunity,

00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:12.840
but I didn't know until
this book came out,

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.540
and I started getting
all these invitations

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.665
that it could be full time.

00:38:15.665 --> 00:38:17.760
So I would say probably
like August, September,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.370
I started to realize that
this can go somewhere along.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.550
And the great thing
is now I travel.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.959
So I could be this
massive hypocrite.

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:27.000
Family time is important.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.960
I say, well, I
travel all the time.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.996
So I try to pack all my travel
into four days at a time,

00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:33.370
and then when I'm
home, I'm home.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.940
Because I'm not rushing off
to a job in the morning.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.650
So I'm taking the kids
to school, and I'm there,

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.566
and we're playing, and
we're doing everything.

00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:41.610
So, so far, I'm managing to
find the balance that way.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:42.750
But we'll see.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:46.800
I just also disbelieve in taking
steps forward and believing

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.100
that there will be
solid ground under me

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.470
and not worry about what
if it all falls apart.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:54.580
AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.450
JOSH LEVS: Thanks.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.490
Yeah?

00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.990
Yeah, sure.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.450
AUDIENCE: So you gave props to
the Silicon Valley companies

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.090
for leading the
way in this area.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.590
JOSH LEVS: A bunch of them.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.480
AUDIENCE: But they're also
notorious for people going

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.930
and not taking their vacations.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.550
They're just falling
off the edge.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.917
So what's the interplay
with those two things?

00:39:18.917 --> 00:39:20.250
JOSH LEVS: That is all top down.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.010
I'm glad you asked about that.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.070
One problem out here is that
people mythologize overworking.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.389
And it's important not to
mythologize overworking.

00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:29.430
Not to be like, oh, that's
such a great employee.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:30.685
He works 20 hours a day.

00:39:30.685 --> 00:39:32.310
That doesn't make
him a great employee.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.060
He might be a great
employee and overwork,

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.320
but those two things
are coincidences.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.947
And so it has to be
top down, and that's

00:39:39.947 --> 00:39:41.030
the same thing with leave.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.863
Like a lot of people
now have been asking me

00:39:42.863 --> 00:39:44.364
about Marissa Mayer
at Yahoo who has

00:39:44.364 --> 00:39:46.946
said that after she has twins,
she is going to take off, what?

00:39:46.946 --> 00:39:47.987
A couple weeks, I think.

00:39:47.987 --> 00:39:49.570
I'm keeping an eye
on Mark Zuckerberg.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.110
They have 17 paid weeks there.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.070
I hope he takes them.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.903
And a lot of people
think he probably won't.

00:39:53.903 --> 00:39:55.900
And the problem is
that it's all top down.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.610
So when policy is on
paper, it doesn't matter.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.400
What matters is what
happens in practice.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.160
So what we need is to have
leaders who take vacations

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.710
as allowed and actual
vacations, so they're not

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.840
working on their vacations.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.530
And I explain it here
that's also proven out

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.110
to be good for business
because it helps

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.210
other people have opportunity.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.085
You're nodding your head
you know about this.

00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:16.700
It's proven now that it helps
other people work their way up.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.270
There's some grandparents
in the book grandads,

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.280
who did it the old, traditional
way when they had their kids.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.950
And now, they want
to do it this way.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.310
So they are taking care of
their grandkids one or two

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.110
days a week.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.050
And they've shrunk their
work schedules because of it.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.730
And the couple from in
here explained to me

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.950
that they have now learned
what they learned decades

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.994
ago which is that when
they take those days off,

00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:37.160
they're really not working,
and when they come back,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.340
everything's fine because their
underlings were given the trust

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.620
to really get things done.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.080
It wasn't you have to call me
if anything at all comes up,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.580
and the people who work there
understand that for that day,

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.060
someone else really
is in charge.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.601
It gives other people a chance
to work their way up and learn

00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:51.390
the business.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.094
So long-winded
answer your question,

00:40:53.094 --> 00:40:54.260
but it's all about top down.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.420
We have to make this
happen top down.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.628
That's the only way to do it.

00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:57.788
Yeah, go ahead.

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:58.800
AUDIENCE: Actually, OK.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.550
JOSH LEVS: OK, I saw
you nodding your head

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.520
so maybe that-- were you
wondering about all the travel

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.880
and stuff?

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.630
You're like, yeah.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.576
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask you about that,

00:41:06.576 --> 00:41:07.380
but you answered it.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.780
JOSH LEVS: You were going
to ask me about why do I

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.290
talk about-- yeah, it's crazy.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.470
Like, here I am 3,000 miles
away from my kids, right?

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.200
And we Skype when we can.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.240
Although I was also
explaining earlier that

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.200
my kids' favorite thing is
not Skype or Facebook video.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.800
It's Google Hangout
video because I

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.520
get to put those faces on.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520
Have you guys done this.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.110
You can press buttons and make
these faces appear on you.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.210
I'm such a Google fanboy.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.722
It's good to be here.

00:41:29.722 --> 00:41:31.430
Yeah, and baby was
saying to me yesterday

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:33.080
when we were on Facebook videos.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.740
She was like funny
face, funny face.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.910
And I said, I can't do it.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.460
I'm sorry.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.184
We're not I Google
Hangout right now.

00:41:38.184 --> 00:41:40.850
So I need your Google Hangout to
create those tools for my phone

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.691
so I could do it on my phone too
and not just on my Chromebook.

00:41:43.691 --> 00:41:45.010
Go ahead.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.660
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.610
So you speak at all of
these different places.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:53.620
I'm curious what's the most
resistance you've faced

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.340
and how you've turned it around.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.230
JOSH LEVS: So the good news
is that partly because I'm

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.590
a communicator, I know how to
knock down a lot of those walls

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.670
when I get somewhere.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.169
You know, when I spoke with the
National Chamber of Commerce

00:42:07.169 --> 00:42:09.740
in New Hampshire-- a mostly
conservative organization--

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.942
traditional views on how
a lot of things work,

00:42:11.942 --> 00:42:12.900
but not so much gender.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.441
They want women to
work their way up.

00:42:14.441 --> 00:42:17.035
But the places like that get
afraid that I'm to come in

00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:19.160
and say, oh, businesses
have to pay for everything.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.046
It's all up to businesses.

00:42:21.046 --> 00:42:23.420
So I start off my talk to
explain that my grandfather was

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.836
a small business
owner that he had

00:42:24.836 --> 00:42:26.462
a tiny shop at the
edge of his driveway

00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:28.502
that I've always understood
the importance of not

00:42:28.502 --> 00:42:30.090
over-regulating
businesses, and that I

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.100
want businesses to thrive.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.600
And then they start
listening to me.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.030
The most pushback
I have ever had

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.257
is one place that I won't
name that was supposed

00:42:37.257 --> 00:42:39.340
to give a talk at, and
they told me that they had,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.400
I think, I like about
100 people signed up,

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.634
and then HR got
involved, and they

00:42:44.634 --> 00:42:47.050
wanted me to jump through all
these hoops to even show up.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.216
Like, what are going to say?

00:42:48.216 --> 00:42:50.115
What are you going to not say?

00:42:50.115 --> 00:42:51.740
And I explained I'm
not a Trojan horse.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.240
I don't go to companies to try
to blow up their own policies

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.787
from the inside.

00:42:56.787 --> 00:42:58.370
But it wasn't even
about them anymore.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.830
It was like this and this
and this and this and this,

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:01.788
and by the way, you can't
talk about your book.

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:05.370
So I said, no, look,
it's not worth it

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.120
for me to make the
trek out there.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.540
So there are places
that still have

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.270
that that are so afraid of
someone coming in and saying

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.090
anything that might in any
way make them look imperfect.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.547
But people respect
their businesses

00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:23.130
for being self-effacing and for
having conversations and being

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.850
open to new ideas.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.680
But this is a business that
is traditional and still has

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.720
backward policies.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.700
So there's that.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.210
I also wrote a piece
slamming Amazon

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.790
for having no paternity leave,
which is disgusting, one

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.984
of the many problems at
Amazon, unacceptable, no.

00:43:38.984 --> 00:43:40.650
Anyone know people
at Amazon, call them.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.810
Tell them to do
something about it.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.580
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of
like a prediction thing.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.110
If you have a crystal ball, and
you're to look forward again

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.230
at the US in 10
years, do you think

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.050
there would be a federal
mandated paternity leave?

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.230
And how long would that be?

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:58.020
JOSH LEVS: Yeah, with the paid
family leave that we need,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.700
I'm hoping within 10 years.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.580
So we've got unpaid leave 1993,
which was called the Family

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.400
Medical Leave Act.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.850
But it doesn't apply
to 40% of workers,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.240
and even 1 in 5 companies
admit they don't even fully

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.480
comply with the law.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.265
So this idea of what we need
now being paid family leave.

00:44:14.265 --> 00:44:16.140
I think you've actually
got the figure right.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.590
My hope is that within
10 years, we get it.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.420
The problem is
messaging to people

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.670
who are afraid of anything
that has the word tax in it

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.860
because even though it's
so good for everyone,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.984
it's proven in three
states, some people

00:44:28.984 --> 00:44:30.900
just won't support it
because of the word tax.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.317
The problem is that we cannot
do a state-by-state solution

00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:35.941
because most states don't have
a structure to collect the money

00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:36.691
and distribute it.

00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:39.190
Like Washington State passed
paid family leave several years

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.670
ago, but they still
don't have it,

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:41.750
because they don't
have-- I don't even

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.760
know why they passed it.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.610
They created it, but
don't have a structure.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.070
They don't have a
bureaucracy in the way

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.900
that the state works that
would take in the money

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.649
and distribute it.

00:44:48.649 --> 00:44:50.100
So we need a national policy.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.570
So my hope is that
within the next 10 years,

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.260
the Democrats are
talking about it.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.490
Almost all the Democrats
running for president right

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:59.592
now are lining up for it.

00:44:59.592 --> 00:45:01.550
But in order to get
something through Congress,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.133
it would need some
bipartisan support.

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.930
So it's just a handful
of brave Republicans

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.620
who will step
forward and say, yes.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.889
Jim Daly is in here.

00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:09.930
He's the head of Focus on
the Family, a staunchly

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.340
conservative organization.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.470
He says in here, I opposed
FMLA, Family Medical Leave Act.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.280
I'm embarrassed.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.610
We should never have
been against it.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.240
Conservatives should
have supported it.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.260
I'm open to new things.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.990
A bunch of Republicans
are in here.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.150
3/4 of Republican voters
want a paid family

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.830
leave insurance policy.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.790
So it's not really about
the general broad base.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:30.170
It's about lawmakers
who are worried

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.910
about their extreme voters in
gerrymandered districts, who

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.270
will just hear the word
tax and go the other way.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:38.074
So my hope is that in
10 years, we'll get it.

00:45:38.074 --> 00:45:40.740
And I'm enough of an optimist to
believe that, yes, in 10 years,

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.050
we will have a federal
plan that makes--

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.780
and I want to understand
the stakes here.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.870
I mean, for everything
that happened

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.078
with me-- for everything
I'm talking about-- the fact

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:50.349
that right now we are
tearing away parents

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:52.640
from their newborn children
because they can't put food

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.515
on the table without
going back to work, that

00:45:54.515 --> 00:45:55.670
is disgusting and shameful.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.650
And every day that
we wait, we're

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.030
making more families suffer.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.240
So 10 years is actually in that
respect a very, very long time.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.400
And it's depressing.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.490
But I am hopeful
that in 10 years,

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.170
we'll get there if we have to.
