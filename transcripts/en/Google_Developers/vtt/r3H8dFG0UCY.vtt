00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.730
MANO MARKS: Hi, I'm
Mano Marks.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.320
Welcome to another
edition of Google

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.430
Maps Developer Shortcuts.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.920
Today, I'm going to talk to you
about the Google Maps SDK

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.630
for iOS and using it with
storyboards, so this will be a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.530
really quick short shortcut.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.020
Storyboards, as you probably
know, are a powerful tool for

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.580
rapidly developing your
user interface for iOS

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.590
applications.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.290
Storyboards are in the latest
versions of Xcode, so we're

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.000
just going to take a
quick look at it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.100
There's a lot of people out
there think that you can't use

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.790
storyboards with the Maps SDK,
and those people are wrong.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.810
So just a quick look here--

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.680
don't have time to do a full,
like, these are storyboards,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.440
but just taking a quick look at
the storyboards here, you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.290
see we have a table view
controller, prototypes cell,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.360
which I have used to create my
segue, and the segue controls

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.340
what data gets sent
to the next view.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.600
And I simply dragged
from control--

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.940
control dragged from the
prototype cell in the table

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:51.050
view into my view controller
over here which is where I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.010
create my map.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.050
So this view controller, which
is just a standard view

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.330
controller that I dropped in
here, and then I popped in my

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.480
class, MR Map View Controller,
to load the map.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:15.540
And in MR Map View Controller,
I created an object MV.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.240
You can actually see it's a GMS
Marker Options object that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.670
gets synthesized
when it loads.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.110
And here we have, in view did
load, when that gets passed

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.400
in, that MV gets passed in, Add
Marker With Options MV.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.940
And it just grabs the position
from the map view options, the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.270
latitude and longitude,
and then sets the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.090
camera to that location.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.360
Now how did I get here though?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.980
If we go back to the MR View
Controller, which is the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.110
controller for the table view,
I created a table with just

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.050
one cell, and that's Sydney,
a a table data array.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.860
Then I created another NS array
of GS marker options,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.230
added one in there.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.640
And in the prepare for segue
method, I have if the segue

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.650
identifier is equal to show
map view, which it is, it

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.840
finds the index of the table
view, the index path for

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.380
selected row.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.450
And then it finds that row.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.070
And then from the coordinate
data array, which is the GMS

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.680
marker array, it passes that
corresponding object over to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.890
the map view.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.360
And let's just take a look
at what that looks like.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.400
So this is my table with my
simple one location, Sydney,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.480
and you can see it shifts
the map view over to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.550
the map view there.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.149
And the nice thing about this
is it just handles quite

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:25.470
naturally on its own, the
flow back and forth

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.480
between these two pages.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.010
Now, if I take a look just at
the View Controller, just to

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.260
prove to you that it did, when
I originally load the map, I

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.650
create a camera position
with latitude and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.970
longitude, zero, zero.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.850
So you can see that when it
passes over the GMS Marker

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.290
Options object, it then uses
that to find the current

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.240
location, and create
a marker there.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.220
So that's it.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.650
That's our shortcut for today.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.620
Hopefully, you are all out
there creating iOS

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.230
applications, and if you use
storyboards, it's a very

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.660
powerful tool to
get you going.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.160
So thanks for joining us,
and see you next week.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:39.683
