00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.250
give new schools a chance so it wasn't
 

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.410
give new schools a chance so it wasn't
hard for us in terms of making the

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.420
hard for us in terms of making the
 

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.440
hard for us in terms of making the
decision it was hard to implement it we

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.450
decision it was hard to implement it we
 

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.610
decision it was hard to implement it we
closed six schools last year we're

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:29.620
closed six schools last year we're
 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.829
closed six schools last year we're
closing another five this year we just

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839
closing another five this year we just
 

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:35.280
closing another five this year we just
announced it on Tuesday we're already

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.290
announced it on Tuesday we're already
 

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.490
announced it on Tuesday we're already
launched in that process of having

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500
launched in that process of having
 

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.010
launched in that process of having
conversations with community that that

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.020
conversations with community that that
 

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.110
conversations with community that that
takes tremendous energy from staff and

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120
takes tremendous energy from staff and
 

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.540
takes tremendous energy from staff and
you know we it does by the way that this

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.550
you know we it does by the way that this
 

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.550
you know we it does by the way that this
is debate about whether the way to

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560
is debate about whether the way to
 

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.800
is debate about whether the way to
improve school systems is to close

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:55.810
improve school systems is to close
 

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.019
improve school systems is to close
schools or to turning them around I mean

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:58.029
schools or to turning them around I mean
 

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:00.750
schools or to turning them around I mean
I think it takes everything we close

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760
I think it takes everything we close
 

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.630
I think it takes everything we close
some we turn some around and turns of of

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:03.640
some we turn some around and turns of of
 

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.440
some we turn some around and turns of of
bringing in new programs but but the

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.450
bringing in new programs but but the
 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.130
bringing in new programs but but the
closure of the worst performing schools

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.140
closure of the worst performing schools
 

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.840
closure of the worst performing schools
I think it's absolutely necessary as

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:15.850
I think it's absolutely necessary as
 

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.900
I think it's absolutely necessary as
long as we're providing something that

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:18.910
long as we're providing something that
 

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.240
long as we're providing something that
is better as part of the exchange so

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.250
is better as part of the exchange so
 

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.660
is better as part of the exchange so
it's been a hard thing for us to do but

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:27.670
it's been a hard thing for us to do but
 

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.010
it's been a hard thing for us to do but
something that I think is making the

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:29.020
something that I think is making the
 

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.829
something that I think is making the
district much better we've become

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839
district much better we've become
 

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.780
district much better we've become
predictable which is which is a really
