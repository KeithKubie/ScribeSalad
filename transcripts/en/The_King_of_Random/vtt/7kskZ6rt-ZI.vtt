00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Wow wohohooo

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.240
It works

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.400
Hey Guys welcome back I'm grant Tomston the king of Random and This is Nate

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.740
hey Guys What's Up ,we're pretty Excited for the opportunity to team up with Nickelodeon in this video

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.020
to recreate an element from their show

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.360
Rusty Rivets

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.520
if You Haven't Heard of Rusty Rivets By Now he's a Young hero that uses his imagination and resourcefulness

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.000
To save the day When the need arises

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.520
in Nickelodeon's New Show Rusty invents His way Out of Every problem By

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.629
repurposing spare parts Into The Wildest Coolest and most

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.192
Awesome contraptions ever

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:31.321
and a Lot of Them have Been Turned into Toys

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.580
so if your Kids are Makers

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.460
Experimenters or Rusty Rivets fans then Head down to your local Toys-R-us and Get something to keep Their Hands and Minds Busy

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.900
Because Toys R us is the only place That Carries the official line of The Rusty rivets collection

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.300
so we watched a part of the show and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.879
For This video we're going to Try

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.740
Recreating One of Rusty's inventions but on a Much larger scale

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.869
and to Help us test it Out we've Got stuart edge With us today

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.509
Dressing Up and Stormy The streets Like a Monkey on the loose

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.693
To help us Answer This challenge from Nickelodeon to make a Launcher That Flings Bananas

00:00:58.693 --> 00:00:59.698
in One of the episodes

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.569
Rusty Saves The City From Monkeys on the loose by creating a Launcher That Shoots Bananas

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.040
to lure them back to the Safety of the zoo

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.580
We wanted to see if we Could replicate something Similar in real life but Bananas are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.892
a Really Awkward Shape and Not Really Designed to be shot Out of Launchers

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:14.860
so that Just means we Have to get really creative

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.240
Now we Spent a lot of time trying to figure out Ways to make a banana

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.440
Successfully fire from a Launcher but The laws of Physics Just Generally Aren't in our favor

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.880
Bananas By nature are Curved Which means they don't fit Very well down a straight Barrel

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.740
They're also Pretty Flimsy so if They're shot with any Type of Force They turn to mush

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.520
So true to the spirit of Rusty Rivets we Have tapped our

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.908
Imaginations Use a little Teamwork and come up with a Launcher that We Believe Will Actually shoot Bananas

00:01:38.908 --> 00:01:40.300
for this project we're using

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.580
Pvc pipes a Sprinkler valve some Heavy-Duty springs and a Bit of proto putty

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.820
This is all going to come together Pretty quickly but don't Worry Because we'll Explain How everything Works When we Get It Together

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.620
Ok We've got all of Our PVC and Abs Pieces Cut for our Blaster

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.880
and we're Thinking It might be a good idea Just to paint Them now to save us the trouble down the Road

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
so Good News Guys We got all of our Pieces cut to size we Got them painted

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.900
and that Paint is gonna take a Few Minutes to cure

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.169
and while that Paint is drying we're gonna be making our proto putty plug

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.754
the Whole idea behind the proto putty is

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.597
So we have something that Pushes the banana out of the cannon but then we Retract back into place

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.960
so i've cut off a Little Piece of the four inch pVC

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.300
we're gonna build the proto putty in there and we're gonna use the end piece of a two inch

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.740
Pvc cap as well as an Eye bolt to secure

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.180
The proto putty to a really thick rope

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.380
there's gonna be a lot of force acting on this and we Don't want This Thing ripping Apart

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.640
i forgot To mention we're going to be using two Tubes Of silicone Number one

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.360
So we Got all of Our proto putty Packed down and setting Now

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.980
it's gonna take about 10 to 20 minutes before we can Actually Take It Out and use It

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.258
and While That's curing we're gonna take some of This rope

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:09.280
and build the internal mechanisms for our banana Launcher

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.620
We Picked This rope Up from the hardware store and we Got The thick stuff

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.580
Because anything Thinner Will Snap

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.370
it's in the paracord Section

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.820
It's the Thicker Stuff and it's got a Working Load in the Hundreds of Pounds

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.229
We're gonna start By cutting off a Six-Foot length of rope and tying The ends together to make a Loop

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.200
With our Knot tied in the end secured we're gonna slip it into this metal Clip That we're gonna Run down through This Abs Adapter

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.220
And secure it to a thick metal Eye Bolt Fastened on the inside

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.720
Okay so now this is going to go through The inside this part is Tricky

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.200
There we Go

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.343
At This point we've Got Pretty Much everything ready to go

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:55.660
so let's clean Up the proto putty and put everything Together

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.940
So here we have it Guys the moment we've Been Waiting for

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.489
the cannon is Finished painted and Fully assembled and Ready to test

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.211
Out We Grabbed some Red Buckets and decorated them with craft Foam and filled them up with Bananas

00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:13.350
so now they look Just like the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.700
Real Rusty Rivets Thing Let's Go find stuart edge Dress Him up in a Monkey costume and go bananas

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.620
[in cartoon]: The Banana Launcher on wheels 5000 [Bling sound] [jubilation]

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.460
[in cartoon]: Alright time for a Test Launch

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.960
[voice from cartoon]: Launching in three

Two

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.220
One

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.330
[in cartoon]: Huh well That's not strong enough What if we Turn it up to full power

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.860
yeah that Should do it

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.300
[in cartoon]: Maybe We Should Keep it on medium Power

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.200
[in cartoon]: Good idea

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.600
Looks like we're in business ,Let's rock

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.540

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.520
Ooh wow

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.860
We might Be using a little bit too much Power i think we're gonna have to Turn It down a bit

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.000
Ohh, dang it ,thatâ€™s so fun to be out there

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.800
Three

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.300
Two

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.800
One

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.360
Yehahaha

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.640
[happy Laughter]

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.660
Yeah

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.660
Wohoo

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.300
[Laughter]

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.820
So update guys banana launcher Is an Epic success

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.440
and apparently Depending on the pressure we put into the canon we can Lop Bananas

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.020
A Very short distance or we Can Launch Them an epic distance

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.020
What I'm Really Impressed about from this Experience is how stewart

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.180
Was Able to catch bananas Every single time Without Fail We Should Probably Make This a Sport

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.060
i think so

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.140
for One Big finish i was Just Thinking What if we Pack This thing full of Ice cream and shot Out a banana split

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.920
i saw a Rush to do it so that Probably means We Should too

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.600
Three

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.320
Two

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.820

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.260

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.179
An Epic Mess that Was Crazy look at This This is insane that flu literally like a Hundred Feet?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.010

So there you have it Guys it'S the Rusty rivets banana Launcher

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.789
in real life and even though It's not super practical to shoot Bananas

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.640
it'll Launch anything Else That you can shove down the barrel

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.310
