00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.368
This would be the keystrokes to enter this third expression, and these would be

00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:07.806
the keystrokes to enter this last expression. We can start entering this

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:13.172
expression by typing in a fraction bar, that's the forward slash. It'll create

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:16.988
a spot for a numerator and a denominator. After we type in the numerator, we

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.348
want to hit the right arrow key twice to move the cursor from the exponent

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:25.636
position down to the denominator. Then, we enter in our denominator using what

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:29.598
we know about the square root. After we enter this under this underneath our

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:32.404
radical, our cursor will appear here and we need to hit our right arrow key

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:38.280
twice to move back to the main line. Then, we just type in negative 4. For this

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.373
last expression, we just want to be careful with the parentheses. If we start

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:46.210
with an open parenthesis, another one is automatically created on the other

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.193
side. So, notice that when I get to the 5, I don't need to type in another

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:53.556
parenthesis, I just the right arrow key and the carrot key and a 2 for the

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:58.876
exponent. If you got all of these correct, you're really becoming a Math Quill

00:00:58.876 --> 00:00:59.763
pro.
