originally was bitten by a spider that

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609
originally was bitten by a spider that
 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.360
originally was bitten by a spider that
had been exposed to radiation the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370

Fantastic Four
 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.989
Fantastic Four
became the Fantastic Four because they

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999
became the Fantastic Four because they
 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.549
became the Fantastic Four because they
were astronauts who had gone into space

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559
were astronauts who had gone into space
 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.399
were astronauts who had gone into space
and gone through a strange radiation

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409
and gone through a strange radiation
 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.529
and gone through a strange radiation
belt in space and came back with these

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539
belt in space and came back with these
 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.200
belt in space and came back with these
powers and that's because at the time in

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210
powers and that's because at the time in
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.419

nuclear blasts the development of
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.799
nuclear blasts the development of
nuclear energy and an enormous amount of

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809
nuclear energy and an enormous amount of
 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.140

nuclear energy and radiation a certainty

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
nuclear energy and radiation a certainty
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
nuclear energy and radiation a certainty
that we were all going to be destroyed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010
that we were all going to be destroyed
 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.490
that we were all going to be destroyed
by a nuclear blast and the resultant

radiation that would radiation was the

radiation that would radiation was the
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.800
radiation that would radiation was the
scientific phenomenon around which

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
scientific phenomenon around which
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.980
scientific phenomenon around which
people had fear and mystery it's not

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
people had fear and mystery it's not
 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.640
people had fear and mystery it's not
true anymore

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650
true anymore
 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.990
true anymore
that isn't how we think about radiation

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000
that isn't how we think about radiation
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.940
that isn't how we think about radiation
anymore now it's how we think about

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
anymore now it's how we think about
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.980
anymore now it's how we think about
genetics so when the first spider-man

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990
genetics so when the first spider-man
 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.040
genetics so when the first spider-man
movie came out the spider that bit Peter

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050
movie came out the spider that bit Peter
 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.920
movie came out the spider that bit Peter
Parker was not subject to radiation as

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930
Parker was not subject to radiation as
 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.660
Parker was not subject to radiation as
it was in the comic books it had been

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670
it was in the comic books it had been
 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.880
it was in the comic books it had been
genetically manipulated and if a new

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890
genetically manipulated and if a new
 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.540
genetically manipulated and if a new
spider-man comes out 20 years from now

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550
spider-man comes out 20 years from now
 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.160
spider-man comes out 20 years from now
maybe the spider will be a product of

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
maybe the spider will be a product of
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.170
maybe the spider will be a product of
synthetic biology who knows what the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
synthetic biology who knows what the
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960
synthetic biology who knows what the
technology will be twenty years from now

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970
technology will be twenty years from now
 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.460
technology will be twenty years from now
that we'll have that same sense of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470
that we'll have that same sense of
 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.090
that we'll have that same sense of
mystery and fear so it's fascinating to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100
mystery and fear so it's fascinating to
 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.390
mystery and fear so it's fascinating to
watch as we move forward in time the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400
watch as we move forward in time the
 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.540
watch as we move forward in time the
science has to keep up in the sense that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550
science has to keep up in the sense that
 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.730
science has to keep up in the sense that
if you use outdated science it's just

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
if you use outdated science it's just
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620
if you use outdated science it's just
people just don't believe it because

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630
people just don't believe it because
 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.990
people just don't believe it because
they know too much about it so you have

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000
they know too much about it so you have
 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.600
they know too much about it so you have
to find what is that technology right

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
to find what is that technology right
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.850
to find what is that technology right
now that holds that sense of potential

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
now that holds that sense of potential
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.770
now that holds that sense of potential
the sense of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
the sense of
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.360
the sense of
people know something about it so it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370
people know something about it so it's
 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580
people know something about it so it's
not completely mysterious to them but

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
not completely mysterious to them but
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.050
not completely mysterious to them but
they don't know enough about it to know

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060
they don't know enough about it to know
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.400
they don't know enough about it to know
that that particular use of it could

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
that that particular use of it could
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.800
that that particular use of it could
never happen or is absurd and so

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
never happen or is absurd and so
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.080
never happen or is absurd and so
genetics is we're in that genetic moment

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
genetics is we're in that genetic moment
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600
genetics is we're in that genetic moment
now and that will pass and there'll be

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
now and that will pass and there'll be
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.030
now and that will pass and there'll be
something else in the future but that's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
something else in the future but that's
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.620
something else in the future but that's
one of the reasons why I think the x-men

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
one of the reasons why I think the x-men
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.840
one of the reasons why I think the x-men
are so interesting why because they're

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
are so interesting why because they're
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.090
are so interesting why because they're
genetic mutants why spider-man

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
genetic mutants why spider-man
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.160
genetic mutants why spider-man
transformed from a radiation phenomenon

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170
transformed from a radiation phenomenon
 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.979
transformed from a radiation phenomenon
to a genetic phenomenon and so the

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989
to a genetic phenomenon and so the
 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.870
to a genetic phenomenon and so the
movies just have to follow that kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880
movies just have to follow that kind of
 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.199
movies just have to follow that kind of
social trending in order to really be

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
social trending in order to really be
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:56.000
social trending in order to really be
able to resonate with their audiences

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
 
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:08.680
