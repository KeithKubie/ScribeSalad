earlier periods three to four million

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070
earlier periods three to four million
 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.480

years ago what excites me probably more
than anything these days is the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920
than anything these days is the
 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.710
than anything these days is the
emergence of ourselves the emergence of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
emergence of ourselves the emergence of
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.700
emergence of ourselves the emergence of
anatomically and behaviorally modern

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.990

humans for many years we've thought that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000
humans for many years we've thought that
 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.420
humans for many years we've thought that
this was an explosive moment it was

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430
this was an explosive moment it was
 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.290
this was an explosive moment it was
called the the cultural explosion or

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300
called the the cultural explosion or
 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.330
called the the cultural explosion or
whatever the cognitive explosion and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340
whatever the cognitive explosion and
 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.149
whatever the cognitive explosion and
what we're beginning to find is that it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159
what we're beginning to find is that it
 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.119
what we're beginning to find is that it
is a sort of step-by-step development

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129
is a sort of step-by-step development
 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.469
is a sort of step-by-step development
and most of those in important steps

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479
and most of those in important steps
 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.710
and most of those in important steps
were seminal in Africa and I I think

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720
were seminal in Africa and I I think
 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.359
were seminal in Africa and I I think
that we're going to be able to flesh out

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369
that we're going to be able to flesh out
 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.619
that we're going to be able to flesh out
in much more detail the archaeology the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
in much more detail the archaeology the
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.600
in much more detail the archaeology the
paleoclimate the biology and the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610
paleoclimate the biology and the
 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.000
paleoclimate the biology and the
behavior of the emergence of that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
behavior of the emergence of that
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.760
behavior of the emergence of that
creature those creatures early Homo

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770

sapiens that gave rise to all humans

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110
sapiens that gave rise to all humans
 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.130
sapiens that gave rise to all humans
today and it is my sense that all humans

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140
today and it is my sense that all humans
 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.680
today and it is my sense that all humans
today come out of Africa so by

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690
today come out of Africa so by
 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.660
today come out of Africa so by

on the inside everyone is an African
