00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.860
It's 
garbage day and I can't believe what I'm seeing!
My neighbor is throwing away a microwave.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.630
The saying goes that one man's trash is another
man's treasure, and for me, this donation

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.930
is a treasure trove just waiting to be uncovered.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.239
The first thing I need to do is get this on
my work bench, and put it back together. I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.100
want to know if the thing actually works,
so I'll plug it in, and test it by nuking

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.200
a CD. This electric blue light show is a good
sign it's working, and it's a good thing I

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.460
don't really need this CD, because it's totally
fried. I've got a 60 watt light bulb I want

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.720
to try on high heat for about 30 seconds,
and i'm fascinated by how it immediately lights

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.800
up. It's a great show, but i'm standing about
20 feet away because I'm thinking this may

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.170
not end well. The glass is warping at the
top… …and it just exploded. This base

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.200
is all that's left, besides all the broken
glass. Ok, enough playing around. It's time

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.890
to unplug the microwave, and get serious.
I've got the microwave turned around so I

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.830
can start unscrewing the fasteners. I've got
this old speaker magnet I can use to hold

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.540
the screws as they come off, and that's really
helpful because there are a lot of screws.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.640
My general rule of thumb here is "see a screw,
remove a screw" because they're all gonna

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.240
come out. I'm working on the bottom panel
now, and before I move on, I'll save this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.750
little light bulb. It's rated 75 W at 250
volts. By removing the bottom panel, I can

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.010
access a fun little motor. This is the motor
drives the turntable you put your food on.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.210
I'm moving up to the top of the microwave
to remove the screws up there, and this will

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.939
allow me to pull the vent cover off, as well
as the outer casing. At this point I've got

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.720
access to some dangerous components like this
high voltage capacitor, the magnetron, and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.100
a high voltage transformer. Now there's a
possibility these capacitors carry an instantly

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.290
fatal electric shock, so I'm wearing gloves,
and using a pair of needle nose pliers to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.460
short the terminals, and discharge it completely.
I'll save this high voltage diode and get

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.500
to work on removing the transformer. 4 screws
hold that in place and when they're removed

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.450
the wires are disconnected from the magnetron.
It's a heavy maze of metal, and I'm happy

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.080
because I've got a lot of uses for it. The
magnetron is the component that generates

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.920
the microwaves that cook your food, and I've
got that disconnected now. While I'm here,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.360
I'll salvage the power cord, this charcoal
filter, and an AC blower motor that's still

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.750
in great shape. Here's another high voltage
lightbulb, and some switches. These 3 switches

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.530
prevent the microwave from turning on until
the door is shut. At this point, the control

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.650
panel will push out, and the circuit board
is removed so I can collect this piezo-electric

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.700
buzzer, and some relay switches. I'll use
a de-soldering iron to remove the solder,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.980
making it possible for me to salvage the 12
volt power transformer. I also got the buzzer

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.989
out, and some other fun goodies, like this
15 volt voltage regulator. These germanium

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.569
and Schottky diodes are useful, and a whole
slew of other treasures that I'll explore

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.450
later. I'm super excited because what would
have cost me hundreds of dollars to buy new,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.580
I just got for free! But wait, there's more!
This magnetron is still hiding a couple of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.860
super strong ring magnets! I'll use my bench
vise to hold it tight while I rip the casing

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.120
off with a pair of pliers. When the sides
are folded down, I can save this mesh washer,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.620
recycle the aluminum bits, and with some leverage
from my chisel, slowly pry off the magnet.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.739
There's still another one hiding under the
fins of the heat sink. I've just gotta clip

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.739
these 2 wires, and carefully use my chisel
to separate it off the metal. Now I've got

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.750
2 super strong ring magnets that are so much
fun to play with, that I went and found 2

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.800
more microwaves just so I could get some more.
The magnetrons look exactly the same, and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.200
the magnets are all about the same size. Now
I've got 6 I can use in a future levitation

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.310
project. I also got 2 more MOT's which I'm
super excited about, because there are a ton

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.120
of dangerous projects I can use these for.
Like unballasted high voltage electrical arcing,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.209
or these instantly fatal traveling arcs. How
about improvised spot welding, or dangerously

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.340
exciting metal melting, and even makeshift
AC stick welders? I feel like I made out like

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.250
a bandit on this project, and these salvaged
components will lay the foundation for many

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.360
projects to come. If you'd like to see more
