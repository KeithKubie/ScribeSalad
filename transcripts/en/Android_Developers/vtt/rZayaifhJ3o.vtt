[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.490
Hello, my name is Reto Meier.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.340
And welcome to "This Week in
Android Development" on

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.060
Monday, September 9, 2013.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.640
Last week, Ankur and Nick put
their unique Anglo-Australian

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300
spin on "This Week in Android
Development," while I was

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.120
putting a unique spin on my
toasted marshmallows.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.170
My absence didn't slow down
the team though with the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.670
release of new "DevBytes" for
animating map markers,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.170
effective efficient prefetching,
understanding the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.480
Patchfield audio architecture,
and implementing card flip

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.530
animations.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.410
The Google Play Games services
team were also hard at work

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.190
with another episode of "Game
On!," covering how to best

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.220
support game controllers
for your Android games.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.250
This week, "Android Design in
Action" will be walking you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.010
through some of the most common
UX issues we encounter,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.760
and I'll be presenting the next
episode of my efficient

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.100
data transfers "DevBytes,"
uncovering how to batch and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.590
bundle your transfers
using sync adapters.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.940
Not to be outdone, Daniel is
back with another "DevByte"

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630
describing how to perform
ListView cell insertion

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.760
animations.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.220
New in documentation last week
was this guide to getting

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.740
started with the Android
testing framework.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.840
And if you're in the UK, the
latest update of BBC's iPlayer

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.220
let's you download your favorite
TV shows to enjoy

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.690
when you're on the tube.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.930
That's all for "This Week in
Android Development." Be sure

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.440
to check out this week's
"DevBytes." I'm Reto Meier,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.350
and I saw two shooting
starts last night.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.930
I wished on them, but they
were only satellites.
