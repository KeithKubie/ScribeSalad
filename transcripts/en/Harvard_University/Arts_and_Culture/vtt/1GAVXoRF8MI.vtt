00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.650
the goal should be that everybody gets a chance
to

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.299
read great books

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.619
and participate in the richness that humanities 
brings us if you die of maliaria 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.980
you don't get that opportunity so absolutely

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.660
it's a wonderful thing that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.289
that we get to experience those of us who

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.539
live in the united states and had resonable
opportunity

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.400
I love movies I love books and things like
that

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.840
I think we need to make it so that everybody

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.380
gets to engage in those thing and some continue
creativity that's wonderful

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.370
but that's more and goal then 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.120
the thing that enables  

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.060
the equity most people that avreage in the
bottom billion

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.600
you don't get the read many books or see many
plays and and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.700
so thats what I put my work into

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.829
I don't have the talent to create those things
but I applaud the people who do
