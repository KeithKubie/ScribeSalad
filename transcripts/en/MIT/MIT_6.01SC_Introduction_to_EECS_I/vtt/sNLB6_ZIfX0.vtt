00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.260
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.050
Last time we talked about NVCC
method and how to reduce the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720
number of equations we had
to deal with to solve a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.920
particular circuit.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.660
At this point, we're pretty
well equipped to solve

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.150
circuits in the general sense,
but we really haven't talked

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.570
about how to use that
information or possibly use

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.210
circuits in a particular way.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.040
Before we jump into both that
and abstraction of circuits,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.820
we need to talk about op-amps.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.270
Op-amps is short for Operational
Amplifier.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.840
And it's a tool that we can
use in order to sample

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.630
particular voltages from a
subsection of the circuit

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.300
without affecting it.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.870
Another thing we can
use op-amps to do

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.440
is modify our signal.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.000
Or if we're going to sample a
voltage from a particular

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.440
subsection of the circuit, we
can then do stuff to that

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.100
voltage without affecting the
circuit, all within the op-amp

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.760
or within the op-amp's special
subset of circuitry.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130
So first of all what is an
operational amplifier?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.900
Well, an operational amplifier
is a giant web of transistors.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.410
But what an operational
amplifier does is act as a

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.310
voltage-dependent
voltage source.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.270
It can effectively sample
voltages from an existing

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.040
circuit and then use them to
power some other object, for

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.480
instance a light bulb.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.685
If you set up this kind of
circuit, you will not actually

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:24.880
be powering this light bulb
with 5 Volts, because the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.240
light bulb itself acts
as a resistor.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.270
And so the voltage drop across
this part of the circuit is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780
going to be different
from just 5 Volts.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.660
If you want to enable a voltage
drop of 5 Volts across

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.140
this light bulb, then you have
to stick up an op-amp.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.670
You have to use an op-amp to
sample the voltage drop at

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.540
this component and put it in
between the light bulb and the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.395
rest of the circuit.

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:54.040
When you see an op-amp on a
schematic diagram, it'll

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.880
frequently look like this.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.370
You'll have a positive input
voltage, a negative input

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.540
voltage, power rails, which are
actually the thing that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.810
determine the range of
expressivity that the op-amp

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.419
has, and an output voltage.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.865
In reality, the relationship
between the output voltage and

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:27.910
then input voltages is something
like this, where K

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.120
is a very large number.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.550
The effect that this has is
that Vout is going to be

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.330
whatever Vout needs
to be, such that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.610
Vplus is equal to Vminus.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.290
That's the basic rule you want
to use when you're interacting

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.700
with op-amps.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.760
So in this case, if we wanted to
power this light bulb with

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.750
5 Volts, we would do something
like this.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.600
Excuse the sloppiness of
the second diagram.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.710
We still have our 10 Volt
voltage source.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.960
We still have our
voltage divider.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.510
This point samples 5 Volts
from this sub-circuit --

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.470
and isolates this part of the
circuit from the light bulb.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.770
Vout has to be whatever value
is necessary such that this

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.630
sample point and this sample
point are equal.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.380
Since this value is 5 Volts,
this value will also be driven

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.780
to 5 Volts by the op-amp,
which means that

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.959
this value is 5 Volts.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.260
And we've successfully
managed to power a

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.510
light bulb with 5 Volts.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.910
The other thing you might be
asked to do is to take an

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.580
existing schematic, an existing
circuit diagram and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.400
figure out what the operational
amplifier does to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.170
a given signal or possibly what
Vout is or possibly what

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.500
Vout is in terms of
the input signal.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.860
So let's practice using
this diagram.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.220
Here's what we're after.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.340
I'm going to figure out where
Vplus is going to be.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.640
This is another voltage
divider.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.280
I'm now interested in Vminus,
in terms of Vout, which is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.530
another voltage divider.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.280
I can set these two equations
equal to one another

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.530
and solve for Vout.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.090
I found a new expression for
Vout in the particular case

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.530
where V is 10 Volts.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.410
If my input voltage were
previously unspecified, or if

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:13.650
this voltage source were not
specified or just Vin, then I

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.900
would be after this
expression.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.150
Some things I'd like to mention,
while we're talking

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.420
about op-amps, all the
operational amplifiers we've

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.170
been working with so far deal
with Vout in terms of Vin,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.140
where Vin is driven through the
positive terminal, and the

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.560
negative terminal is typically
connected to ground.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.150
You can do the opposite
and end up with

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.670
some interesting effects.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.010
But it comes at a cost.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.190
It is entirely possible that you
will end up driving your

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.800
op-amp to an unstable
equilibrium.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.505
What you need to look at
is this relationship.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.430
There may be a particular point,
in which case your

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.550
system is stable.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.110
But if you get any sort of minor
perturbations, you'll

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.650
actually end up with
divergence.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.880
If this is the case, then
you'll probably

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.380
burn out your op-amp.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.540
You can do this by hooking
it up in this way.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.580
This is expensive and could
possibly burn you.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.350
The other thing to note is that
the power rails on your

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.260
op-amp limit its range
of expressivity.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.890
And I think I've said this
before, but it's worth

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.560
mentioning again.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.950
If your op-amp is only powered
by 10 Volts, it cannot amplify

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.790
your input signal to a final
value greater than 10 Volts.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.660
Likewise, if your input value
is a negative voltage, and

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.890
you're working with a
non-inverting amplifier, if

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.350
your ground is truly ground or
if your ground is higher

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.880
relative than your input
voltage, you cannot actually

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.670
express a negative voltage.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.960
The third thing I'd like to
quickly mention is that there

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.420
are some terms associated with
op-amps that you might hear

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.582
used by the staff or online,
that sort of thing.

00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:27.240
A buffer and a voltage follower
are the same thing.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.680
And that's explicitly when you
want to sample a signal or you

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.690
want to sample a particular
voltage, and you don't want to

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.780
multiply it or add it to
something or do any kind of

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.500
LTI operations that we might be
able to do using op-amps in

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.290
this course.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.450
You can work with amplifiers.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.060
And the thing we worked with
earlier was an amplifier for a

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.060
value less than 1.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.040
You can also use op-amps
to some signals.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.030
And if you look for a voltage
summer amplifier on the

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.830
internet, you should be able
to find some information.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.740
In any case, op-amps are
really powerful.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.070
They allow us to both isolate
a particular section of a

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.460
circuit and sample a particular
voltage value from

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.130
that circuit without affecting
that circuit, and also allow

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.640
us to modify that particular
voltage value before using it

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.220
in another part of our
overall circuit.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.550
Therefore, we're enabled to
design more complicated and

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.240
powerful things.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.680
Next time, I'll talk about
superposition and Thevenin

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.010
Norton equivalence, which will
further enable modularity and

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.470
abstraction in our
circuit design.
