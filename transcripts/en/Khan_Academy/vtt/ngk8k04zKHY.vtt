00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.958
FAREED ZAKARIA: The price
is, of course, great,

00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:02.855
because it's free.

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.480
This week, I'm not
recommending a book.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.520
Premier Wen already did that.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.630
But instead, I want you to
go back to school, for free.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.320
And you don't have
to leave home.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.090
This school is called
the Khan Academy.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.690
It's an online classroom started
by former hedge fund manager

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.080
Sal Khan.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.840
Khan makes videos of lessons
about everything from algebra

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.470
to venture capital and
everything in between.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.420
2,000 lessons in all,
mostly math and science,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810
which have been watched
18 million times.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.945
Bill Gates watches
them with his kids.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:35.320
I want to recommend--
just to get

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.060
you started-- four
particular lessons, one

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.540
on the French Revolution, one
on so-called cupcake economics,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.210
one on the Geithner plan
2.5, and one on that math

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.220
problem that vexed all of us
in high school, the passing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.750
bicycles.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.350
Take a look at this clip.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.210
SALMAN KHAN: How many minutes
after Ann arrives at point B

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.490
will Betty arrive at point A?

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.190
So Betty was going
in this direction.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.780
They meet right here.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.055
And then she keeps
going and hits point A.

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:04.930
FAREED ZAKARIA: Didn't
get it in high school?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.990
You will now.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.060
Go to our website for
links to the lessons

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.360
I particularly like.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.470
But they're really all good.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.010
And now for the last look.
