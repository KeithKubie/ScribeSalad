[THEME PLAYING]

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.980
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.120
Thanks, everyone, for coming to
"Treasured Lands" presentation.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.698
Please give a warm
welcome to Dr. QT Luong.

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:18.093
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.200
QT LUONG: Thank you,
[? Phil, ?] for inviting me.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.890
It's an honor for me
to talk at Google,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.300
and I'm grateful that you took
some time out of your busy day

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.310
to come and listen to me.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.640
I was a more unlikely person
than you to photograph

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.280
the national parks.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.250
I was born in Paris
from Vietnamese parents,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.270
and I grew up as a city kid.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.980
My world changed
when college friends

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.040
took me high up the
high peaks of the Alps.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.590
I discovered wilderness
for the first time

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.960
and made a connection
with nature.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.950
Here in California, we are
very fortunate to have access

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.900
to many wild places.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.280
But in France,
they were all gone,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.330
save for the high mountains.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.800
I took up photography as a
means to bring back to France,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.180
and family who
could not get there,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.990
the beauty of the high
peaks of the Alps.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.050
Here, this is Mont Blanc, the
highest peak in Western Europe.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.250
I was just snapping a quick
shot before hurrying down

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.045
to beat the storm.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
At first, my goal was just
to document my climbs.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.930
But I began to notice
that, sometimes, light

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.580
could create some magic.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.400
A Canadian friend of
mine donate me this book,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.090
and I realized that the type of
photographies that I was doing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.190
could be elevated
to an art form.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.570
This was my last climb in the
Alps in the summer of 1992--

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.880
beautiful light at sunset.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.410
But wait.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.870
What were you doing
there at sunset

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.740
when you were supposed
to have an alpine start?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.830
It was a photo trip.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.420
I had begun to learn
more about the light

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.200
and play with this
way of changing it.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.030
This was my last trip in the
Alps because the next winter,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.350
I would move to Berkeley.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.170
I would work on the
first self-driving car

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.720
project in California.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.410
I'd just finished my PhD--

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.110
that's the book that
grew out of it--

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.970
and I was looking for a
short-term post-doc stay

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.140
in the US.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.680
At that time, I didn't know
much about the geography

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.470
of this country.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.230
But other climbers had told me
that there were some good rocks

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.180
to climb in Yosemite.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.570
So of all the great US
research universities,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.170
I picked Berkeley because it
was the closest to Yosemite.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.010
I didn't know anything about
the national parks, either.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.250
But I was told that
somewhere in Yosemite,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.790
there was a
3,000-foot-high cliff,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.150
the tallest in North America.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.710
I discovered there a vertical
wilderness at a scale new

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.481
for me.

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:25.740
The climbs took several days.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.910
To sleep, we had to bring
along those platforms, which

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.052
are called portaledges--

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:31.760
very comfortable.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.460
You just have to make sure that
you don't roll in your sleep.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.770
So I didn't fall out
of the portaledge,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.650
and I managed to
snap a few pictures.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.790
So the key to
climbing photography

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.490
is that you have to try to be
at the same level of the climber

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.140
or above.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.630
In the spring of the same year,
the mountain called again,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.490
and I set up my sight on Denali,
the tallest peak in North

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.910
America, at 20,000 feet.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.910
What makes a climb
of Denali special

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.090
is that it is a combination
of mountaineering and Arctic

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.440
expedition.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.570
Temperatures can go
down to minus 40.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.230
Climbers build snow walls
to protect their tents

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.209
against a fierce wind.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.490
You start with supplies
for three weeks.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.840
That's the time it
takes to acclimatize,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.390
climb the mountain, while
waiting through storms.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.270
It's too heavy to
carry on your backpack.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.150
So in addition to the
backpack, you drag a sled.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.270
I didn't freeze to death
and made it to the summit,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.480
with glaciers extending
to the horizon.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.410
The immensity of the mountains
were at a scale new to me.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.600
That same fall, I
visited Death Valley.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.610
I'd never been in
a desert before,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.820
so that was also a new
environment for me.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.640
The geological
formation fascinated me.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.250
Previously, I was
standing on the top

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.720
of the coldest
mountain on earth,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.690
the top of North America.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.160
Now, I was at the lowest point
in the Western Hemisphere,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.775
where the hottest temperature
on earth was recorded.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.380
I began to realize how
much diversity there

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.180
was in the national parks.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.960
I was able to appreciate
that because I'd

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.730
been to both places.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.070
Yet, there were
also similarities.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.090
You see here is a
[INAUDIBLE] echoing

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.770
the glaciers in the valley.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.090
Each park is highly
individual and unique.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.370
But taken together, they
are all interrelated.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.670
So I'm a self-taught
photographer

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.760
and learn mostly
by reading books

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.030
and by looking at
books of photography.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
I began to study the
American tradition

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.330
of landscape
photography, which is

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.760
much stronger than in France.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.620
I visited local museums,
and the prints that I saw

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.590
were the most beautiful
I've ever set my eyes on.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.600
When I came back from
Denali, I was somehow

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.670
disappointed by my pictures.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.620
So it was time to try
to learn a new approach.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.580
I decided to try to photograph
with the same camera

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.060
as the old masters, so
a large format camera.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.970
So here's one of the first
images I made in Death Valley.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.620
When I came home and
looked at the transparency,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.180
I was astonished
to see that there

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.760
was more details that
I could see than when

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.340
I was standing at the scene.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.940
And to give you, beside
that, with an example

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.340
from a very different
environment-- the redwoods

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.290
of Northern California.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.780
If you come between
mid-May and mid-June,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.470
the rhododendrons are in bloom.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.010
They are a very small
part of the image,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.730
but important
nevertheless because they

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.770
create the correct contrast.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.930
With a large format
camera, I do not

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.290
have to frame tightly
the blooms for the detail

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.220
to be there because--

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.820
see-- so much resolution.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.950
So one example here to show
you is that, in those images,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.710
I do not have to direct the
viewer because there's so much

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.700
detail that they can explore the
image for themselves as if they

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.960
were standing at the scene.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.030
So here's a few details
from that image.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.420
Each of them makes an
interesting nature picture

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.380
of their own.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.970
So one technical
detail is that you

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.400
can notice that the
trees in the background

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.798
are as sharp as the
reeds in the foreground.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.840
So the second technical detail--

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.270
so the horizon here is
fairly low in the image,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.290
yet you see the trees
remain parallel.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.730
And there in the redwood
scene, the horizon was low,

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.590
and we have parallel trees.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.000
If we had converging trees,
as would have happened

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.980
if I had pointed
the camera up, that

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.380
would create a different
mood for the picture

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.572
with less of a sense of calm.

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:23.230
So the large format
camera has bellows

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.120
that connect the
front and the back,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:33.620
and that allows me to include
tall objects without pointing

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.730
the camera up, and that is
what maintains the parallelism.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.070
So here, the simple adjustment
that you have is a tilt.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.090
So the tilt allows you to
change the plane of focus.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.660
With a regular camera, the
plane is a vertical plane,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.050
which means that you focus
at a fixed distance, either

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.140
a foreground or a background.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.880
Here, I was able to
choose as a plane of focus

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.570
a plane that goes from
the reed to the hill

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.020
and, therefore, maintaining
everything sharp.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.570
So those movements are
available in a limited

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.150
way with tilt and shift lenses.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.670
But what's unique to
the large format camera

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.830
is the size of the negative.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.540
So here, you see the back
of my camera is 5 by 7.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.480
That's the exact
size of the negative.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.550
Here, you see a transparency.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.980
So this transparency is 5 by 7.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.330
It is five times, in
linear dimensions,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.890
the size of 35
mil or full frame,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.350
25 times in surface area.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.950
That's what gives detail
and provides large format

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.870
photography its
descriptive power.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.770
So when you photograph, you
have to use a dark cloth

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.260
because the image on the
ground glass is very dim.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.690
Everything is manual,
not only focus, exposure,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.550
but also film transport.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.980
So there's many
occasions to mess up.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.620
So each holder holds two pieces
of film, one on each side.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.990
So you insert it on the camera.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.590
When you're ready to
make the exposure,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.420
you have to remove
the dark slide so

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.190
that the film can be exposed.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.150
And then, you have to be
careful not to double expose it,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.860
since there's two of them.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.030
So in order to do that, you
put the dark slide in reverse,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.610
so you remember which
side you've exposed.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.490
So with all the time it
takes to set up an image,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.520
does it make sense just to
shoot one without backup?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.370
So in general, I
shoot two pictures

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.090
for the same composition.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.320
With the cost of film
and processing labs,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.300
it adds up to $20.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.390
So here's a picture.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.430
It was taken in the
Tetons in winter.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.410
This type of photography
promotes a very deliberate

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.580
approach.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.190
This helps me communicate
how the land reveals itself

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.440
to you in a state of
heightened awareness.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.470
So I've been talking quite a bit
about large format photography.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.200
But the disciplines
that I learned

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.290
can be transferred to
other equipment, as well.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.690
If you slow down, that
would be the thing

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.770
that will do the most to
help your photography.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.400
And you can, maybe,
pretend your camera

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.500
is very heavy and
cumbersome, if it helps.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.720
Those two
[? strains-- ?] my desire

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.200
to see the diversity of the
national park and large format

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.120
photography--

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.930
inspired me to embark on the
project to photograph each

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.460
of them in large format.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.920
So we have, currently,
16 national park.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.280
Nine of them are
located in California.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.650
Have you visited, any of
you, visited each of them?

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.275
And to give you a
quick tour of them,

00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:59.570
and since it's a tech
talk, there will be,

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.370
maybe, a few photo tips.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.580
To many viewers it is, maybe,
the most accessible viewpoint

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.690
in the national parks.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.660
It was made famous
by Ansel Adams.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.140
I conceived this image as
an homage to Ansel Adams

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.820
because he'd photographed
it so many times.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.870
But I wanted to make some
things that he hadn't

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.740
made at that location, which is
an image which would work only

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.370
in color and not
in black and white.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.590
So I envisioned the
maximum color contrasts

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:36.740
that would happen with the
orange of sunsets in the cloud

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.540
and the blue fog in the valley.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.530
And this was the image
that I visualized.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.700
It took me dozens of visits, but
eventually, I made it happen.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.470
So that's the power of
previsualization for you.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.870
Lassen Volcanic National Park.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.260
So for this image, I
photograph at sunrise.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.100
The more specific the
moment, the more universal

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.660
is the image.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.450
I had to photograph
right at that moment

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.840
because after the
sun would come out,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.020
the shadows would
ruin the foreground.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.740
And I use a graduated
neutral density filter

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.720
to control the brightness
of the horizon.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.870
Joshua Tree National Park.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.666
So beginner is often
told to photograph

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.790
with the sun on their back.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.320
But here, that's a backlight
that makes the image work.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.520
It's very interesting light.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.120
It makes the spine
of the cacti glow.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.810
So those cacti are called
the jumping cholla cactus,

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.890
and they're not called
that for nothing.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.790
When I was there,
fumbling in the dark,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.600
I brushed against one of them.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.410
I didn't want to
try to dislodge it

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.390
for fear of getting my
fingers stuck, as well.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.960
So with the sunrise
quickly approaching,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.980
I kept photographing with
one lodged in my behind.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.330
So only after it was all over,
I strolled back to my car

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.530
and teased the spiny
thing out with pliers.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.140
But the best tool
for that is a comb.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.390
And my advice to
you is to carry one

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.730
when you hike in the desert.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.500
Pinnacles National Park.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.500
It was the 59th national park.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.200
It was designated in 2013.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.010
The next day after it
became a national park,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.280
I came at dawn so
that I would be sure

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.610
that I'd be the first
to photograph the 59.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.440
But this image is taken at dusk.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.100
Often, photographers leave
right after the sun has set.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.460
It's too early.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.590
The best light often
comes after sunset.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.520
So you have to stay
until it is dark,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.790
but make sure that
you bring a light.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.770
Redwood National Park.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.870
So the smaller subject
needs softer light.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.730
Larger subject needs
stronger light.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:12.300
So for the forest, often,
overcast is the best light.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.700
But even so, it
wouldn't have been

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.090
enough here because
the tops of the trees

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.900
would have been too white.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.445
So what makes the picture
work here is the fog.

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:25.560
It conveys a sense
of death and mystery.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.600
So try to seek
weather conditions.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.345
Kings Canyon National Park.

00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:36.860
So unlike the redwoods, the
sequoias are mountain trees.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.330
I wanted to convey that by
shooting them in the snow.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.720
The first time I came, since
there was no snow on the trees,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.330
the scene didn't have
a wintry atmosphere.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.050
So I came back a second
time, right after a storm.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.010
But as the sun came
up, the snow started

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.600
to fall from the branches.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.800
I drove back home six
hours without making

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.890
a single large
format photograph.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.440
So third time, I came
right during the storm

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.290
wearing full mountaineering
gear and using snowshoes.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.570
I was able, at least,
to get the image.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.670
So persistence pays.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.000
Sequoia National Park, the
sister of Kings Canyon.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.620
You see here a very similar
subject to the previous one.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.970
The base of sequoia trees--

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.620
very similar composition.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.260
But the mood is very different.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.745
In photography,
light is everything.

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.500
So the light that
you're seeing here

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.520
is the light that I
talked about before--

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.430
after sunset,
before it gets dark.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.830
It's a very beautiful
light for that scene

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.060
because it is at
the same time soft--

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.540
so no hard shadows--

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.770
and directionals
reveals the texture.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.780
Channel Islands National
Parks, a set of five islands.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.720
The closest is only
one hour off the coast

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.540
of Southern California, but
it could be a world apart.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.030
They are home to
plants which are

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.980
found nowhere else
on the planet,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.099
such as the giant coreopsis.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.130
So this viewpoint
is, in my opinion,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.560
the best view on the
whole west coast.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.119
But it is more
beautiful if you come

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.329
when the flower is blooming.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.670
At other times,
everything is brown,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.579
like the rest of California.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.980
So for trips, if you want
to see the best of nature,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.990
it is always
important to research

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.710
and try to time your trip.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.820
Death Valley
National Park again.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.090
So maybe you've
noticed, but this

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.610
is the fifth image of Death
Valley that I show you.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.670
And all of them were
taken in midday.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.490
So midday is possibly
the most difficult time

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.080
to photograph a landscape
and, particularly, the desert.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.790
So how did I make that work?

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.470
I looked for a dune which
had a steep slope which

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.330
was graced by the sun.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.530
I shot backlit to
accentuate the texture.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:14.630
So in the back, those
mountains with textures

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.210
echoes that of the dunes.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.040
But yet, they are darker, so
they don't draw the eye away

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.880
from the dunes.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.430
And for the same reason,
I excluded the sky

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.540
because it would
have been brighter

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.530
and drew your eye away.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.230
So beyond California, we
have many national parks.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.510
There's total of 60 of them.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.800
Here's [INAUDIBLE] that I
photographed two weeks ago.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.990
The national parks extend
from the southern hemisphere--

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.760
so this is our southernmost
national park in American

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.750
Samoa--

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.290
to north of the Arctic Circle.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.210
This is our northernmost
national park, Gates

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.980
of the Arctic National Park.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.000
So like many of the
Alaskan national parks,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.730
there's no roads or even trails.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:09.950
So when I made
this image, I took

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.100
advantage of a
five-minute window

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.060
during which the clouds lifted.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.410
For the rest of my stay,
they would not lift again.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.070
To get there, I flew
from the Bay Area

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.630
to Anchorage and
then to Fairbanks.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.080
In Fairbanks, I took
a commuter plane

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.410
to reach Bettels, a community
which can be reached only

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.230
by plane in the summer.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:40.190
And there, we chartered a
plane to land us on a lake.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.190
And we backpacked for
two days and a half

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.430
to arrive at the
base of the peak.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.990
To show you a few more behind of
scenes from my Alaskan trips--

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.750
so this scene looks,
also, very wild.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.420
But actually, it is
the best place for you

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.550
to walk on the glacier.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.780
It is only one hour from a road.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.180
It is in Wrangell-St.
Elias National Park, which

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.100
is our largest national park.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.870
It is the size of
six Yellowstone.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.020
I wanted to convey the
immensity of the place

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.390
and of the mountain.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.440
And for that, I needed
a higher viewpoint,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.040
which I sought by climbing
the mountains that you

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.410
see on the right.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:30.020
So that's me with a backpack
typical of Alaskan trips.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.800
So I have my backcountry
camping gear, my 5 by 7 camera,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.250
and a 35 mil system, too.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.128
It adds up to 70 pounds.

00:20:41.128 --> 00:20:43.730
The glacier looks
flat from a distance,

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.530
but it is full of
nooks and crannies,

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.130
such as this canyon carved
by a glacier stream.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.740
You can even go down
under the glacier

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.265
if you're a relatively fit
hiker, even without experience

00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:56.810
in mountaineering.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.990
Local guides can take you
on a half-day trip there.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.730
So crossing the glacier
was only a few miles,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.190
but it took me several
days because I had

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.650
to zigzag between crevasses.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.640
The next day, after
setting up my camp

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.980
at the base of the
mountain, I planned

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.350
to climb the mountain
as a day trip.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.290
But in the afternoon,
it turned out

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.790
that it was too hazy because
of distant wildfires,

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.990
and the light wasn't very good.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.810
So I resolved to bivy on
the top of the mountain

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.280
without my climbing gear.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.290
But fortunately, I
had my stove, so I

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.680
was able to make myself
some warm tea before going

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.010
to bed for a very cold night.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.990
So the next morning, I
got my second chance.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.040
Here's a picture.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.780
Was it worth it?

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.360
Glacier Bay National Park.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.030
So far, to explore
the national park,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.340
I had used, mostly, my
mountaineering skills.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.730
But Glacier Bay is
a marine wilderness.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:04.710
When Captain George Vancouver
sailed there 200 years ago,

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.630
that very spot was a
solid sheet of ice.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.070
200 years later,
the glaciers have

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.210
retreated 65 miles,
which is the largest

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.090
glacial retreat in history.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:23.280
So to explore those parks,
I had to learn new skills--

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.080
in the case of
Glacier Bay, paddling.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.170
The glaciers that you see in
the background look smaller,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:40.140
but our kayak, here, give you a
better indication of its scale.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.900
The National Park Service
has done a great job

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.400
at helping us explore
the parks and even

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.610
at such a remote
location as Glacier Bay,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.680
they provide a shuttle boat.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.010
And so it transports
you midway, so you

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.265
have to paddle only 30
miles to the glaciers.

00:22:57.265 --> 00:23:03.490
So this was a trip in which
we packed for two weeks.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:09.040
And believe it or not, all this
stuff fits into a double kayak.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.350
Everything was wrapped
into plastic bags

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.940
because it had been
drizzling all morning.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.350
Usually, I travel solo, by
myself, but for that trip,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.620
I was very fortunate to
have found a partner.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.130
And actually, I recruited
him at a slide presentation

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.110
just like this one.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.460
So come to see me if
you want to take a trip.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.570
And I was fortunate to have him
because the tides in Glacier

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.930
Bay is so strong that
if I was by myself,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.000
I might have been swept away.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.520
So we started very
early in the morning.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.900
We had planned to paddle
until it got dark.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.020
But it was Alaska.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.170
And it was mid-May.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:58.900
So we ended up setting
our camp past midnight.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.980
And by the time we were done,
I noticed that the light

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.300
was getting brighter.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.800
So I didn't want to go to bed.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.950
It was so beautiful,
I strolled down,

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.610
and I saw an iceberg which
was 100 feet out in the water.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.640
I knew at the speed at
which the tide was moving,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.570
it would be soon
out of the water.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.670
So I walked in the water
until it was knee deep.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.570
I set up the camera, and I was
able to make this image just

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.110
as the tide line
was reaching it.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.820
So this was on the
first day of my trip.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.430
But it still remains my
favorite image of the trip

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.340
because it reminds me of
that particular state of mind

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.610
I was after being
awake for 24 hours.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.470
So on our way to Kobuk
Valley National Park,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.190
our most remote and least
visited national park,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.760
the year when we visited, Kobuk
Valley saw 4,000 visitors.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.482
By contrast, Yosemite
had four million.

00:24:58.482 --> 00:25:01.780
There's [INAUDIBLE] village,
downstream of the park,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.630
and take off through
another melt plain.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.750
But we thought it would
be a leisurely float.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.280
But the river was very
placid, and from time to time,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.860
when the wind blows hard,
if we didn't paddle hard,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.580
we would float backwards.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.080
Kobuk Valley is known for its
sand dune, which is a curiosity

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.060
north of the Arctic Circle.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.340
So when I set up the camera,
and I photograph in the park,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.680
I choose my goal to be the first
to photograph all the national

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.320
parks-- it was 57 back then--

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.550
in large format.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:42.780
And it was the year 2002.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.790
My project to photograph
the national parks

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.440
had been self-funded, so far.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.240
Back until that
time, I was still

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.580
working as a computer scientist.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.050
But in 2001, I set up a website.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.920
So back then, there was no
Flickr, no social media.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.130
And I was hoping to be
able to sell photograph

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.010
through the website.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.850
Other photographers were
skeptical but, eventually,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:18.740
thanks to a little-known
search engine called Google,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.330
I was able to get some
decent amount of traffic,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.325
and it allowed me to sell enough
prints and license images.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.950
For a moment, Terra Galleria
was the most visited

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.160
of all individual
photographers' website.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.100
So in the year 2007, I was
able to follow my passion

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.370
and go into
photography full-time.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.850
It allowed me to do
more repeated visits

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.210
to the national parks to cover
them in different seasons,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.700
visit all their corners.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.050
I would end up doing
more than 300 parks

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:04.835
visit for that project, an
average of five per parks.

00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:09.160
There was a thing which
happened in the 21st century is

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.630
that digital
photography took off.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.690
I bought a second
full-frame camera,

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.550
and it opened the door
for night photography,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.365
which, previously, it was
impossible to photograph

00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:29.260
the star field with film because
film was not sensitive enough.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.520
Night photography offers even
more creative possibilities

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.640
than daytime photography
because, in addition

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.810
to all the other variables,
you have the phase of the moon.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.380
And visiting the parks
at night restores a sense

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.710
of awe and mystery
that sometimes

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.390
was lost in crowded
spots during the day.

00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:56.320
Moonlight is just like sunlight.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.040
Here is a moonset.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.850
Also, you don't see it
with your naked eye.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:06.910
The light of moonset is warm,
just like the light of sunset.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:12.090
Another thing which the faster
shutter speed of digital

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.510
made possible was to properly
capture the northern lights.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.890
To make this image, I drove
on the Dalton highway,

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.500
which is one of the most
dangerous roads in North

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.620
America.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:30.890
It's 400 miles long, with
services only at one point,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:37.330
called Coldfoot,
appropriately, population 13.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:42.150
At one point during the trip,
at midday, the thermometer

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.760
had minus 32.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.420
So another thing that I
did to extend the project

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.570
beyond landscape photography
with a small camera

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.910
is to photograph wildlife.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.510
But still, I had the sensibility
of a large format photographer.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.530
Instead of trying to
use telephoto lenses,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.590
I tried to get closer
to the animals.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.340
This is Dall sheep in
Denali National Park.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:14.010
So actually, the way to
get close to the animals

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.300
is often to let
them approach you.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.510
So if you stay still,
they will come to you,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:25.770
and then, you will be able to
photograph them more closely,

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.890
as in this image.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.410
So here's one exception, when
I approached the subject.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.010
This was in Zion National Park--

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.480
not your typical bird picture.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.100
It was taken with a wide-angle
lens, a 24 millimeter,

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.550
on a tripod with a
multi-second exposure.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.560
So why is that longer?

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.560
Because it was in
a dark slot canyon.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.120
To reach that spot, we had
to use a technique called

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.620
canyoneering, and
it was a skill set

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.350
I learned during the project.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:01.620
So one of the thing which is
surprising in those hidden

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.790
canyons is that, although
the temperature in the desert

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:10.200
hovers in the hundreds, if
you don't wear a wetsuit,

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.270
you get hypothermic in no time
because the water is freezing,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.280
and you have to swim through.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.960
Speaking of water, here is the
other half of Channel Island

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.420
National Park.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.610
This is a kelp forest,
the fastest growing

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.920
plants on earth.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.270
And here, on the other coast,
Biscayne National Park,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:38.340
our lowest national park,
maximum elevation nine feet.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.890
95 percent of the
park is underwater.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.470
So to photograph that,
I had to scuba dive.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.990
So in underwater
photography, likewise, you

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.260
have to try to photograph
at a close distance

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.940
because otherwise,
the picture is not

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.050
clear because of the water.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.040
And if you try to
chase the fish,

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.220
you will just end up
photographing their tails.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:09.330
And the same is true,
also, if you go snorkeling.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.110
Katmai National Park has
the largest concentration

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.460
of brown bears in the world.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.390
So unlike the previous
animals, those are not the ones

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.390
that you want to get close to.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.670
But sometimes things happen.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.310
So maybe the bear was curious
about the strange device which

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.820
are pointed to
them all the time.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.190
But fortunately for me, he was
more interested in photography

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.700
than having me for breakfast.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.180
So I'd set up the
large format camera

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.550
to try to take the picture
of the big footprints

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:51.330
because you can't use that
camera to photograph the bears

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.470
themselves.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.000
So I was under the
dark cloth when

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.510
I felt a presence behind me.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.480
Turning away, I see the bear.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.610
He was at the same
distance from me

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.100
as I am from you in
the front hall here.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.470
So I had to remember those
lessons that they teach you

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.390
at the visitor center
that you have to try

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.870
not to run because it triggers
their hunting instinct.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.390
So I walked back slowly and
made it to behind a tree.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.840
The other thing with
digital photography

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.250
is that now, the digital
cameras double as video cameras.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.210
And so I've shown you how
I extended the project

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:41.240
beyond large format photography
into wildlife and night

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:41.900
photography.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.270
And here I'm going
to show you a video,

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.067
another art form that
I've begun to explore.

00:32:47.067 --> 00:32:49.400
But before that, I'm going
to explain to you what you're

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.320
going to see in the video.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.370
So Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park is home to Kilauea.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.440
It is the most active
volcano on earth,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.980
been erupting
continuously for 40 years.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.100
And it is also the most
user-friendly volcano on earth.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.950
There's no place
like that on earth

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.850
where you can get as close and
personal because the explosion

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.450
is not eruptive.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.750
The lava flows very slowly.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.220
This image was taken
with a wide-angle lens.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.160
I got as close as
I could to the lava

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.396
before I could feel the
heat burning my skin.

00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:34.050
The Halemaumau crater-- this
image was taken in 2001.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:39.060
So back then, you could get
to the rim of the crater.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.580
In the background,
you see Mauna Loa,

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.460
which is a 4,000-foot mountain.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.150
Despite what its rounded
shape would lead you to think,

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.790
it's so rounded because
the lavas that created

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.420
it flowed very smoothly.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.710
It's called a shield volcano.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.450
But one decade later, the
volcano has reawakened.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:09.389
And then in the crater,
there's now a lava lake.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.719
At night, you just
see a plume of smoke.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.350
When you come at day,
you see a plume of smoke.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.560
But when you come at
night, the lava lake

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.360
illuminates the plume of
smoke to create that glow.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.110
So the lava flows mostly through
underground tubes to the ocean.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.150
But if you come
at the right time,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.449
you can see [INAUDIBLE] on the
surface and, from time to time,

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:35.449
into the ocean.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.020
So if you want to
witness that, you

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.959
have to check out the
National Park Service website.

00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:44.380
They have posted
daily conditions

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.850
because most of
the time, the lava

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.110
doesn't flow on the surface.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.650
So when the lava
hits the ocean, it

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.449
creates new land
right in front of you.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.840
And as it cools
down, it's something

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.620
that I found very moving.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.650
After everybody had
left, I stayed overnight

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.140
to create a time-lapse at night.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.530
So I had a tent there because
it's very windy at that spot.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.590
So opposite of that
volcano that I showed you,

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.500
Mauna Loa, it could
be another planet.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.090
This was the most daring
hike that I'd ever done.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.170
It was 30 miles, and I
didn't see a single plant.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.860
And I didn't, also, see
a single person there.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.570
It could have been
another planet.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.560
I expected the top
to be flat form,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.530
but, actually, it
has this huge crater

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:43.240
with 600 feet vertical walls.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.820
I stayed there, on
the top, all night

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.400
in order to make a time-lapse.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.980
Also, it was Hawaii.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.900
At night, my water bottle froze.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.842
Here's a video.

00:35:55.842 --> 00:35:56.508
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:56.508 --> 00:35:59.003
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:56.765 --> 00:38:57.715
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:03.020
QT LUONG: So video is
great, but it still

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.210
remains in the digital realm.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.820
And for me, it's very
important to have

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.160
a physical manifestation
of the photograph

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.070
because there's so much more
resolution in the print.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.310
And viewing things
in the world is

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.310
different than looking
at a computer screen.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.250
So I mounted a
travel exhibit, which

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.710
traveled across the country.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.260
Here's an installation at
the Boston Museum of Science.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.150
It was viewed, maybe, by
hundreds of thousands.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:34.870
But exhibit still go,
still come and go.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.970
On the other hand, book stays
and can inspire generations.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.480
So the year 2016 marked
the 100th anniversary

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.330
of the National Park Service.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.730
I wanted to celebrate
the occasion

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.630
by releasing my own book.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.420
So book travel through
the ages, indeed.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.410
I was inspired by 100-year-old
book which is called

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.590
"The National Park Portfolio."

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.830
It was a main tool
that Stephen Mather

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.770
used to lobby for the creation
of the National Park Service

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.590
in 1916.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.870
Also, it says Department of
the Interior on the cover.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.580
He funded the first printing
out of his own pocket.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.060
So Stephen Mather would go on
to become the first director

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.905
of the National Park Service.

00:40:22.905 --> 00:40:25.770
The book was called "The
National Park Portfolio"

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.650
because it consisted
of nine booklets-- one

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:33.216
for each of the national parks.

00:40:33.216 --> 00:40:36.680
The first characteristic of
the portfolio that struck me

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.040
was that it provided a
very complete description

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.210
of each park.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.755
So here's Stephen
Mather's own assessment.

00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:48.170
At that time, there were
just nine national parks.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.050
So that was something which
was fairly easy to do.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.430
Now, it is much
more of a challenge.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.900
The second characteristic of
the portfolio that struck me

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.820
was that it was an
invitation to visit the park.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.620
So you see how to reach
the national parks.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:10.270
And he's very emphatic,
"Yosemite belongs to you."

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.880
So inspired by those
two characteristic,

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.290
I wanted to make a book
about the national park

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.510
which would be
very comprehensive

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.410
and which, also, would be
an invitation to visit.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:28.990
So here is some specifications
from my book proposal.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.670
No traditional publisher
wanted to take on that project

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.380
because it was too ambitious.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:40.580
So by the summer of 2015,
no progress had been made.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.090
And so I decided to
try to do it by myself.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.660
I hired a publishing consultant.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.870
Two months after,
the consultant quit

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.080
because he thought that
the project was too risky.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.810
So I want to show you the
vision that I had for the book.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:01.170
So of course it would cover
all the national parks,

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:06.520
but it would also give equal
weight to the lesser gems

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.340
than to the more
well-known national parks.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.210
And I will give you an
example a bit later.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:18.750
So for each park, I also
wanted to cover it in detail

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.430
to give justice not only
to the diversity found

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:27.060
in the national park system
but also to the diversity found

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.730
in each park.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.540
So the example
that I'll give you

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.570
is from Lassen
Volcanic National Park.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.440
It is always a place where
I can go in the summer

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.560
when I'm looking for
an uncrowded outing

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.050
to a national park.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:46.260
I can find there the beautiful
landscape of the Sierra

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.930
but, at the same time,
Lassen has a vast array

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.460
of geological features.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.020
It is the only
national park that

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.290
has the four types of
volcanoes-- so all those.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:03.810
So it's 10 images from Lassen
Volcanic National Park.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.700
This is the summit
of Mount Lassen.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.930
It bears the scars of the
20th century eruption.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:14.850
Here, you see a plug dome
volcano above Helen Lake.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:21.360
And here, that composite
volcano above Reflection Lake.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.420
Basalt cliffs giving rise
to Kings Creek Falls.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:31.000
And a shield volcano
against Juniper Lake.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.190
That's the Cinder Cones
that we have seen before.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.310
And at Bumpass Hell,
a geothermal area

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.740
which looks like a
mini Yellowstone.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.340
And there are Devil's Kitchen,
another geothermal area,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.260
which is much less developed.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.610
So the images not only will
tell of a natural history story

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.750
but, also, you can see on
the map that each of them

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.740
was chosen to represent a
specific location on the park.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.530
And to get there, they cover all
the five entrances of the park.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.990
So other photography
books, coffee table books,

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.630
they can inspire you with
beautiful photography

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.640
but, often, they
leave you wondering

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.470
where the locations are.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:19.700
So in "Treasured Land,"
I wanted, for each image,

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.410
to provide a paragraph of text
that explains in detail where

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.840
the location, how to get
there, what is the best

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.480
time of the day, of the
year, and maybe, from time

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.140
to time, some photographic tips
or some of my own experiences.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:41.290
So many in the publishing
industry were very skeptical.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:45.010
But by using a hybrid
publishing model

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.240
between self-publishing
and traditional publishing,

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.720
I was eventually able
to realize my vision

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.090
and offer the book for a very
reasonable price for what

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.940
you get.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:02.490
So "Treasured Lands"
is my opus magnum.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.610
I set out to create
the best photography

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.210
book about the national parks.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.980
So have I succeeded?

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.970
I'll let you judge.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:17.010
But I only say that one year
after publication, the book

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.690
went into its third printing.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:26.750
So I'm going to conclude here
with the section of Yosemite

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.200
from the book.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.250
And the idea is that, even in
the most well-trodden places,

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.790
there is still something
new to discover.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:39.320
So on the right, [INAUDIBLE]
views that all of you know.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.770
On the left are views that I
bet you haven't seen before.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.040
So where is that view?

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.420
If you look at the valley
views there on the left,

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.100
there is a waterfall
very high, there.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.830
This waterfall is
called Ribbon Falls.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:02.390
It is the tallest one-drop
waterfall in North America--

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.220
1,600 feet.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.870
Yosemite Falls is higher,
but it has three tiers.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.100
And these are user
trails that lead you

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.080
to the base of that waterfall.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.890
You can stand in a
huge amphitheater

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.410
where the water drops
directly on your head.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:23.100
It is a very awesome and
very cold experience.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:28.990
Speaking of Yosemite Falls, even
for a very well-known landmark,

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:32.460
there's still something
new to discover.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.090
Most photographers and
visitors stop at the bridge.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:40.320
But if you continue
maybe 10 minutes past it

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.470
on the talus field, you'll
come to this viewpoint,

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.690
where you see upper falls
and lower falls in alignment.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.340
So the picture
was made at night.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.570
It is a moonbow--

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.690
a rainbow created
by the full moon.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.990
This part is exceedingly
wet in the spring.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.470
To make this image, I had
to use a special device that

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.450
rotates very fast to throw
out water off the lens.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.670
So I'm going to
conclude by saying

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:17.460
that I'm hoping that this
presentation has given you

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.060
a taste of the diversity
found in the national parks.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.360
Exploring the national parks
has been an incredible adventure

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.440
for me.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.680
It has brought much
joy to my life,

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:35.240
and my hope is that you can
experience for yourself the joy

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.610
that I experience in the park.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.420
So the National Park
Service has two goals.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.600
One is to conserve the lands
for future generations.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.830
The other is to
make it enjoyable

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.660
for present generations.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:54.240
They have made a very good
job at accommodating those two

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.450
objectives.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.920
So everything that you
saw there is there for you

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.420
and belongs to you.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.790
You don't have to
lug a heavy camera.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.930
You don't even have to venture
very far from the road.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:10.500
So above all, I hope
that my photography

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.440
has inspired you to visit
your park for yourself

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.950
and, if the experience
has enriched

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.000
your life, to do something in
return for your national parks.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.307
And I thank you in
advance for that.

00:48:24.307 --> 00:48:27.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:32.870
OK.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:36.470
So I think we have time for a
few questions, if you'd like.

00:48:39.507 --> 00:48:41.340
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the great presentation.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:45.220
I'm down to 19 parks, so
you beat me, for sure.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.790
I hope to cover all the
parks at some point in time.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.890
So two-part question.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:58.210
One is, what kind of processing
do you do of these images?

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.700
And now there are the digital
camera, full-frame cameras,

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.880
are you inclined more to
take full-frame pictures

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.580
with a digital camera
versus the traditional ones?

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.170
What are the pros and cons?

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:09.080
QT LUONG: Sure.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.750
So first, processing.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:17.830
In case of the film images,
the post-processing that I do

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.950
is mostly to try to
match the transparency.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.340
So the transparency is
a transmissive medium.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.770
The light goes through it.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.430
The print is a
reflective medium.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.680
So they have different
characteristics.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.710
And so I try to match experience
of looking at the transparency

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.180
and the print.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.970
So in order to do that, I
do some minor adjustments.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:50.050
In general, I do not do
radical post-processing.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.740
Of course, when I
shoot with digital,

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.830
I use [INAUDIBLE]
and then you have

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:02.230
to process a file to bring out
the color and the contrast.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.290
But in general, that's pretty
much the adjustments that I do.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.510
So local adjustments
of color and contrast.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.150
As for digital since
large format photography--

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:19.270
so when I started the project,
if you wanted high resolution,

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.490
there was no alternative
to large format.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.970
Now, of course, digital
give you very good quality

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.460
in a very small package.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.070
And so now, these
days, I actually

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.710
do most of my
photography in digital.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:38.200
But in the book, I would say,
it's about half and half.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.230
My five-year-old
has done 12 parks,

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:45.547
so I'm hoping she'll get
to all the 59 in good time.

00:50:45.547 --> 00:50:47.380
One of the things I was
very curious to know

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.750
is if you've seen the art form
emerge from traditional film

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.940
into digital.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.000
While we all see the quality of
pictures change along with it,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.400
how is the experience in
national parks changed?

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.110
Now, with more
digital photographers

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:06.310
out there, more people wanting
to experience national parks,

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:07.840
have you seen a
significant change

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.340
in how the national
parks themselves

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.967
have evolved to handle that?

00:51:11.967 --> 00:51:12.550
QT LUONG: Yes.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:17.890
I would say that
photography has definitely

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.340
become more popular with
digital photography.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:29.316
And now, some of the spots
that I photograph in the '90s,

00:51:29.316 --> 00:51:31.210
usually, I was the only
photographer there,

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.100
or there were just
a couple of them.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.790
A spot like, for instance,
the Mesa Arch in Canyonlands,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:42.130
I've been told that, now, if you
want to stake a spot you have

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.350
to come several
hours before sunrise,

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:49.330
and, in general, there would
be a crowd of several dozen.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:55.100
So indeed, I would say that
some of the more popular spots

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.410
have become more crowded.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.910
There's no denying it.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:01.890
But I've been
trying, as of late,

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.750
to explore mostly in the
backcountry of the parks.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:07.190
And the things
that I've found is

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:11.600
that if you go
further than maybe one

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.840
hour from the trailhead, the
parks remain largely uncrowded.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:23.550
And if you go further than that,
and you go into lesser-know

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.290
areas--

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:30.060
some of which I've tried
to feature in the book

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.080
to give you some ideas--

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.126
then, you can really have
the place for yourself.

00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:42.540
AUDIENCE: So a question online.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.579
How do you decide to go to
a particular national park?

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:47.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
actually my question, too.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.490
So for example, I
guess, say, for example,

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.460
you might want to
visit a national park

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.900
for a particular season.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.310
But then, what, exactly,
days do you pick?

00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:59.490
Do you look at the weather
forecast and things

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.710
like that before deciding,
OK, I should go now,

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:05.190
or I should go next week?

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.780
QT LUONG: So, in
general, on the trips,

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.150
actually, I try to visit
more than one park.

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:14.160
So it's not, I would say--

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.260
with some exceptions-- it's
not last-minute planning.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:24.660
So I pick the time more
based on the season, I'd say,

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:30.030
for instance, the
autumn or the spring.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.960
And then, after that,
I can delay my trip,

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.440
say, by a few days,
or choose to visit

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.080
the parks in a different order,
according to the weather.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.070
And for instance, if I see
that it's going to be cloudy,

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.290
then I'm going to
go to somewhere

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.200
where I'm going to photograph
in the forest or something.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:59.010
Or conversely, if I see
that there will be no cloud,

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.620
then I'm going to plan to
do some night photography,

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.780
for instance.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.790
So I stay flexible when
I get to the location.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.960
But it's the long-term
planning, I would say,

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.572
which is more important.

00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:16.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.300
So I notice that you're
starting to use drones.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.820
Could you talk about
how that changes things?

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.900
QT LUONG: Well, for
one thing, drones are

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.160
prohibited in national parks.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.440
So I haven't done
any drone photography

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.530
in the national park
for that reason.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:44.060
But for my other projects,
I've, indeed, taken to them.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.410
And I think they are
really great because they

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.510
afford you to do
aerial photography

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.100
on the spur of a moment.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.580
So you don't have to do advance
planning and book a flight.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:59.390
And it is, of course,
much less expensive.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:03.170
And then, it really
allows you to have

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:09.854
a new perspective on the
land, which I think is great.

00:55:09.854 --> 00:55:11.270
AUDIENCE: So it
sounds like you've

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:12.936
been doing this, now,
the national parks

00:55:12.936 --> 00:55:16.050
project, for about 25 years,
give or take, from '92.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:17.875
So I know you also
mention more, lately,

00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:19.250
you've been going
to backcountry.

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.080
So I was curious
if you've worked

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.594
on a project of
continuity at all,

00:55:22.594 --> 00:55:25.010
or is it more just trying to
document as much as possible?

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.093
Or have you found yourself,
even season to season,

00:55:27.093 --> 00:55:29.300
going back to the same
spots and trying to capture

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.020
a lot of the same images?

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.489
I'd add, as a
second part to that,

00:55:32.489 --> 00:55:35.030
if you've noticed any changes
in those spots over the last 25

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.529
years?

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.640
QT LUONG: The things
that I do, actually,

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.285
when I return to
a park, I always

00:55:43.285 --> 00:55:46.310
try to find something new.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:50.980
And interestingly enough,
I thought that the project

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.790
would stop at one point.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:56.720
But the thing is that the
more you know some things,

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.970
the more you realize that
there's some things that you

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.710
don't know.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.380
And so I've been
exploring, I would say,

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:09.410
new corners of the park
that I hadn't seen before,

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.620
or new conditions, rather than
trying to return repeatedly

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.270
to the same spot.

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:19.610
But still, you know,
I did, from time

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.290
to time, return to the
same spot-- for instance,

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:25.600
to exit Glacier.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.810
I've gone there four times.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:33.740
And each time, what that has
taught me was glacial retreat.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.690
So the first time
when I got there,

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.920
I was able to get to
the edge of the glacier.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:44.420
And now, the glacier has
retreated hundreds of yards.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.280
And then, there's
new valleys that

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.130
appeared which is very steep,
and you can't get closer.

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:56.365
So those changes are the
most striking that I've seen.

00:56:56.365 --> 00:56:58.490
AUDIENCE: Which one is your
favorite national park?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.040
QT LUONG: So that would
be a question which

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.350
would be difficult
to answer just

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.640
based on the merits of the
park because they're all

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.470
so different.

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:13.550
But for me, it's
an easy question

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:17.000
to answer if I answer it
based on my relationship

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.940
with the place.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.290
And so it has to be
Yosemite because it was

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:23.490
the first place that I visited.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:26.260
It's a park that I visited
more than any others.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:30.950
I've done, probably, hundreds
of visits in that park, alone.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:33.790
I've climbed, skied, hiked
in the park in all seasons,

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.000
so I've really developed a
relationship with the place.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.160
AUDIENCE: If you
were to think back--

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.190
actually, let me
rephrase the question.

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.440
If somebody were to do this--

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.750
visit all the national
parks and take pictures--

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.630
what would your
advice to them be?

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:57.250
And on reflection, what
would you do differently?

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:03.840
QT LUONG: So if someone was to
visit all the national parks,

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:07.890
my advice would be
don't get ready to do

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:13.570
a single trip to a park and
expect to see everything.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:17.810
So I see there's quite a
few folks, particularly

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:20.190
during the centennial,
they embark on a trip

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:23.790
where the goal was to visit
all the parks in a year

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.250
or something like that.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:31.550
And I mean, it's something which
is fun to do but, actually,

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:35.130
on a single visit, you see
only one aspect of the park.

00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:40.620
And I, personally, prefer
to come back to a park

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.730
several times rather
than making a long visit.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.530
So that would be one
advice I would give.

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:51.865
What was the second
part of the question?

00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:54.360
AUDIENCE: On reflection, what
would you do differently?

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.310
QT LUONG: What would
I do differently?

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:57.570
Yes.

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.940
What I would do
differently is that I

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.460
would take a much more
systematic approach

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.980
to photography in the
national parks in the sense

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.400
that, in the course
of a project,

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.900
I notice that there's
a number of themes that

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.880
began to develop that
I haven't showed you

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.930
in this presentation.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:23.330
So I began to zero in on some
specific aspect of the parks--

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:27.420
the trees, close-up
of the grounds,

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:31.530
the night sky, even
grains of sand.

00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:35.700
And so I found that,
because I didn't

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.930
begin to photograph those
subjects on my first visits--

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:43.220
even some parks after I'd
done three or four visit--

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.410
I still had to return to
complete those series.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:49.050
So it's something that I
would have thought better

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:50.550
from the beginning.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:51.050
SPEAKER: OK.

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.560
Well, thank you for coming.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.610
