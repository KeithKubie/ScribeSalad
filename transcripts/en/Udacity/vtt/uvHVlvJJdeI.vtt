00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.890
All right. Let's make things a bit more interesting.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.220
Same page as before, but now with an external

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.140
CSS file. This time around we get the HTML

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.110
response and start building DOM. We then discover the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.840
link tag and send the request for the CSS.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.980
In the meantime, we continue parsing the HTML and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.930
constructing the DOM, but note that we can't render

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.800
the page just yet because we're still blocked and waiting

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.630
for the CSS. Once the CSS does arrive and we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.620
finish building the CCS Object Model, we can paint the page.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.410
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.940
&gt;&gt; Now, I want you to figure out the critical path metrics.
