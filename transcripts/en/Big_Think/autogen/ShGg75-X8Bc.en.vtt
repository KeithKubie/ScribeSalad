the way down the road and they come
 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.770
the way down the road and they come
right up against that goal and this is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780
right up against that goal and this is
 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.249
right up against that goal and this is
when they get confronted with losing the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259
