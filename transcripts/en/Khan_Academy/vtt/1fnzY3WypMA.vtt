00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.010
A single postage stamp
costs $0.44.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.930
How much would a roll of
1,000 stamps cost?

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.570
So we're going to have 1,000
stamps, and each of them costs

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.480
$0.44, so we can multiply
the 1,000 stamps

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.680
times $0.44 per stamp.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
And then we just have to
multiply the two numbers.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.000
Now when you first multiply
decimals, you can just pretend

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.229
like they're whole numbers,
and then worry about the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.840
decimals later.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.500
So we can view this as 1,000
times 44, and then worry about

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.970
the decimals.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.560
What's 1,000 times 44?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.310
You could work it out.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.040
You could say, OK,
4 times 0 is 0.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.970
4 times 0 is 0.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.220
4 times 0 is 0.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.680
4 times 1 is 4.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.920
You get 4,000 here, And you
put a zero here, and you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.610
multiply that, you get 40,000.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.650
You'd add it all up.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.010
But I think we know from
experience, dealing with

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.010
multiplying by powers of ten,
or by multiples of ten, that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.379
really, 44 times 1,000 is just
44,000, so we can just write

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.270
it out here.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.220
So 44 times 1,000 is 44,000.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.620
Let me not put a comma
there just yet.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.360
That's 44 times 1,000.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.560
Now this isn't 44.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200
This is 0.44.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.120
So in both numbers that we're
multiplying, we have exactly

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.540
one, two numbers to the
right of the decimal.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.540
So our answer, our product, has
to have two numbers to the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.190
right of the decimal.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.640
So we count from the right.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.370
We count one, two.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.510
Stick the decimal right there.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.640
So our answer is 440.00, and
these trailing zeroes really

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.960
add nothing there.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.120
So 1,000 times 0.44,
or forty-four

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.700
cents really, is 440.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.850
Or it's going to cost us $440
to buy 1,000 stamps, which

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.030
makes sense.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.080
Because 0.44, think about it.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.240
It's a little bit
less than half.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.720
0.5 would be half.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.780
So this is a little bit less
than half of $1,000.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.960
A half would be $500.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.229
This is a little bit less.
