00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Hello, I'm Steven Winnick.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.540
This is the Library of
Congress, and I'm here

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.720
with a group called Newpoli,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.130
who perform music
from Southern Italy.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.120
I am the writer and editor in
the American Folklife Center

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.030
of the Library of Congress and
I'm trained as a folklorist.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.590
And we just presented
Newpoli in concert

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.370
in our Homegrown Concert Series.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.270
So these are three members of
the group Newpoli, and I'm going

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.160
to ask each of you
to say your name.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.690
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: My
name is Carmen Marsico.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.010
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And my
name is Angela Rossi.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.200
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: My
name is Bjorn Wennas.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And these
are, as I said, three members

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.380
of the group Newpoli who perform
music from Southern Italy.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.470
So let's begin with the
question, how many members

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.650
of the band are actually
from Southern Italy?

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.370
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Three
members actually, yes.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.160
Three members are from the
South in different parts.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.000
One is me and I'm
from Basilicata.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.840
My family is from Basilicata.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.870
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
then I am from Naples,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.620
like my family is from Naples.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.430
And then there's
Fabio Pirozzolo.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.730
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
There's Fabio--

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.270
Yeah, there is also from
the lowest part of Lazio,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.700
which is Southern pat of Rome.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.370
So Terracina is actually
the name of his town.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.970
And that--

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.270
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Maybe
we should give a shout

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.570
out to Dan, our band--

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.870
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: That's right.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.170
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: OK.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.470
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.770
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Because this
[inaudible] we come up here.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.070
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yes.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All
right, excellent, yeah.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.670
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And as we--

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.970
And as I always like
to joke about it.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.270
He's from Northern
Italy as you can tell.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.870
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: The
very north of Italy.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.470
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Region
called Sweden [laughter].

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.070
And so, other members of the
group are from other places,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.370
some American and
some from Europe.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.670
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yes, yeah.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.970
Correct.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And so,
how did you come together

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.570
as a group around Italian music?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.340
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: That's
in [foreign language].

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.640
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yes.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.970
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: So we--
well, we have had, you know,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.350
changing personnel in the group
over-- throughout the years.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.360
But we met at Berklee
College of Music

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.670
where we were all studying
really modern music,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.960
jazz specifically,
blues and other styles.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.700
And one day, we were-- we all
met at the library at Berklee

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.290
and we noticed that there
was a wonderful international

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.680
folk festival.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.620
They were helding it at the
Berklee Performance Center,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.200
which is a really
nice room at Berklee.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.960
And we noticed that Italy
wasn't represented, so we--

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.260
our pride came out, you know.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.560
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100
actually haven't been
represented almost ever,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.350
only once they did it but they--

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.960
it was done by
Italian-Americans,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.050
and they did not
play a folk music.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.000
They play, you know, more
like the Jazz Italian.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.300
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.980
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And so we
thought, well, we need to do it.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.280
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes,
to bring, you know,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.860
the real authentic music.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.470
And since, you know, Carmen
and I were both from the South

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.340
of Italy and we were exposed
since we were really young

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.520
to these styles, we just
said, oh, we can, you know--

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.780
we weren't doing
it as a, you know,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.920
before then as a professional
or anything, but we said, well,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.950
we should try to
prepare some music

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.610
and we submitted it,
see what was there.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.770
And we-- you know, they
selected us and so we performed,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.380
and we really enjoyed
it and we decided

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.100
to make it something more
serious and start a research

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.220
at that point, you know, to
widen the repertoire and such.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.820
That's a great story.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.480
But it also touches on
something interesting which is

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.570
that in the US, you
have movements

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.290
around certain ethnic folk music

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.370
like Irish music and
things like that.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.140
But Italian music
doesn't seem to be

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.090
as well represented
even though there are

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.070
so many Italian-Americans.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.370
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It's true.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Have
you gotten a sense of why

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.970
that is through your--

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.270
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
I have an opinion.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.560
I don't know if I have a
sense but I have an opinion.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.530
I think that that some
older generations,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.650
I think now is a little bit
better, we are progressing.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.130
But in the first immigration
especially, people were really--

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.410
Italian immigrants
were very afraid

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.990
of not integrating
properly with the culture,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.560
with the American culture
especially their kids,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.860
their children.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.060
Sometimes they wouldn't
even teach them Italian.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.360
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.850
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi So I think
it might have something

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.150
to do with that.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.450
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: I think
they were a little bit ashamed.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.640
I mean, they kind
of repressed the--

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.900
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wenna: There was a lot
of racists towards Italians--

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.260
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.580
Because they couldn't really
speak well English, so they kind

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.040
of erased a little bit--

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.850
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: I think your
opinion is probably correct.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.150
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.750
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.050
And now-- you know, though,
there is a really nice--

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.550
we're so glad because I feel
like the newer generations,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.360
you know, that are coming, the
new immigrations so to speak,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.660
they're more interested

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.590
in keeping the traditional
life, so.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.890
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
What I actually noticed

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.760
that even Italian-American are--
I'm receiving more like people,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.710
oh, this is amazing, I want to
research more about my roots.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.610
So now-- I mean, now, it's
been probably five years or so

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.510
that Italian-American
are more interested

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.320
in rediscovering their roots.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.920
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.050
your immigrant experience was
coming here to be musicians.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.350
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And you
kind of shifted the type

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.950
of music that you play though.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.310
So what was that like coming
to the United States to work

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.400
as musicians or to
learn as musicians?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.700
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.110
I mean I guess we were a little
bit lucky because we studied--

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.760
all three of us studied
at Berklee

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.330
where there was so
much diversity.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.440
So it was fantastic actually,
it was really wonderful

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.720
to hear different cultures and
explore different sounds and,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.270
you know, become richer
and richer as a musician

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.290
because you could really
absorb all those influences.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.560
I really enjoyed-- I
still enjoy it actually,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.680
now-- even now, yeah.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And you want-- yeah.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.370
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: I agree
with what she said.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.950
No, I would say that one thing
that I think that everybody

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.370
that studied at Berklee
experience was that a lot

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.570
of teachers there, they
want you to go and look

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.980
in your roots and, you know,
see what you can bring.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.280
So I think that,
you know, that--

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.040
maybe like the shift towards--

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.120
for them, shifts towards
playing folk music

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.190
from back home was maybe
not that big of a shift,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.490
you know, that's the--

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.790
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It
wasn't that far fetch.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.090
It's true.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.840
Because what you do is you're
integrating-- those are--

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.380
yeah, relate to that
because you're integrated,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.950
you're studying the
American styles of singing

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.580
and playing and-- but you're
exposed to so much, different--

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.880
so many different things.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.140
And then what happens is that
you start sort of going back

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.930
to what can I contribute?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.710
What's my unique voice?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.560
And I think partly is that
you are so far removed

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.110
from your origins that you
really can look with a sort

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.820
of a more like a neutral and see

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.010
that that's very
special, you know.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.750
When you're there, maybe you
don't appreciate it as much.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, right.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.350
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
When you were there,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.250
were you mostly interested
in American musical styles?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.550
Is that what--

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.850
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: I would
say-- I mean, I'm--

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.150
first of all, we
all have our own--

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure, yeah.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.750
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: --
you know, obviously.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.540
So I was-- I really was drawn
to jazz primarily and blues

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.440
and some of the, you
know, the good rock,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.580
British rock and roll.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.490
And I've-- yeah, I'm
not ashamed of it,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.160
you know, like I'm American--

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.280
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: I
was going to say it,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.620
say it like you also
like Metallica.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.410
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
I love Metallica.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.550
I love Metallica, but I was
trained-- classically trained.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.430
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And even,
you know-- And so it's, yeah,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.000
it's sort of interesting
background.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.790
A lot of Europeans have this, by
the way, you know, this exposure

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.270
to all these, they seem
so opposite in a way

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.290
but they're not, you
know, it's all music.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.870
And so, that's kind of
where my influence is

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.430
where if you can see
that, you know, at first.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.970
And then I kind of went
towards where music more--

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.650
and then more and more as I
was, you know, exploring things.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.250
Was that true for
you as well, Carmen?

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.550
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
I mean, I-- as--

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.770
I mean I actually
started within--

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.490
I was kind of trained
classically for a little bit,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.300
but I kind of like the
R&amp;B the, the American R&amp;B.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.060
And then I started being
interested in jazz because I am

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.080
at this jazz British-Egyptian
singer that played

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.470
with this [inaudible]
for a little bit.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.130
They actually think they were
lovers, but-- and then it was--

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.330
I was-- I fell in
love, I couldn't stop,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.860
but I have to say, when-- at
that time, she was the one

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.500
that maybe stared make me think
a little bit because she decided

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.420
to record this famous
song, "A Night in Tunisia"

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.200
in Egyptian instead of English.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.660
And I was like, woah, and then
the whole-- it wasn't really,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.620
you know, swing, it was done

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.340
with this really
amazing African rhythm.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.930
And I was like so
absorbed by that,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.210
it was like I really like that.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.090
And then the next kind of step
it was to discover Shubin.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.760
For me, it was a big discovery

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.700
because I couldn't
stop listening to them.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.250
I felt that, that type of
music was little closer

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.880
to how I felt music
compared to just

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.690
to swing, more natural for me.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.630
So, yeah, and then little
by little, you know,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.350
when you start exploiting the
Brazilians style then the Latin

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.240
style, the Cuban and then
you get to the Africa.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.480
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: It was
kind of like going back

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.100
to the roots like that.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.200
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Fabio,
though, they [inaudible].

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.680
He did play folk music in Italy.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.980
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.910
He really professionally--
the tambourine--

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.210
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.510
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- in Italy

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.760
in several traditional groups
before he came to Boston

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.550
where he also studied, you know,
modern styles and jazz and--

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.850
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Yes, and jazz.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.450
Mm-hmm. And Bjorn--

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.750
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Yeah, what about you?

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: -- what
was your musical background?

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.610
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: My musical
background is classical guitar,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.830
that's how I started.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.640
Then I quickly shifted
to a lot of metal.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.860
So, several hardcore
groups that I played

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.780
in back home and more groups.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.050
But at some point, I started
playing jazz, that's how I got

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.730
over to Berklee College of Music

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.380
and then I met this
wonderful lady.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.770
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well, I want
to say something about Bjorn,

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.510
the-- he always forgot to say.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.810
When we-- yeah--

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.300
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: We're
married, you can tell her.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.600
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: There you go.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.900
There you go.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.200
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: When we were
looking for a guitar player,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.030
we first asked this Italian
guy, that was a jazz player

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.380
and he said, this is not what
I really do, and then we--

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.530
we're already dating
and he had play

00:11:53.530 --> 00:12:00.090
for me this amazing Swedish
folk group and I was like, wow,

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.900
so things are similar to what--
how we embellished music.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.050
And so, when Angela and
I asked him and he said,

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.060
oh, yeah, I'd love to.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.790
And then-- I mean he had this,
I don't know, new eyes to look

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.380
at the stuff and but at
the same time he have

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.700
in his mind even though
he doesn't say, but he--

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.110
I mean Swedish like
culture like their folk,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.410
traditional is so strong.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.710
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.550
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Even if they
don't maybe, you know, think so

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.790
but it's still part of
them the way they are.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.970
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: The
strings and the--

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.270
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.160
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- the value
of singing is very strong--

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.150
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: So, he never
had the problem to understand

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.760
like the grooves
or like you know--

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.060
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.340
Pretty much all the
arrangements and most

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.770
of the original music
that we play, I did.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.630
The Swedish eyes--

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.290
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: He had
the right sensitivity.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.480
So who was this Swedish
group that you talk about?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.780
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh, Frifot.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh, Frifot.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.380
Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.680
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.980
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: You know them?

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I do.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.580
Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.880
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Unbelievable.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.180
Yeah.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.480
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And you know,
I just-- it's interesting.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.780
I just-- I was just thinking
how all of us kind of came--

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.080
we really came from
studying jazz.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.990
What happens is it's such a free
music, it's so free and the--

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.950
I think the improvisational
element is a thing

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.180
that makes you discover other--

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.480
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.190
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: --
interesting aspects of the music

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.480
and also yeah, like
she was saying jazz had

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.870
different components.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.170
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.100
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: You know, jazz
is like general word but this--

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.160
the Latin, the Cuban,
so you realize

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.390
that what is his is
really-- the world of music--

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.690
the music of the world--

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.990
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
It's a lot of folk.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.680
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- flows into
it, so yeah, there's a lot

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.150
of folk in it, basically, so.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.350
But another influence that
people might hear in Newpoli

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.400
and you'll tell me
if it's really there

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.550
or if it's just a coincidence,
is there really music?

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.850
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.150
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh no.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.450
For sure.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.750
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.350
So, how did that
get integrated into?

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.000
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Well, I
mean like when you listen

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.550
to folk music in Italy,
they are still using a lot

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.350
of the same instruments.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.540
And I think that, you
know, the crossover

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.170
between the early music and
the folk tradition there,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.480
it's not a big step.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.280
Two of our musicians in
the group, Dan and Karen,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.180
they are flute player
and the violin is there.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.890
They're actually
educated early musicians.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.880
And I think that one of the
big reasons of why we pull them

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.830
into the band was two CDs ago,
we did a CD called Tempo Antico

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.750
where we did a lot
of renaissance music

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.650
but in a more of
a street folk way.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.310
And yeah.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.610
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well--

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.910
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
The-- yeah, go ahead.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.210
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
I actually want

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.510
to say something about this.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.780
Yeah. Because the
thing is that in Naples

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.970
in the renaissance time, they--

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.870
of course, there was
the educator early music

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.690
and not educator early music.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.310
And so there's a bit, you know,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.120
like discussion groups
to talk about.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.380
The fact that the same composer,
maybe, perform the song

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.410
in a certain way at the court
and then instead on the street,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.510
he would do it with the
folk musician, you know,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.740
more like completely a little
rough and a little more edgy.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.770
And I mean they don't know
exactly, of course, like--

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.170
but there's one specific
style that we did record

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.400
in Tempo Antico is the
Villanella alla Napolitana.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.700
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.000
Right.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.300
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
And that was what we--

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.470
When we did that we said, OK.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.040
We want to present this
way, because we, you know,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.480
we are kind of thinking
that probably on the street,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.660
they were playing
the song like this.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.590
But you know, in front of the
King, it was more refined.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.190
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.490
Moresca as well.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.090
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: The
moresca is another style,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.390
carnivalistic style.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:15.220
And many sounds are involved,
you know, the-- and that was--

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.140
our take was because we
heard a lot of those--

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.000
of this music, this material
performed classically really

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.390
perfectly with no--

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.690
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: I think
there was also couple--

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.300
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- edge,
not a lot of-- yeah.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.600
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
-- a couple of groups

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.900
that try to do it in the--

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.200
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right,
in the younger way.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.500
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: --
in this foreign way, so.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.100
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yup.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.400
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And--

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.700
[ Foreign Language ]

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.000
Exactly.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.300
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: That was
really almost like the other--

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.600
the other way because they--

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.900
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah,
no, they play, yeah.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.050
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- they really
even introduce the [inaudible].

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.580
I don't know if you're
familiar with them.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
I've heard of them.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.180
Yeah.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.770
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: So
they introduce some even

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.160
electric instruments.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.460
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.760
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And you know,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.340
they definitely had a different
take on more folk and more edgy.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.640
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.940
They were definitely
a big influence

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.380
when we started doing
this music.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.890
Absolutely.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well--

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.920
So then another group that
I was familiar with growing

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.850
up because they're from New
York City was the group called I

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.520
Giullari di Piazza.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.630
And I understand that
you've interacted

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.170
with them a little bit as well.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.470
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Well
not with the group per se

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.140
but with the guitarist, John
LaBarbera, he's a good friend

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:33.490
of ours and he actually played
on two of our albums, sorry.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:41.460
And he was definitely one person
that I went to to learn from

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.900
and when it came to playing
the chitarra battente,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.760
which he is a real master on.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.910
And yeah but that's pretty much
the extent of our collaboration

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.210
but John definitely
taught us a lot

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.210
and was just always
supportive of the band.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.810
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.410
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: A
lot interesting stories.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.010
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh my God.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.310
He has some interesting stories.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.610
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: All right.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.910
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:Get a ball
and a wine and that guy--

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.210
Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.510
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: He's-- yeah,
he's traveled a lot and--

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.870
&gt;&gt;: Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.800
He was part of the
awakening of the folk music

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.530
in the Southern Italian folk
music in the '70s in Italy

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.520
and collaborated with a
lot of those people there.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.980
And so-- playing with him was
kind of like I'm playing jazz

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.430
and I'm playing with
Charlie Parker.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.030
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: You know.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.330
Yup.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.410
Well, what are things that they
had observed that group and John

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.620
in particular was that
because Italy was so important

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.650
in the development of classical
music, Italian folk styles

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.240
and the early music actually
had organic similarities,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.510
is that something that
you've worked with as well?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.030
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
Well, maybe in the

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.090
like when we did Tempo Antico,

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.950
I think that we were
thinking about that a lot.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.530
So, that was the album that we
use a lot of renaissance music

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.290
and try to re-imagine
it in a more folk way.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.190
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: But I think
from our previous in CD

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.290
in Nun Te Vuta and with the
CD that we recorded now,

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:28.630
we really wanted to turn it
completely different page

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.390
and write more of our own
music and in the style.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:38.630
And also we wanted to look
at the entire area of the--

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.940
that surrounding Italy
and think about what kind

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.500
of influences may
or may not have come

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.200
in that influence
the folk music there.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.960
And we wanted to like shine
a light on, say particularly

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.340
like recruit them or a
particular scale that, you know,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:03.040
we could trace back to
something and, you know,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.430
re-imagine the folk music
from those perspectives.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.480
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Besides
also using the film recording.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.780
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.380
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: As I--

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.000
well, some film recordings
are more like, OK, you listen

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.040
and it's like it's a song,
it's there and you can take it

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.150
and maybe, you know,
decide to do an introduction

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:32.340
and some sections in a certain
way, but others are really there

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.720
like those like-- I don't know--
or yeah, a woman singing in the

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.460
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: -- the
beginning of the songs is like,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.930
oh cool and then she goes--

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.230
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Out of tune.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.560
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: -- completely
out, and you're like, oh--

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.860
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah, it's--

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.160
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: -- maybe she
didn't really want to do that,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.460
so you have to imagine.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.060
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.360
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: But
still there's material

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.660
that you can use.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.560
And one of the song that we
performed before during the

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.980
concert, then the flute player
was talking about, it's a chant

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.720
that has different variation,
different, I guess, way to sing.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.040
It's really long too, we
didn't do the whole thing,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.540
it's a little too long.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.360
And-- but it's the-- we
collected this version close

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.750
to Matera in Basilicata
because of the time we thought,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.010
oh we like this and
it's close to where--

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.080
how we feel it, but then I--

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.470
later on, even discover
the same chant--

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.410
like you could find a little
more in the center of Italy.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.470
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Let's
the name of the--

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.050
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: It's
called fronidaliya [phonetic],

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.090
which means olive
branches, olive branches.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.390
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.690
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And it sang

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.520
with a slightly different
dialect because, of course,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.030
the dialect there is different.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.430
So I don't know it's
like it's Bjorn said,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.500
we discover like this
group from Greece or like--

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.910
but also I think the
film recordings are

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.650
like such a treasure.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.350
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: So
sometimes by listening to one

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.950
of those things, we're like,
we could do this with this.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So where you
do find the field recordings

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.220
for Southern Italy
that you've used?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.180
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: So I
started researching online

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.330
because being here I couldn't
go deeply in, you know,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:22.900
the library, but we have the
archival of Santa Cecilia

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.720
in Rome that has all those
recordings collected there.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.650
And some professor that teaches

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.280
at different universities
have done like put together

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.680
like a book for-- by the region.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:46.020
And so I bought the Basilicata
book even that Puglia,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.130
I think about Calabria too.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.800
Yeah. And I mean the
Basilicata was very dear to me

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.100
because it's my region.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.400
And actually they say that
that was the first expedition,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.860
expedition like going to
Africa, done, you need to be,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.120
and it was done in 1952
by Diego Carpitella

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.270
and Ernesto De Martino
in the South of Italy.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:17.050
And they specifically went
to Basilicata because at

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.490
that time was the most isolated
region and so they thought

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.850
that they would have been really
untouched and so like, you know,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.640
they were really eager to
record whatever was there.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Mm-hmm.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.240
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And partly--

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.920
you know, particularly it
is true, you feel that way

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.940
when you hear those
recordings because I wasn't--

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.430
you know, I think that my
tradition was Neapolitan

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.480
and actually Carmen too, but she
was part-- she heard this music.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.150
But, at first, I feel
like you were exposed also

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.460
to mostly Neapolitan music.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.760
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Mostly Neapolitan.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.060
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Because it's
the more famous one, right?

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.400
Even the [inaudible]
in Neapolitan.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.700
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.130
That was a big tradition
in my family like yours.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.070
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: But when
she played this, you know,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.450
recordings for me, I just-- oh
it really sounded like something

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.070
that had the elements
of Greece, of, you know,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.720
some Arabic Middle East and
elements and the melodies and--

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.650
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well,
a lot with that actually.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.950
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.250
And there was [inaudible].

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.470
Angela Rossi: Even, even--

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.350
Right, just vocal technique
that is completely different,

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.350
you know, with-- we don't want
to go too specifically, but,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.710
you know, thrills that
only happen in that region,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.060
specifically in that region.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, right.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.660
Interesting.

was amazing, you know.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.930
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yes,
it was really interesting.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.230
Yes.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
I want to invite you

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.060
because as you know Diego
Carpitella just soon

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.080
after that collaborated
with Alan Lomax

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.400
and did other trips
throughout Italy.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.020
And we have those
field recordings here

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.320
at the Library of Congress.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.340
So we're going to invite you
back anytime you want to come.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.640
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: We can't wait.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And we'll
show you those and we'll listen

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.800
to some more of the
same kind of recordings.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.100
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.400
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.000
So those are, those are great.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.010
So, let's talk a little
bit about the instruments

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.660
in the group because some of
them will be instruments that,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.910
you know, our audiences might
not be that familiar with, so.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.210
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Mm-hmm.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What about
the bagpipes, Italian bagpipes?

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.320
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh yeah.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.620
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Zampogna.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.920
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.690
It's actually going to-- I
didn't know this until I went

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.610
down to Southern Italy.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.710
It is huge tradition down
there with the bagpipes.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.880
And I don't think that a lot
of people are aware of it.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.180
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Mm-hmm.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.660
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: But it's funny
because they basically turn--

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.030
they basically turn
it inside out.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.280
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: And make some
reads on it and then play it.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: When you
say it's a huge tradition,

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.890
it makes me laugh because some
of the bagpipes were so big.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.190
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: I know again.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.490
Yeah, they're--

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That it looks

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.090
like you're dancing
with another person.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.390
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
-- they're amazing.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.690
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.990
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.290
The first time I've really
strongly experience is what we

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.970
were in Naples, Carmen and
I for Christmas and it is--

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:01.360
and particularly in Christmas
time, the shepherds--

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.330
well, nowadays is just
bagpipe play which--

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.930
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: -- but they
come down dressed as shepherds

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.540
and they play all these
pastoralis [phonetic]

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.980
on the streets of Naples.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.050
So, it was funny, you
walk around and you see--

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.470
you pass a Gucci store and next
to it is a guy with his bagpipe.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.820
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And usually
the tradition is the bagpiper is

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.890
going to play with the another
musician that plays charamela,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.460
which is the-- our
[inaudible] version.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.360
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: So they
always go in pairs like that.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So it's
a double reed mouth blown

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.960
double reed.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.260
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.560
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Right.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.860
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.160
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Then--

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.460
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And
then plays both of them.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.760
Yeah. And actually the charamela
comes from Napoli, Naples.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.050
And the bagpipe comes
from, well--

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.080
From Alfonso Toscano,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh,
oh, you're speaking

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.940
about his instrument, yeah.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.580
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: The Zamponia
itself was an instruement--

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.560
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah,
it's been made by [inaudible]

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.200
in Italy, though, yes.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.500
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Part
of the same, you know,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.790
era and they do-- the two,
you know, musicians, they go--

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:14.130
in Christmas time, some hire
them to go to their apartment

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.540
to play the novena so
to play this traditional

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.840
Christmas music.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.440
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
it's still happening,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.790
the Christmas very, very early.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.090
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well you
should talk about your--

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.390
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.250
-- That's a very
important instrument.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.550
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yes.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.710
So I play a particular guitar
called a chitarra battente.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.540
And I was mentioning
John LaBarbera before.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:41.420
He was definitely a person that
help me develop playing that.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.940
And so, it's-- it is
basically a baroque guitar

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.400
but with steel strings
and medal frets.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:56.070
And in the west, baroque guitar
has gut strings and gut frets.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.650
But other than that, it
is very much the same.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.820
And it has something
called re-entrant tuning.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.890
So as you drag your
finger across the strings,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.840
this got di-da-da and then
it jumps up and octave again,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.230
ba-ba, which is-- but
it's the same strings

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.980
as you play a guitar which
is very confusing that all

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.430
of a sudden you would
jump up an octave.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:18.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.810
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
Anyway, I learned a bunch

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.740
of different techniques
both from John

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:31.410
and from another chitarra
battente player in Italy.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:38.150
And it is a particularly
an instrument that you find

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:42.320
in Calabria and in
Gargano and Puglia

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.510
and in Salento and Campania.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.540
So those are the-- I would
say probably these areas

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.060
that has the strongest
tradition.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.250
So it's very much an
instrument that's remain

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.750
from history, you
know, up to now.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
It's really interesting

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.750
because it gives it some
of the early music feel and

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.910
yet it's a surviving aspect
of folk tradition that a lot

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.520
of people just don't know about.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.820

It's-- Outside of
Italy here in America.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.770

me and John and maybe--

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.360
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
probably you two, yes.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.660
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.400
I would say it's probably a few
other people that maybe doesn't,

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.870
but I think him and I,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.740
we all know once they
do it professionally.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Right, interesting.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.040
And then there's-- you--
there's another guitar player

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.340
in the group.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.640
So let's talk about
Yusy's [assumed spelling].

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.940
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.880
So, Yusy he plays a mandola,
beautiful mandola actually

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.950
that I snapped up
in Napoli from 1960.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.390
And he plays--

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.690
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: The oud.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.070
&gt;&gt;Bjorn Wennas: -- the
oud and classical guitar.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.840
We both play classical
guitar and mandola.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.210
The mandola and the
chitarra battente,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.660
they complement each other
very much like in the sound

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.660
in both double strings and--

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.530
but he has a little bit more
body to it, which is nice.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.110
When he plays lines, I play
arpggiated park or strumming.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:10.370
But the oud, I think that was
one of the things when we--

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.140
when he was starting in a band,
that we really want to bring

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.310
in his knowledge of music from
the middle east and the language

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.370
that he spoke because we--

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.820
as I was mentioning before
when we're looking at the music

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.430
from the southern Italy,
we saw all these influences

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.100
and there was definitely
one influence

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.150
that we wanted to enhance and--

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.450
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Make
people aware of it.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.750
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.050
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Make
it shine in the music.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.120
And it's funny because
Yusy always--

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.000
when I remember when we re
talking to him about it,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.420
he said, well, let's be careful
because I don't want to look

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.900
like I'm appropriate in
anything from the Arab world

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.380
and I'm just trying to
make my contribution with--

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.810
I think we loved him just for
that, just for that, you know,

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.510
approach of respect because
that's what we always try

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.170
to grab, you know,
towards the music.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.780
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Other than
that, I think you almost--

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.810
all the instruments are--
instruments that you find

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.400
and people know about the
violin, et cetera, the bass--

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.530
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: The
recorders, right, in the room.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.830
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.620
But the-- But I guess
the most particular part

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.850
in the music is the--
what Fabio play is the

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.310
different tamburellos.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.680
And I don't know who
it was that said that,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.780
it's very much the
heartbeat of the music.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.620
And you want to hear
that boom, boom, boom.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.220
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.520
It gets you going,
lots of triplets

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.540
And he has several
different ones for different--

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.840
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh, yeah.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.140
I mean, yeah-- well--

a selection, yeah.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.740

&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah, I
was going to say like yeah,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.340
you saw three here

girlfriend is crying.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.240

you know, if he sees--

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.230
if you make him sit down
sometimes and talk about the--

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.220
his instruments and
the tradition

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.780
of the instruments,
it's pretty amazing.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:10.430
He was-- we were giving a
lecture recently in Arkansas

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.480
and he-- you know, they both
talked about the instruments.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.710
And I learn things that
I totally didn't know

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:21.330
about the frame, drums,
the tambourines of Italy.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.670
And one major difference

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:29.620
for example is there is a big
tambourine that's called a

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.190
tammora that is used to play
a certain style of music

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.780
in Naples, the tammurriata.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:41.700
And then other different
tambourine, different sizes are

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.000
from different regions
and so areas--

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.300
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Specialized,
so different techniques.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.600
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.900
Like from Calabria,
they have one in Apulia,

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.470
in Salento they have another--

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.770
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.520
Obviously all of
them and things--

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.110
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
different claves, you know,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:33:00.510
different claves for different
styles, but today we kind of--

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.870
we play different-- there
was a Calabrian rhythm,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.070
which is a certain
Calabrian rhythm within.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.220
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh I can
say that Calabrian sparka,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.990
spaka napoly, napoly sparka,

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.820
[clapping] sparka
napoly napoly sparka,

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.300
sparka napoly napoly
naploy napoly napoly napoly.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: There you go.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.220
Excellent.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.520
Yeah. Great.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.750
So let's talk a little
bit about arranging.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.610
So you've got all these
great instruments,

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:30.480
how do you decided what's
going to be on [inaudible].

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:37.390
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Well--
oh, how do I decide?

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.550
I don't know.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.840
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Well, you hear it.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.920
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Well, yeah,
but I would say-- thank you.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.990
I would say I hear
it quite often.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:54.320
The-- for example like
when we do new songs,

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.970
songs that I've written, right,
then is-- I write very much,

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.270
try to write very much

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.430
to everybody's strength
as a player.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:07.280
And-- But if we, for
example, like if we pick

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.720
up on a field recording and
I have a skeleton basically,

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.380
sometimes a broken skeleton, you
have to mend it back together.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.420
It was like did she
mean to sing that?

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.390
It's just supposed to
be my tone in there,

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.990
or she's out of tune, you know--

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.240
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: What kind of
harmony do you put under there.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.540
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Right.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:33.730
So, I would say like a lot of
times I start out with a rhythm

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:39.050
and from the rhythm,
I get the idea of the

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.350
where we want to take it.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.150
I mean like sometimes maybe
we hear it immediately like--

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.460
but if I don't hear it
immediately I would say

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.420
like you often start
with some kind of rhythm

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.030
and I get the feeling
for what kind

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.150
of direction I want to go in.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.880
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well, for
example if you think of--

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.270
I mean, the first tarantella
would be today [inaudible].

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.320
When we heard the field
recording for that,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.560
there was a clapping
going on in the background

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.500
and it's tambourine, I think,
was there or maybe not.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.800
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
No there was only--

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.190
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: No, only
voice and the clapping.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.490
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Only
voice and clapping.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.830
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
So-- and you said, OK,

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.620
their clapping has to stay.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.640
We need to keep it,
that's very cool.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.300
And then because of tarantella,
it's not a tarantella

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.550
if you don't have a tambourine
and we needed to have that.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.280
And then we thought, well, let's
do this slightly different,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.460
let's do just chitarra battente,
that goes together with a groove

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.230
and the clapping
and the tambourine.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.740
And that's how it works.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.700
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Oh, oh,
oh, I have to say something

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.380
as an arrangement, and I would
say that probably other people

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.280
that arranges this music
contemporary like, for example,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.930
there's another group
in Apulia [inaudible],

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.620
and they arrange
their [inaudible].

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:01.030
So quite often, this music did
the traditional tarantellas.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.490
We have two chords.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.060
Right? We have a one
chord, we have a five chord.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.330
Let's play that for five minutes
now like-- and you have--

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.850
as an arranger, you have
to do something with that,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.350
so I have invented
all kind of ways

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.420
that you can possibly re-imagine
these two chords turn them

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:24.900
inside out creating baselines
using the parallel minors, the--

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.560
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
And then I mean--

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.860
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: --
anything that [inaudible].

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.540
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Sometimes
there is sneaks in,

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.280
maybe a little something
different, right, not always.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.090
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: But, you know--
not always but quite often.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.390
And you just have to think

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.260
about like what can I
do with this, you know.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.860
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And also
another thing that I notice,

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.650
not always because sometimes

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.750
like the arrangements
are perfect and pristine.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.050
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Thank you.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: But I
think sometimes it's great

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.040
when they're not because we--

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.430
then when we get to
play, then it's--

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.730
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
We get more ideas.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.540
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- We get more
ideas, we get some ideas and,

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.630
you know, he's thinking,
oh perhaps, you know,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.370
if you play this
an octave higher,

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.190
it's going to give
a different effect.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.250
Perhaps, you know, if in
certain instruments, you know,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.970
you get to see the
potential of their instrument

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.140
that maybe you didn't
know about.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:20.090
And I think that's a
really fun aspect of it.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:24.440
When we come up with
breaks and all the sound,

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.360
this would be a really
good break or--

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.660
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.050
They are not untouchable
to my arrangements.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
But it's interesting

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.190
because it shows how your
musical training is interacting

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.490
with this tradition.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.300
So if you're inside
the tradition,

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.190
those limits are there but you
don't recognize them as limits

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.660
that you can break or
that you can play with.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.630
But if you come from outside
and have this musical training,

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.390
you can-- you recognize the
limits for what they are

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:54.900
and say, well, OK,
so how are we going

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.920
to deal with this one part?

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.220
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yes.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.820
So it's really interesting
to hear you talk about that.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.120
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So great.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.300
So, yeah, so one thing
that we didn't mention

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.600
that when we were talking

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.800
about instruments is it might
be interesting to people

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.620
that you include an
electric base in the group.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.710
What was the reason behind that
or the-- or how do you use it.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.680
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
Well, the reason for--

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.730
I mean that we're not going
to take the credit for that

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.290
because there are a lot of
bands in Italy who does that.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.590
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: We heard--

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.190
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
No, no, absolutely.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.920
And I think that we all
wanted, we all wanted to have

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.830
like a slightly more modern
sound of-- you know, we can--

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.840
we-- I mean quite often we
played clubs, and, you know,

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.640
you want to have the power on--

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.500
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Also
outdoor festivals.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:52.420
For example in Italy
or Chicago, it's nice--

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.780
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
You need the bottom.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.080
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- Right.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.790
You need the bottom
sound and I feel

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.030
like sometimes it's a
bridge to connect also

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.590
to a younger audience that
connects to the element

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.300
that now is so popular,
you know.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.600
And--

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.470
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: I mean, yeah,
it really-- I mean in reality,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.270
we have to face the fact
that we are in 2018.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.700
And like some stages if you
don't have that low end,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.010
you're really going to lose.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.310
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: You disappear.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.610
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Yeah, a little bit.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.100
But then other times,
we found ourselves

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.810
like in Kansas City
in the room--

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.130
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: In the room.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.430
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: -- yeah.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.600
Well, we-- Jeff with bass was
there too with a small theme,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.880
but having just a little bit
yeah, or sometimes we play--

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.830
something, this little place in
Boston, and it's a book store

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.970
and that we kept it
really acoustically,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.700
acoustic because I mean it would
be an overpower in the rooms,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.900
so I guess that it's-- you
know, we needed that to make it

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.200
as we said more modern and--

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So I should mention

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.890
that I first met the
band in Kansas City

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.390
in a very small hotel room at
the Folk Alliance conference.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.170
So that's what was
being alluded to their--

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.470
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
One-thirty in the morning.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's right.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.760
And they were playing a set
for, you know, a few of us,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.360
there were-- there was-- it
was pretty full actually.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.660
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
I was surprised.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.980
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: It
feels like a blur in.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.580
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: I
was very surprised

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.880
because there's so
many people just--

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.180
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.480
I don't remember at all.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.780
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- at 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.380
But--

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.680
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: We played
one, even later, we played one,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.980
I think at like about 2:30.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.280
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Three.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.580
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Three--

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.880
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Something like that.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.180
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: -- 3 a.m. Yeah.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.480
And we were like--

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.780
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
And still people--

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.080
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: And we were
like no one is going to come.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.380
And then like-- by the end, it
was like the room was packed.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.070
So the Folk Alliance
International is an organization

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.850
that promotes folk music

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.640
and they have these
showcases every year.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.940
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And this is--

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.290
you guys showcase
this past year.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.580
Had you been to a Folk Alliance?

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: No.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.180
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: No.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.480
That was first time, I think.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What was
your impression on that?

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.080
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: That was shock.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.380
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It
was so much fun though.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.680
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.980
We have so much fun.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.280
It's-- It was amazing.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.580
We plan to go back
again this year.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Which will
be in Canada, if I'm not--

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.820
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.870
And that brings up
another one more question

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.550
which is you'd mentioned
playing in Italy

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.040
at festivals and playing here.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.320
Do you perceive a difference
between playing in Italy

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.440
versus playing for
American audiences?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.740
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.040
A little bit.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.340
I do. I do it a little bit.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.640
You do fear that that's

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.590
where the tradition
belongs definitely.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:41.180
I've-- When you-- But it's
just the way that they all grew

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.260
up with the music
and/or it was just taught

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.650
to them especially the
dance because the element

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.320
of the dance is very
tight to some

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.110
of these music that we play.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.010
And so that's the first
thing you see people--

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.970
young people in Italy just--

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.270
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Going crazy.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.570
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- dancing

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.240
like the traditional
dance and-- but really--

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.540
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- with a
lot of passion and knowledge,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.030
really, you know, the--

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.620
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Sometimes they, you know--

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.540
Well, we played in the very
south, but we play more

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.850
in the center where the
tradition wasn't really the same

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:21.360
than they had, but because
anyway they are exposed,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.160
they could dance
and know what to do.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.550
Sometimes maybe they don't
but they dance anyway.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:34.440
So, yeah, it's-- I actually
lately even here, I've noticed

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.330
that more people are aware of
like only where they let it be.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: They
connect more without--

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.720
yeah, it's true,
over the years--

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.020
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.320
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: I agree.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.650
I always saw a difference
in welcoming a style

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:52.150
that they're not used to
and just let themselves go

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.980
and hear it and maybe even
dance, you know, maybe even--

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.280
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.600
They just do their own thing.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.330
That's what we usually say

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.820
because sometimes we have
the chance to teach some

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.000
of the dances, sometimes
there's no chances

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.030
and we say just feel free to
dance, you know, as you wish.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:17.280
It's not like the ballet,
so you can really improvise.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.580
Yeah.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So one last thing.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.960
I know that you've recorded
four CDs, I think, and you--

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.720
actually you're working
on the fifth.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.020
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: The first
three were mostly traditional

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.610
music of various times and now
you've moved into a process

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.220
where you write a fair
amount of the songs.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.500
So you're doing essentially
original music in the styles.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.530
How is the experience different
of doing your own songs

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.580
and the styles that you became
accustomed to as traditional?

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.880
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Its fun.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.180
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Its really fun.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.480
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yes.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.780
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: It's--

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.080
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.380
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: It's been
fun also like because we want

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.060
to still write in the dialects.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:03.300
So, the previous city,
we wrote a pizzica.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:10.040
And so I studied a little bit
this pizzica and just standing

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.800
like how do they-- and
try to think about rhythm.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:21.890
And then we pick the theme and I
wrote it in some kind of dialect

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.700
that I-- by singing, you hear
and then you sort of like kind

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.580
of guessing what the word it
will be because it wasn't--

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.230
that I was-- I mean acquainted--

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.480
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It's
not who we are, right.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.780
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.080
It was from-- so
far like Tejano.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.180
Actually, no, wait, I
thought of like doing it there

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.100
from Salento, which is the area,
the southern part of Apulia.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.540
And there are many
dialects there.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.340
And I knew a friend that was
from there, and then I said,

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.210
so I'm going to write it, but
then you have to correct it.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.430
And, you know, correct
it in your dialect

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:55.940
and then we'll keep
it like that.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.150
So I did it and I found
their dictionary, try to--

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.140
because the metric
was very important.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.620
So I couldn't, you know--
And so then I send it to him

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.920
and he said, oh,
maybe this one is--

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.930
So it was a little
collaborate, it was fantastic.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.230
We did that.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.640
Then we did it with
Neapolitan and for Neapolitan,

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.440
it was much easier because
she knows it very well.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.710
I'm more-- definitely
know a little bit more.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.010
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
we have our mamas.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:20.580
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well,
your dad at that time--

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.880
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: My dad.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.180
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
-- and then your mom.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.480
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yeah.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.780
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And then
we started writing also

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.080
in the dialect of my parents.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.800
And then it was like
collaboration

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.170
between me and my mom.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.770
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Like, so what--

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.070
and then my mom would call
her sister, it's like,

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.370
so maybe we should
say like that.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.670
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
And then friends.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:37.970
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.270
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It's like
all the friends were involved,

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.570
no, it's like this.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.870
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:43.170
And like, no.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.470
And, you know, different
opinions

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.770
because it's not this
type of language anyway.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.080
But it was wonderful
to actually--

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Involve them?

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.020
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: --
involve them and make them--

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.970
we make this whole thing alive.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.270
It's really great.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:56.160
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And for
this last album which is done

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.220
and I was so happy because
we just received our sample

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.580
with the cover and everything
covered out, beautiful.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:10.020
And in this album, we
definitely, you know,

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.980
try to be very creative with the
writing aspects and, you know,

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.980
and lyric wise to try to-- I
just wanted to say something

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.630
about the substance of the text.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:27.210
Sometimes you-- we try now,
we're really trying to talk

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:33.520
about personal experience
and what we see and we try

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:41.830
to just express our
thoughts through the music.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.670
So it's-- the text
component is important too.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.590
So we talk about
immigration, the way we--

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.180
the way people are
dealing with it,

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.640
the way we see it [inaudible]

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.610
and sometimes we don't
agree, you know, and-- yeah.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.220
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: And then
the new album is called

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:05.840
Mediterraneo, so it's very much
about the crisis of migrants

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.800
and across the Mediterranean
Sea.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.400
Yeah. Yeah.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.700
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
So how, you know,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.750
the stories of these people
that they come, you know,

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.060
and leave everything
behind just like we did.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.660
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Well--

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.960
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: To--

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.260
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.050
Well a lot of our ancestors,
that's what I mean--

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.350
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Yeah.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:32.650
Oh OK, OK.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.950
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: -- not me.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:36.070
Me, yes, so I went for better
opportunities but I wasn't,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.400
you know, in despair,
we weren't in despair.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.840
We are very lucky migrants, but
there's different levels of--

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.440
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: --
you know, and today--

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.740
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Well,
we actually talked also

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.770
about our experience
as immigrants because--

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:56.560
well, when you move somewhere
else and you live far away,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.560
and when you go back,
you feel kind of awkward.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.720
And, you know, people--
I mean I don't know,

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.190
but like people call
me the American and I'm

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.970
like it's Italian, but
because I've been living here

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.300
for a long time.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.830
So I mean it's-- we
have a lot to say.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:20.130
There's a lot.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.430
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.730
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Yeah.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well,
it's also interesting

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.330
because you're going back there
with some traditional music

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.930
from that region but
then also some songs

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.760
that you've written
in their dialects.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.910
And so there's this sort
of strange combination

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:39.870
of foreignness and
belonging that's sort

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.840
of natural to what you're doing.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.440
One thing I notice is you did
win an independent music award

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.340
for the most recent CD, but it
was in the traditional world

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.180
of category even though a lot
of the songs are original.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.480
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Yes.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Do you
have any feelings about that?

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.080
I mean--

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.380
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico:
Well, I do have--

00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.680
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas:
I'm feeling great.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
You're happy--

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.280
yeah, that's why
[inaudible] I would be too.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.580
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: I do have--
I have a comment to say.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.510
Two years ago we played for
a-- for this event, small--

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.000
I mean, small event, we actually
played, just me and Bjorn

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.130
because she couldn't
come in Basilicata

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:14.910
in this little village and
they were given some kind

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.670
of recognition to people
that had immigrated all

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.160
over the world from the village
and they came back and they say,

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.460
oh, you did this, whatever.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.240
And we were asked to have
sing-- to play some songs.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.030
And we did some traditional
song of our self.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:34.310
And then I had a woman come
and say, oh, this is beautiful.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:37.860
But I recognize some, some
other I don't recognize, but--

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.310
like it's really great.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.890
So she did not thought--

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:44.710
they didn't think that
they were not traditional.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.010
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: And
she was from there.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.310
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: And
she was from there.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.290
She just thought I don't
know that song, you know.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.000
And I was, oh, this
is really amazing.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.090
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: It's
like we're getting part

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:58.230
of the standards now that
we have the traditional--

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.400
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: And also I
can point to the last album,

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:07.160
it was actually nominated
in Italy too as a part

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.750
of like the traditional music
prize that they give up there.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.160
And also there was a bunch

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.210
of music journalists
particularly one,

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.620
Shiro de Rosa [assumed
spelling] who--

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.990
he writes song lines and he is
from Naples and then-- I think.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:25.110
And he wrote very
interesting things

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:29.480
about like how we take
Southern Italian tradition,

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.190
put it on its head, mess around
a little bit with it and come

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.330
up with something
new and he like that.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.710
You know, it is like, you know.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:42.500
Because, you know, any
time you treat it as a--

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.140
as an object that you--

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.440
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: A
museum piece, right?

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.740
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: -- Yeah,
you can't touch it, you know,

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.920
it has to be a living organism
and the fact that, you know,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.640
for example, Fabio, Carmen
and Angela, they went here

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.910
and then they write
music about it, you know,

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:01.720
about their homeland and
their experiences here,

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.600
in the tradition, it's
all part of folk music.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.900
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi:
So we don't mind

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.460
to be called traditional
or non-traditional.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.760
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Or foreigners.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, thank
you so much on that note.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:19.280
I think we can say we've
talked a lot about your music

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.210
and we really hope to hear
more of it in the future.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:24.840
And we were so happy
that we had you here

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.640
for a homegrown concert.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.150
And we'll meet again
especially when you come

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:30.730
to hear our Alan
Lomax recordings

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.030
of Italian folk music.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.330
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Thank you.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:34.630
&gt;&gt; Bjorn Wennas: Thank you.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:35.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Thank you.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.230
&gt;&gt; Angela Rossi: Thank
you for having us.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.530
&gt;&gt; Carmen Marsico: Thank you.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.800
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
