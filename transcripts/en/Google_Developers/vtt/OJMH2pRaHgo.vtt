00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.670
ANNA PATTERSON: My dad was a
NASA engineer, so he brought

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.030
us for a tour at Johnson Space
Center, and they asked my

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.440
brother what he wanted to be,
and he said an astronaut.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.780
And then they asked me
what I wanted to be,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.200
and I said an astronaut.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.260
And they said, what?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.020
Girls can't be astronauts.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.050
In their mind, they
were right.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.564
They just didn't realize that
the future would be different.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.920
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's hard
when you're young,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.210
when you're a teenager.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.220
There's a lot of peer
pressure to conform.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.420
ANGELA LAI: There is a certain
stigmatism to being a woman in

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.890
technology.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.210
It doesn't seem to be something
that you do.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.010
JEN FITZPATRICK: I didn't want
to be stuck at my desk,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.360
programming on a computer 8, 10
hours a day, every day for

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.070
the rest of my life.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.730
That's just not how
I saw myself.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.160
But so much of it is also
collaborating with other

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.790
people, and brainstorming,
and problem solving.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.590
GAYATHRI RAJAN: It's
working as a team.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.200
It's building things together.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.600
ANGELA LAI: It always
feels like play.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.560
It doesn't feel like work.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.900
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I'm always
surprised that there are not

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.620
more women going into tech,
because I think it's growing,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.180
and there are just lots
of opportunities.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.170
ANGELA LAI: There is no road
blocks, you know, being a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
woman in technology.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.410
PAVNI DIWANJI: There were
a lot of naysayers.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.930
They're like, don't do that.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.720
You're never going
to be successful.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.630
And so one of the things I
learned very quickly is you've

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.030
got to stay focused, and you
just have to believe in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360
yourself and just
make it happen.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.700
GAYATHRI RAJAN: I come into work
everyday excited about

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.200
the challenges and the
possibilities.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.460
JEN FITZPATRICK: It's incredibly
satisfying to know

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.730
that you're doing something that
has that type of impact

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.145
and that type of reach.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:32.200
SHERRY LISTGARTEN: You really
feel like you're doing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.080
something that's helpful and
that's making a difference.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.160
PAVNI DIWANJI: I'm able to
create something that most

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.920
universities in the world use.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.820
You know, how impactful
is that?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.630
GAYATHRI RAJAN: Five million
businesses use the products

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.740
that I've been working on.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.490
ANNA PATTERSON: Every time
you type in a query,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.920
you're using my code.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.100
And that means that
I'm reaching

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.520
billions of people a day.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.670
JEN FITZPATRICK: You see the
impact every single day on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.880
real people, and your friends,
and your family, and that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.235
just magical.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.160
MEGAN SMITH: Hello, welcome to
Women Techmakers live on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.110
location at Google I/O. It's
incredible to be here.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.160
We have a fabulous lineup
of speakers.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760
We've set up this session as a
series of lightning talks.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.560
So we want to ignite and inspire
with topics around

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.980
search, of course, but also
Google Glass, some product

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.990
insights, AI knowledge,
and other topics.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.440
I've asked all of our speakers
to tell personal stories as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.720
they walk through these topics,
and we have a bit of a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.420
theme of past, present,
and future.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.615
But before we start, I don't
know if my slide thing is

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:53.340
advancing, so I'm going
to come over here.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.010
Hello?

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.220
Sorry, guys-- there.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.520
So this is the lineup.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.910
And before we start, I want to
talk a little bit about why we

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.010
started Women Techmakers.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.700
Last night we had a fabulous
gathering of the women, a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.370
pre-gathering of the women who
are here at I/O. And we might

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.290
be in the minority,
but we're fierce.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.660
And it was really fun, a good
social experience, and we want

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.060
to build community amongst
women, with our male

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.810
colleagues.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.190
We also are working on
visibility, and women are

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.350
largely invisible in technology

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.440
is part of our feeling.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.080
And so our goal is to
increase visibility.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.330
Our industry is probably 10 or
20% technical women, sometimes

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.240
a little higher.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.100
We want to get to 50%.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.780
We want to match
the population.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.300
Products are just better
when they're

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.360
built by diverse teams.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.520
Companies are better.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.750
The world is better.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.550
And that's part of our goal.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.400
I wanted to give a shout out
to real progress that's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.790
happening this year.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.392
Sheryl Sandberg, who is a
fabulous colleague, Google

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:56.160
alum now, leading Facebook with
Mark, has really driven

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.380
the national and international
conversation up.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.320
We need to be talking
about these things.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.380
I don't know if people
are familiar

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.040
with the Maker series.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.410
Maker.com, AOL, and PBS
have launched this.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.080
It's the modern women's rights
movement's history,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.100
documentaries, and really
shining a light into actual

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.930
fabulous stories, the back
stories, on women that you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.380
haven't really heard before.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.250
And you just saw a video clip,
a montage of something we've

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.490
done, which is called Makers at
Google down here, which you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.150
can get to on
google.com/diversity/women.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.960
We really want people to know
the stories of the women who

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.390
build YouTube, the women who
build Android, the women who

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.790
build Search.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.950
And so we've launched this
series starting today.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.510
As part of celebrating what's
going on and some momentum, we

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.810
have a long way still to go, but
we've come a long way in

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.600
really upping the
conversation.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.430
I just want to shout out to some
of the giants we stand on

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.440
the shoulders of.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.460
This is Katherine Switzer, first
woman to run the Boston

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.055
Marathon officially.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.770
I encourage you to
watch her story.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.170
The race director tried to
rip her numbers off.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.900
It's on Makers.com.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.180
And this is Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, and she's delivering

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.820
the Declaration of Sentiments in
the mid 1800s at the first

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.070
Women's Rights Convention back
when women weren't allowed to

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.730
go to university and were not
allowed to do many things.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.740
How many people in this room
have ever heard of the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.430
Declaration of Sentiments?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.130
There's one, two.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.945
Looks like for people on
Livestream, we're probably at

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:22.300
about 10%, which brings me to
the point I want to make,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.880
again, about visibility
and invisibility.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.020
We really have a problem
with how visible

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.170
technical women are.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.360
And so I want to jump into two
things before we start.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.780
Sometimes you're lucky-- you
know, there's symptoms of a

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.930
problem, and sometimes there's
roots of a problem.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.350
And I stumbled off across this
when I met Geena Davis, the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.170
famous Academy Award-winning
actress.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.990
Geena was watching TV with her
children when they were young

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.420
and she just-- as an
actress, she could

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.320
see that TV was biased.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.630
And she'd say in the industry,
there's not enough women and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.010
girls on children's
television.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.680
People would say, yes, of
course, there's plenty, like

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.570
Dora, the "Scooby-Doo" girls,
lots of people.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.570
But then she thought,
no, there's not.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.830
Let's measure.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.170
You manage what you measure.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.620
So she measured it together with
USC Annenberg, and the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.620
studies were showing-- and
they had grad students

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.080
counting by hand--

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.810
it's actually three to one
across all of children's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.610
television, the corpus of
children's television of men

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.240
and boys versus girls.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.850
And so the girls aren't equally
represented, and you

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.720
see amazing things that you
wouldn't even notice, but how

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.180
many women in the whole ocean
in the film "Nemo"?

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.900
How many monsters or muppets
were in "Sesame Street" who

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.880
were girls until the '90s?

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.770
That would be zero.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.123
"Nemo"?

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:38.080
One.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.450
So we're not accurately
depicting the world, and we're

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.960
skewing it.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.920
So one of things we've been
lucky to do-- and also, one

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.340
more stat, the 80% stat.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.740
80% of the jobs that were held
by characters in the

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.410
television our children watched,
were held by male

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.400
characters.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.690
So we taught our kids that girls
and women don't do STEM,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.175
which it just doesn't happen to
be true, as we'll show in

00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:00.070
this session.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.110
And so we really need
to get in here.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.920
We are now working with Geena on
trying to automate some of

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.620
this so we could have a gender
disparity measurement ability

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.660
to look at our media.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.010
And I encourage everybody who
has technical background, look

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.310
at ways we could use technology
to count bias so we

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.030
can measure and see things.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.140
The last thing I'll point out
before we start about things--

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.000
oh, one more example.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.670
This is so insidious, like our
bias, that I was looking in a

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.180
catalog recently, and this was
a dresser for a boy and a

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.600
dresser for a girl.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.380
And the colors are different,
but really, the big difference

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.960
to me that I saw because of
being aware of Geena's work

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.140
was that the boy got
the microscope

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.340
and the girl didn't.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.840
So as you now know this fact,
you're going to notice it

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.540
everywhere.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.830
And it's something we
need to work on.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.010
And if we could use technology
to help ourselves see it, we

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.150
could get out of this historic
bias that we inherited.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.310
The last thing I would say
before we start is around

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.380
becoming visible, includes not
only seeing the technical

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.620
women who are here today, but
also the historic women.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.700
I don't know how many people
recognize some of the people

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.090
on these slides.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.370
Yeah, I see a couple hands,
but really probably these

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.990
people are pretty
unknown to you.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.915
Ada Lovelace is representing
the Doodle.

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:09.940
She's from 1800s.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.000
She's actually the first person
in world history to

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.505
think of programming
something.

00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:16.720
She is the founder
of our industry.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.660
There's the women who were
Astronaut Corps.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.590
Nobody knew about them.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.510
We know about the men.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.510
Some of the most decorated
Americans, of course, are the

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.040
astronauts from the "Apollo"
and "Mercury" times.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.560
They were there.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.180
They just weren't
allowed to fly.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.170
Grace Hopper, this is the
Whirlwind project at MIT.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.059
The Bletchley code crackers, the
Enigma code crackers from

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.860
World War II, more than half
women, mathematicians.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.672
Hedy Lamar, Hedy Lamar helps you
have your cell phone work.

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:44.850
And up on the top, there's
a wonderful thing that

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.620
Singularity University launched
last week and

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.210
encouraged all of us to help.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.340
It's a crowd-sourced
history idea.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.480
And so innovatingwomen.org,
please go there.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.800
Please help capture
these stories.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200
And last, I want to
point to this

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.710
picture down on the bottom--

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.690
University of Pennsylvania,
World War II.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.510
I want to bring Kathy
Kleiman on stage.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.510
She's going to share an
extraordinary story from

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.550
history that I was lucky Brad
Feldman alerted me to.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.430
He's here.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.700
Kathy.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:15.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.100
KATHY KLEIMAN: Thank
you so much, Megan.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.870
I'm thrilled to be here with all
of you today, and I have

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.830
an amazing story to
share with you.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.960
But first, I have
two questions.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.610
The first one is, does anybody
here know who invented the

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.860
first sort routine?

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.860
It was Betty Holberton.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.820
Another question, who invented
the first software

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.620
application?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.960
That was Betty Holberton, too.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.210
We don't know about her because
she was never written

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.040
into formal computer history.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.030
In fact, her story was almost
completely untold

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.030
for a very long time.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.300
I know because I found it.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.660
Can we go to the
slide, please?

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.305
Thank you.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.660
No, because I found it.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.310
When I was an undergraduate and
a computer programmer, I

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.960
felt very isolated.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.510
I didn't see women around me.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.700
I didn't see them
in my classes.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.980
I didn't see them
as faculty in my

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.850
computer science classes.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.850
So I turned to history to see
if I could find role models,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.560
and I found this picture.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.070
This is of the ENIAC, the first
all electronic digital

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.820
computer it was a secret project
during World War II at

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.820
the University of
Pennsylvania.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.950
And when I found the pictures,
the men were in the captions.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.260
That's J. Presper Eckert and
John Mauchly on the left and

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.040
right front, and they're the
co-inventors of the ENIAC,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.240
very famous.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.490
But there are women in these
pictures, and I wanted to know

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.960
who they were, and they weren't
in the captions.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.140
So I took the picture, and I
went to a leading computer

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.260
historian, and I asked
her who they were.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.866
And she said, the refrigerator
ladies.

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:46.250
I said, refrigerator lady?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.520
She said, they're models posed
in front of the machine to

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.070
make it look good, like the
Frigidaire models who used to

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.150
open the new refrigerators
with such a flourish.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.820
Well, they didn't look
like models to me.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.100
These women look like they
belong in this picture, and

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.080
they look like they know exactly
what they're doing.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.290
So I set out to find
them, and I did.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.080
That's Jean Bartik in the far
back, and Ruth Lichterman

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.870
Teitelbaum in the front.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.380
They were two of the original
ENIAC programmers, and I was

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.150
thrilled to learn that all six
of the original programmers

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.270
were women.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.320
So now I'm going to
take a pause.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.550
Thanks to the wonderful Women
Techmakers, I've been able to

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.000
bring you a short video of the
ENIAC programmers telling you

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.630
a bit of their story
themselves.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.710
It's part of oral histories
I've collected over many

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.460
years, and I'm thrilled to be
able to share this with you.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.404
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:39.376
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:41.470
-From the very beginning, you're
going to be a first in

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.430
a lot of things.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:48.440
-I've never since never been in
as exciting an environment.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.870
We knew we were pushing
back frontiers.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.300
-In February of 1946, six months
after World War II had

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.340
ended, America learned
of a secret Army

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.210
project called ENIAC.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.100
It was the first

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.750
all-electronic digital computer.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.060
Yet the tale of ENIAC's
programming by a group of

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.260
young women has been all but
erased from computer history.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.540
During World War II, the US had
assembled a crew of nearly

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.020
100 mathematically trained women
whose official title was

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.480
Computer, women who were
computing complex ballistic

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.770
trajectory equations by hand and
using mechanical desktop

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.980
calculators.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.500
In the spring of 1945, six were
selected to figure out

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.720
how to program the
ENIAC machine--

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.230
Fran Bilas, Betty Jean Jennings,
Ruth Lichterman,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.640
Kathleen McNulty, Betty Snyder,
Marlyn Wescoff.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.670
-We were computing ballistic
tables on a hand calculator.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.392
We were computing, and
we were computers.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:51.580
-There logical diagrams of the
ENIAC, and we were supposed to

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.480
study them to figure out
how to program it.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.540
The ENIAC was a son of
a bitch to program.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.460
-ENIAC became legend.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.300
Eckert and Mauchly
became famous.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.770
However, the ENIAC programmer
story, the story of these six

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.280
women founders who created the
first sort routine, first

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.390
software application, and became
the first teachers of

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.230
modern programming
was never told.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.140
Their work dramatically altered
computing in the 1940s

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.450
and 1950s as they paved
the path to

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.630
modern computer science.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.790
-At that time, the emphasis was
on the invention of the

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.160
ENIAC, I mean, developing, and
the mechanics, the hardware.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.930
-We were like fighter pilots.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.460
I mean, here was this great,
great machine, but you

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.610
couldn't just take any ordinary
pilot and stick them

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.000
into a fighter pilot and
say, go to it now, man.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.120
I mean, that was not the
way it was going to be.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.010
-I had a fantastic life.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.400
Everything I did was the
beginning of something new.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.660
-I really loved working
with those girls.

00:13:57.332 --> 00:13:58.250
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.120
KATHY KLEIMAN: Aren't
they amazing?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.230
KATHY KLEIMAN: And their work
didn't stop with ENIAC.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.840
They became the first teachers
of modern programming.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.740
They became the first modern
professional programmers.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.240
And Betty and Jean went on to
program BINAC and UNIVAC, the

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.220
first commercial computers, and
they created innovative

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.010
tools that changed the face
of programming forever.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.730
Absolutely amazing.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.290
And in a very nice twist,
Betty Holberton actually

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.680
interviewed Grace Hopper
to invite her down to

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.200
Eckert-Mauchly Computer
Corporation, the first

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.810
commercial modern computing
company, and

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.910
Grace, of course, accepted.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.900
So now--

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.180
thank you.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.930
So now, today, I have an amazing
announcement to make.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.650
After so many years of
recording their oral

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.980
histories, researching their
accomplishments, and working

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.190
so closely with the ENIAC
programmers, I'm thrilled to

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.250
tell you that and I'm thrilled
to announce here, that final

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.900
funding has finally been put
together so that I can produce

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.790
a documentary and finish my book
on the ENIAC programmers

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.950
and share the story
with all of you.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:17.300
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.410
KATHY KLEIMAN: This is happening
because Megan Smith

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.760
introduced me to two remarkable

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.410
technical women of vision--

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.520
Anne Wojcicki and Lucy
Southworth Page.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.830
And they're providing wonderful
support through

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.620
their foundations, The Brin
Wojcicki Foundation and the

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.830
Donor Advised Fund on behalf
of Lucy Southworth Page.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.775
And I really want to applaud
them, because this is amazing.

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:46.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.040
KATHY KLEIMAN: And thanks to
this support, I will be in

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.710
production this summer with the
Paul Freeman Film Group,

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.680
and we will be producing a
documentary, and we'll have a

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.460
book for you very,
very shortly.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.590
I can't wait to share the
story in its full form.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.880
And now I want to share just a
personal story about how I

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.170
learned firsthand what history
and visibility can do to shape

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.390
our viewpoints.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.840
Ten years ago, when my son was
five, he came over to me with

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.300
a very confused look
on his face.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.720
He'd grown up with my work on
the ENIAC programmers, and

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.000
he'd even met and actually
played with four of the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.230
original six ENIAC
programmers.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.850
And he looked upset/ and he
said, mom, I know that women

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.110
can be computer programmers,
but can men be

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.360
programmers, too?

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.960
I assured him that, of course,
women and men could be

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.190
programmers, and in fact,
technology was better when we

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.240
created it together.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.570
And when I left him two nights
ago, he was programming.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.610
And so what I want to do and
conclude is say stay tuned for

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.390
more about the ENIAC
programmers.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.520
And please join me in the quest
to capture wonderful

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.680
stories of women in
technology, so we

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.810
don't lose any more.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.850
And on behalf of all of us,
I want to thank you.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:02.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.760
MEGAN SMITH: And first off,
thank you to all of our

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.190
amazing lightning speakers.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.420
You guys were incredible.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.259
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:14.310
MEGAN SMITH: And also to
Stephanie, and Phoebe, and

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.760
Mimi, and Sinead, and Judith,
who helped us put all this

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.069
together with the amazing
I/O team.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:24.180
Just quickly, Larry talked
about thinking big.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.060
We've been talking about the
idea of moon shots, you know,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.770
going 10x instead of 1x.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.500
And so we--

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.420
my colleague Astro and I have
launched this site in this

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.160
sort of goal to have the meme
of moon shot thinking be

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.740
something that more of us do.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.900
So Solve For X is this
idea of there's a big

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.090
problem in the world.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.170
There's some kind of crazy
technology that is there.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.090
It feels like science fiction,
or there's a reuse of

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.480
something old that we just
might be able to use as a

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.780
radical solution to solve big
problems in the world, be they

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.600
self-driving cars, or poverty,
or water, or just

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.860
more fun for everybody.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.720
And the main thing about this
is that it's on the web.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.150
It's open.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.250
And so there's lots of proposals
already up, and

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.220
we've partnered with the X
Prize and TED and Arizona

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.790
State University, Singularity,
this great set of movies from

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.890
GE's Focus Forward about moon
shots that people are taking.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.290
And so we're just trying to get
the conversation going and

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.910
really celebrate people who are
starting, or who are in

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.630
process of moon shot, because we
always celebrate the people

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.050
who made it, but we really
want to get more about

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.210
collaborating and teamwork.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.890
Bill Clinton calls the 21st
century the century of

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.170
creative collaboration.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.720
And really, the web and
all the things, we

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.760
already know that.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.090
We already feel that.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.910
So that's what Solve
For X is about.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.820
And along those lines, there's
an idea that we have as part

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.010
of it-- my clicker's
not working--

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.370
about your x, like x is a
problem in the world or

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.970
something you're passionate
about.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.940
So I was really lucky as a
student to get to take

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.320
acoustics at MIT from Professor

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.550
Bose, as in Bose speakers.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.980
He was an extraordinary
professor.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.380
And at one point during our
classes, he paused, and he

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.320
went into a lecture
about life.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.240
And one of the key things he
said is, you know, you guys

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.970
are really talented.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:07.890
You're doing great things.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.570
You're going for it.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.490
The key thing now for you is,
figure out what are you

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.610
passionate about.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.910
In some ways, what's your x?

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:14.800
What do you care about?

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.180
What do you want to work on?

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.260
Because if you find that,
you're going to be

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.300
unstoppable, and you will do
extraordinary things to help

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.770
people make things great
in the world.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.570
And I think that the women who
we've heard from have found

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.800
their x, and I hope that
everybody will be

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.680
thinking that way.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.440
I welcome everybody to
stay afterwards.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.870
I think Susan has to
catch a plane, but

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.180
everybody else is here.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.770
There's a bunch of great
websites up, like the

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.160
makers.com site.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.670
And in fact, today I heard--

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.290
somebody just told me that
Susan's story is up on the

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.630
homepage of AOL, so
she's one of the

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.360
Makers, and she's there.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.320
And again, we've launched Google
Makers at Google, and

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.500
we hope that other companies and
other organizations will

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.080
start telling the stories,
which leads me back to

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080
visibility.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.300
And let's make people visible.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.100
Help us do it.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.870
And thank you so much
for being here.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.675
[APPLAUSE]
