00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.921

&gt;&gt;presenter: And welcome to Google.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.921
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Thank you.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:27.921
&gt;&gt;presenter: You've never been here before,
right?

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:28.921
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: No, I've never been here before
only been on the website.

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.921
[laughter]

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.921
&gt;&gt;presenter: Cool, cool.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.921
[laughter]

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.921
Now we're really, we're really excited to
have you here today.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:33.921
There's a lotta big fans.

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.720
I myself I grew up on South Florida so I was
like an original Heat fan, like Rony Seikaly,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
[cheering]

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.720
Glen Rice, all that stuff.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.079
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: How many people here are from
Miami?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.079
[cheering]

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.079
&gt;&gt;people in audience: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.519
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Alright represented, we've
got a few.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.519
[laughter]

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.510
&gt;&gt;presenter: But so I read, you have a new
book out this week and this is part of the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.949
Authors@Google series and the memoir is called
A Father First and I thought we could talk

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.239
a little about that today and your experience
and some of the stuff you discuss in that

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.239
book.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.239
And I think, like many people in this room,
I and a lot of us knew you as the NBA final,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.500
the two time NBA champion, the NBA Finals
MVP, and the guy who took Marquette the Final

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.610
Four and all that, but I think --

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.840
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I'm still that person.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.970
[laughter]

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.400
I think that story which you definitely tell
in the book is sort of almost secondary to

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.270
this other sort of set of tales about you.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.640
This kid who grew up in a tough life in a
rough part of Chicago and who learned to be,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.160
learned he was going to be a father at 19
and I think that, that, do you feel like that's

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.530
true that, that part of that story, the story
of the guy who had to learn how to make all

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.650
these tough decisions very early and learn
how to be a father and all that is the primary

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.650
story of the book?

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.980
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well, yeah, I think it would
have been easy for me to write a book about

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.159
basketball but I also think y'all can Google
it.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.159
[chuckles]

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.159
[laughter]

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.159
&gt;&gt;presenter: Nice, nice.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.159
[laughter]

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.770
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: That was so corny.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.770
[laughter]

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.590
I didn't even think about that one it just
came to me.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.590
[laughter]

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.210
But no, I felt that if I was gonna go down
this path I wanted to write something that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.290
I felt was meaningful and I felt that can
help others in a sense.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.349
So I talked a lot about my childhood, I talked
a lot about my upbringin'.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.870
And I do a lot of foundation work so I know
kind of the same struggle that's goin' on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
in the inner city, kinda the same way I grew
up.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.260
So I see kids everyday that's just like I
was and goin' through some of the same issues

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.659
that I went through.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.469
So I took this opportunity to kind of express
that and talk about it because when kids see

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:42.959
me and I come and talk to them they see Dwyane
Wade, the two time NBA champion and all these

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.620
accolades, but I don't think they necessarily
understand that I was them and I remember

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.019
being in that same seat and I remember bein'
told that I wasn't gonna be successful and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.060
I couldn't do this and I couldn't do that.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.029
So I thought I would take this time in this
book and kinda share those personal experiences

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.029
through my life.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.091
And also the title of the book is A Father
First and it's not necessarily directed to

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:09.980
just fathers, I wanted to really express to
families that's gonna through the same issues

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.290
that I went through whether it's a divorce,
or whether it's the battle between the custody

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.180
from the kids, and kinda just share my experiences
the negative and a positive of it and hopefully

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.000
it can help someone look at things in a different
way or it can help them in some facets of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.879
their life so hopefully I accomplished that.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.200
Oh a little basketball's in there, too.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.540
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.550
So why did you decide, I mean the book opens
with you getting full custody of Zion and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.550
Zaire --

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.550
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.359
&gt;&gt;presenter: and so why did you decide that
you wanted to get this out there?

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.790
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It just, I really don't know.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.760
I've never really thought that I was gonna
write a book, I never thought I'd be an author

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.269
before I always looked at it as hard work,
which it is --

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.269
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.269
[laughter]

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.739
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: but I just felt that I go through
everything in life for a reason.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.950
It's some reason I went through this process
for many, many years and still going through

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.329
it today.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.239
And I just know that a lotta guys especially
in my league, in the NBA, that come up to

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.049
me had a lotta questions, gave 'em hope in
a sense.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:25.310
Before I got custody, I got appointed to the
Fatherhood Initiative from our President himself

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.680
and to be seen in that field as bein' someone
who can speak for fathers in a sense I just

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.160
thought it was my duty and my job and obligation
to kind of share those experiences with others

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.760
hopefully, like I said hopefully it can help
them, hopefully it can give them a different

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760
perspective --

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.630
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: on how to handle somethin'
because when I was goin' through this custody

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.360
battle, it was kinda like shootin' in the
dark.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.450
You didn't know what was gonna happen and
where the ball's gonna end up.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.700
So hopefully if anybody's gonna through the
process they can kinda see, "Well, you know

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.280
what this is how D. Wade said he dealt with
it, this is what he went through," and they

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.060
can see this is how hard it's supposed to
be, this is as hard as it's gonna be, just

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.190
so many different things so.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.870
You describe yourself as an introverted guy
in the book but there are some very personal

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.590
things that you share in there.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.980
Were there parts of it that were difficult
for you to sort of explain or put out there

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.130
and share with the world?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.570
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I mean anytime you're
talkin' about your personal life in a sense

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.700
is always difficult.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.730
I've had to live my life under the microscope
in a sense and it's very public so a lot of

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.720
things I didn't want to get out got out and
I would love to deal with a lot of things

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.150
behind closed doors but it's not the hand
I was dealt.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.530
But I kept a lot out.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.530
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.690
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I like to tell people that
what you read in here is a little mild version

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.690
of my life -- [chuckles]

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.690
[laughter]

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.690
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: especially the divorce and
the custody battle --

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.280
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: it was hectic but, and at the
same time it was public so --

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.340
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: you can go find out that kind
of information.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.580
I didn't wanna really get too much into it
in the book.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.090
&gt;&gt;presenter: I mean there's also some very
emotional stuff from when you were a kid growin'

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.760
up and some of the experiences with your family
and the relationships that you had with them.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.750
Do you think it was easier telling some of
the stories especially about your mom and

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.600
stuff because it was also sort of a lessons
learned tale that you were telling?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.710
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, not easy but the lesson
learned tale made me really feel comfortable

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.390
tellin' it, but it's still not easy today.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.492
We was on The View the other day, my mom and
my sister came, and we had a segment and my

00:06:29.492 --> 00:06:35.520
mom was talkin', I put my head down in there
'cause I almost lost it, I almost went in

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520
tears.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.920
And it's kinda sometimes like I'm lookin'
at someone else's life when I hear about it

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.750
or when I think about it it's kind of like
that's not my life, that wasn't me.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.190
But it was me.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.140
So some of those emotions, some of those memories
come back in a sense so writin' this book

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.250
was like my therapy, it was kind of therapeutic
--

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.250
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.250
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: in a sense.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.040
So it's like bein' in a dark room and talkin'
to my writer about my life.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.680
And I remember so much, like it started coming
back and I remember things like it was yesterday

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.920
as well so it was very, very therapeutic.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.770
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.390
The subtitle of the book is How My Life Became
Bigger Than Basketball and that came from

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.250
something that your mother used to say to
you.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.660
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, she's always, she know
I loved basketball, she know I wanted to be

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.790
a basketball player but she didn't want that
to be my only dream.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.170
But she always told me, "Son, you life," she
still tell me this day, "Your life is bigger

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.480
than basketball, your life is bigger than
basketball."

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.170
I never understood it then 'cause when you're
a kid you're like, "No, I'm gonna play basketball."

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.170
And that's --

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.170
[laughter]

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.170
that's what I would do.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.180
But I lied I was like, "Yeah, mom I wanna
be a doctor --

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.180
[laughter]

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.180
is that good?"

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.330
But I didn't wanna be a doctor.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.330
[laughter]

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.330
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.330
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: [chuckles]

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.700
&gt;&gt;presenter: One of the things you talk about
in there is with your two sons and your nephew

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.120
is man time and man talks right –

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.700
&gt;&gt;presenter: where you have like these serious
conversations about important things with

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700
them.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.230
&gt;&gt;presenter: And how important is that in
your relationship with them?

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:06.230
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well it's very important to
give them their time together and apart.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.980
Like I said I had to learn this stuff too,
takin' parenting classes, my kids are in therapy

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.710
as well, going and sit down with them in therapy
sessions and tryin' to learn about them not

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.670
thinkin' that just because I was a kid once
and now I'm an adult, I have all the answers.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.070
So I understand that man time for them is
very important because they want it every

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.070
day.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.370
"Like I gotta go to a game.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.140
You all want man time now?"

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.240
So they want it all the time but it's good
that they like to hang with me that way and

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.330
it's not always just fun sometimes we sit
across from each other, and one day it was

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.940
rainin' so it was like okay we couldn't go
out so I put like a table in my room with

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.050
chairs all around it, had everybody name on
the chair, had questions for everybody written

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.740
down on note cards that we asked each other.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.620
And I was sittin' there and it was like real
life questions and I want them to know they

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.240
can, I'm an open book they can come to me
about anything and I want them to feel comfortable

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.240
about comin' to me about stuff but I also
ask them questions, the tough questions and

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.700
I wanna be able to answer it for 'em.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.320
So that's one thing that consists of man time,
it consists of obviously doin' fun things.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.920
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: My kids are they're simple
in a sense like my youngest son if I put him

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.720
in the car on the expressway and drop the
top and we rollin', he great, that's amazing.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720
[laughter]

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720
He like, "Faster, faster."

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720
[laughter]

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.260
I'm like, "I don't wanna get pulled over but,"
--

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.260
[laughter]

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.380
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: but, so I got to drop the top
to make it seem like we goin' real fast and

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.420
he's like lovin' it.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.290
So it's like certain things is just to me
when we spend time together and no one else

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.020
is involved in that moment.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.020
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.140
Are there things that you feel like you haven't
been ready to explain to them yet that they've

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.370
kind of come to you with the man talks?

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.010
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Not really, I mean, like I
said I'm pretty honest with 'em.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.340
I think it's things that they not ready to
ask me yet.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.340
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.529
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Most anything I don't think
they still tryin' to make sure they get as

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:55.910
comfortable as possible to be able to open
up in a sense.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.820
They still a little guarded on certain things.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.020
It's tough for them, they goin' through things
that I've never been through so I tell my

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.260
oldest son, "You know what I don't know what
you goin' through.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:16.221
I've never been the son of a quote unquote
celebrity basketball player and all the stuff

00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.221
that he go through.

00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.180
If I have a bad game he gonna hear about it
in school.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.500
The kids gonna talk about his dad.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.750
So I don't know how to --

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.750
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.190
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: When I grew up everybody Dad
sucked, it was --

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.190
[laughter]

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.190
it was [chuckles]

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.190
[laughter]

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.660
it was the way of the world.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.660
[chuckles]

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.660
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.660
[laughter]

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.390
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: and so it's a lot different
[chuckles]

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.390
[laughter]

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.390
different now.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.700
But so it's tough, it's tough man, he deals
with a lot of emotions that I've never had

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.370
to deal with and that I don't really understand
and I'm tryin' to teach him how to handle

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.920
things in a certain way, so.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.200
&gt;&gt;presenter: Do you ever worry about that
they'll have a strange perspective on the

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.540
world that's, because, I mean their life is
so different than yours was when you were

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.960
that age and there is a difference between
being the son of a famous person.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.200
Do you ever worry about that perspective?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.430
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I worry about it a lot.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.000
Everybody so much when you're young and you
get older you start thinkin' about your family,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.600
you wanna give your family everything you
didn't have and so I worry about givin' 'em

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.740
too much, they might not have the work ethic
that they need to be successful.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.750
I mean, they not gonna live off my money 'cause
I'm gonna retire and live off my money --

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.750
[laughter]

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.950
so I think about all these things.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:39.291
It's not necessary, it's not easy and everyone
in the world thinks that, "Well, I know it

00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:43.180
might not be easy but just give me that money
and I'll make it work."

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.089
That big and small, more money, more problem
stuff --

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:47.089
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:48.660
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: that, it makes it a little
harder.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.230
I think my parents, I think it was very simple
to be my parents.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.649
We don't have anything so you don't get anything.

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:56.649
[laughter]

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.460
Sounds simple enough to me.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.460
[laughter]

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.860
[chuckles] And I understood that.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.690
But it's tough but, like I said, I'm still
learnin' and only thing I can hope is that

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.670
I always say I'm raisin' future leaders.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:15.080
My son is 10, my oldest son is 10, Zaire,
Zion is 5, and my nephew Dahveon who lives

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.500
with us as well he's turnin' 11 next week,
so I'm raisin' these future leaders of the

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.130
world and I gotta try to do my best job that
I can to hopefully raise 'em to be better

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.130
men than me.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.130
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.520
And Zaire likes to play basketball, right?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.570
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, it's just sickening.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.570
[laughter]

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.360
&gt;&gt;presenter: So you said in the book that
you made this deal with him when he was nine

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.490
that he could play but he had to play for
fun only --

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.490
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.490
&gt;&gt;presenter: like he had to play because he
wanted to be having fun.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.490
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah,.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.940
&gt;&gt;presenter: Do you think that that's going,
I mean in the book you talk about how you

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.380
like to play for fun but there are times when
you're not, you're clearly not playing just

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.880
for the fun of it --

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.880
&gt;&gt;presenter: you're fiercely competitive.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880
&gt;&gt;presenter: Do you feel like you worry about
that with him, like do you feel like that's

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.880
goin' well?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.100
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I got double, it's like
I got double standards.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.100
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100
[laughter]

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.080
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I'm tellin' him just to play
for fun and like leave the refs alone and

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.940
don't have an attitude out there and I know
he's like, "Dad, I watch you play --

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.940
[laughter]

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.540
and like what are you talkin' about?"

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.540
[laughter]

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.580
So, but I do this, I told him I don't want
no pressure, I don't want him to put pressure

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.250
on himself because it comes with bein' my
son.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:22.670
So automatically everyone he plays basketball
with is, on one hand, they're gonna come after

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.670
him.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.529
On the second hand, they expect him to be
this amazing player.

00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:30.820
But if he wants to play this sport I want
him to play it because he enjoy playin' it,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.820
he havin' fun.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.190
I mean, he's in fifth grade now, I mean, you're
not workin', you're not makin' no money off

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.190
this --

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.190
[laughter]

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.190
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: so why stress yourself.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.190
[laughter]

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.190
So I mean I'm payin' all the bills I ain't
get no help.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.190
[laughter]

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.190
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So I just try to tell him that.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.600
He had an episode one time where he, and this
was the moment where I became that dad.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.170
I always thought I was gonna be the cool dad
and sit in the crowd with my head low and

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.170
sit in the back.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.650
And then this moment I became that father
'cause he was out there, man, and everything

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.650
he was havin' an emotion day.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.300
It was a girl that he likes, she was a cheerleader
at the game, so first game cheerleadin' so

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.900
he was, he didn't know how to act.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900
[laughter]

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.899
[chuckles] His little brother, Zion, had kicked
him the groin so his groin was hurtin' from

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:12.899
the night before --

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:13.899
[laughter]

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:19.470
my dad, everybody was at the game, my dad,
the whole family was there so that's another

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.470
emotion.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.650
So he out there, every time a call is called
he runnin' to the ref.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.870
The coach say somethin' to him he talkin'
back and he's just not playin' so I stand

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.640
up in the middle of the game: "Zaire!"

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.390
I never thought I'd be that dad.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.390
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.390
[laughter]

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.640
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I calmed myself but then I
went to talk to him at half time, "Hey, you

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.640
wanna got get in the car?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640
You wanna go?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.279
'Cause you not doin' what we say you're gonna
do.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:43.330
Second half he came out he was back to his
dancin' ways and --

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.330
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.330
[laughter]

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.330
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: and playin' --

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.330
[laughter]

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.330
doin' all those things.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.330
[laughter]

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.330
&gt;&gt;presenter: When --

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.330
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: [chuckles]

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.250
&gt;&gt;presenter: when you were in school you talk
about your sister used to push you academically

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.830
and I know that Coach Crean pushed you to
finish strong in school even though you left

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.830
early.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.520
But do you ever talk to your kids about how
you didn't finish, how you decided to go pro

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520
early?

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.220
And what is your perspective on the whole
going pro early I mean is it purely an economic

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.240
decision or?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.910
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I haven't, I haven't really
gotten to that conversation with them yet

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.000
about me leavin' early.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.440
For me, the decision, I think everyone has
a different reason why.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.529
Some people are just, they're so good, they're
so ready.

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:23.980
It's time for them to go to the next level.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.790
For me, I felt that I was ready to go but,
and then, I talk about this a lot.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.660
Financially, I was strugglin'.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:38.230
At the time I married, I was 20, 21, 20 years
old, married with a child that ate a lot and

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.230
--

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.230
[laughter]

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.230
needed a lot --

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.230
[laughter]

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.830
and I was makin' $220 a month.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.830
It was rough.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.140
And so it came to the point where I was like,
"I love college basketball, I would love to

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.959
get my degree right now, but I have to do
what's best for my family and these stomach

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.120
rumblins', it's not workin'."

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.940
So I had to take my, I had to go to the next
level and take a chance.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.620
So everyone has their own journey and their
own path to the reasons why they have to do

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.620
that.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.230
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.850
Professional athletes have this, have a pretty
bad stigma when it comes to being fathers

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.820
and fatherhood and you talk about, that's
one of the things you mention in there.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.290
Do you think that that portrayal is fair broadly?

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:28.790
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I think, I think it's fair
in a sense the one's that they focus on.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:33.899
I think just as much negative, just as much
as we focus on negative just as much positive.

00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:37.529
So I don't think it's just professional athletes.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.240
I mean, my dad was a professional athlete
and he wasn't around for the first eight or

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.399
nine years of my life then he eventually became
a part of it.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:49.720
So a lot of fathers out here, it's no secret
about it, that for whatever reason they have

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.280
left not even the home but they left their
responsibilities.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.970
But professional athletes anything we do is
gonna get a little bit more and rightfully

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.970
so.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.830
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So I think it's a lot of great
fathers as well and I think that's one of

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.429
the reasons that I wrote this book as well
to kind of shed light on those positive fathers

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:09.870
out there.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:17.540
Goin' through this process I get it, I get
situations why certain dads are not in the

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.540
house, let me just say that now.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.720
It wasn't me, I wasn't gonna stop fightin'
but it's not easy from a situation that I

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.220
dealt with where really tryin' to push me
out and really tryin' to make it impossible

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.490
for me to become a father to my kids.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.260
So I understand certain fathers to move on,
but I don't accept it, I'm not sayin' that's

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.680
what you should do, but I get it.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.800
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.059
There's a funny anecdote in there about your
kids are out playin' basketball and they're

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:47.610
callin' each other Lebron, right?

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.610
[laughter]

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.630
And you were kind of like --

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.630
[laughter]

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.790
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It's crazy.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.790
No matter what you do --

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.790
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.790
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: no matter what you do somebody
[chuckles] yeah, they, I mean they like me

00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.790
they --

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.790
[laughter]

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.700
I'm one of their top players --

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.700
[laughter]

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.480
but it's, they got they favorite players --

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.480
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: and everyone does.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
[chuckles]

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.280
&gt;&gt;presenter: But do they like know, is the
team a part of your life with the kids.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.850
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, yeah, they yeah.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:21.860
All of our, we have a family atmosphere in
Miami so all of our kids are friends of each

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.210
other's and they play.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:28.330
Like, if anybody ever really like focused,
if they did a reality show a day on the kids

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.490
of the Miami Heat players, they would see
that they only watch the first half of the

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.340
game, they never around for the second half
of the game because they be upstairs on the

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.020
basketball court playing they own game.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.020
[laughter]

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.140
Me and my kids have to make a deal like, "You
gotta watch at least two quarters."

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.140
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.950
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So they are very close, they
are very close to everyone on the team.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.710
Kids love guys that can fly and can do amazing
things in the air.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:58.390
So Lebron James is that guy that does all
those amazing things, so he's a favorite.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.891
But now he's gettin' pushed over a little
bit 'cause KD is now become the favorite in

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:02.891
my house.

00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:06.610
So we got to the finals and I'm like, "So
who you rooting for?"

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.610
[laughter]

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.610
&gt;&gt;[laughter]

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.630
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: [chuckles] They's like, "Dad
it's gonna be tough."

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.070
[laughter]

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.950
It's crazy.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: Because you guys are, you say
in there that you guys are pretty close right

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.630
now on the team, there's a family atmosphere,
like you said, down there, do you feel like

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.930
this championship was any different from the
last one?

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.590
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It is different, obviously
it's a different --

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.590
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.590
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: total different team --

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.590
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.540
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: from the standpoint of what
we've dealt with.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.980
When Shaq came to Miami, it was a love fest
–

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.980
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.810
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: everybody loves Shaq and the
Miami Heat and that team and we was able to

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.810
win the championship.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.960
That was my third year in the league and I
was like still young and just excited and

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.870
felt on top of the world and untouchable and
then reality set in.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.870
[chuckles]

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.200
And then, now winnin' this one.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.700
It took me six years from then to win another
championship and I've just been through so

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.880
much in my own personal life.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.370
And a lot of guys on the team, besides me
and Udonis who won in '06, no one else has

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.350
won a championship that we had on our team
so we had a lot of guys that really was humbled

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.970
by this game.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.910
And so this one meant a lot more for me because
of everything I've been through.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.790
When you go through, I had three surgeries
in between the time where I had shoulder surgery

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:30.690
that took me out for awhile, actually two
knee surgeries or whatever, and divorce, custody,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.900
lawsuits, everything I've dealt with since
these six years' span and to finally win it

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:43.070
it was kinda like just thank God that I've
stuck with it and that I believed in my ability,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:49.510
I believed in me but I continue to work because
I was written off so many times since then

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.200
and just kept fightin'.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.280
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.070
So since you are at Google, I thought we'd
talk a little bit about technology and the

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.520
Web.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.610
You're one of the 50 most followed profiles
on Google+ right now, I think you have two

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.490
million followers or somethin' and you have
millions of fans that follow you on other

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.150
social networks: Facebook, Twitter.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.960
How do you follow, how do you use your social
media?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.710
What's the role that it plays for you right
now?

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.480
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well, I use it so many different
ways.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:20.590
I mean social media's a good thing and a bad
thing 'cause you really have no private life.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.590
[laughter]

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.799
But I think it's a good thing first of all
'cause you really get to connect one on one

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.970
you get to connect.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.500
Me and you can connect just on Twitter and
you can really feel like you know him and

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.669
I know you, we might not never meet.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:35.990
How you doin'?

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.990
[laughter]

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.850
But I think I use it in so many different
ways to express myself from a standpoint of

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.940
people really getting' to know who I am.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.990
And obviously I talk about a lot of things
that I'm gettin' involved in and I'm doin'

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:58.070
whether it's Foundation, whether it's me showin'
up to a book signin' somewhere, me endorsin'

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.679
a product and wantin' people to try it out
and do these things.

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:09.470
I do so much but I talk about my kids a lot,
you see I have fun on there, with my fans

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.140
I try to have fun on there as much as possible.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.160
I mean I get talked about a lot on Twitter
so --

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.179
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: it's not easy to read all the
comments but I try to make light of it.

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:21.610
Someone say somethin' negative I say, "You
need a hug?"

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.610
[laughter]

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.710
"It's not my fault you're angry."

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.710
[laughter]

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.100
So, but I enjoy it, I'm amazed that that many
people will follow me and wanna know anything

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.100
about me.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.559
I've never thought that someday roughly all
these millions of people gonna wanna know

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:42.240
that my life is that interesting, I don't
think it is, but I guess somebody does.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.332
When you, I mean, a lot of this stuff is pretty
recent, when you started in the league this

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.370
stuff didn't exist

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.370
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: No.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:55.320
&gt;&gt;presenter: So I'm curious to get your perspective
on has all this stuff changed the sort of

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.290
public life of a star professional athlete?

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.670
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: No question it has.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.850
I mean this is a different time for professional
athletes.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:10.230
It's like I said some symbolism, everyone
know where you at at all, well not, it's not

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.640
always accurate because I've been in Miami
and somebody Twitted all the pictures, "Ah

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.929
I just seen D. Wade."

00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:18.919
It was the back of somebody's head it was
back in Tennessee somewhere.

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.580
I'm like, "I'm not out there."

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.580
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.580
[laughter]

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.610
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: But for the majority of the
time most people know where you at.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.610
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.280
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You can walk by and say, "Oh
I just seen D. Wade at walkin' into, walkin'

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.000
down the street with his young, what color's
that, is that teal?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Is that teal?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.520
Walkin' down the street with this lady with
curly hair with a teal shirt and took a picture

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.770
of us backing in lookin' like we goin' into
a hotel but we're really comin' to Google.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.390
[laughter]

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.811
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It's [chuckles] --

00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:48.811
[laughter]

00:23:48.811 --> 00:23:49.811
[chuckles] That's the way the world is so
--

00:23:49.811 --> 00:23:50.811
[laughter]

00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:53.470
it's the privacy is really, you really have
no privacy at all.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.470
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.470
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: And so.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.180
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well, so there's the privacy
aspect right and then there's the other aspect

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.870
right which is you have this instant communication
platform to every fan, journalists, whoever.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.000
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.610
&gt;&gt;presenter: So you have these younger guys
who are comin' like you that are pretty young

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.420
when they're comin' into the league and now
they have, they can just talk to a million

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.420
people by --

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.420
&gt;&gt;presenter: the push of a button.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.230
Do the more veteran guys see that as liability
or like a concern for the team dynamic?

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.030
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It could be dependin' on the
young guy comin' in.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.030
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.799
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You had a, if anybody had,
if Michael Beasley, Mario Chalmers and those

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:32.150
guys when they was rookies when they came
in together, if social media was big then

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.820
oh, we would have been in trouble.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.820
[laughter]

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.120
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Those rookies right there was
terrible.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120
[laughter]

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.220
We would have been in trouble.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:45.100
So I guess it just depends on the rookies
that come in if they mature or not so, yeah.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.100
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.910
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: They's bad.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.910
[laughter]

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.030
&gt;&gt;presenter: So I mean this is going to be
a central part of your kids' lives as they

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.880
get older but do you worry about them getting
exposed?

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.650
You talked a little bit about them getting
hassled in class right but like if they set

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.480
up a Twitter account or something like and
they're young do you worry about them getting

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.600
exposed in this sort of social media world
to all kinds of stuff that you wouldn't be

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600
comfortable with?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.620
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I mean I can't imagine
bein' a kid and growin' up in this time.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:19.660
The world is so different from obviously when
even when I was growin' up and I couldn't

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660
imagine.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:27.210
Only thing I could try to do is continue to
tell 'em right from wrong and hopefully they

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.750
continue to abide by the rules and things
that I'm tellin' 'em what's right.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.150
And I know there's gonna be times come up
when they gonna do things that I'm not gonna

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:40.500
approve of and hopefully they learn from their
mistake that they're making and they continue

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.820
to grow from it.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:48.050
My kids haven't asked me yet for a Twitter
handle yet, they haven't asked me for to be

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:54.310
on Facebook and stuff yet so and they only
10 so hopefully I can hold out a little longer.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.130
If I had a conversation it's gonna be quick
it's gonna be like, "No."

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.130
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.130
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It's gonna be very quick.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.130
[laughter]

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.030
But I don't really wanna have that conversation
right now so they haven't asked for it yet

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.780
so we still in the phone and BBMin' and all
that stuff, they still cook with that so I

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:13.160
don't wanna go through somethin' and see a
Z. Wade Twitter handle and Zaire takin' a

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.350
picture in his own bedroom.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.350
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.350
[laughter]

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.360
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: They gonna do stuff like that,
like they gonna try to be sneaky but it's

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.049
gonna be a picture of them in they bathroom
as you might--

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:22.049
[laughter]

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:24.070
that's in the house, I know that's your page.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.070
[chuckles]

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.070
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.070
[laughter]

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.910
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: No one else has been in here
so --

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.910
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.910
[laughter]

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.230
You mention that your kids watch YouTube all
the time and you call Zaire the king of all

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.950
media in the book.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:35.950
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.100
&gt;&gt;presenter: I know you have a channel on
YouTube also.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.090
Do you have any favorite videos or channels
that you watch?

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.260
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You know what, like I said
Zaire is, he's the king of watchin' YouTube,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.790
him and my nephew watch YouTube, Zaire really
he gets up early just to watch YouTube before

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.790
he goes to school.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.790
[laughter]

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.790
It's a problem like --

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.790
[laughter]

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.790
it's seriously a problem.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.470
I think it still be dark outside, like early
in the sixes and he gets up and he dresses

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.100
real fast, he might forget to brush his teeth,
brush his hair, but he's gonna get on YouTube

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.100
--

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.100
[laughter]

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.640
and he's gonna watch videos, he gonna watch
all this stuff and it excites him.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.559
Me, I mean, I don't know I go as the wind
blow, sometime I'm on it often and sometime

00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:16.070
I'm not on it at all so I'm late on a lot
of things.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.360
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.230
In the book you talk about how when you were
growin' up some of your new school clothes

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.809
were clothes that had been left at the local
Laundromat right that's what used to --

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:28.280
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I used to get some nice
things out of the Laundromat.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280
[laughter]

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280
That's nice.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.280
[laughter]

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.731
&gt;&gt;presenter: Now you've been named the NBA's
best dressed player and somebody told me that

00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:35.190
you're good friends with Anna Wintour and
--

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.190
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Oh, Anna.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.190
&gt;&gt;presenter: and first of all, what?

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.190
[laughter]

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.190
But also --

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.190
[laughter]

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.049
do you ever think about,"How did I get from
from A to B on that?"

00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:43.169
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I have no idea how --

00:27:43.169 --> 00:27:44.169
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:45.169
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: how that happened.

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:49.470
I got a great team around me that's all, they
push me, they made Anna be friends with me,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.470
I think.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.909
[laughter]
No it's been cool.

00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:57.110
I think as a kid I've always loved the thought
of dressin' up.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.410
I wasn't able to do it my whole life but I
used to say I used to see my dad, my dad used

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.320
to work and he delivered pretty much delivered
boxes, he might have had a sexy title for

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.570
it but the man delivered boxes to other companies,
that's what he did.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.680
But he used to dress up on every Friday.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:19.510
I used to have to get up and iron his clothes
so I know he used to dress up every Friday.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.830
And I used to see that and I used to be like,
"Well, one day when I got to work this is

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.320
how I wanna go to work."

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.930
So my thought of dressin' up came from that
and then just goin' through life and now you

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.440
startin' to feel who you are and see what
you like and I got into a great situation

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.010
with my stylist where she kind of like pushed
me out of my comfort zone in a sense.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.690
I still get flak, and my sister not here but
she always give me flak about what I'm wearin'

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.559
cause she like we wear the same stuff like
--

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:46.559
[laughter]

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.909
like, "Your pants are red, I got the same
pants on."

00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:49.909
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:50.909
[laughter]

00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:53.049
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So like but like she's pushed
me and now I'm just comfortable.

00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:55.150
If anybody seen me on Letterman the other
night I had on this bright yellow jacket,

00:28:55.150 --> 00:29:00.390
it was like the seat covers right there and
I wasn't comfortable in it but she was like,

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.400
"Come on you're gonna look good.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400
I mean you gotta put it on."

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.320
And I was like, "Forget it."

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.190
And I walked out there with as much confidence
as possible and hopefully I didn't get murdered

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.760
for wearin' the yellow jacket.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.429
But it actually didn't look too bad once I
kept watchin' it.

00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:15.429
[laughter]

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:16.429
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:29:16.429 --> 00:29:19.690
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: My business manager she told
me she couldn't hear the first half of the

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.270
interview because of my jacket was so loud.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.480
[laughter]

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.370
But it worked and when I walked out David
was like, "Is that yellow?"

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.990
I was like, "Yes."

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.990
[chuckles]

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.990
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.980
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So I enjoy it and havin' the
opportunity.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.220
Last night I went out to Fashion Night Out
and last year was my first year here and I

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:47.600
couldn't believe how many people was so excited
about Fashion Night Out and it was like a

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.250
big concert goin' on, it was like everything
in one, it was like everything like so many

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.470
people on the street you can't drive nowhere.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.059
So last night really bein' a part of goin'
to the Calvin Klein and bein' a part of the

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:02.850
Calvin Klein Collection and sittin' next to
Anna Wintour signin' my book and signin' the

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.750
Vogue Magazine was kind of like a cool moment.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.720
I just think about how far I came to be here
so fast so like I said, I mean, we must have

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.490
somethin' on Anna, I don't know what it is
--

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.490
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.450
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: but it's good to have a great
relationship with someone who's a legend and

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.419
respected so much the way she is.

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:20.429
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:30:20.429 --> 00:30:22.700
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: She's nice to me, I don't know
about everybody else.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.700
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.700
[laughter]

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.520
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I seen September, too, and
I was like, "What, I don't know about this

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.520
one."

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.270
But now she's very nice to me so.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.350
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's cool.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.520
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Thought I'd add that.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520
[laughter]

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: [laughs]

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.409
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let's talk about, I have just
a couple last questions here and then we'll

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:42.740
open it up to everybody here about the future
for you.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.789
So where do you picture yourself right now
in 10 years?

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:51.870
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well, I won't be playin' hopefully.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.780
I'll be 40 so hopefully I'll be retired.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:01.240
And hopefully that all the opportunities that
are being created now, there's so many doors

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:07.770
that I'm so blessed to be able to walk through
hopefully I'll continue to find my niche of

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.770
what I wanna do next.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:14.600
Like I said I got so many, I got too many
things that I'm tryin' to do right now.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.220
But I think this is the right time for me
to figure out what's next for Dwyane Wade

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:26.679
even though I still wanna play at least another
seven years.

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:33.530
I think that'd be good in an ideal, perfect
world and then after that I can start stalking

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.530
my kids.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.530
[laughter]

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.850
I told Zaire I was like, cause I always tell
him, "Y'all gettin' out of my house one day."

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.909
I be like, "Eight years, you outta here son."

00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:45.830
But so then I told him I said, "Once you go
to college I'm gonna buy an apartment right

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.830
by your dorm room."

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.830
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:48.830
[laughter]

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.410
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: "I'm gonna [chuckles] I'm gonna
live through you."

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.410
[laughter]

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.520
So I'll just hopefully move into the next
phase of my life and --

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.860
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: do somethin' that I again enjoy
doin' and but also spend a lot of time with

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.860
my kids.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.820
Zion at the time will be, like, if I retire
when I want to will be like 12 years old --

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.870
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: really gettin' into the meat
of his goin' to high school soon so it'll

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.730
be kinda cool.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.980
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.630
You mentioned in there that Shaq was one of
the people who really introduced you to the

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:18.630
world of like being --

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.799
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Silly.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:24.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: young, like, but yeah, yeah,
but also being a brand or like being a personality

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.690
beyond --

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.690
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: the game.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.690
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: Like to you feel like that has
started you on that trajectory to get ready

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.799
for some post-game stuff, too?

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:34.179
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, it was great havin' Shaq
at the time when I did.

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:36.720
It kind of helped me come out of my shell.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.570
We would have not been able to do this interview
years ago, no way possible.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.450
I'd have been lookin' at that clock nervous,
sweatin' like, "I got an hour?"

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.450
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.450
[laughter]

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:47.700
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: It's no way I'd of been able
to sit up here.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.490
But so kind of bein' around him kind of helped
open me up a little bit.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:59.400
He came along, he coined me Flash at the time
and kinda gave me a different person to be.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.230
So I really fed into it, like I really was
Flash on the basketball court, like don't

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.230
call me Dwyane.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.230
I am Flash.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.230
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.230
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: That's weird.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.230
[laughter]

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:13.370
But so it really was big and I think it just
opened me up to people to really see who I

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:19.850
am and me to see who I am in a sense and not
be the introvert kid that I was when I was

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.850
young.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.850
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:30.940
Again goin' to the 10 year, 15 year range
like what is the thing that you most want

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.470
for your kids when they get to that age?

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.980
Like what is the thing that you wanna make
sure is just right with them?

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:42.789
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well, I mean to me obviously
I think I want them to have an unbelievable

00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:49.059
education, I want them to kind of have their
vision and their dreams of who they think

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:50.059
they wanna become.

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:56.080
I'm a big believer in dream big and vision
boards and all that, I'm a big believer in

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.080
that.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:03.650
It's puttin' down what you wanna be, who you
wanna be and it's no problem with workin'

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.650
towards that.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.659
And if somethin' steer you in a different
direction then you take that road, but you

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:10.659
need to have a vision.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:15.280
So hopefully around that time they, I'm payin'
a lot for their education, seriously it's

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.271
like college, like college fund and my son's
five years old, it's like it's a lot of money.

00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:21.840
So it better work out.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840
[laughter]

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.830
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: So but hopefully on my end
it's just make sure that I take care of my

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:33.399
responsibility, my job, to make sure that
they don't have the concern, if they can't

00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:37.810
right away find out what they wanna do or
find a niche that they have enough security

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.810
--

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.810
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.810
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: to fall back on.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:41.810
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.960
Alright cool, so let's open it up, there's
two microphones, I think, so for questions

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.210
just line up and we'll just alternate back
and forth.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.540
[pause]

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.159
You're first [ indistinct ], you wanna go
for it?

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.720
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hey D. Wade, a big fan.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.960
So like you're like the father of style in
the NBA and you actually pull it off.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.420
What are your thoughts on like Russell Westbook
and Kevin Durant showing up --

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420
[laughter]

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.420
like clowns?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.420
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.420
So what's you're sayin', they don't pull it
off?

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.420
[laughter]

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.420
&gt;&gt;male #1: Have you seen [unintelligible]?

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.420
[laughter]

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.440
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I am not the one to judge.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440
[laughter]

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:20.530
But it's not for me, I couldn't do it but
he's what he's got and he's getting everyone's

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.530
attention.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.609
I get a question about Russell Westbrook fashion
every time I'm do somethin' about fashion.

00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:29.800
So he's doin' his job of gettin' out there,
so it works.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.430
But I don't think you would look good in it
--

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.430
[laughter]

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:40.859
and [chuckles] and I don't think I would look
good in it.

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.089
[laughter]

00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:44.089
So [chuckles]

00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:45.089
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hey there.

00:35:45.089 --> 00:35:46.089
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: How ya doin'?

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:47.089
&gt;&gt;female #1: Sara, huge fan as well from Miami.

00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:48.089
I grew up down there and I'd just love to
get your perspective on what it's been like

00:35:48.089 --> 00:35:49.089
raising your sons in Miami.

00:35:49.089 --> 00:35:51.170
People always ask me, I've been in New York
for five years now, "Are you ever gonna move

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.170
back down?"

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.850
It's always something I've considered but
I'd love to hear what you think.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.340
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Are you gonna move back down?

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.590
&gt;&gt;female #1: Maybe, maybe.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.140
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I just thought I outta add
to the people.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.359
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.359
[laughter]

00:36:04.359 --> 00:36:08.570
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: 'Cause when you retell the
story you be like, "Yeah D. Wade be askin'

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.460
me if I'm gonna move back down."

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.460
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.460
[laughter]

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.460
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: "People are always askin' me."

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.460
[laughter]

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.180
I do that all the time, I name drop.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180
[laughter]

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.200
[chuckles] I think my kids rather enjoy livin'
in Miami.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.330
I mean you think about obviously everyone
knows that it's the Sunshine State so they

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:31.260
enjoy the ability to be able to go out and
do many different activities outside, they

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.310
don't have to go through the winters, those
tough winters like in Chicago where they kinda

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.310
grew up in a sense.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:42.930
So I think they like it, I think they like
how every day, I remember goin' through the

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:47.240
season where we won 15 games but no matter
what when I woke up and looked outside and

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.630
went outside I was like, "Ah, it's not that
bad."

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:55.330
I think they like wakin' up to it's not that
bad kinda feeling 'cause when you're growin'

00:36:55.330 --> 00:37:00.810
up in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and all
those places it's kinda like, "Man, it's another

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.810
day?"

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.810
[laughter]

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.010
And you look out the window you like, "This
sucks."

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.010
[laughter]

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.930
So I think [chuckles] I think they like wakin'
up and and like, "Ah, let's go get it.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.930
Let's go to school."

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.930
It's cool.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:11.930
&gt;&gt;presenter: Nice.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:12.930
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thanks.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.930
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.290
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hey, I'm Aaron.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.550
If you're the most stylish guy on the team
who's the least stylish guy?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.550
[laughter]

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.550
[pause]

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.550
[laughter]

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.150
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Let me think, let me think.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.710
Do, do, do, do, do, do do.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.240
Oh Joe Anthony.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240
[laughter]

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.800
He's terrible, he's terrible, he's terrible.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.800
[laughter]

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.190
There's no help for him either so.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.190
[laughter]

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.290
'Cause he's cheap, 'cause he's cheap, he's
not gonna spend no money so --

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.290
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.290
[laughter]

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.331
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah and we got, so Joel Anthony
and James Jones.

00:37:43.331 --> 00:37:48.339
James Jones is, he [chuckles] is, I love him
he's one of the best teammates I ever had,

00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:49.839
one of the funniest guys ever.

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:55.849
But if we go on a two week road trip you'd
be lucky to get two pair of jeans outta him

00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:56.849
--

00:37:56.849 --> 00:37:57.849
[laughter]

00:37:57.849 --> 00:37:58.849
and more than two polos.

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:59.859
Like he keeps it simple as it get.

00:37:59.859 --> 00:38:03.300
He's gonna pack one pair of shoes, he gonna
pack two pairs of jeans, and two polos and

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.400
that's gonna be two weeks.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400
[laughter]

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.849
It's like you didn't think you gonna go eat
--

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:08.849
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:09.849
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: or, doesn't care.

00:38:09.849 --> 00:38:10.849
[laughter]

00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:12.340
&gt;&gt;male #2: You gonna help him out or no?

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.390
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: No, he's not spendin' no money.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.390
[laughter]

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:20.740
You gotta, it's an investment to dress nice,
it's very expensive now days and J.J. like,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.740
"For what?"

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.740
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.740
[laughter]

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.590
"I'm married with like five kids nobody wanna
look at me."

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.590
[laughs]

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.590
[laughter]

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.590
So I love him, it's hilarious.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:35.360
So we gotta a couple guys who don't really
get into the dressin'.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.640
They like to see what we wear and that's about
it.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.800
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thanks.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.700
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Hopefully J.J. don't really
hear me.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.840
You can't tell him what I said.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.840
[laughter]

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.010
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hey, D. Wade, [ indistinct ]. So
lots been said about Heat for the past two

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:52.150
seasons but you've been totally cool in media
I mean is it just you're a good actor or you

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.220
just don't care about what media says?

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.589
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, I don't.

00:38:55.589 --> 00:39:02.560
I'm not gonna say I don't care, I do care,
I'm not immune to it, but you can't really

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.500
let it consume your life in whatever you decide
to do.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.780
And I get talked about obviously with my fashion,
I get talked about when I don't perform the

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.720
right way, but no one can be as hard on me
as I can be on myself.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:21.330
So yes it's a part of the job and it's unfortunate
that media does that but.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:25.250
Now I think one thing that's great with social
network is you can kinda control your own

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:30.660
in a sense and you can beat 'em to it, [chuckles]
to beat 'em to the punch.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:38.260
So it's a part of it and it's not meant for
everybody to deal with it, to handle it so

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.270
I think that we do a good job of try and handle
the best way possible.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.800
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thank you.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.950
&gt;&gt;presenter: Over here.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.099
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi.

00:39:46.099 --> 00:39:49.720
When a lot of us were growin' up our parents
are always embarrassing us, we're very embarrassed

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720
of 'em.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.280
So I was wondering, as a celebrity, do find
that your kids are embarrassed of you at times

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.020
and of your friends, your friends' kids?

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.869
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Good question.

00:39:57.869 --> 00:39:59.420
They haven't told me yet --

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.420
[laughter]

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.369
but I'm sure there been a few times I ain't
performed right they've been like, "Man oh

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:05.369
--

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.369
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:07.369
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: I don't really wanna go to
school,"

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:08.369
[laughter]

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:09.369
'cause they gonna hear it.

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:16.530
But I think it's gonna hurt me when the day
comes that I'm not the cool dad no more.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:22.820
It's kinda comin' soon 'cause they already
tellin' me that so, but they don't really

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.840
mean it yet, I think so.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.840
[laughter]

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:34.180
So, but yeah, it's a time where you kinda
get away from, you grow out of it in a sense,

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:40.150
so it's gonna hurt me when I can't, I mean,
now I like kissin' my kids on the forehead,

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:45.240
there's gonna become a time when they not
gonna be havin' it no more.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240
[laughter]

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.270
And that's my boys, man, so it's gonna hurt.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.270
I'm gettin' emotional --

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.270
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.270
[laughter]

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.270
thinkin' about it.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.991
&gt;&gt;male #5: So Ryan, I lived in Miami for 20
years and I was at game three in 2006 when

00:40:56.991 --> 00:40:59.160
the Heat were down by 12 points and --

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.579
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: 13, go ahead, go ahead.

00:41:00.579 --> 00:41:01.599
&gt;&gt;male #5: 13, sorry, sorry.

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:02.599
[laughter]

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:03.599
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:04.599
&gt;&gt;male #5: 13.

00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:05.599
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: That's fine.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:09.230
&gt;&gt;male #5: Anyways and you took over the game
and even from before that I was a big fan.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.270
But my real question is more about fatherhood.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:17.579
So I have a five year old as well and I've
found that when I first became a father I

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:23.700
had this concept that I was gonna be his teacher
and that I was gonna be the one teachin' him

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.990
everything, but the more he gets older and
the more I get mature basically I've realized

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.060
that he is more my teacher.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.770
So I was wonderin' if you feel like the same
way?

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.349
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You hit it right on the, you
hit it right on the head.

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:41.200
I talk about it in my book, there's a passage
in there where I talk about learnin' from

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200
my kids.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.339
I'm learnin' how to be a father, I'm learnin'
how to be a parent from them, they teach me

00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:47.480
every day.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:53.820
And you guys see I like to make light of a
lot of situations, but it's seriously I took

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.240
parenting classes, like I said I go to their
therapy sessions, and it's times where situations

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.420
come up I have no idea how to handle it.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.070
But I'm learnin' from my kid, the personality
that he has, I'm learnin' from his history

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.900
of how much trouble has he got in before,
so I'm learnin' from them how to handle these

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.900
situations.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.800
So I learn so much, just as much as they gonna
learn from me, it's the same as I'm gonna

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800
learn from them.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.750
And I always tell them when we together I'm
like, "Hey, we learnin' on the fly together."

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.670
And that's just the way it is.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:31.700
There's no guidebook to tell you how to be
the perfect parent or perfect father or tell

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.770
you exactly how to handle every situation
that comes up.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:40.401
Sometimes you gotta go off your gut and we're
gonna be wrong sometime and hopefully they

00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.070
understand that and we gonna be right sometimes.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:47.480
So I'm glad to hear that you have that mentality
because that's exactly what I said in the

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480
book.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.090
But some parents don't have that mindset.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.670
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yeah.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.670
Thanks.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.970
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Thank you.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:08.720
&gt;&gt;male #6: So I was actually sitting here
listening to you and I realized that we got

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:14.990
a lot in common, like we absolutely love our
family, we love our children, and then I said

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.390
also we love basketball.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.130
Who's better, that's still debatable.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.130
[laughter]

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.130
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: [laughs]

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.130
[laughter]

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.390
&gt;&gt;male #6: But on a serious note, do you feel
any pressure with bringing your children up

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.820
in, if they say they love basketball do you
push 'em in that direction or do you try to

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.839
let them figure out what they wanna do?

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.109
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You know what I'm gonna come
back to that other part.

00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:30.109
[laughter]

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:31.109
I'm gonna answer your question first.

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:33.000
I'm just that person that just believe that
whatever they wanna do I'm gonna support and

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.810
obviously they wanna play basketball, it's
something that we can share together, but

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.420
it's nothin' that I would push them towards.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.190
When you tell me this is seriously what you
wanna do I will make sure that you have all

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.369
resources you need to be able to do it.

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:49.990
But I'm all about somethin' else.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:53.109
Like my youngest, Zion, he's played, he likes
soccer.

00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:55.890
Even though he quit last year he's back on
the team this year.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:56.890
And I'm like, "Ooh cool."

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:02.210
So now I'm tryin' to learn more about soccer,
I wanna get into soccer more.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:06.930
So they gonna be they own man and they gonna
have they own idea of what they wanna do,

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.489
and I applaud that and I celebrate that and
I want them to be that.

00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:11.489
Now back to --

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:13.829
[laughter]

00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:14.880
back to the basketball thing.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.100
I love your confidence, that's all I'm sayin'.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.100
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.100
[laughter]

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.100
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Anybody watch Love &amp; Hip Hop
in here?

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.100
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: Oh yeah.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.100
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Y'all watch that crazy show?

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.510
Don't he kinda look like the guy that's on
--

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.510
[laughter]

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.120
is married to the rapper, the girl who raps,
the good couple, the good couple?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120
&gt;&gt;voices in audience: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120
[laughter]

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.120
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah, the good couple.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.120
[laughter]

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120
Kinda looks like him.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120
[laughter]

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.670
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs] That could be him, that
could be him.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:37.670
[laughter]

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:38.670
Let's go over here.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.670
&gt;&gt;male #7: Hey, D. Wade.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.750
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Did you say that was a good
show?

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.750
Man.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.510
&gt;&gt;male #7: Hi, huge NBA fan here.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.890
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Thank you.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:51.770
&gt;&gt;male #7: I was just wondering what do you
think about the current era?

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:57.980
Obviously like when you guys came in 2003
that was an amazing year in terms of the talent

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.540
in the draft, but then there's been several
other years where it was just incredible players.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.540
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Yeah.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.599
&gt;&gt;male #6: Where do you think this current
era is in terms of the history of the NBA,

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:10.730
is it like a golden era, the talent, the teams,
the competition?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:19.220
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Well I think that obviously
I believe that 2003 was that year was a great

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.220
time for the NBA.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:25.400
I kinda felt like before that the NBA had
a couple down seasons in a sense and I felt

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.420
that there was new energy for the league that
it needed at the time.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:35.770
And I just think now that we're continuing
to get very good young players and you kinda

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:39.520
look at it and understand that our game is
in great hands with all the young players

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520
comin' up.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.859
So our game is as big as it's ever been.

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:50.390
And even though the older players before us
will argue and it's always debatable of what

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:56.670
era was the best era, I just think that our
era's the most important era to grow the game

00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:03.740
because we're doin' so much globally to grow
this game, so many kids really gettin' into,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.310
worldwide, really gettin' into the game of
basketball, it's so big everywhere.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.661
So I just think that we're doin' a great job
of continuing to try to grow it.

00:46:10.661 --> 00:46:15.510
I mean David Stern and the NBA has done an
unbelievable job of kinda changing the outlook

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:20.720
of how players was kinda viewed in a sense
and they've done an unbelievable job of that.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.890
So I'm glad that I'm in this era and not the
other eras.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:32.400
&gt;&gt;male #7: Since you're in New York tough
question, Knicks or Nets who's gonna be better

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400
this year.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400
[laughter]

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400
&gt;&gt;presenter: [chuckles]

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400
[laughter]

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.560
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: There's a tough question because
no one knows how the Nets are gonna come together.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.430
They put together a pretty decent team, they
gonna be pretty good, and then with the excitement

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.910
in Brooklyn and everything they put together
a good team.

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.490
But you never know how long it takes the continuity
to take, to really work.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:47:04.130
The Knicks kinda have some in a sense, they
did lose Jeremy Lin but they still have a

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.570
lot of the core of their team.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:10.270
So because of that they might start a little
faster than the Nets, you just never know.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:14.579
So I'm sure it brings excitement to the City
of New York and as a fan of the game I will

00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:17.510
sit back and do the same thing you're doin'
and watch and see who would be the best in

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.630
New York.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:22.900
&gt;&gt;male #7: I think it's gonna be the Knicks.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.900
[laughter]

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.900
[applause]

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.070
&gt;&gt;presenter: Alright, I think we have time
for one more.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.620
&gt;&gt;male #8: Hey, huge fan.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:33.819
I was just wondering you said your kids and
a bunch of the kids of your teammates play

00:47:33.819 --> 00:47:34.819
basketball all the time.

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:35.819
Who's the best?

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.819
[laughter]

00:47:36.819 --> 00:47:37.819
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: Of all the kids?

00:47:37.819 --> 00:47:39.380
&gt;&gt;male #8: Of all the kids on your team, yeah.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.750
&gt;&gt;Dwyane Wade: You know that's a great question
because if you ask each of them they would

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:44.970
all say themselves.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.970
[laughter]

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.680
Yeah, so I don't get the luxury to be able
to watch them play together.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.040
I think right now a lot of it has to do with
who's the oldest and who has the most height,

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:02.010
so they ain't reached the point they're all
that talented yet.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.160
But they be havin', they be competin' up there.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.780
There's been a couple, separate them a couple
of times I heard.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.780
[laughter]

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:14.520
They get real and so it's good, it's good
and some of them play together like AAU Basketball,

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520
some of them play together.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:22.020
I think Lebron's youngest son, Bronny, Lebron
Jr., his older son, he plays like he's seven,

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.980
I think he plays like the 12 year olds or
somethin'.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.980
[laughter]

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.500
Like, but he try to humble him already.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.740
But he's gettin' that experience so they all
are gonna be in competition with each other

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.740
for a long time to come.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:38.510
So it's gonna be interesting to see how it
all shakes out.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.510
&gt;&gt;presenter: Cool.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.510
Alright, we'll wrap it up here Dwyane.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.510
Thanks very much for comin'.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:42.510
[applause]

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.510

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.513
