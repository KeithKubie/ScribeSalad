00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.140
Look at this map of China and tell me if,
from what we’ve learned so far, you can

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.330
tell me about the Chinese civilization. Yep,
rivers, big ones… and from them ran the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.380
bureaucracy and technology necessary for controlling
water.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.420
Like Egypt, Sumer, and Mesoamerica, ancient
China represents a hydraulic civilization—one

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.730
that maintained its population by diverting
rivers to aid in irrigation—and one that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.360
developed writing thousands of years ago.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.630
In fact, there is an unbroken Chinese literary
and scientific tradition from this time on—not

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.210
true of Egypt, Sumer, or Mesoamerica.
And from writing, Chinese scholars naturally

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.210
developed a critical invention in knowledge
transmission and state control: you know it,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.150
you probably hate it, the standardized test.
Today, we’re going to focus on the time

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.650
of the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties,
a time of great technical innovation. But,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.489
before we get to the Song, let’s take a
tour through the ages and explore key elements

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.960
of Chinese scientific culture.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.560
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.070
From the beginning, science in China was a
product of the state. The very first Chinese

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.810
dynasty, the Xia, supported astronomical
research to create more accurate calendars.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.850
Later, between 400 and 0 BCE, Chinese scholars
measured the length of the solar year to 365.25

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.979
days, predicted eclipses, recorded supernovas
and sunspots, founded a Bureau of Astronomy,

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.750
and even determined the 26,000-year cycle
of the precession of equinoxes!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.570
Alongside this research, Chinese culture developed
a grand model of the cosmos: in an infinite,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.910
empty space—enclosed by the great celestial
sphere—celestial bodies float around, directed

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.900
by a h“hard wind.”
This mysterious force explained how the stars

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.799
and planets moved around.
The earth sits, still, at the center of the

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.299
system. On the earth, in a zone between the
four points of the compass, stretches the

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.730
Middle Kingdom—China. The cosmos revolved
around not just earth, but China itself.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.170
And in the symbolic center of China stands
the Son of Heaven—the emperor.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.780
The ancient Chinese states, like others governing
large populations, developed complex ideas

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.540
about human society.
The most prominent early Chinese thinker was

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
Confucius, whose philosophy emphasized the
importance of tradition, etiquette, respect

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.779
for elders, and for the patriarchy.
Confucianism’s focus on an orderly human

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:38.260
world conflicted both with Buddhism’s transcendental
orientation toward a reality beyond this one,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.680
and the proto-scientism of Mohism
and Legalism, which were contemporary schools

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.420
of thought that privileged rational laws.
Despite competition from these other schools,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.329
Confucianism influenced a lot of later thought.
The official state ideology of the Song was

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.620
neo-Confucianism.
China was first unified in 221 BCE, in the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.969
Qin Dynasty. But it was the succeeding
Han Dynasty that instituted an imperial university

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.090
and the state examinations, also called the
civil service or imperial examinations.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.559
The state exams, which were open only to men,
were a way of ensuring that the central administration

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:16.819
had enough trained civil servants to oversee
the collection of taxes and building of roads,

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.510
maintain a large standing army, and roll out
agricultural reforms.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.510
For the examinees, it also meant a chance
to jump from a lower class to a higher one.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.340
Passage of even the first level of exams led
to exemption from corvée labor,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.079
which was part-time unpaid work for the state.
Science, however, did not figure much into

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.001
these state examinations. The exams mostly
tested memorization and recitation from the

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:44.790
important government and Confucian texts.
These shaped the values of the country: examinees

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.049
were well-rounded and shared a common culture
focused on law and order.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.109
So while the Chinese state did support research,
especially on topics such as agriculture,

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.139
meteorology, and astrology, and while there
was a large state system for educating people

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.999
and getting things done, these two threads
never quite entwined as they did at the Museum

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:08.159
of Alexandria or the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.
This brings us to the Song Dynasties.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.919
The Song state produced a lot of infrastructural
and social change across China, starting with

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.049
the key to everyone’s heart, their stomachs.
During the eighth century, rice cultivation

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.510
took off in southern China and the Yangzi
Basin.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.850
Then, in 1012, the Song state introduced new
early-ripening and winter-ripening rice from

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.200
the Champa kingdom in what is now Vietnam
that allowed rice to be produced faster with

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.180
less water
The Song state reclaimed ricefield plow and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.230
paddle chain water-lifting devices.
These agricultural changes led to the growth

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.550
of a leisured middle class, increased trade,
and a growth in manufacturing.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.160
Within a century, urbanization skyrocketed:
urban population reached twenty percent of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.820
the total even as population jumped from fifty
million to one hundred and fifteen million.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.370
And we moderns know what hegemonic powers
want, right?

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.890
A gigantic state bureaucracy!

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.810
In medieval China’s case, this meant the
highly centralized mandarinate, a term referencing

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.110
Mandarin, the dialect of Chinese employed
in the imperial court.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.380
The bureaucrats who oversaw the imperial exams
became known as “mandarins.” The mandarinate

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.740
provided social stability and, thanks to the
exams, some insulation against corruption.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.460
Systematic knowledge production in abstract
natural philosophy was never unified. But

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.970
Chinese technē was another story.
Whereas scholars had high status, craftspeople

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.890
had low status. The state controlled most
industries, and the state was responsible

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.400
for programmatic improvements.
The list of Chinese “firsts” or true technical

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400
inventions is so long that it could be its
own episode.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.600
The wheelbarrow, silk production, earthquake
monitors, lacquer, gunpowder, the crossbow,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.670
porcelain, umbrellas, fishing reels, suspension
bridges, and paper money.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.100
As fascinating as this list is, it’s of
somewhat limited analytic value, because it

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.210
doesn’t tell us anything about the social
and political context of technological invention.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.340
What are the characteristics of a given society
that lead to new ideas? Does the state help

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.510
or hinder this work? Let’s look at some
examples.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.110
Sometimes a practical invention led to new
scientific knowledge after the fact. For example,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.880
the Chinese had tinkered with magnetic compasses
since 300 BCE, but the concept of attraction

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.410
to the North Pole was not understood for another
two hundred years.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.950
Other times, cultural desires drive lots of
little iterations that lead to major breakthroughs.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.640
For instance, Chinese artisans made paper
since the second century CE, although it may

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.710
have been developed even earlier.
And by 700, the Chinese also made use of a

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.930
printing press involving carved wood blocks.
In fact, the first Song emperor ordered the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.340
printing of a compilation of Buddhist scripture
that included 130,000 two-page wood blocks

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.250
in 5048 volumes!
But printing really took off in 1040, when

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.560
Song artisans introduced the first movable-type
printing presses using wood and, later, ceramic

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.380
characters. These helped standardize writing
and unify Song culture.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.570
Finally, sometimes the state would directly
support the creation of new knowledge.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.110
Sponsored by the state, Chinese artisans created
complex astronomical clocks and orreries,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.240
or mechanical models of the heavens.
During the Song Dynasty, civil servant Su

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.770
Song refined these techniques to construct
a gigantic machine that would replicate planetary

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.050
movements and allow the government to correct
the official calendar.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.470
Alchemy—or a systematic investigation of
“what is stuff?”—also took off with

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.620
state support, starting in the Han dynasty.
Thanks to this work, the Chinese had gunpowder

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.610
as of the mid-ninth century. But it took until
roughly the twelfth century, under the Song,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.360
to perfect the military application of such
a volatile substance.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.420
But as fascinating as medieval gunsmithing
is, the real achievements of Chinese technology

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.530
were in infrastructure.
This includes everything from taking raw ore

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.620
and making it into usable iron, to moving
vast quantities of water around.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.710
Medieval China saw an infrastructure revolution.
Show us what it looked like, Thought Bubble!

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.000
Iron production in China had been a state

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.171
enterprise since 117 BCE. But under the Song,
iron production skyrocketed, increasing by

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:13.810
sixfold from CE 800 to 1100. In 1078, for
example, the Song state foundries produced

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.900
125,000 tons of iron!
How did they do it? Knowing more about the

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.610
chemical properties of stuff! Specifically:
coal.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.710
By the late Song, households used coal for
heating, which was much more efficient than

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:32.079
charcoal. Coal burns hotter, for longer, and
doesn’t require deforesting the lands around

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:35.190
cities.
This allowed iron production to scale up without

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.870
destabilizing society. And iron workers used
water-powered bellows by the eleventh century,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:46.180
smelting ore with coke—a powerful fuel made
from coal which burns hot and clean.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.240
The Song state made 32,000 suits of armor,
16 million arrowheads, not to mention loads

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.079
of agricultural implements, every year!
In addition to metallurgy-backed military

00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:03.430
might, hydraulic engineering is vital in running
large states. But the Grand Canal took infrastructure

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.149
into a new scale.
Completed in 1327, the Grand Canal stretched

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:13.430
eleven hundred miles, from Hangzhou in the south up to Beijing in the north.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.350
This is about the distance from New York to
Florida. The Grand Canal allowed merchants

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.650
to ship up to four hundred thousand tons of
grain every year.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.709
The Great Wall is pretty wondrous, as far
as long-term engineering projects go, but

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:33.180
the Grand Canal was not only a technical project—necessitating
the water-level-adjusting pound lock (a technology

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.180
we still use in canals to this day) —but
a social and economic one.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.649
Thanks, Thought Bubble! The efficient moving-around

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:44.649
of goods is characteristic of the Chinese
world by the time of the Song—when economic

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:49.050
activity and population boomed alongside the
ability to grow more rice.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.470
The Canal also represented the powerful Chinese
state’s ability to engineer vast regions:

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.949
they connected smaller waterways to main rivers,
opening up where goods and people could travel.

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:05.029
But—as political winds shifted—certain
sections were expanded or left to silt in.

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:10.639
So centuries later, during the Ming Dynasty,
the Grand Canal had to be massively restored.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:18.480
The Ming repaired 40,987 reservoirs and planted
a billion trees. Billion… With a B.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.040
The story of natural philosophy in China is
similar to the story in other early states:

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.680
useful science was prioritized, not science
for its own sake.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.589
Given its resources, state support of research,
population, and impressive track record regarding

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:36.870
technical innovation, some historians have
asked why a “Scientific Revolution” didn’t

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.519
occur during Song Dynasty China.
But is this question useful in helping us

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:45.050
make sense of past systems of knowledge-making?
For one, many revolutionary technical achievements

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:50.699
in medieval China were made over long periods
of time by anonymous, lower-class artisans,

00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:55.730
not individual, named scholars.
Two, in another sense, a “Scientific Revolution”

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.140
did happen!
Coal, water-powered bellows, gunpowder, compass-assisted

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.410
navigation, centuries-long hydraulic engineering
schemes, movable-type presses, massive urbanization,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.820
and research-driven agricultural intensification—added
up, these sound pretty revolutionary! And

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.000
many of these inventions traveled well beyond
China.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.860
But! The Song state fell to—wait for it—the
Mongols…

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.309
….so these achievements didn’t all persist
in time. The more important point is that

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:29.339
changes in how cultures have understood and
manipulated the natural world don’t follow

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:33.430
a single predictable model.
Chinese historians have seriously challenged

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.420
the assumption that a so-called “Scientific
Revolution” is a necessary path for all

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.610
civilizations.
Next time—we’ll zoom in on the field of

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:46.449
medicine and compare systems of making knowledge
about health across Eurasia and north Africa.

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:50.110
