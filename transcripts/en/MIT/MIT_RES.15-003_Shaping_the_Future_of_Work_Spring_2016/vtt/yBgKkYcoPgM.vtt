00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.800
Let's boil the
3,000 year history

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.500
of work down to three minutes.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.620
First, there were
hunters and gatherers.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.450
Everyone contributed,
and their business

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.630
was basically to survive.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.290
Eventually they began to
tame plants and animals,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.130
opening up new kinds of work.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.960
And, if you were
lucky, pleasure.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.310
In early civilizations,
powerful ruling classes

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.350
emerged for the first time.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.490
They could outsource work
to slaves and servants

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.520
because that mundane,
hard work was considered

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.919
beneath their dignity,
even though it

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:51.210
made their lifestyles possible.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.126
In the Middle Ages, new
religious philosophies

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:54.450
changed that.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.360
Working hard became synonymous
with doing good, pleasing God,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.990
and repenting for one's sins.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.620
Then came the rise
of the family farm.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.010
Working the land took
on a sense of community.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.780
All family members
literally pitched in,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.570
depended on each other, and the
farmer's work was never done.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.190
But as civilization ticked
on, more and more people

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.860
moved to cities.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.220
In those cities, artisans
specialized more and more,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.410
and along came the
craft stage of work,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.910
like shoemakers and
carpenters, all very skilled

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.670
and specialized.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.110
Then the Industrial Revolution
came along and brought with it

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.840
mass production.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.570
Humans adapted.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.410
New kinds of factories
created new kinds

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.650
of workers eager to earn a
living however they could

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.500
in a rapidly changing world.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.280
Some workers banded together.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.040
They took historic stands
for humane work conditions

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.800
and demanded all kinds of
fundamental rights including

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.440
the 40 hour work week.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.700
The development of computers,
the World Wide Web,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.810
and widespread
education ushered us

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.970
into the
knowledge-based economy.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630
As fewer people
and fewer hours are

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.570
needed to do the
work of yesterday,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.680
people are adapting again.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.740
Today some do work that didn't
even exist five years ago.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.850
So here we are.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.571
Is this the end of
work's evolution?

00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:21.070
No.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.110
How you live and work
will invent the future.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.740
You'll work to eat.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.060
You'll eat by outsourcing food
production to other workers.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.970
You'll tap into a deep human
drive to work on something

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.790
and to make a genuine
difference doing it.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.510
You'll rely on your networks
and connections to help you out,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.600
and you will help
others in turn.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.270
You'll specialize
in something no one

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.310
has thought of before
using technology

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.980
no one's seen before.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.680
You'll wonder how to better tip
the balance of work and life

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.390
to the needs of a new world.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.750
So keep on working,
creating, and inventing

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:05.190
the future of work.
