00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.820
I remember the arugula phase.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.120
Every time I walked towards your
desk you smelled like a salad.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.260
Hello everyone, my name is Lana Hum.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.300
My name is Mack Cole-Edelsack.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.600
We are two members of the Exhibition Design
team at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.420
As exhibition designers, we work with the
curators and a large team at the museum to

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.140
craft the environments
that house the exhibitions.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.100
We wanted to give you a
behind-the-scenes look and a chance

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.619
to ask some questions about what
goes into making these exhibitions.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.079
Questions like what are the considerations
exhibition designers have to take into account?

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.100
Things like wall placement, colors,
lighting, conservation requirements.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.010
Working with artists and also
making sure that all of it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.500
maintains true to the curators' vision

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.300
and the meaning behind
what they are hanging.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.920
Or how does one become an exhibition designer.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.079
We'll answer those and a whole lot more, so
please leave your questions in the comment

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.850

to tune in live when we'll

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.730

and be sure to subscribe to the museum's YouTube

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.060
See you then.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.760
I know.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.719
We can talk about
arugula like endlessly.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.719
No problem.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:20.219
Exactly.
