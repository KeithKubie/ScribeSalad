00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Please welcome the 14th
Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.220
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.520
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.400
Hello and welcome.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.250
I'm delighted to see all
of you here with us today

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.850
for our new poet laureate's
opening reading.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.510
You may clap right now.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.340
As the Librarian of Congress,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.280
I'm charged with appointing
the poet laureate consultant

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.440
in poetry every year, a
position that, by law,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.770
is described as equivalent to that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.740
of poet laureate of
the United States.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.410
What an awesome responsibility.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.250 position:56%
The Library surveyed over 120 poetry
experts from coast-to-coast: editors

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.090
and critics, publishers,
bookstore owners, and of course,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.430
our former poet laureates.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.090
And in the end, the
choice was crystal clear.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.250
But before I sing the
praises of our new appointee,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.830
I want to introduce
a very special guest.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.330
This year, for the first time ever,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.060
our nation has its own national
youth poet laureate [applause].

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.550
Now, this position was almost
a decade in the making.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.620
In 2008, the literary
organization, Urban Word,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.450
worked with New York City to launch
their youth poet laureate program.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.150
And since then, 41 other
cities across the country,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.630
from Seattle to South
Florida, Boston to Los Angeles,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
Madison to Baton Rouge,
followed suit.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.050
And this past year, Urban Word
identified its first group

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450 position:56%
of regional national youth poet
laureate finalists in the Northeast,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.310 position:56%
Southeast, South, Midwest, and West.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.970
And in April, they named the first
ever national youth poet laureate.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.600
Now, Urban Word didn't
do it all alone.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.320 position:56%
There were plenty of organizations
to thank for this nationwide effort.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.170
And please join me
in recognizing a few

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.980
of Urban Words' wonderful
local partners.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830
Do More Baltimore, the host

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.130
for Baltimore's youth
poet laureate [applause].

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.520
Dialect USA, the host for Prince
George's County's youth poet

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.710
laureate [applause].

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.130
And Words, Beats, and Life, the
host for the Washington, DC,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.270
youth poet laureate [applause].

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.790
And finally, thank you
to Michael Cirelli,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.290
executive director of Urban Word.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.700
Michael, could you please stand up?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.580
[applause].

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.770
There he is.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.020
Your vision and hard work has
paid off tenfold, and the Library

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.200
of Congress is delighted
to do its part

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.180
in promoting the national
youth poet laureate.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.470
And what an inspiring young woman
you found to take on that role.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.780
In her 19 years, LA native Amanda
Gorman has done more to speak out,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.020
organize, and give back than
most of us do in a lifetime.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.850 position:56%
I had the pleasure of riding the
elevator today with her grandmother.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.910
Can you please stand up?

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:20.780
[ Applause ]

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.820
Now, you can read about
Amanda's many accomplishments

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.250
in your program, or
talk to her grandmother.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.780
And tonight we have the privilege

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.480
to hear Amanda read a poem
she's composed especially

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.780
for this occasion.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.470
So please join me in
welcoming Amanda Gorman,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.510
the nation's first
youth poet laureate.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:57.790
[ Applause ]

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.040
&gt;&gt; Amanda Gorman: Amanda,
center yourself, get ready.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.430
Before I read my poem, I want to
give my most sincere thank you

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.570
to the Library of Congress and
Tracy K Smith for involving me

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.170
in such a phenomenal occasion.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.770
So a round of applause to this
program, please [applause].

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.500
My poem is called In This
Place, an American Lyric.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.430
There's a poem in this place
in the footfalls in the halls

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.850
in the quiet beat of the seats.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.200
It is here, at the curtain of day,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.390
where America writes a lyric
you must whisper to say.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.700
There's a poem in this place in
the heavy grace, the lined face

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.010 position:56%
of this noble building,
collections burned and reborn twice.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.900
There's a poem in Boston's Copley
Square where protest chants tear

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.200 position:56%
through the air like sheets of rain,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.480
where love of the many
swallows hatred of the few.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.590
There's a poem in Charlottesville
where tiki torches string a ring

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.150
of flame tight round the
wrist of night where men

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.930
so white they gleam blue seem
like statues where men heap

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.150
that long wax burning ever higher
where Heather Heyer blooms forever

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.540
in a meadow of resistance.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.540
There's a poem in the great
sleeping giant of Lake Michigan,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.090
defiantly raising its big
blue head to Milwaukee

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.680
and Chicago a poem begun long
ago, blazed into frozen soil,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.850
strutting upward and aglow.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.930
There's a poem in Florida, in
East Texas, where streets swell

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.980
into a nexus of rivers, cows afloat
like mottled buoys in the brown,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.630
where courage is now so common

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.180
that 23-year-old Jesus Contreras
rescues people from floodwaters.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.460
There's a poem in Los Angeles
yawning wide as the Pacific tide

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.280 position:56%
where a single mother swelters in a
windowless classroom, teaching black

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.830
and brown students in Watts
to spell out their thoughts

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.210
so her daughter might
write this poem for you.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.280
There's a lyric in California
where thousands of students march

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.490
for blocks, undocumented
and unafraid;

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.360
where my friend Rosa finds the
power to blossom in deadlock,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.740
her spirit the bedrock
of her community.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.170
She knows hope is like a stubborn
ship gripping a dock, a truth:

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.770
that you can't stop a
dreamer or knock down a dream.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:16.450
How could this not be her city su
nacion our country our America,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:22.550
our American lyric to write a
poem by the people, the poor,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.450
the Protestant, the Muslim, the
Jew, the native, the immigrant,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:33.160
the black, the brown, the blind,
the brave, the undocumented

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.740 position:56%
and undeterred, the woman, the man,
the nonbinary, the white, the trans,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.870
the ally to all of
the above and more?

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.510
Tyrants fear the poet.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.850
Now that we know it
we can't blow it.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.950
We owe it to show it not slow
it although it hurts to sew it

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.180
when the world skirts below it.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.930
Hope, we must bestow it like a wick
in the poet so it can grow, lit,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:10.090
bringing with it stories to rewrite
the story of a Texas city depleted

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.890
but not defeated a history written

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:19.000
that need not be repeated a nation
composed but not yet completed.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.930 position:56%
There's a poem in this place, a poem
in America a poet in every American

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:32.030
who rewrites this nation, who
tells a story worthy of being told

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.070
on this minnow of an earth to
breathe hope into a palimpsest

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.200
of time, a poet in
every American who sees

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.410
that our poem penned
doesn't mean our poem's end.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:52.830
There's a place where this poem
dwells, it is here, it is now,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.750
in the yellow song of dawn's bell

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.430
where we write an American lyric
we are just beginning to tell.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.510
Thank you.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:38.500
[ Applause ]

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.780
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, thank you,
Amanda, for your wonderful poem

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.430
and for setting the stage for
our poet laureate, Tracy K Smith.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:00.570
If Amanda represents where poetry
can go, Tracy has brought us here

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.190
and there in poem after
poem and book after book.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.350
During the selection process, I had
the opportunity to sit down at home

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.920
and read Tracy's Pulitzer
prize-winning poetry collection,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.630
Life on Mars, and I was wowed.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.260 position:56%
In poem such as My God, it's Full of
Stars, the Speed of Belief, and Yes,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.580
Life on Mars, Tracy takes us
farther than we imagine we can go,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.620
to the great beyond and
deeply inward as well.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.230
Her poems walk us through
their wandering.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.580 position:56%
Their power is that they can go
anywhere they want: scientific fact,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.770
pop artifacts, bits of
memories, and arguments of faith.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.350
They aren't simple
but they are direct.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.850
And they aren't afraid
to face the painful parts

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.110
of our past and present.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.310
My favorite moment in the book
came in the poem, They may love all

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.550
that he has chosen and hate
all that he has rejected.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.580 position:56%
While the title dates back more than
2000 years to the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.460
the poem moves straight
to the present-day horror

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.220
of hate crimes making news.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.070 position:56%
Tracy shows us in a new and yet
intuitive way how hatred changes us.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.130
Instead of just reading about
hatred, she asks us to imagine it,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:28.880
to feel it, to own it, in a way
that can't be easily ignored.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.880
The great American poet
William Carlos Williams wrote,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.900
It is difficult to get
the news from poems,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.680
yet men die miserably every day
for lack of what is found there.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.500
Our great American poet and
newest poet laureate knows how

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.940
to give us the news our minds
and hearts and souls most need.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.510
Please join me in welcoming
Tracy K Smith.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:20.700
[ Applause ]

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.610
&gt;&gt; Tracy K Smith: Thank
you, Dr. Hayden.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.690
And thank you, Amanda.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.240
I feel so much joy
and hope and belief

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.780
when I hear your voice, Amanda.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.260
I know the future is in good hands

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.130
and that poetry will
remain alive and well.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.430
So thank you.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.220
And, Dr. Hayden, it's such an honor

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.220
to be selected and
introduced by you.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.590
I remember when I was very young,
I started but was never able

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.400
to finish a poem in
which I was trying

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.990
to imagine the afterlife
as a librarian.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.090
And I think I was on to
something, because moving

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.350
through these mammoth
buildings, through the hallways,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.180
the beautiful halls, and then
the underside of the building,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.270
all the tunnels, I realize
there's something magnificent

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.690
and divine that's housed here.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:22.820
But there's also something
ethereal that is born of the energy

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.240
and the belief that
builds places like this.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.100
So I'm extremely grateful
to be here tonight.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.850
I'm excited about the year
ahead and the conversation

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.920
that poetry will allow me to
have with my fellow Americans.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.800
So I thought I would go back to
the beginning and read a few poems

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.960
from each of my books and finish
with some newer work that makes

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.670
up my forthcoming book,
Wade in the Water.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.220
These are poems from
the Body's Question.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.420
A Hunger so Honed.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:08.410
Driving home late through town,
he woke me for a deer in the road,

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.350
the light smudge of it
fragile in the distance,

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.270
free in a way that made
me ashamed for our flesh.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:24.200
His hand on my hand, even the
weight of our voices not speaking.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:31.070
I watched a long time, and a long
time after we were too far to see,

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:38.000
told myself I still saw it nosing
the shrubs, all phantom and shadow,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.980
so silent it must have
seemed I hadn't wakened.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.150
But passed into a deeper,
more cogent state of dream.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.020
The mind a dark city,
a disappearing,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.890 position:56%
a handkerchief, swallowed by a fist.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.890
I thought of the animal's mouth
and the hunger entrusted it.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:06.980
A hunger so honed the green
leaves merely maintain it.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.950
We want so much, when perhaps
we live best in the spaces

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.020
between loves, that
unconscious roving,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.070
the heart its own rough animal.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.410
Unfettered.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:28.130 position:56%
The second time, there were two that
faced us a moment the way deer will

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:33.720 position:56%
in their Greek perfection, as though
we were just some offering the night

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.500
had delivered.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.090
They disappeared between
two houses, and we drove on,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.170 position:56%
our own limbs sloppy after that, our
need for one another greedy, weak.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.720
[ Applause ]

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.550
You're going to get
tired if I make you clap

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.530
after each poem, so don't worry.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.870
So a large portion of my first
book is dedicated to the memory

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.110
of my mother, who died
when I was 22.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.110 position:56%
And so I'm going to read just a
couple of sections from what I think

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:17.190 position:56%
of as the heartbeat of this book,
which is an elegy to her called Joy.

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.670
Imagining yourself a girl again,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:28.930
you ask me to prepare a simple
meal of dumplings and kale.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.390
The body is memory.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.370
You are nine years old, playing
hospital with your sisters.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:41.280
These will be my medicine, you
tell them, taking a handful

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.140
of the raisins that you love.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.690
They've made the room dark
and covered you with a quilt,

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.290
though this is the South in summer.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.960
The body's appetite.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.180
You savor the kale,
trusting this one need.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:05.070
But the body is cautious, does
not want more than it wants.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.690
Soon there will be a
traffic of transparent tubes,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.920
striking their compromise
with the body.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.890
When you close your eyes,
I know you are listening

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.290
to a dark chamber around
a chord of light.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:27.140
I know you are deciding
that the body's a question:

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.130
What do you believe in?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:39.570
It will rain tomorrow, as it rained
in the dark days after you died.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.990
And I will struggle with what
to wear, and take a place

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.780
on the bus among those
I will only ever know

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.920
by the shape their
shoulders make above the backs

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.540
of the seats before mine.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.410
It's November, and
storm clouds ascend

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.840
about the roofs outside my window.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.240
I don't know anymore
where you've gone to.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.350
Whether your soul waits here
in my room, in the kitchen

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.150
with the newly blown bulb,
or whether it rose instantly

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.910
to the kingdom of hosannas.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.880
Some nights, walking up my steps
in the dark, digging for the mail

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.110
and my keys, I know you are
far, infinitely far from us.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.200
That you watch in the way one
of us might pause a moment

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.920
to watch a frenzy of ants, wanting
to help, to pick up the crumb

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:45.050 position:56%
and put it down Close to their hill,
seeing their purpose that clearly.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.010
These are some poems from Duende.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:56.400
Many of you will recognize that
term as one that Garcia Lorca kind

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.430
of brought into the
wider vocabulary of art.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.370
It's used to describe the
wild, often times dark

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:12.210 position:56%
and unpredictable energy that we all
house, not just artists but people.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.550
And that a daring artist
might seek to draw out

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.970
and wrestle with in art making.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.320 position:56%
I loved that so much when I was a
student reading about it in workshop

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.200 position:56%
and saying, oh, I want to have that
kind of passionate sense of my work.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.730
And then years later, traveling,
I realized this sense of wrestling

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:39.180
with something that might undo
you and surviving the effort

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.790
with something remarkable to show,
something that's not just beautiful

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:48.080
but something that's raw
and damaged and profound,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.370
that's not just something
artists do.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.450
I think about the way that
people all over the world,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:01.660
all over our world, are wrestling
with something that seeks

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.120 position:56%
to undo them and they do their best.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.070
And oftentimes they overcome it.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.710
And so this concept became
something that had to do

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.220
with just the urgency
of being human.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.620
So I'll read you a couple of poems

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.300
from that book that's
thinking with it.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.100
The first one is set in
Spain, where the speaker

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.630
of the poem is observing the art
form, the traditional art form,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.920
of the deep song that Lorca
worked so hard to translate

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.940
to readers outside of Spain.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.500
This poem is called Duende.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.100
The earth is dry and
they live wanting.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.890
Each with a small reservoir of
furious music heavy in the throat.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.340
They drag it out and with nails

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.530
in their feet coax
the night into being.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.670
Brief believing.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.650
A skirt shimmering
with sequins and lies.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:05.350
And in this night that is not
night, each word is a wish,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:10.530
each phrase a shape their
bodies ache to fill.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.520
I'm going to braid my
hair braid many colors

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.260
into my hair I'll put
a long braid in my hair

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.330
and write your name there.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.310
They defy gravity to
feel tugged back.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.800
The clatter, the mad
slap of landing.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.020
And not just them.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.430
Not just the ramshackle
family, the tios, Primitos,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.870
not just the bailaor whose heels
have notched and hammered time

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.690
so the hours flow in
place like a tin river,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.000
marking only what once was.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.320
Not just the voices of
scraping against the river,

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.290
nor the hands nudging them farther,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:02.090
fingers like blind birds,
palms empty, echoing.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.680
Not just the women with sober
faces and flowers in their hair,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.890 position:56%
the ones who dance as though they're
burying memory, one last time.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.190
Beneath them.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.290
And I hate to do it here.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.860
To set myself heavily beside them.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.160
Not now that they've
proven the body a myth,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.800 position:56%
a parable for what not even language
moves quickly enough to name.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:37.190
If I call it pain, and try to touch
it with my hands, my own life,

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:44.580
it lies still and the music thins,
a pulse felt for through garments.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.140
If I lean into the
desire it starts from.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.820
If I lean unbuttoned into
the blow of loss after loss,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:24:00.510
love tossed into the ecstatic void,
it carries me with it farther,

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:06.710
to chords that stretch and bend
like light through colored glass.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.440
But it races on, toward
shadows where the world I know

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.040
and the world I fear
threaten to meet.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:23.610
There is always a road,
the sea, dark hair, dolor.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.040
Always a question bigger
than itself.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:38.510
They say you're leaving Monday,
why can't you leave on Tuesday?

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:45.500
[ Applause ]

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.450
And this poem is one that I
kind of think of as an example

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.680
of like the domestic duende.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.370
It's called Slow Burn.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:25:00.310
We tend toward the
danger at the center.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.710
Soft core teeming blue with fire.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.190
We tend toward what
will singe and flare,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.820
but coil back when brought near.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.270
Sometimes we read about
people pushed there

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.650
and left to recover, they don't.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.560
Come out mingled or not at all,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.870
minds flayed by visions
no one can fathom.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.820
I have a cousin who
haunts the basement

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.650
of my aunt's house,
drinking her liquor.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:40.320
The air around him is cold, and
he swings at it, working himself

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.810
into a sweat like a
boxer or an addict.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.510
Sometimes he comes
upstairs to eat her food,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.740
feeding the thing inside him.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:57.250
We laugh, thinking laughter will
make us safe, then we go home

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.300
and lie down in our lives.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:05.550
Sometimes when my thoughts won't
sit still, I imagine Marcus

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:13.190
down there awake in the dark, hands
fisted in his lap, or upturned,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.490
open in what might
be a kind of prayer.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:22.750
I'm certain the same thing
dragging his heart drags ours,

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.530
only he's not afraid to name it.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.670
Can call it up into the room and
swear at it, or let it rest there

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:36.230
on the couch beside him till
his had slumps onto his chest

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:42.240
and the TV bruises the
walls with unearthly light.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:49.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.900
In some ways, although
I didn't realize it

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:04.140 position:56%
when I was writing these poems, Life
on Mars is a book that's seeking

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.950
to answer that question from my
first book, What do You Believe in.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.330
And there are so many different
directions that the poems go

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.910
in an effort to bring
something coherent

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:20.610
and consoling together for me.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.530
This is a poem called
The Weather in Space.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:30.320
Is God being or pure force.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.760
The wind or what commands it.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.130
When our lives slow and we
can hold all that we love,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:45.480
it sprawls in our laps
like a gangly doll.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.340
When the storm kicks
up and nothing is ours,

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.890
we go chasing after all
we're certain to lose.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:03.450
So alive faces radiant with panic.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.540
Cathedral Ciche [phonetic].

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:14.380
Does God love gold.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.380
Does he shine back at himself
from walls like these leafed

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.410
in the earth's softest wealth.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.960
Women light candles.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.990
Pray into their fistful of beads.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.860
Cameras spit human light
into the vast holy dark.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.860
And what glistens back
is high up and cold.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.310
I feel man here.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.570
The same wish that
named the planets.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.420
Man with his shoes and
tools, his insistence

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.510
to prove we exist, just like God.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.310
In the large and the small.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.350
The great and the frayed.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.230
In the chords that rise
from the tall brass pipes

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.550
and the chorus of crushed cans.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.830
Someone drags over cobbles
in the secular street.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:20.990
There is a little bit of
us sort of science fiction

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:26.470
or wishful understanding of the
actual principles of science

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.050
that runs through this book.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:34.660
So I'll just read you a
little sample of that.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.710
You might remember from -- well, if
anyone ever read the novelization

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.460
of cupric's wonderful
film 2001 A Space Odyssey,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:49.460
it opens with the line -- or dot
dot dot, my God it's full of stars.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.850
There's something that
I'm not remembering

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.450
that precedes that statement.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.010
And then if any of you like
me ever saw the movie 2010,

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.370
that film opens with that quote.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:06.950
So that sense of the future that
I grew up on in science fiction

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.230
that was made in the '60s
and '70s, film mostly.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:16.530
With something that drove my
visual imagination in this book,

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.660
thinking about how
innocent those old versions

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:25.630
of the future always feel once
we've, you know, we pass them up.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.480
And so that's part of what's
running through this poem.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.990
But, of course, it's also
an elegy for my father.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.910 position:56%
So I'll read you just a few sections

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.850
in which some of these
things come up.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.580
My God it's Full of Stars.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.080
Perhaps the great error
is believing we are alone,

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.630
that the others have come
and gone, a momentary blip.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.970
When all along, space might
be chock full of traffic.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.850
Bursting at the seams with
energy we neither feel nor see,

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:06.590
flush against us, living, dying,
deciding, setting solid feet

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.950
down on planets everywhere.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.280
Bowing to the great
stars that command.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.810
Pitching stones at
whatever are their moons.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.380
They live wondering if
they are the only ones.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.760
Knowing only the wish to know

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:29.030
and the great black distance
they, we, flicker in.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.770
Maybe the dead know.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.460
Their eyes widening at last.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:39.400
Seeing the high beams of a million
galaxies flick on at twilight.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:47.040 position:56%
Hearing the engines flare, the horns
not letting up, the frenzy of being.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.340 position:56%
I want it to be one notch below
bedlam, like a radio without a dial.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.860
Wide-open, so everything
floods in at once.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:05.130 position:56%
And sealed tight so nothing escapes,
not even time, which should curl

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:09.240
in on itself and loop
around like smoke.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.130
So that I might be sitting
now beside my father

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.310
as he raises a lit match
to the bowl of his pipe

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.710
for the first time in
the winter of 1959.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:31.070
In those last scenes of cupric's
2001, when Dave is whisked

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:35.410
into the center of space,
which unfurls in an aurora

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.980
of orgasmic light, before
opening wide like a jungle orchid

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:46.560
for a lovestruck bee, then
goes liquid, paint in water,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.550
and then gauze wafting out and
off before finally the night tide,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.510
luminescent and vague, swirls in.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.410
And on and on.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:06.330
In those last scenes as he floats
above Jupiter's vast canyons

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:12.230
and seas over the lava strewn
plains and mountains packed in ice,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.820
that whole time he doesn't blink.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.560
In his little ship,
blind to what he rides,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.220
whisked across the wide
screen of unparceled time.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.220
Who knows what blazes
through his mind.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.040
Is it still his life
he moves through.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.150
Or does that end at the
end of what he can name.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:41.570
On set, it's shot after
shot, till cupric is happy.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.470
Then the costumes go
back on their racks.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.300
And the great gleaming
set goes black.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.880
When my father worked
on the Hubble telescope,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.090 position:56%
he said they operated like surgeons.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.840
Scrubbed and sheathed
in papery green.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.670
The room a clean cold
and bright white.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:10.560
He'd read Larry Niven at home
and drink scotch on the rocks.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.040
His eyes exhausted and pink.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.360 position:56%
These were the Reagan years, when we
lived with our finger on the button

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.930
and struggled to view
our enemies as children.

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:28.690
My father spent whole seasons
bowing before the Oracle eye,

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.240
hungry for what it would find.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.790
His face lit up whenever anyone
asked and his arms would rise

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.560
as if he were weightless,
perfectly at ease

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.940
in the neverending night of space.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.070
On the ground, we tied
postcards to balloons for peace.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.470
Prince Charles married Lady Di.

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.210
Rock Hudson died.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.480
We learned new words for things.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.430
The decade changed.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.140
The first few pictures
came back blurred.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.900
And I felt ashamed for all
the cheerful engineers,

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.990
my father and his tribe.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.380
The second time, the optics jibed.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.000
We saw to the edge of all there is.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.210
So brutal and alive, it
seemed to comprehend us back.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.010
I'll never now read this poem
and not think of this place.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.970
Because on my last
visit to the Library,

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.950
a wonderful librarian named Nanette

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:40.220
and her colleagues
pulled the archive

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.020
of Hubble space telescope
materials and set them up for me.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.780
And she said, I was
looking at these pictures.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.310
Everybody's wearing masks.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:50.000
They're in these clean outfits.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.580
But I was hoping one of
them might be your father.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.030 position:56%
But don't worry, I'm going to go
through his military archive and see

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.500
if I can find anything for you.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:07.150
So this is wonderful [applause].

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.690
I'm going to read some newer poems.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:09.990
I might go backwards.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:15.410
But I have a new book of poems that
will be coming out this spring.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.640
And a lot of the themes that
I've always been interested in,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.300
I continue to be interested in.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.280
I think primarily they have to
do with how we treat each other.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.420
Whether that means intimate
relationships or, you know,

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:35.240
the people we never ever meet but
upon whom our lives have an effect.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.220
And it's a book that's seeking
to explore that question

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.030
by looking backward toward
history in some moments

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.800
and also looking at
us now, as we are.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.940
And one of the things that I
find myself really thinking about

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.010
or maybe willfully meditating
upon is this notion of compassion.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:56.120
As an act or a mode that we
can choose to operate in.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.770
And often we fail to do that.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.000
So I'll reach you from
around this book

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.560
in which you'll hear
different versions

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.060
of that, that consideration.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.440
I think the other little thing
I'd say about this book is that,

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.060
whereas Life on Mars is trying
to imagine this universe,

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:19.020
the vast thing that we know like
a tiny little pinprick size amount

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:25.560 position:56%
of information about with certainty,
what I'm also interested in is what

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.920
that system belongs to or what
continuum it is a part of.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.620
And so I imagine that the
history of eternity is something

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.370
that I'm also trying to
will my brain to imagine.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.750
Because we're a part of it, right.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:43.750 position:56%
And what we do is imprinting that in
ways that we may not even recognize.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:48.110
So this is a small poem that kind
of dips its toe in that question.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:52.900
It's called Garden of Eden.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:59.670 position:56%
What a profound longing I feel, just
this very instant, for the Garden

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.930
of Eden on Montague Street.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.580
Where I seldom shopped,
usually only after therapy.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:13.790
Elbow soar at the crook from a
hand basket filled to capacity.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:19.670
The glossy pastries,
pomegranate, persimmon, quince.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:26.900
Once a bag of black Beluga lentils
spilt a trail behind me while I

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.070
labored to find a tea
they refused to carry.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.590
It was Brooklyn.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:40.930
My 30s. Everyone I knew was
living the same desolate luxury.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.190
Each ashamed of the same things.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.130
Innocence and privacy.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.620
I'd lug home the paper bags,

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.450
doing bank balance
math, and counting days.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:01.470
I'd squint into it or close my eyes
and let it slam me in the face.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:07.080
The known sun setting
on the dawning century.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:22.970
About five months ago, I visited
coastal Georgia to Geechee

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.420
and Gullah communities that
make up the Sea Islands.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:32.490
And I had the privilege to attend
a ring shout, which is a tradition

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:40.520 position:56%
that brings spiritual into just this
really beautiful living rhythmic

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.370
space that reminds us
of the deep connection

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.450
between African-American
tradition and Africa.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.480
When I went to this
performance, I had been --

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.120
so I had been in the South for
a number of days going to a lot

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.170
of sites of a very painful history.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.650
Some of which were marked,
many of which were not.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:03.070
And then I walked into this
space feeling, you know,

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:09.010
like a storm inside, just about
like, you know, who we are,

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.070
what we come from, what we are able
to acknowledge and what we're not.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.520
And a woman who was one of the
performers just walked up to me.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.240
I'd never seen her
before in my life.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.250
And she said, I love you,
and she gave me a hug.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.550
And I just lost it.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:27.220
I felt like, that's exactly
what my soul needed to hear.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.810
And I couldn't stop
thinking about her.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.260
And so this is the poem
that came from that.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.930
I've since met her again, and
her name is Bertha McKnight.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.250
And she's a member of the
Geechee Gullah ring shouters.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.930
And so this poem is
dedicated to them.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.230
Wade in The Water.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:46.850
One of the women greeted me.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:49.530
I love you, she said.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.270
She didn't know me.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.040
But I believed her.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:59.360
And a terrible new ache rolled
over in my chest, like in a room

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.270
where the drapes have
been swept back.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.650
I love you.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.020
I love you.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.470
As she continued down the
hall past other strangers,

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:16.470
each feeling pierced suddenly
by pillars of heavy light.

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.460
I love you, throughout
the performance

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:23.670
in every hand clap, every stomp.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:29.900
I love you in the rusted iron
chains someone was made to drag,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.050
until love let them be
unclasped and left empty

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.430
in the center of the ring.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.720
I love you in the water,
where they pretended to wade,

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.640
singing that old blood
deep song that dragged us

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.880
to those banks and cast us in.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.300
I love you.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.730
The angles of it scraping
at each throat,

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:58.220
shouldering past the swirling dust
motes in those beams of light,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:04.120
that whatever we now knew we could
let ourselves feel new to climb.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:14.560
O, O, woods, O, dogs, O,
tree, O, gun, O, girl run.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.550
O, miraculous many gone.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.880
O, Lord, O, Lord, O, Lord.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.750
Is this love.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:30.510
The trouble you promised.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:38.040
[ Applause ]

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.220
So that poem leads into
a Civil War poem that --

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.300
DC is just like such a
wonderful -- I'm realizing now,

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.640 position:56%
this Civil War poem was commissioned
by the Smithsonian for an exhibit

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.340
of Civil War portraits
a number of years ago.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.360
So, wow, thank you.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.260
It's a history that, of course,
I learned about but I never felt

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.210
that I had a footing within it.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.140
And so being asked to think
about it was a real gift.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.550
Because I had to say, well, what
perspective am I curious about?

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:16.680
And I wanted to know about
recorded testimonies or experiences

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.490
from black soldiers of that
war and their families.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:26.070
And so I found a number of sources
that included letters that many

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.310
of soldiers or their widows
or their families wrote

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:34.260
to President Abraham Lincoln,
asking for help in some way.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.790
Either getting their son paid or
finding out if they were free yet.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:43.610
And I also found a number of
testimonies from depositions

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.350
that veterans and their families
gave after the war, sometimes for,

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.030
you know, decades and
decades after the war,

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.740
in an attempt to claim pension.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.180
Slavery made it very
difficult for blacks to do

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.420
that because there were
not birth certificates

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.000
or marriage certificates
that people had.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.200
And so it was very difficult for
them to prove that they had served.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.540
So reading these documents,
I felt like all I wanted

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:15.660
to do was make a space for them
to exist together as a chorus.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.970
And so I'm going to
read you two sections

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.640
from a found poem called I Will
Tell You The Truth About This,

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.500
I Will Tell You All About It.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.270
And these two sections are
written really as choruses

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.980
that every few lines
is a different speaker,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.360
but I feel like they're telling
pieces of the same story.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.630
Excellent, sir.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:41.520
My son went in the 54th Regiment.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:48.230
Sir, my husband, who is in company
K 22nd Regiment US colored troops

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:53.500 position:56%
and now in the Macon hospital at
Portsmouth, with a wound in his arm,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.120
has not received any
pay since last May.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.300
And then only $13.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:07.100 position:56%
Sir, we, the members of company D of
the 55th Massachusetts volunteers,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.630
call the attention of your
Excellency to our case.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:17.290
For instant, look and see
that we never was freed yet.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:21.780
Run right out of slavery
in to soldiery.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.460
And we hadn't nothing at all.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:28.570
And our wives and mother most all
of them is a perishing all about.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:32.020
And we all are perishing our self.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:38.540
I am willing to be a soldier and
serve my time faithful like a man.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:45.260
But I think it is hard to be put
off in such dog-ish manner as that.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:50.570
Will you see that the colored men
fighting now are fairly treated?

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.160
You ought to do this.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.110
And do it at once.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.260
Not let the thing run along.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.180
Meet it quickly and manfully.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:04.980
We poor oppressed ones appeal
to you and ask fair play.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:11.070
So please, if you can do any good
for us, do it in the name of God.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:17.390
Excuse my boldness, but please,
your reply will settle the matter

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:21.390
and will be appreciated by
a colored man who is willing

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:27.400
to sacrifice his son in the
cause of freedom and humanity.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.810
I have nothing more to say.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.390
Hoping that you will
lend a listening ear

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.650
to an humble soldier, I will close.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:43.090
Yours for Christ sake, I shall
have to send this without a stamp,

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:51.510
for I ain't money enough
to buy a stamp.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:59.710
[ Applause ]

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.010
But wait, there's more.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.160
I am 60 odd years of age.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.030
I am 62 years of age next month.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.990
I am about 65 years of age.

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:17.150
I reckon I am about 67 years old.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.890
I am about 68 years of age.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.080 position:56%
I am on the rise of 80 years of age.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.230
I am 89 years old.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.750
I am 94 years of age.

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.510
I don't know my exact age.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.540
I am the claimant in this case.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.910
I have testified before you
two different times before.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:42.090
I filed my claim I think
first about 12 years ago.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:45.060 position:56%
I am now an applicant for a pension.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.120
Because I understand that all
soldiers are entitled to a pension.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.150
I claim pension under the general
law, on account of disease of eyes,

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:59.330
as a result of smallpox
contracted in service.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:03.580
The varicose veins came on
both my legs soon after the war

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.270
and the sores were there
when I first put in my claim.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:12.400
I claim pension for rheumatism and
got my toe broke and I was struck

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.090
in the side with the breach
of a gun, breaking my ribs.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:23.210
I was a man stout and healthy, over
27 years of age when I enlisted.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:27.550
When I enlisted, I had a little
mustache and some chin whiskers.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:33.030 position:56%
I was a green boy right off the farm
and did just what I was told to do.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.740
When I went to enlist, the
recruiting officer said to me,

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.690
your name is John Wilson.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.680
I said no, my name
is Robert Harrison.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.270
But he put me down as John Wilson.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.410
I was known while in
service by that name.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:52.220
I cannot read nor write and I do
not know how my name was spelled

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.770
when I enlisted, nor do I
know how it is spelled now.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:00.580
I always signed my name while
in the Army by making my mark.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.830
I know my name by sound.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.520
My mother said after my discharge

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.500
that the reason the
officer put my name

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:13.840
down as John Wilson was
he could draw my bounty.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.700
I am the son of Solomon
and Lucinda Sibley.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.220
I am the only living
child of Dennis Campbell.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.820
My father was George Jordan and
my mother was Millie Jordan.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.930
My mother told me that
John Barnett was my father.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:33.460
My mother was Mary Eliza Jackson
and my father Ruben Jackson.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.110
My name on the role was Frank Nunn.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.980
No, sir, it was not Frank Nurn.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.320
My full name is Dick Lewis Barnett.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.920
I am the applicant for pension
on account of having served

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.060
under the name Lewis Smith,

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.020
which was the name I wore before
the days of slavery were over.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.190
My correct name is Hiram Kirkland.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.030
Some persons call me Harry
and others call me Henry,

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.720
but neither is my correct name.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.850
The United States Welcomes You.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.560
Why and by whose power
were you sent?

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:24.500
What do you see that
you may wish to steal?

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.370
Why this dancing?

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:30.780
Why do your dark bodies
drink up all the light?

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.210 position:56%
What are you demanding that we feel?

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.710
Have you stolen something?

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.430
Then what is that leaping
in your chest?

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.400
What is the nature of your mission?

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:47.110
Do you seek to offer a confession?

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:52.130
Have you anything to do with
others brought by us to harm?

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.500
Then why are you afraid?

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.430
And why do you invade
our night, hands raised,

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:03.870
eyes wide, mute as ghosts?

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.030
Is there something
you wish to confess?

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:11.880
Is this some animatic type of test?

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.670
What if we fail?

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:18.610
How and to whom do we
address our appeal?

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:28.450
I think I will kind of wind down
with just a couple of poems.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:40.640
I want to read something
that's a little bit happy.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:47.040
Okay, this is a poem -- my
daughter is here being so perfect

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:53.950
and wonderful in the
front row [applause].

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.750
So this is a poem that was
written a few years back.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:01.720
It's called Four and a Half.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:08.420
Morning finds her curled like a
prawn around a stuffed blue Pegasus

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.240
or the smallest prawn pink lion.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.980
Or else she's barging into
my room and leaning in close.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.430
So it's her hair I wake to.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:24.610
That coarse, dark heaven
of knots and purple fluff.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.420
And she's hungry.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.750
But first she has to pee.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.790
Pee, pee, she sings,
hopping in place.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:36.900
Trying to stanch off the wild
ravenous river she carries,

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.760
until I'm awake for real.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.800
Saying, go, go, hurry
before you wet the floor.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:50.090
And then she tries and succeeds
or else stands bereft relieved

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.970
as a pool trickles
out around her feet.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:53:01.230
She's like an island made
of rock with one lone tree

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:04.230
at the top of the only mountain.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.130
She's like the soul in Congas
goat tethered to the tree.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:12.050
Smiling almost as you approach.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:16.890
Scraping the ground with its
horns and then lickety-split,

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:21.150
lurching hard, daring
the rope to snap.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.450
She's hungry.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.270
She wants bread, toasted,
with no skin.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:30.540
And enough butter to
write her name in.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.160
Or a bowl of cereal,
but not the noisy kind.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:41.390
She wants a movie or maybe just the
tussle of her will against mine.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:50.070 position:56%
That scrape and crack, horn on rock,
rope relenting one fiber at a time.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:57.470
I want that, she says, punctuating
what she just said she wanted.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:01.000
Before I close with one last poem,
I want to reiterate my thanks

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.170
to everyone here tonight, many of
whom are family members, teachers,

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:10.620
friends, mentors, colleagues
in this world of poetry.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.700
And of course to Dr. Hayden and
Rob Casper and the Library staff

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.330
who have just been so
wonderful in making this feel

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:21.110
like it's not just a dream, this
is real, this is really happening.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:22.410
So thank you.

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:23.710
And of course, Amanda.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.570
I'm excited to follow your voice.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.670
An Old Story.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.140
We were made to understand
it would be terrible.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.440
Every small want.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.770
Every niggling urge.

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:45.140
Every hate swollen to
a kind of epic wind.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:51.450
Livid the land and ravaged
like a rageful dream.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:58.390
The worst in us having taken over
and broken the rest utterly down.

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:07.970
A long age passed, when at last we
knew how little would survive us.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:14.900
How little we had mended or
built that was not now lost.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.170
Something large and old awoke.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:24.970
And then our singing brought on
a different manner of weather.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:31.470
Then animals long believed
gone crept down from trees.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:35.530
We took new stock of one another.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:40.910
