00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.510
There’s nothing cooler than Uncle Jessie
shades.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.900
Except the Coolest cooler featuring a USB
Charger, bottle opener, waterproof wireless

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.170
speakers, and a blender.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.170
This is episode 44 of LÜT.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.460
Hit the road with GasPods on your car to reduce
drag and save money on fuel.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.110
Thanks to aerodynamics

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.570
Then fuel your food with fire with alchemist
hot sauces - that come in seven different

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.960
flavors each in a hand-corked and wax-sealed
apothecary bottle.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.409
But only hot sauce is bacon hot sauce.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.530
Wash that down like an optimist with a half-
full pint glass.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.379
Chilled to puzzling perfection in this Rubik’s
Cube fridge.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.789
That actually has a warm and a cool setting
for keeping your food warm or cold.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.300
If that doesn’t blow you away use the Hurricane
2 Canless Air System - that blows air over

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.799
200 mph without any chemicals, greenhouse
gasses, frostbite or explosions.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:06.300
Just charge the battery and blow yourself
up a giant inflatable rubber ducky.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.920
Swim with your ducky and listen to music with
the Neptune Underwater Mp3 Player - that uses

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.409
Bone Conduction audio transmission to transmit
audio through your cheekbone and into your

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.409
inner ear.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.640
And it holds 4 Gigs or about a thousand songs.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.700
Cheeseburger Mask.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.109
For some incredible masks check out composite
effects.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.590
They have professionally sculpted silicone
masks and gloves - and their mask lab let’s

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.329
you customize and test your ideas from skin
color and hair style to the scars, burns and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.509
paint.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.220
Mask the odor of your bathroom business with
the Poo Pourri Crapsman gift set.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.359
It has essential oils that you spray on the
toilet water before you go - trapping the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.009
odor without any harsh chemicals.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.640
Odor yourself a deck of X-ray cards - to finally
see through your poker opponent.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.450
See everything bright and smart with the emberlight
- a device that allows you to control any

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.789
dimmable bulb with your phone.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.929
The automated lighting can turn on when you
enter a room, be set as an alarm, or be controlled

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.140
remotely if you’re out of the house and
left on the..

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
Lights.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Camera.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.140
Action.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.430
With your cardboard smartphone projector that
turns YouTube videos (like this one) into

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.500
grand cinematic events.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.430
To improve sound quality while staying warm
the Audio Engineer’s Hoodie features acoustically

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.160
transparent, speaker cloth hood panels and
a headphone pass-through for internal wiring.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.420
Finally, go camping with wires thanks to these
solar-powered tents - allowing you to charge

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.050
your devices while at festivals or amongst
wildlife in the great outdoors like the sloth.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.870
The cutest of the deadly sins.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.810
And as always - thanks for watching.
