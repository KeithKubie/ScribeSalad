00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:19.170
In the 1950s U.S. forces were stretched dangerously
thin.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.550
U.S. President Dwight D Eisenhower stated
of this, “My feeling…remains, that it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.320
would be impossible for the United States
to maintain the military commitments which

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.379
it now sustains around the world (without
turning into a garrison state) did we not

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.460
possess atomic weapons and the will to use
them when necessary.”

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.281
No surprise from this that, unsatisfied with
the portability of their shiny new M65 nuclear

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:47.650
cannons, which required a couple of very large
trucks to transport, and further unsatisfied

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.780
that firing it off in many tactical situations
would be a bit like killing a mosquito with

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.990
a hand grenade, in the late 1950s the U.S.
military brass for once were thinking smaller.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.110
What they really wanted was a simple weapon
that could launch a miniature nuclear warhead,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.600
could be carted around by a few soldiers,
and be fired relatively quickly and reliably.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.970
This would allow a handful of soldiers to
successful combat far superior forces on the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
other side, even at relatively close range,
which none of the other nuclear weapons of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.180
the age could safely do- Enter the Davy Crockett.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.020
Rumor has it the name was chosen in homage
to the famed American politician owing to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.200
the legend that he once grinned a bear to
death, with the idea referencing the association

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.980
between Russia, and the Soviet Union in general,
with bears.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.880
Whether that’s actually the reasoning behind
the name or not, the first prototype of the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.509
Davy Crockett was completed in November of
1958 and ultimately deployed about two and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.010
a half years later in May of 1961.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.240
Featuring a variant of the W54 warhead contained
in an M388 round, the projectile was fired

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.439
from an M-28 or M-29 smooth bore recoilless
gun.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.149
This was capable of launching the 10 or 20
ton yield nuke as far as about 1.25 miles

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.590
for the M28 or 2.5 miles for the M29.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.590
As for portability, the Davy Crockett could
be either deployed and fired from the back

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.200
of a jeep for maximum mobility, or even broken
down into its components, with the pieces

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.620
of the weapon carried by five soldiers on
foot.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.800
The general procedure for firing the 76 pound
nuclear round was quite simple.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.040
First a spotting round would be shot from
an attached gun to ensure the weapon was aimed

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.420
reasonably well.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
After this, in order to get the nuke to end
up more or less where the spotting round did,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.170
the angle of the gun would have to be adjusted.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.150
To do this, a small book with pre-calculated
tables was carried giving adjustment figures

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.430
for said angle.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.960
However, it turns out test firings with non-live
nukes showed again and again that the Davey

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.010
Crockett was an obscenely inaccurate weapon,
possibly both because of the angle adjustment

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.550
and that the weapon itself was smooth bore.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.300
Of course, the fact that the Davey Crockett
was shooting a nuclear warhead helped make

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.629
this inaccuracy issue not as much of a problem
as would be the case with other similar weapons.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.780
Once the target was mildly locked on, the
propellant charge would be inserted into the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.830
muzzle with a metal piston placed in after
as a sort of cap.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.010
This was followed by the M388 round itself
containing the W54 warhead.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.040
As the M388 was far too big to fit inside
the bore, instead a rod would be attached

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.099
to the back, with the nuke sitting at the
front.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.030
As for how the warhead would know when to
detonate, there was a timer dial that would

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.599
be set based on estimated distance to the
target, using figures given in the aforementioned

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.900
book containing a spreadsheet of tables.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.769
However, contrary to what is often stated,
the timer was not actually the thing that

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:52.980
triggered detonation.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.100
Rather, it simply armed the bomb once the
time ran out.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.849
The actual trigger for detonation was a simple
radar device in the back of the M388 that

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.409
would detect how far above the ground the
nuke was.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.340
There was also a high and low switch that
could slightly adjust height of detonation

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.560
based on the radar reading.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.480
As you might have gleaned from all this, also
contrary to what is often stated, this switch

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.829
did not control the yield of the bomb, just
what height it would detonate above the ground,

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.150
roughly 20-40 feet AGL, depending on setting.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.580
It should also be noted that, unlike many
other nuclear weapons, this was an otherwise

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.690
dumb nuke.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.210
Once the timer was set and it was fired, it
would either go off or prove itself to be

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.210
a dud.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.689
There was no aborting detonation after launch.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.270
If all that is involved in firing the Davey
Crockett sounds like it might take a long

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.219
time, it turns out not at all given the destructive
power of this weapon.

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.729
One former Davey Crockett section soldier,
Thomas Hermann, notes that they were actually

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.740
trained and well capable of firing a nuke
every two and a half minutes!

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.369
So just how deadly could this weapon be?

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:06.029
While extremely low-powered as nukes go, the
weapon nonetheless produced a blast in the

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:11.899
ballpark of as large as the highest yield
non-nuclear explosive devices of the era.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:15.319
But unlike many of these, it was relatively
small and portable.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.449
More important than that was its potential
for extended damage long after the initial

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.449
blast.

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.169
This was particularly useful when fired around
critical routes that enemy soldiers would

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.389
have to traverse.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.690
Not only would the initial blast do significant
damage to any soldiers and enemy vehicles

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.319
around at the time, but the radioactive fallout,
which would almost certainly be fatal to anyone

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.689
within about a quarter of a mile of the initial
blast when it went off, would remain long

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:45.259
after, making a given route, such as a mountain
pass, impassable for several days after if

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.550
one was interested in not dying of radiation
poisoning.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.849
Naturally, the Soviets could defend against
this simply by equipping each of their soldiers

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.399
with lead-lined refrigerators, but for whatever
reason they never seemed to have chosen to

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.919
go this route.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.400
On the other end of things, neither did the
Americans.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.499
This was despite the fact that the Davey Crockett
was also not terribly safe for those firing

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.499
it.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.970
While 1.25-2.5 miles away is plenty of range
to keep the soldiers who pulled the trigger

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.740
safe from being harmed by the blast itself,
in real world scenarios the enemy being fired

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.279
upon could be closer and some of your own
troops might also be even closer still.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.210
Critical to all of this was also wind direction.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.110
With no wind, the radiation kill zone in the
immediately aftermath of the blast was approximately

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.280
1,500 feet, but wind could easily blow dangerous
radioactive particles towards one’s own

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.339
troops.

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:39.309
As such, crew were instructed to, if possible,
only fire the gun when suitable cover behind

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:44.110
a hill or the like was available to help reduce
radiation exposure.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.330
That said, presumably to try to get the soldiers
operating the weapon to be slightly less hesitant

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.860
about firing it, the instruction manual notes
that the leader of the troop should instill

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.960
a great sense of urgency in the soldiers operating
the Davy Crockett and to remember that, to

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.509
quote, “The search for nuclear targets is
constant and vigorous!”

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.399
On top of that, the manual states that if
the nuke failed to detonate for some reason,

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.509
the soldiers should wait a half hour and then
go and recover the supposed to be armed and

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.322
ready to detonate at the whim of a radar trigger
nuke…

00:07:11.322 --> 00:07:14.709
Needless to say, while the Davy Crockett was
deployed everywhere from West Germany to South

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:21.339
Korea, with well over 2,000 of the M388 rounds
made and 100 of the guns deployed, it was

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.729
never actually used in battle.

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:29.280
That said, the Army did do one test fire of
the Davy Crockett with a live M388 round.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.669
This occurred during Operation Sunbeam in
a test code named “Little Feller I”, which

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.259
took place on July 17, 1962.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:42.520
The nuke flew approximately 1.7 miles and
detonated successfully about 30 feet above

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.270
the ground, with an estimated yield of 18
tons from the blast.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.710
Interestingly enough, this was the last time
the United States would detonate a nuke in

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:56.009
the air close to the ground thanks to the
1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.610
the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.800
(And, yes, that is the real name of the treaty).

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.710
In the end, as cool as having a portable nuclear
gun is and all, within only a few years the

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.509
weapon would become antiquated, and by 1967
the Army was already beginning to phase it

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:13.429
out, with it going the way of the Dodo completely
by 1971.

00:08:13.429 --> 00:09:30.089
No doubt to the eternal relief of the soldiers
tasked with firing the things should

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:42.850
the need arise.
