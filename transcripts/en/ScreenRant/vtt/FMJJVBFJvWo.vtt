00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.160
Just like any part of a film, the cast is
always subject to change until the movie is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
complete.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.780
When brainstorming the right actors and actresses
for each role, filmmakers can go through several

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.020
names, and Hollywood history is full of interesting
“what if?”

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.160
alternate realities.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
Some of the biggest movies of all-time could
have looked very different if certain parts

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.689
were handed out to someone else.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.869
At times, it’s difficult to say if that
would have been for the better or worse, but

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230
it’s always fascinating to think about.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.010
Here are 10 actors who missed out on huge
roles for strange reasons.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.010
Spider-Man

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.680
Elizabeth Banks was only 26 years old when
she tested for the role of Mary Jane Watson

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.520
in Sam Raimi’s first Spider-Man film.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.600
She was less than 15 months older than lead
Tobey Maguire, so it was puzzling when she

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.360
was told she was “too old” to play MJ.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.739
The part eventually went to Kirsten Dunst,
who was just 20 when the movie reached theaters

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.740
in 2002.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.450
Though Banks didn’t get the role she wanted,
she did land a supporting part in the trilogy,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.480
playing Daily Bugle secretary Betty Brant.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.739
It’s clear that Raimi enjoyed her talent
and wanted to include her in his movies somehow.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.809
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.949
Matthew Broderick IS Ferris Bueller.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.110
It’s impossible to separate actor from character,
so it’s a little jarring to consider that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.270
he wasn’t the only choice for the role.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.770
Johnny Depp was originally offered the role
of the troublesome teenager, but had to turn

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120
it down because the production schedule conflicted
with some of his other projects.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.160
That opened the door for Broderick to step
in, and a cinematic legend was made.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.690
Depp can act circles around people, but it’s
tough to envision him mastering the art of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.750
breaking the fourth wall in such a charming
fashion.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.580
Broderick is what made the film what it is
today.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.580
Casino Royale

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.440
When a new James Bond was needed for reboot
Casino Royale, EON Productions considered

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.750
several names, including some A-listers.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.340
Hugh Jackman could have donned the tux, but
he turned down the role of 007 because he

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.340
already had Wolverine.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.710
He felt portraying two classic characters
would have boxed him in too much, due to the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.920
large commitments franchise films present.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.370
In the end, it may have been a good move.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.850
Daniel Craig is considered one of the better
Bonds, and Jackman carved out a diverse career

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.890
between X-Men appearances.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.069
Interestingly enough, both roles could be
looking for a new actor soon.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.069
The Terminator

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.470
Arnold Schwarzenegger became an action icon
with his terrifying performance as the cybernetic

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.209
Terminator in James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi
work.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.410
But if the filmmakers stuck to the first pick,
history would have remembered the movie very

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.010
differently – for all the wrong reasons.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.260
The producers initially wanted football star
O.J. Simpson, but then decided against it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.960
because they thought the charismatic running
back couldn’t be a convincing killer.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.830
Real life had an ironic way of proving Cameron
wrong, but luckily The Terminator lives on

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.520
as a one of the best films ever made.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.090
If Simpson was the T-800, it may not be as
revered as it is today.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.360
The Silence of the Lambs

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.010
Silence of the Lambs pulled off the rate feat
of winning in all the major Oscar categories

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.560
the year it was released, meaning the role
of Clarice Starling netted Jodie Foster a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.780
Best Actress trophy.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.230
Foster was always the screenwriter’s choice
for the part, but director Jonathan Demme

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.420
wanted Michelle Pfieffer.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.660
She was offered Clarice, but Pfieffer turned
it down because she wanted to avoid the amount

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.240
of violence and gore that was in the film.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.540
It wasn’t all bad for Pfieffer, who turned
many heads as Catwoman in 1992’s Batman

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
Returns.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.390
She still got to leave her mark on a popular
film.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.400
Django Unchained

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.290
Most actors would kill to work with Quentin
Tarantino, who consistently writes crackling

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.540
dialogue and crafts masterful films.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.900
But Will Smith didn’t sign up when he had
the chance.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.540
Tarantino had the Fresh Prince he mind for
the role of Django in 2012’s Django Unchained,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.540
but Smith turned the part down because he
felt Dr. King Schultz, not Django, was the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.540
movie’s real lead.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.720
Smith begged for Tarantino to revise the script
so it was Django who killed Calvin Candie,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.840
but the director refused.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.740
The role ended up going to Jamie Foxx, who
did an excellent job opposite Christoph Waltz,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.510
who won Best Supporting Actor for his turn.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.510
Star Wars

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.840
David Prowse gave Darth Vader his intimidating
physique, but his accent made the Dark Lord

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
less threatening.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.850
George Lucas knew that Vader’s lines would
have to be overdubbed by another actor for

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.930
the finished film.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.420
Looking for someone with a powerful voice,
Lucas first considered Orson Welles, but then

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.230
decided against it because he thought Welles’
vocals would be too recognizable for the viewers.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.959
Of course, he eventually landed on James Earl
Jones, whose baritone became ingrained in

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.940
popular culture as one of the definitive sounds
in Star Wars lore.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.319
He’s set to return in this December’s
Rogue One, and fans cannot wait.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.319
The Blind Side

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.290
Its status as an Oscar contender was mocked
by some, but there was no denying The Blind

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.540
Side had a lot of fans within the Academy.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.201
Its touching true story is the stuff classic
inspirational sports films are made of, and

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:11.610
Sandra Bullock received an Oscar for her performance.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.180
But another Hollywood sweetheart could have
had the trophy if things played out differently.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.070
Julia Roberts was originally offered the role
of Leigh Anne Tuohy, but turned it down so

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.849
she could work on Valentine’s Day, one of
Gary Marshall’s infamous holiday themed

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:22.849
films.

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.970
Roberts may not have chosen wisely, but at
least she has an Oscar of her own for Erin

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.130
Brockovich.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.130
Avatar

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.560
Whenever an expensive original project is
coming through the pipeline, executives look

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.580
for any way they can to increase its appeal.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.150
When it came to casting James Cameron’s
fantasy epic Avatar, the studio considered

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.500
stars such as Matt Damon and Jake Gyllenhaal
for the lead, Jake Sully.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.870
Cameron took the opposite route and went with
the then unknown Sam Worthington.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.320
Worthington may not have broken out as the
next great leading man, but he was solid in

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.419
the role and will be a main player in the
forthcoming sequels.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.490
And when you consider Damon and Gyllenhaal
are doing just fine without Pandora, everything

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.180
worked out for the best.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.180
Deadpool

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.900
Ryan Reynolds was locked into Deadpool from
the day he was born, but he needed a supporting

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900
cast.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.681
Originally, Olivia Munn was offered to play
Wade Wilson’s girlfriend Vanessa, a part

00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:05.620
that eventually went to Morena Baccarin.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.090
Munn turned it down because she didn’t just
want to be a love interest.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.970
She stayed within the same franchise and chose
to play Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.540
Ironically, Psylocke was seen as one of the
weaker elements of that film, while the relationship

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.310
between Wade and Vanessa in Deadpool was praised
for its heart.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.360
If Munn had a mulligan, maybe she’d pick
Deadpool.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.590
Those are our picks for actors who missed
out on big roles for weird reasons.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.590
Are there any we missed?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.720
Which ones do you wish had actually happened?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.449
