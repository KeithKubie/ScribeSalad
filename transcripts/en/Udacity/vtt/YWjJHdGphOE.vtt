Okay, first things first. Once we've started to receive this HTML,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.320
we'll be parsing it as we get it. So that's step one.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.220
DOM construction can be incremental, and the response may not arrive all at

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.550
once. So, we may not finish constructing it all at once. In the head,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.200
we'll find links to CSS and JavaScript, so then we'll fire off those requests.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.180
That's step two. But there's a gotcha. The script is synchronous, and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.670
we can't execute it until we have the CSSOM. So we'll need to create the CSSOM

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.610
as soon as possible. Completing the CSSOM will unblock the JavaScript engine, so

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.160
we'll be able to execute JavaScript as soon as we've received it.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.050
Once the JavaScript is finished, we can resume and finish constructing the DOM.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.890
Once we have the DOM and CSSOM, we'll merge the two and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.660
build the Render Tree. After that, we run layout and paint the page.
