00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.880
Regina rode her bike 2 and 1/4
miles from her house to school

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.500
and then 1 and 5/8 miles
to her friend's house.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.140
How many miles did Regina
ride in total?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.390
So she first rode 2 and 1/4
miles, and then she

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.110
rode 1 and 5/8 miles.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.760
So the sum is the total number
of miles she rode.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.510
So to take this sum, we've seen
that we can add the whole

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.759
number parts, because this is
really the same thing as 2

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.470
plus 1/4 plus 1 plus 5/8, so we
can just switch the order,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.910
if you want to view
it that way.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200
So we can add the 2 plus the 1
first, and then we get-- let

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.010
me do that here.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.930
So 2 plus the 1, you get 3, and
then we need to add the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.200
1/4 plus 5/8.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.910
And to add these two fractions,
we have to find the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.480
least common multiple
of 4 and 8.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.730
That'll be our new
denominator.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
8 is divisible by both 8 and 4,
so that is the least common

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.770
multiple of 4 and 8, so our
common denominator will be 8.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.300
Obviously, 5/8 will
still be 5/8.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.710
Now to go from a denominator
of 4 to 8, you have to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.690
multiply the denominator by 2,
so we also need to multiply

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.370
the numerator by 2,
so 1 times 2 is 2.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.600
And, of course, we still
have this 3 out there.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.870
So 2 and 1/4 plus 1 and 5/8 is
the same thing as this right

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.180
here, and this is equal to-- we
have our 3 plus, and then

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.980
over 8 we add the 2 plus 5.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.610
We have 7/8.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
So this is going to be equal
to 3 and 7/8 miles.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.220
She rode a total of
3 and 7/8 miles.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
Now, I want to make one
thing very clear.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.480
So far when we've been adding
these mixed numbers, the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.280
fraction part always ended
up as a proper fraction.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.290
The numerator was smaller
than the denominator.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.490
But I want to do a quick example
to show you what you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.860
do when the numerator is not
smaller than the denominator.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:24.560
So let's say we had 1 and
5/8 plus 2 and 4/8.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.990
So if you add just the
whole number parts, 1

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.800
plus 2, you get 3.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.600
Plus 5/8 plus 4/8, 5/8
plus 4/8 is 9/8, so

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.360
you get 3 plus 9/8.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.670
Now it would be really strange
to just say, OK, that's the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.010
same thing as 3 and 9/8, because
you have a mixed

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.500
number with a whole number
and an improper fraction.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.190
If you're going through the
trouble of making it a mixed

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.530
number, the fraction better
be a proper fraction.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.020
So what you need to do is
rewrite 9/8, and you know that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.110
9/8 is the same thing
as 1 and 1/8, right?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.490
8 goes into 9 one time with 1
left over, so it's 1 and 1/8.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.380
So this is the same thing
as 3 plus 1 and 1/8.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.250
So now we can add the
whole number parts.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.140
3 plus 1 is equal to 4, and then
you have your 1/8 over

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.270
there: 4 and 1/8.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.690
I just wanted to give you that
special circumstance when your

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.150
fraction part ends
up improper.
