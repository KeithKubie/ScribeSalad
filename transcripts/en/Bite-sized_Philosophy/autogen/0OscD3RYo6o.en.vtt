experience something like that and this
is<00:00:14.280><c> kind</c><00:00:14.519><c> of</c><00:00:14.549><c> what</c><00:00:14.700><c> that</c><00:00:14.880><c> is</c><00:00:15.089><c> this</c><00:00:15.599><c> is</c><00:00:15.750><c> a</c><00:00:15.780><c> field</c>

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
is kind of what that is this is a field
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.769 align:start position:0%
is kind of what that is this is a field
and<00:00:16.430><c> basically</c><00:00:17.430><c> what</c><00:00:17.910><c> happens</c><00:00:18.270><c> is</c><00:00:18.359><c> you</c><00:00:18.420><c> parse</c>

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
and basically what happens is you parse
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.230 align:start position:0%
and basically what happens is you parse
out<00:00:19.020><c> a</c><00:00:19.050><c> little</c><00:00:19.320><c> part</c><00:00:19.619><c> of</c><00:00:19.680><c> the</c><00:00:19.830><c> world</c><00:00:20.000><c> say</c>

some handleable amount of time and you
 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
some handleable amount of time and you
posit<00:00:38.070><c> a</c><00:00:38.129><c> goal</c><00:00:38.340><c> in</c><00:00:38.640><c> there</c><00:00:38.850><c> and</c><00:00:39.059><c> you</c><00:00:39.450><c> plot</c><00:00:39.690><c> your</c>

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 align:start position:0%
posit a goal in there and you plot your
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410 align:start position:0%
posit a goal in there and you plot your
route<00:00:40.170><c> and</c><00:00:40.469><c> then</c><00:00:40.620><c> that</c><00:00:41.460><c> tells</c><00:00:41.760><c> you</c><00:00:41.969><c> what's</c><00:00:42.210><c> up</c>

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
route and then that tells you what's up
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389 align:start position:0%
route and then that tells you what's up
and<00:00:42.690><c> tells</c><00:00:43.350><c> you</c><00:00:43.500><c> what's</c><00:00:43.680><c> down</c><00:00:43.890><c> because</c><00:00:44.250><c> up</c>

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
and tells you what's down because up
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
and tells you what's down because up
moves<00:00:44.879><c> you</c><00:00:45.030><c> towards</c><00:00:45.180><c> the</c><00:00:45.510><c> goal</c><00:00:45.660><c> and</c><00:00:45.690><c> down</c>

moves you towards the goal and down
moves<00:00:46.379><c> you</c><00:00:46.530><c> away</c><00:00:46.800><c> from</c><00:00:46.860><c> the</c><00:00:47.129><c> goal</c><00:00:47.340><c> and</c><00:00:47.370><c> that</c>

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
moves you away from the goal and that
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 align:start position:0%
moves you away from the goal and that
sets<00:00:48.210><c> up</c><00:00:48.360><c> your</c><00:00:48.390><c> motivation</c><00:00:49.079><c> framework</c><00:00:49.590><c> so</c>

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.020 align:start position:0%
know that's a really interesting thing
to<00:00:53.910><c> know</c><00:00:54.059><c> -</c><00:00:54.329><c> it's</c><00:00:54.539><c> like</c><00:00:54.690><c> why</c><00:00:55.680><c> have</c><00:00:55.920><c> a</c><00:00:55.949><c> goal</c><00:00:56.219><c> well</c>

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 align:start position:0%
to know - it's like why have a goal well
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.819 align:start position:0%
to know - it's like why have a goal well
it's<00:00:57.270><c> easy</c><00:00:57.420><c> no</c><00:00:58.260><c> goal</c><00:00:58.559><c> no</c><00:00:58.859><c> positive</c><00:00:59.579><c> emotions</c>

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 align:start position:0%
it's easy no goal no positive emotions
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.740 align:start position:0%
it's easy no goal no positive emotions
because<00:01:01.829><c> you</c><00:01:02.309><c> experience</c><00:01:02.850><c> positive</c><00:01:03.059><c> emotion</c>

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
because you experience positive emotion
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
because you experience positive emotion
by<00:01:03.870><c> noticing</c><00:01:04.350><c> that</c><00:01:04.409><c> you're</c><00:01:04.650><c> moving</c><00:01:04.979><c> towards</c><00:01:05.280><c> a</c>

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 align:start position:0%
by noticing that you're moving towards a
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390 align:start position:0%
by noticing that you're moving towards a
goal<00:01:05.549><c> and</c><00:01:05.909><c> so</c><00:01:06.270><c> you</c><00:01:06.420><c> don't</c><00:01:06.570><c> have</c><00:01:07.080><c> a</c><00:01:07.110><c> goal</c><00:01:07.400><c> well</c>

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
goal and so you don't have a goal well
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.609 align:start position:0%
goal and so you don't have a goal well
you<00:01:08.580><c> can't</c><00:01:08.820><c> have</c><00:01:08.939><c> any</c><00:01:09.119><c> positive</c><00:01:09.540><c> emotion</c><00:01:09.990><c> so</c>

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
you can't have any positive emotion so
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 align:start position:0%
you can't have any positive emotion so
you<00:01:11.220><c> better</c><00:01:11.400><c> have</c><00:01:11.580><c> a</c><00:01:11.640><c> goal</c><00:01:11.909><c> and</c><00:01:12.180><c> so</c><00:01:12.840><c> you</c><00:01:13.409><c> might</c>

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
you better have a goal and so you might
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 align:start position:0%
you better have a goal and so you might
say<00:01:13.770><c> well</c><00:01:13.799><c> what</c><00:01:14.070><c> should</c><00:01:14.280><c> the</c><00:01:14.369><c> goal</c><00:01:14.549><c> be</c><00:01:14.820><c> well</c><00:01:15.750><c> we</c>

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
say well what should the goal be well we
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 align:start position:0%
say well what should the goal be well we
could<00:01:16.140><c> start</c><00:01:16.350><c> by</c><00:01:16.439><c> saying</c><00:01:16.860><c> well</c><00:01:17.040><c> any</c><00:01:17.250><c> goal</c><00:01:17.670><c> is</c>

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 align:start position:0%
could start by saying well any goal is
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 align:start position:0%
could start by saying well any goal is
better<00:01:18.150><c> than</c><00:01:18.420><c> none</c><00:01:18.659><c> and</c><00:01:18.960><c> then</c><00:01:19.470><c> we</c><00:01:19.590><c> might</c><00:01:19.740><c> say</c>

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 align:start position:0%
better than none and then we might say
