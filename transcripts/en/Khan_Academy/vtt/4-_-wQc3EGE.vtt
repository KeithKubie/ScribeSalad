00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:03.402
A few videos ago we saw
that we could maximize

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:07.736
total utility given our $5 spending

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:11.057
by calculating the
marginal utility per dollar

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:13.478
for each incremental dollar we could spend

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:15.337
on each of these goods

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:17.813
and then just for each
dollar maximizing it.

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:21.644
Our 1st dollar, we got 100
utility points per dollar

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.142
for that first chocolate bar

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:24.412
and that was more than any

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:25.791
than the first fruits,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.001
so that's where we spent it.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.136
Then we got more for the 2nd chocolate bar

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:31.404
for that 1st pound of fruit,

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:32.270
so we spend it there.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.250
Then for the 3rd pound or
for the 3rd bar of chocolate.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.604
Then it became equal to spend
for the 1st pound of fruit

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:42.804
so then we spent the next $2
on that 1st pound of fruit

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:44.751
because the price of fruit were $2.

00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:46.079
What I want to do in this video

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.605
is explore what happens
when I change the price

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:50.001
of the chocolate bars.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.465
What happens to our marginal
utility per dollar over here?

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:57.603
In particular, what happens
to the quantity demanded?

00:00:57.603 --> 00:00:59.836
If you think about what we're doing it,

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.748
we figured out with 1 price

00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:03.208
what was the quantity demanded,

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:04.534
we demanded 3 bars.

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:05.866
If we change the price

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.203
and we get another quantity demanded,

00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:10.209
we're essentially starting
to plot our our demand curve

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:12.273
and we can actually
derive our demand curve

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:15.081
from this information right over here.

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:16.580
Let's see how we could do that.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.420
Let's now assume that our
chocolate bars are $2.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.069
Now we're going to calculate.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.669
The marginal utility per dollar,

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.836
this applies to both of these columns.

00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:31.840
This is for what it was $1 per bar,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.999
this is now when it's $2 per bar.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.836
Well, for that first bar,
I'm still getting 100 points

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:40.832
of marginal utility, but now it's $2.

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:44.474
So 100 divided 2 is going to give me

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:48.331
50 marginal utility points per dollar.

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.075
Then for that next bar,

00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:53.733
I get 80 marginal utility points.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.283
I'm still enjoying it but
enjoying it a little bit less

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.124
but I'm paying $2 for it.

00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.334
I'm getting 80 divided by 2 is 40 points,

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:03.472
you know, and I'm just
giving these arbitrary units,

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:05.538
40 points per dollar.

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:08.008
Then the 3rd bar is 30 points per dollar.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.537
Then the 4th bar is 20 points per dollar.

00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:16.267
Now, how would I spend my $5?

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:17.703
Let me do this a little bit,

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:18.933
let me do it over here.

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.876
How would I spend my $5 now?

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:25.284
My first dollar, where
would I get the most

00:02:25.284 --> 00:02:27.291
marginal utility per dollar?

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.933
Where would I get the
most bang for my buck?

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:35.048
My very 1st dollar, I can
either buy half a bar here,

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:36.706
I could buy half a here

00:02:36.706 --> 00:02:39.998
and I'm assuming that,
for the sake of simplicity

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.135
let's assume that I get the same

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.887
marginal utility per dollar
for the 1st half a bar

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:46.469
and for the 1st bar.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.207
That is constant until
I get to one entire bar.

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:53.335
That's also true for, and
even if I buy a fraction

00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:54.741
of the pound here.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.807
My 1st dollar, I can't use these numbers,

00:02:57.807 --> 00:02:59.950
this is when the bars
were a dollar per bar,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.631
now they're $2 per bar.
This is the reality.

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:05.009
Now actually it makes
sense for me to, at least,

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.666
for that 1st dollar I can
buy a half pound of my fruit

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:13.405
at a marginal utility per dollar of 60.

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:24.577
My 1st dollar will go
towards .5 pounds of fruit

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:28.644
and I'm getting a marginal
utility per dollar of 60.

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:34.081
Where is my 2nd dollar going to go?

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:37.005
Well, I can still get another half pound

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.011
at a marginal utility of 60.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.924
Remember, we have to
ignore these right here

00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:43.457
for the sake of this argument

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:45.924
or for the sake of this
scenario right now.

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:47.660
I could still get another half pound

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.005
for marginal utility per dollar of 60,

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:56.532
so now I buy another half pound of fruit

00:03:56.532 --> 00:04:01.088
and my marginal utility per dollar is 60.

00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:05.654
Now, where is my 3rd dollar,

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:07.844
my 3rd dollar going to be spent?

00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:12.306
Well, I could spend it now

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:15.348
at a rate of a dollar per half bar,

00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:17.198
or $2 per bar for chocolate

00:04:17.198 --> 00:04:20.727
or a dollar per half bar, $2
per bar for fruit over here.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.061
I'm actually neutral.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.864
I could spend it.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:24.397
Let me just, for the sake of fun,

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:30.375
say list on half a bar of chocolate

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:36.152
and my marginal utility per dollar is 50.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:41.460
Then my 4th dollar, once again,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.405
I could do a couple of
different things here.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:45.133
I could buy another half bar

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:47.263
because I can buy up to a whole bar

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:50.064
at this marginal utility per
dollar up to a whole bar.

00:04:50.064 --> 00:04:51.213
So why not do that?

00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:53.066
I'll buy another half chocolate bar,

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.879
so now I have a whole chocolate bar.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.212
Once again, I'm able
to continue buying that

00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:02.065
at 50 utility units per dollar.

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:08.881
Then my 5th dollar over here,
what would I do with that?

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:12.733
Well, I don't want to buy
any more chocolate bars

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:14.403
because my marginal utility per dollar

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:15.464
of the chocolate bar

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:18.467
because I've exhausted what
I can buy at this utility,

00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:20.285
this utility per dollar.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:23.234
My marginal utility per
dollar has gone down now,

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:24.738
but now I could still buy fruit

00:05:24.738 --> 00:05:26.130
at that same 50.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.996
Now, with that dollar, since
the fruit is $2 per pound,

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.905
I can buy another half pound of fruit

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:36.565
at a marginal utility
per dollar rate of 50.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:41.871
Now I buy another half pound of fruit

00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:45.821
at a marginal utility per dollar of 50.

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:50.859
You can calculate the total
marginal utility I got,

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:52.407
this is the marginal utility per dollar

00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:54.570
and this is a dollar spent

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.334
at that marginal utility per dollar.

00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.905
My total utility I should say,

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:00.531
the marginal utility is the increment,

00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.534
but my total utility now is 60 + 60 is 120

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:07.152
plus 50 + 50 + 50.

00:06:07.152 --> 00:06:14.585
So it's 120 + 150 = 270 total utility.

00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:15.754
Even more interesting here,

00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:18.581
let's think about the
quantity of chocolate bars

00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:22.160
that I have now bought
once the price is gone up.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.869
I have now bought exactly 1 chocolate bar.

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.705
You could say my 3rd and 4th dollars

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:30.869
were spent on 1 bar right over here,

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.329
I bought 1 bar.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.265
Let's think about it, all else equal.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:35.532
Remember, ceteris paribus.

00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:37.268
We haven't changed the price of fruit,

00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.412
we haven't changed consumer preferences

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:40.934
which would have changed your

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.960
marginal utility numbers right over here.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.878
All else equal.

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:46.381
What happened just when we changed

00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:47.594
the price of chocolate bars?

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:48.864
Let me write it down.

00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:50.593
Just think about chocolate.

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:53.164
If we just think about chocolate bars.

00:06:53.164 --> 00:06:57.011
Let me write price and quantity.

00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:04.422
When the price was $1
the quantity demanded

00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:08.319
was 3 bars.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.124
That was the 1st video we
saw on marginal utility.

00:07:11.124 --> 00:07:13.657
We demanded 3 bars.

00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:19.133
Now when the price has gone up to $2,

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:24.260
the quantity demanded is exactly 1 bar.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.796
We could do everything in between,

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:28.617
we could see what happens
if the price was a dollar 50

00:07:28.617 --> 00:07:29.861
or if the price was 50 cents,

00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:30.999
if we actually lower the price.

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:32.323
We would see how the,

00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.523
and there might actually be a situation

00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:36.462
where you would have to
have higher quantities here

00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:37.792
especially when you lower the price.

00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:39.458
But by doing that,

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:43.277
assuming you have enough rows here

00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:44.277
and we might not have it,

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:45.198
if you lower the price.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.369
Assuming you have the marginal utility

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:49.730
at different quantities for the two goods,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.590
you can figure out exactly
how much chocolates

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.328
someone would buy given
different changes in price.

00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:59.104
We at least have 2 points
for the demand curve now.

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:03.881
If we assume that this is
price and this is quantity

00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:05.095
right over here,

00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:09.926
when the price was $1, the
quantity demanded was 3,

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:16.730
and when the price is $2,
the quantity demanded is 1.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.198
There, we have 2 points
for our demand curve.

00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:27.193
Our demand curve might
look something like that.

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:29.655
If it was linear, it would go straight.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:32.460
It would go something straight like that.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.127
But we at least have 2 points on the curve

00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:35.923
and we could keep trying
different prices out

00:08:35.923 --> 00:08:37.925
using these information to figure out

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:42.400
the exact shape of that curve.
