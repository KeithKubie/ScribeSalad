territory we're surrounded by people

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
territory we're surrounded by people

territory we're surrounded by people
linked to the Noble Foundation and who

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
linked to the Noble Foundation and who
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.710
linked to the Noble Foundation and who
are mainly working in the in the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720
are mainly working in the in the
 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.560
are mainly working in the in the
academic or the scientific field and we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
academic or the scientific field and we
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.160
academic or the scientific field and we
are in the art world and just to begin

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
are in the art world and just to begin
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039
are in the art world and just to begin
with a tiny tiny question namely the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
with a tiny tiny question namely the
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109
with a tiny tiny question namely the
question of truth oh it's very small

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
question of truth oh it's very small
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.390
question of truth oh it's very small
yeah I would ask is there such a thing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
yeah I would ask is there such a thing
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.289
yeah I would ask is there such a thing
what is the role of truth in art can an

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
what is the role of truth in art can an
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.030
what is the role of truth in art can an
artwork be true yeah of course that's a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
artwork be true yeah of course that's a
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950
artwork be true yeah of course that's a
very very difficult difficult question

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
very very difficult difficult question
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960
very very difficult difficult question
so in preparation I've been reading

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
so in preparation I've been reading
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.210
so in preparation I've been reading
Freud where else would one go and Freud

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
Freud where else would one go and Freud
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210
Freud where else would one go and Freud
has a very interesting attitude to truth

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
has a very interesting attitude to truth
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.130
has a very interesting attitude to truth
in that of course psychoanalytically

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
in that of course psychoanalytically
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920
in that of course psychoanalytically
speaking of course where is it what is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
speaking of course where is it what is
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.740
speaking of course where is it what is
it and the NEB the nebulous nosov it is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
it and the NEB the nebulous nosov it is
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.630
it and the NEB the nebulous nosov it is
something that we take as it's hard for

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
something that we take as it's hard for
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190
something that we take as it's hard for
us to accept that actually it is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
us to accept that actually it is
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.190
us to accept that actually it is
nebulous and we can't we continue if we

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
nebulous and we can't we continue if we
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.469
nebulous and we can't we continue if we
keep looking for it here and there so I

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479
keep looking for it here and there so I
 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.330
keep looking for it here and there so I
would go immediately from Freud to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
would go immediately from Freud to
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.680
would go immediately from Freud to
another great man which is who

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
another great man which is who
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.470
another great man which is who
Sushil who said who said I think very

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
Sushil who said who said I think very
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.710
Sushil who said who said I think very
deeply very profoundly the artist is a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
deeply very profoundly the artist is a
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.860
deeply very profoundly the artist is a
mediumistic being I like this idea of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
mediumistic being I like this idea of
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.990
mediumistic being I like this idea of
the mediumistic being so we are already

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
the mediumistic being so we are already
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.490
the mediumistic being so we are already
calling a kind of cabal of the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
calling a kind of cabal of the
 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.120
calling a kind of cabal of the
shamanistic or whatever it is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
shamanistic or whatever it is
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.480
shamanistic or whatever it is
so the mediumistic being who seeks

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490
so the mediumistic being who seeks
 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.380
so the mediumistic being who seeks
mystic truth but but and this is the key

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
mystic truth but but and this is the key
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.990
mystic truth but but and this is the key
thing but the work itself is never

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
thing but the work itself is never
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.130
thing but the work itself is never
complete until the viewer is present so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
complete until the viewer is present so
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.990
complete until the viewer is present so
mediumistic being makes this object and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
mediumistic being makes this object and
 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.040
mediumistic being makes this object and
then in this interaction something takes

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
then in this interaction something takes
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.450
then in this interaction something takes
place that completes the work truth lies

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460
place that completes the work truth lies
 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.510
place that completes the work truth lies
in this interaction and of course its

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520
in this interaction and of course its
 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.990
in this interaction and of course its
nebulous because I come with my

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000
nebulous because I come with my
 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.750
nebulous because I come with my
love-hate desire do I want it how much

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
love-hate desire do I want it how much
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.120
love-hate desire do I want it how much
does it cost and all the other crap that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130
does it cost and all the other crap that
 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.000
does it cost and all the other crap that
life brings and says oh is it not so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
life brings and says oh is it not so
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.160
life brings and says oh is it not so
interesting no I don't believe it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170
interesting no I don't believe it
 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.100
interesting no I don't believe it
oh yes I do believe it and of course the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110
oh yes I do believe it and of course the
 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.690
oh yes I do believe it and of course the
eye of all our instruments I believe is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
eye of all our instruments I believe is
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.090
eye of all our instruments I believe is

but can we talk about that so you asked

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:33.790
but can we talk about that so you asked
 

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.650
but can we talk about that so you asked
me about illusionism I've made lots of

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:37.660
me about illusionism I've made lots of
 

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.020
me about illusionism I've made lots of
physical objects but I'm really not

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.030
physical objects but I'm really not
 

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.770
physical objects but I'm really not
interested in physicality what I've

falling has something in it that is some

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940
falling has something in it that is some
 

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.480
