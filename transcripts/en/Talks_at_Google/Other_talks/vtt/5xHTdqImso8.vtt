00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.050
RAJIV SATYAL: I'm
Indian, just Indian.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.180
I'm not South Asian any more
than Russians are North Asian.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.850
I'm not Asian Indian
or East Indian.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.630
There are 1.3 billion of us.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.550
We don't need a
cardinal direction, OK?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.120
It's not our fault that
Christopher Columbus got lost.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.640
Sure, we love our states, but
there's strength in numbers.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.670
One out of every six
human beings is Indian,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.370
so stop dividing us.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940
The British already
did that once.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.560
And we need to quit saying
that we're not Indian

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.410
because I wasn't born here, or
sound like this, or eat that.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.800
Our hearts are Indian.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.880
We are feelers.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.340
We gave the world the
romance of Bollywood films

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.210
and the music of Ravi
Shankar and Zubin Mehta

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.510
and Lata Mangeshkar
and Asha Bhosle

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.430
and the allure of
the "Kama Sutra."

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.690
We are thinkers.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.300
We are great at math
because we invented numbers.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.125
And we're pretty
good at letters too.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.810
We are doctors and
engineers and techies.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.460
And we mean business.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420
We're the world's third largest
economy and the wealthiest

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.220
ethnic group in America.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.320
We are huge and efficient.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.924
India is all on one time zone.

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:18.340
That way, everybody
in the country

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.890
is still late, but
at the same time.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.860
We never invade anyone because
we already have everything.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.770
Chess, the ruler, the button,
wireless communication,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.880
arranged marriage flush
toilets, steel, democracy-- all

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.780
us, all India.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.830
And you are welcome,
world, for yoga,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.480
and elevating cricket into
a multibillion-dollar sport,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.950
and making food so good that
you sailed across the planet

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.090
to come have some.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.620
Our food is hot.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.130
Our country is hot.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.550
Our women are hot.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.580
Our men are-- lucky.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.430
Where the world
prays, we meditate.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.690
We practically invented
religious tolerance.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
And we gave you Mahatma
Gandhi and pundits and gurus

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.070
and karma and dharma and
kismet and reincarnation.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.170
The motherland is
magical and mystical.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.570
And no matter who you are,
you can find yourself here,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.480
in incredible India.
[SPEAKING HINDI]-- I am Indian.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.330
And I'm late.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.880
Told you I was Indian.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.340
It's an honor to
be here at Google.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.782
I actually got a degree
in materials engineering.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:28.740
That was the big thing.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.260
That's how I prepped for
comedy, I got a degree

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.540
in materials engineering.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.309
I was going to
work in wafer fab.

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.850
I was going to be
a wafer fabrication

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.360
engineer in the Silicon Valley.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.619
And until today,
February 19, 2016,

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:41.910
I have disappointed my parents.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.784
But today, I'm working
in the Silicon Valley.

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:44.460
So here I am.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.942
So I guess, finally,
my parents can be proud

00:02:46.942 --> 00:02:49.150
that I'm actually here in
the Silicon Valley with you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.830
like a good Indian.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.340
It's a lot of
Indians here today,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.061
which is mostly--
token white guy.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:56.560
OK.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.150
Right, in the front row--
it's still your country,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.199
don't worry.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.740
That's great.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.336
It still works out, so
no problem with that.

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:04.710
No need to take
the country back.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.150
OK.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.230
I'm actually giving TED X
talk in a couple of weeks.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.730
And so people have been asking
me-- friends, they're saying,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.670
oh, you're speaking at Google.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.961
You're giving a talk at Google.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:15.800
Are you practicing?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.341
You don't come to
Google to practice.

00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:18.560
This is the Super Bowl, OK.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640
So this is the highlight
of my year so far,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.160
but it's only, what, 50
days old, so not a problem.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.600
But I'm here to give a
speech and break down

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.620
that video that you saw.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.760
How many people, by round of
applause, have seen that video?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.670
How many people have seen it?

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.220
OK.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.820
You can clap.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.319
It's OK.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.820
Let's get some
energy going in here.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.670
It's Friday.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.962
How many people have not seen
it, by round of applause?

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:40.711
I guess it's a weird
thing to applaud for.

00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:41.650
But yeah, that's fine.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.900
I'm glad that if
we hadn't seen it,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.274
we wish we wouldn't
have seen it.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:46.699
But no, I'm glad that a
lot of you had seen it.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:47.490
Some of you hadn't.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.050
So that's very cool.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.730
But I'm going to explain,
I think, to some extent,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.570
why that video worked, and also
tell you a little about humor,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.204
about stand-up, about jokes.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.620
And I want to make
it interactive.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.946
So if you have questions or if
you are bored-- well, if you're

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:04.070
bored, just leave, I guess.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.570
But if you have
questions, just feel

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.870
free to put your hand up
or shout something out.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.036
I think that's always a
good thing to be able to do.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:12.420
It's odd, though, to talk
about why something worked

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.850
as a stand-up comedian,
because normally, we

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.962
talk about our failures.

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:17.670
We don't really talk
about our successes,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.524
because failure is funny.

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:20.190
You know I mean?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.606
It's funny to watch
somebody fail.

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:23.523
That's why we have fail
blogs and hashtag fail

00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:24.147
and everything.

00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:25.040
It's a lot funnier.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.240
If I just get up
here and tell you,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.323
and that's how I got the
girl back to my apartment

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:30.210
and I hooked up with
her, OK, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.850
That's not really a funny story,
that's just somebody bragging.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.700
I do want to talk about jokes.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.700
I do live in the Valley.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.699
And I don't know how many
people saw "Clueless."

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.500
This movie's now 20 years old,
which is crazy for me to think.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.450
Somebody's nodding back there.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.000
OK, good.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.092
So-- which is why, up here, I
have to speak like an adult,

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.300
because I live in the Valley.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.190
Normally we tend to go up
at the end of our sentences.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.430
We all kind of talk
like this down in LA.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.430
And I know, in San
Francisco, you don't like LA.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.804
So as long as I
make fun of LA, I

00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:04.230
think I'm going
to do pretty well.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.110
But I realize that some of
my friends, they're cool.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.680
I'm not a cool guy.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.980
I've never been a cool guy.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.182
Some of my friends, they'll
develop cool phrases.

00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:14.890
They'll say, yeah,
let's all turn up, yo.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.640
Let's all turn up.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.591
That's a good look.

00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:18.840
I want to talk like that,
but it just doesn't come out

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.690
of my mouth like that.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.100
I always pick up the
annoying phrases.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.349
I think she's already leaving.

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.847
OK, fine.

00:05:23.847 --> 00:05:24.930
But I always pick them up.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.554
Because a friend of
mine in the Valley,

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:27.682
she always says, "right."

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:29.140
She's one of these
women who always

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.880
says "right" at the
end of her sentences.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.160
Or whenever somebody gets
finished speaking, she'll go,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.470
"anyway," which is
such a beautifully

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.030
condescending way of speaking.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.790
It's so great.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.373
I mean, somebody
will say, "and that's

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:44.890
why I'm voting for
Donald Trump"-- "anyway."

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.680
It's just such a
great thing to say.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680
It's amazing.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.020
But I noticed I had to stop
saying the word "like."

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.970
I was saying "like" constantly.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.710
And I realized I
had a problem when

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.260
I said it three times in a row.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.900
OK?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.430
So I actually said, "Like
like like?" as a question.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.790
And some of you understand
that, which is sad.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.040
We have a problem-- it's an
epidemic in this country--

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.210
of likes, too many likes.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.390
And I think I'm not at Facebook,
so I should stop saying "like."

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.890
But the point being-- I think
you can like things on YouTube

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.617
too, right?

00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:12.450
But I realized this.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.770
Actually, on our way
here, we were driving

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.770
and I saw a guy hitchhiking.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.790
I thought he was
giving me a like.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.040
So it was one of those things.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.722
So it does actually
happen, I guess, here.

00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:22.180
But no, a friend
of mine was trying

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.070
to ascertain whether I was
fond of a certain girl.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.290
And so to distinguish between
liking her as a friend

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.930
and like liking her as
someone more than a friend,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.364
I said to him-- I asked the
question-- "Like like like?"

00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:37.030
That's when I realized
I have a problem.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.530
Ouch.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.770
You don't want to say "like
like like" three times in a row.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.920
Anyway, the point being,
that I'm going to talk about

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.160
jokes and where you might
find them in society.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.880
They appear in different places
and they're more ubiquitous

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.000
than you might imagine.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.250
There's a dollar word for you.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.520
You can right-click that one.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.410
So I'm going to break down
humor, stand-up, jokes,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.650
and lessons from I am Indian.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.229
Let's see how far I get.

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.770
I have a lot of
content here, but I'm

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.228
going to treat this
like my dates--

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.527
I'm just going to see
how far I can get.

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:10.610
That's supposed be a joke.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.330
All right, so let's
start with humor.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.940
The job of a comedian
is to make people laugh.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.657
It is the simplest
job in society.

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:23.490
It's not the easiest,
but it's the simplest.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.590
It's just three words.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.600
If you also want to say
something else, that's great.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.240
There are comedians
who say funny things

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.430
and there are comedians
who say things funny.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.390
And they are sort of
two different things

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.269
if you have to explain
why a comedian is funny.

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:39.560
We showed a little clip of
Russell there inadvertently.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.370
But sometimes you may
say, why is he funny.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.920
Ah, I don't know.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.587
He's just funny.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:43.253
He's just funny.

00:07:43.253 --> 00:07:44.564
The way he is, he's just funny.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:45.480
But what does it mean?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.340
So we've got to break
that down a little bit.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.400
I don't remember if
it was Chris Rock or I

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.040
who said this-- I get us mixed
up all the time-- but it was

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.950
really-- the goal was to
make people laugh in the room

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.147
and think on the way home.

00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:05.230
That was really the thing.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.870
You don't want people to
think while you're here.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.910
Otherwise-- there's no
sound to thinking, right?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.451
So I want you to laugh in the
room and think on the way home.

00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.020
That's always a
big thing for us.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.850
And so not all
comedians are what we

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.910
would call social commentators.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.190
Some people are just
there to get a laugh

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.610
and other people want to say
something more than something

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.030
funny.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.351
If we go back to
medieval times, there

00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:29.850
was something called
a court jester.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.660
Round of applause--
how many people

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.590
have heard of a court jester?

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.330
How many people have at
least heard of this concept?

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.679
OK, that's good.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.780
You can clap, that's
fine-- or raise your hand.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.559
Either one is OK.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.862
Does anyone know the
role of the court jester?

00:08:39.862 --> 00:08:42.070
Does anyone know what the
purpose of the court jester

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.761
was?

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:43.261
Yes.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.529
Yes, perfect, to point out
the absurdities of society,

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.820
of what's going on around them.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.590
Also, it was to convey
messages to the king

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.280
without fear of being beheaded--
that was a big thing--

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.200
without fear of retribution.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.390
That was a really important
message or thing for him

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.300
to be able to do, to convey
messages to the king.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.370
Today, we have multiple kings.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.800
We've got the president, sure.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.850
The president can
be sort of a king.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.890
But we also have the media.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.220
We have the pope-- unless,
again, you're Donald Trump.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.220
He's going to be a
consistent punch line for me,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.140
I think, this time-- the pope.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.200
We have corporate America
and all of these things

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.680
that do exist.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.210
But one by one, through
one scandal or another,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.870
it seems like we've
lost our kings.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.310
If you go all the way back to
Richard Nixon and Watergate

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.020
and the Vietnam
War, the government

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.510
lost a lot of credibility
here in this country.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.042
And I have to-- in America.

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.250
We have so many Indians here.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.460
I need to make sure
that we say in America.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.580
The government here lost
a lot of credibility.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.790
Brian Williams, right?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.370
He lost his job for lying.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.040
And there was a
joke going around

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.979
that he had-- he was
joking about the--

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:58.520
or he was actually talking about
being involved with the Iraq

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.470
War and is the only person
who lost his job from lying

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.380
about the Iraq War.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:02.630
Right?

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.430
So that was a joke
that was going around--

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.790
it was kind of unfair--
that he sort of exaggerated

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.980
a little bit, he lost his job.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.100
And so the media
has-- especially

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.180
with the rise of talk radio, Fox
News, the liberal media, nobody

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.849
really knows where to
get facts from anymore.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:20.140
I don't know how many people
saw the movie "Spotlight."

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.430
I'd ask you to clap,
but it's not really

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.810
the kind of movie you clap for.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.160
But it pointed out the scandals
in the Catholic church.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.890
And so the churches have
lost a lot of credibility.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.156
We look at violent
extremism with Islam

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:32.030
and things like that.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.110
That's not to impugn a religion,
but people now are very scared

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.290
to talk about religion.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.680
Whether it's Catholicism,
Islam, Hinduism, Christianity,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.700
anything, people are on edge.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.670
And it's lost some
credibility as well.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.119
In 2008, we had the
financial crisis, right?

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:48.660
By round of applause,
how many people

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.940
were in the country in 2008?

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.580
How many people
were here in 2008?

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.570
OK, so quite a few
people were here.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.474
And anyone here, were
you working at Google?

00:10:57.474 --> 00:10:58.640
Anyone still here at Google?

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.790
OK, so few of us were--
not us, but today I'm

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:01.540
working at Google.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.790
So not getting paid, but
whatever, that's not the point.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.790
We're not keeping track.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.480
No one's bitter.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.310
The point is that in 2008,
the economy fell apart

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.040
and people lost
faith in capitalism,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.300
in the mores of society, and
what this country is built on.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.226
And it's kind of funny, because
I was pre-med for a while.

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.121
I was, like I said, an engineer.

00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:22.870
But I was pre-med.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.790
Now I'm post-med.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.190
I just skipped the med
party, really, altogether.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.350
That's where the work
was, so I did that.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.940
And that was back in '94.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.562
I'm going to turn 40 soon, so
I'm a little older than-- well,

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.020
maybe I'm younger
than you thought.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.520
Who knows?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.440
I don't know.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.710
My parents really wanted
me to be a doctor.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.680
After that, I decided
to get out of that.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.280
And the Clintons
sort of tinkered

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.130
with the health care system.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.750
Doctors were not
making as much money.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.470
And so I that's when
I went into the wafer

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.526
fab and semiconductors
and P-N junctions

00:11:50.526 --> 00:11:51.650
and I was going to do that.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.640
And then the dot com
bust happened in 2000.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.150
That was my senior
year in college.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.225
And that fell apart.

00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:58.100
And then I decided, you
know what, maybe I'll

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.130
go into finance.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.520
And then in 2008, that
whole thing fell apart.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.812
So suddenly, becoming a
comedian did not look so risky.

00:12:03.812 --> 00:12:05.436
My parents said, go
ahead, be comedian.

00:12:05.436 --> 00:12:06.060
It's fine.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.670
So all of a sudden, it
was not such a bad idea

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.660
at this point in time to
just go ahead with that.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.240
And so after all the
kings have been slain,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.320
maybe the jester is
the last one standing.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.319
I went to a friend of
mine's to get the picture,

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:19.500
so that was at least good.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.460
But you can see that I'm a
jester in that, as a comedian,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.710
but I've stolen a king's
crown so to speak.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.334
Many, many people
make arguments, right?

00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:31.250
After all, stand-up
comedy, a lot of the time,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.110
is really just kind
of a funny argument.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.312
We're trying to get you
to see our point of view.

00:12:35.312 --> 00:12:37.020
But lots of people
make arguments, right?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.590
We've got the president--
you're going to see Obama a lot

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.130
in this presentation as
well-- Obama as the president.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.060
We have preachers who make
arguments all the time

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.410
or make, of course, sermons.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.820
Columnists, when they
write anything you read,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.300
it tends to be an
argument to get you over

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.680
to that point of view.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.092
And then you have CEOs who,
of course, get up there

00:12:57.092 --> 00:12:59.050
and try to get people to
invest in the company.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.950
And I love the profile.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.530
I don't know who
wrote it, but "This

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.280
is most famous CEO of World."

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.310
So he's not just
the CEO of Google,

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.770
he's the CEO of the world.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.270
OK?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.320
So I didn't know if you
knew earth has a CEO.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.480
But I think as we
discover more planets,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.290
we need to promote somebody.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.074
And we thought, Google Earth,
Google Maps, maybe this guy

00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:21.740
will be the one.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.540
So "This 43 years old
man is Google's CEO."

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.470
So he's been demoted in his
own bio, I guess, evidently.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.390
"His full name is
Pichai Sundara--"

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.350
words of South Indians.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.392
Who can read this?

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:35.350
AUDIENCE: Sundararajan.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.540
RAJIV SATYAL: Sundararajan,
OK, thank you,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.081
with an American
accent at that, too.

00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:40.609
You really showed me up--
born in Tamil Nadu in India.

00:13:40.609 --> 00:13:42.900
Which, I love how it puts it
in parentheses in case you

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.500
didn't know were Tamil Nadu is,
but maybe some people don't.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.520
But now it's kind of
old news that people

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.890
are getting their news not
just from traditional media.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.650
We're getting it from
"The Daily Show."

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.600
People will tell you
that they don't just

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600
go to watch Trevor Noah or John
Oliver or Dennis Miller or Bill

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.560
Maher for jokes.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.750
A lot of the shows are--
they're kind of serious.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.140
I mean, there are laughs, sure.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.515
But a lot of times,
it's serious.

00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:10.310
So we're getting that and
we're seeing that people are

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.170
getting their news that way.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.790
If you doubt the
power of a joke--

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.190
some of you will know this
man and some of you won't.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.240
His name is Hannibal Buress.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.090
And Hannibal Buress
is the one who

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.570
told the joke about Bill Cosby,
which led to Bill Cosby's

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.990
now being indicted.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.110
And he is going to go to court.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.030
Hannibal Buress.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.030
He made a joke.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.860
And in fact, several
women had come forth

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.010
to talk about Bill Cosby.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.160
Their concerns were not
taken seriously, which

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.030
is a horrible thing in society.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.130
And it took a stand-up
comic-- and some people

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.460
point out, a black man stand-up
comic-- to say and make

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.930
the joke about Bill Cosby.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.730
And he even said,
well Bill Cosby, yeah,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.000
but you raped women.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.650
And he said this in a stand-up
act and it got laughs,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.170
but it led to the
investigation of Bill Cosby.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.500
This was a joke that
revealed the truth

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.560
and really kind
of a scary thing.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.100
But I think that's what's really
great about stand-up comedy

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.910
is nobody is bigger
than the field.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.130
No matter how big a
stand-up comic gets,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.940
the person is still
a subset of humor.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.450
Right?

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.310
If you look at Michael Jordan,
he transcended basketball.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.130
He was bigger than basketball.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.130
There were people in
Africa, there are certainly

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.010
people in India, there are
certainly people in Australia

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.210
that didn't follow the NBA.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.043
They didn't really
follow the Chicago Bulls.

00:15:25.043 --> 00:15:27.720
But almost everybody knew
who Michael Jordan was.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.450
Barack Obama-- again, somebody
who transcended politics

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.360
talking about hope and change.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.132
But nobody transcends humor.

00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:35.590
And I think that
was sort of what's

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.330
great about stand-up comedy is
we use it to expose the truth.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.890
And that's the
idea, even if it's

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.406
about other stand-up comedians.

00:15:42.406 --> 00:15:44.780
And in that case, Hannibal
Buress doing a joke about Bill

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.294
Cosby, we even eat our own.

00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:48.210
I think that's a good
thing, which is probably

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.300
why his name is Hannibal.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.080
I worked hard on
that slide, so I need

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.300
you to probably laugh harder.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.600
But anyway, the
point is that-- no.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.340
Recently-- and you'll appreciate
this-- Facebook board member

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.555
Marc Andreessen, he tweeted.

00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:05.180
I'm sure a lot of people in this
room have followed this story.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.960
His tweet, again, Donald
Trump-like in nature.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.700
It got more and more out
of control until he finally

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.994
tweeted "Anti-colonialism has
been economically catastrophic

00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:15.410
for the Indian
people for decades.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.039
Why stop now?"

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.330
That was supposed to be a joke.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.570
And you hear how
hard you're laughing?

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.880
Yeah, right, not at all.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.340
Nobody was laughing on Twitter.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.110
Nobody was laughing about this
joke that apparently was made.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.944
But it revealed--
a lot of people

00:16:27.944 --> 00:16:30.110
think-- Facebook's intentions,
or a lot of companies

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.860
intentions, to go and have this
colonial approach to what they

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.450
still see as a
third world country.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.010
And so that was a joke that was
not funny, but a lot of people

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.810
think it revealed the truth.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.850
So there should be no doubt that
jokes are very, very powerful

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.410
and they can work to our
benefit or to our detriment.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.750
Some good examples-- a
lot of people, I'm sure,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.170
know Tina Fey.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.160
She and Amy Poehler hosted
the Golden Globes in 2015,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.650
which they've done a few times.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.200
One of her best jokes
was when George Clooney

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.680
was in the audience and he had
his wife Amal there with him.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.240
And Tina Fey clowned him
by saying, "Amal, his wife,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.579
is a human rights lawyer who
worked on the Enron case,

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.369
was an advisor to Kofi
Annan regarding Syria,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.970
and was selected for
a three-person UN

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.040
commission investigating rules
of war violations in the Gaza

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.290
Strip.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.000
So tonight, her husband is
getting a Lifetime Achievement

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.569
Award."

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:27.069
Right?

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.150
So exactly, it was a
really, really funny moment.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.430
And it really kind of
threw men under the bus.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.970
It threw actors under the bus.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.804
What are we
worshipping in society

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:36.970
that she is so accomplished?

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.011
What does a person have
to do to get recognition?

00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:41.660
And George Clooney is the one
getting all the good looks

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.160
there.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.807
So that was a great example.

00:17:44.807 --> 00:17:47.140
There's something called the
White House correspondents'

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.431
dinner that happens every year.

00:17:48.431 --> 00:17:50.890
And Stephen Colbert,
in 2006, roasted

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.010
George W. Bush by saying,
"Now I know that there

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.266
are some polls out there
saying that this man--"

00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:57.640
and he points to
George W. Bush--

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.100
"has a 32% approval rating.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.160
But guys like us, we don't
pay attention to the polls.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.280
We know that polls are a
collection of statistics that

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.740
reflect what people are thinking
'in reality.' And reality,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.414
as we all know, has a
well-known liberal bias."

00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:14.338
Right?

00:18:14.338 --> 00:18:17.350
So it really roasted
George W. Bush and said,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.450
you know what, we're
going to point out

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.400
something that's true that
you may not be acknowledging.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.540
Still one of my favorites
and my favorite comedian

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.760
of all time, Chris
Rock, a great example

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.672
when he said, "You don't
need no gun control.

00:18:31.672 --> 00:18:32.630
You know what you need?

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.460
We need some bullet control.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.420
We need to control the bullets.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.460
That's right.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.500
I think all bullets should
cost $5000, $5000 for a bullet.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.690
You know why?

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.950
'Cause if a bullet
cost $5000, there

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.028
would be no more
innocent bystanders."

00:18:48.028 --> 00:18:48.916
Right?

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:52.000
And so he does this whole
bit about how people

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.167
would be a lot more careful.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:55.250
They would shoot somebody
to take the bullet back,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.890
because it was still
their property.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.497
So it was a really good
example of a problem.

00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:02.080
A lot of people watched that and
they went, yeah, why don't we

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.580
do that.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.370
That's actually a
really good solution.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.020
That was in 1999.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.371
Then if you go all
the way back to 1989,

00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:14.120
I don't know how many
people saw the movie

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.720
"When Harry Met Sally."

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.670
This is Billy Crystal
from that movie.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.520
We couldn't use the
image from the movie

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.062
because all these
images are approved.

00:19:22.062 --> 00:19:23.020
We did the right thing.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.030
We did not go after
copyrighted images.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.799
So we had to get one when
he's-- too old to sue us?

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.090
I don't know what it is really.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.770
If you remember the-- I'll
get sued for that though.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.347
But there's a point in
"When Harry Met Sally"

00:19:39.347 --> 00:19:41.430
when he's talking, when
Harry is talking to Sally.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.890
And he just says--
they're walking

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.180
along the streets in New York.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.860
And he says, "Really, but
what's so hard about finding

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.660
an apartment?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.390
What you do is you look
in the obituary section.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.470
You see who died, find
out where they lived,

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.530
and tip the doorman.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.880
What they could do to make
it easier is combine the two.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.590
You know, Mr. Klein
died yesterday

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.470
leaving behind a
wife, two children,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.060
and a spacious
three-bedroom apartment

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.150
with a wood burning fireplace."

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.820
So we watch that
and go, yeah, they

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.970
should do that, especially
here in San Francisco.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.136
You could really use that,
I think, in the Bay Area.

00:20:09.136 --> 00:20:10.582
With prices going
out of control,

00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:12.290
maybe this would be
a good thing to have.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.510
So it's examples of
comedians telling

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.650
jokes but revealing
solutions, revealing truths,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.770
and things that are
a little bit deeper.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.750
This phenomenon of
using humor and truth

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.150
is not surprising, because
they're very closely related.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.080
Mary Poppins-- and
no presentation

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.910
is complete by a
nearly 40-year-old man

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.510
without using Mary Poppins
in it-- Mary Poppins once

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.450
sang a song that said
a spoonful of sugar

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.130
helps the medicine go down.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.180
And I think that
medicine is truth

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.550
and the sugar is the humor.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.070
So in every speech, you
try to think about what

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.320
your bumper sticker would be.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.730
So that would be
my bumper sticker,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.540
"Humor is the spoonful
of sugar that helps

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.080
the medicine of truth go down."

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.329
I hope you don't drive a
Prius, it's not going to fit.

00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.980
So I was trying to get it down
a little bit shorter than that

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.840
as short as I am, but
it didn't really happen.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.160
But I think that's sort
of the thrust of my speech

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.880
overall in the idea
that we can use humor

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.990
to get across the truth.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.490
And again, this
is not a new idea.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.260
Dick Clark, in 1959, he
said, "Humor is always

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.690
based on the modicum of truth.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.780
Have you ever heard a joke
about a father-in-law?"

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.280
Right?

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.170
So he's starting to get
across the idea of that.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.060
You go back to 1884
with Nietzsche even

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.960
saying, "We should
call every truth false

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.960
which is not accompanied
by at least one laugh."

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.130
And we can go 500 years before
that to Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.220
And he wrote, "Many a true
word is spoken in jest."

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.407
So using humor to convey
truth makes a lot of sense.

00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:51.740
In fact, a lot of businesses--
it's not really a-- well,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.531
I guess politics is a
business, but we just

00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:57.870
like this picture, four living
presidents at the time-- a lot

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.830
of businesses are
using comedians now.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.540
They're using improvisers, using
writers to warm up the audience

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.995
or get people to
brainstorm and play games

00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:08.120
and all that sort of thing.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:08.744
And it's great.

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.150
It's a great idea.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.180
But we're also using
stand-up comedians.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.830
And stand-up comedians
are a little bit different

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.510
because we're actually
saying something.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.520
I'm not saying that improvisers
and writers are not trying to,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.645
but-- wait, no, that is
completely what I'm saying.

00:22:19.645 --> 00:22:22.550
Stand-up comedians are better
than improvisers and writers

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.134
because we actually have to
come up with it in advance.

00:22:26.134 --> 00:22:28.050
Improv is sort of
impressive that they came up

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:28.730
with anything.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.464
But stand-up comedy sometimes,
if it's just a blank room,

00:22:31.464 --> 00:22:32.880
they're just looking
at you going,

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.120
you've had six months
to come up with this

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.578
and this is what
you're telling us.

00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:37.940
So it's a level of
expectations game.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.040
So I actually have
a business where

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.300
we hire stand-up comedians
to help marketers generate

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.190
insights for their brands.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.040
No big deal, it's just
really, really successful.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.900
It doesn't matter.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.370
The point is that we actually
had a comedian come in--

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.150
not Jerry Seinfeld.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.170
But Jerry Seinfeld made a
movie called "Comedian."

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.370
And if you're interested
in this sort of topic--

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.537
I see some of you
nodding-- this movie

00:22:59.537 --> 00:23:00.620
was really something else.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.880
Because it's a documentary.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.250
And the tagline for it is
"Where does comedy come from?"

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.029
Did you see it?

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:06.070
Yeah, really great movie.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.300
Where does comedy come from?

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.674
So he's the main
character in it,

00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:10.090
because he made
it, just like I'm

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.589
the main character
in my own speech.

00:23:11.589 --> 00:23:12.820
That'd be weird if I weren't.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.490
But there's one
other comedian in it

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.380
and his name is Orny Adams.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.800
We had Orny Adams
fly out to a company.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.780
I'm going to tell
you which company,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.070
keep that part confidential.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:27.020
But there was a part where the
underlings at the company-- I

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.180
don't think they went by
those titles-- they wanted

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.970
to convey to the king, to the
GM that they were not really

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.007
big fans of the name of
one of their products.

00:23:38.007 --> 00:23:39.090
They had changed the name.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.450
And so we had Orny
Adams go on stage

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.604
and just clown this brand.

00:23:42.604 --> 00:23:44.020
He just gets up
there and he goes,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.720
you took something that I
understood, like Greek yogurt,

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.850
and you changed it to Oikos.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.510
What the hell is Oikos?

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.260
And you could see the
whole place go nuts.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.310
And you could see
the GM nod his head.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.320
And we got the idea
across to the king.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.540
We used a stand-up comedian
to get the truth across,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.156
because everyone
underneath the GM

00:24:00.156 --> 00:24:01.780
was a little bit
scared to convey that,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:07.690
so a real life example
of how that can work.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.390
I wanted to ask, do you think
stand-up comedy is hard?

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.805
Do you think it's hard or easy?

00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:14.430
AUDIENCE: Hard.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.221
RAJIV SATYAL: Hard.

00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:16.410
Does anyone think it's easy?

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:16.910
OK.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.540
You can't say that, because
otherwise I'll have you come up

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.040
and do it.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.170
So it's sort of a mixed matter,
a stacked deck, I guess.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.200
I'll tell you why it is.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.429
The whole idea with
talks at Google

00:24:27.429 --> 00:24:28.720
is to break things down, right?

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.280
So let me tell you
why it's difficult.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.160
First of all, you can see
us do it while we do it.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.057
That's odd.

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.140
I could ask anyone here,
are you good at your job.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.440
I could say, are you
good at your job.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.600
You're going to say yes, right?

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.910
Because I'm not going
to see you do it.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.720
So I'm going to go to
assume you're good, right?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720
You can tell me all day long.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.750
And you have multiple chances.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.560
If you mess up on your
spreadsheet or whatever,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.476
you could just fix it.

00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:49.942
But I can't do that.

00:24:49.942 --> 00:24:51.150
You're going to see me do it.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.811
I can't speak up
here and then try

00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:54.560
to talk to someone
after the show and say,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.809
I'm this really amazing comic.

00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:57.790
We just saw you eat
it for 45 minutes.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.520
You suck.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.020
Right?

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.390
So you can see it happen.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.122
This is why I don't
understand doctors.

00:25:02.122 --> 00:25:04.080
And maybe I'm just bitter
because, like I said,

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.910
I'm post-med.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.810
But I don't know
what doctors do.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.820
I don't know what
their job is, still.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.340
It's just totally--
we're staying

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.850
with a couple of friends
who-- my friend [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.350
is a doctor.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.350
He's an ophthalmologist.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.240
And I just don't really
get what his job is, OK?

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.460
I go to the doctor.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.620
And first of all,
you see the nurse.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.500
The nurse does 90%
of the doctor's job.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.000
OK?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.230
Right?

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.010
You see the nurse first.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.650
The nurse does blood
pressure, weight.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.670
Most of the stuff,
you spend most

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.350
of the time with the nurse.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.970
I don't if we have any people
who were nurses or are.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:31.940
Any Malayalis?

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.120
OK.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.127
They're always nurses.

00:25:35.127 --> 00:25:36.085
It's true.

00:25:36.085 --> 00:25:36.960
I'm glad you laughed.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.710
Sometimes people grown.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.400
Like, it's not bad,
I'm just saying.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.510
You know?

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.470
But I don't know if they're
nurses or registered nurses.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.720
The only people in
society-- I don't

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.970
understand a registered nurse.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:47.470
I don't get that.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.240
They're the only people in
society who are registered.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.210
Where's this registry?

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.850
I don't get it.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.474
Them and sex offenders, they're
the only people who registered,

00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:54.587
I guess.

00:25:54.587 --> 00:25:55.670
You can grown on that one.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.190
So the point is that the
nurse does 90% of it.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.250
Then the doctor comes in.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.650
And I've never
had an appointment

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.360
with a doctor that lasts
more than two minutes.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:03.540
OK?

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.456
It's like a lot of things
in my life, I guess.

00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:07.020
But it's two minutes long.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.670
And it's never a
consecutive 120 seconds.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.110
The doctor keeps
leaving the room.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.585
The person, he keeps getting up.

00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.560
I don't know, is
he-- what's he doing?

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.770
Does he not know the answer?

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.040
Or is he looking up
stuff on the Web MD?

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.330
Or is he-- I don't know what.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.162
Is he googling it?

00:26:22.162 --> 00:26:23.370
I don't know what he's doing.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.202
What's he doing?

00:26:25.202 --> 00:26:26.660
And then it's his
turn to headline.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.640
It's his turn to
perform, to do surgery.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.390
That's the hardest
part of a doctor's job.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.380
And then they knock us out.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.160
We don't even get to
see them do it, right?

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.150
They can mess up, whatever.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:34.710
And they don't even do it.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.200
An anesthesiologist does that.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.330
They don't even do that.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.222
Then they prescribe a pill and
a pharmacist gives you the pill.

00:26:40.222 --> 00:26:41.680
So I don't know
what a doctor does.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.990
They're general contractors, OK?

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.400
I don't think they
have a job, really.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.390
I think that they gather a
bunch of people in a room.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.556
They're general contractors.

00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:49.370
That's their job.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.871
That's the difference there.

00:26:50.871 --> 00:26:52.870
The second thing what's
difficult about stand-up

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.761
is we come up with this
whole thing ourselves.

00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:56.260
Right?

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.590
I have no one to blame up here.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.214
I can't say, well,
Tonby, you wrote it.

00:26:59.214 --> 00:27:01.880
No, obviously, I wrote it, I
directed it, I produced it,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.660
I edited it.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.661
So I get the credit or
the blame depending.

00:27:04.661 --> 00:27:05.160
Right?

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.357
So that's pretty great.

00:27:06.357 --> 00:27:08.690
Although you get credit for
turnout, so nice job on the.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.750
Yeah, good work on that.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.709
That's really impressive.

00:27:11.709 --> 00:27:13.500
The other weird thing
about stand-up comedy

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.230
is you don't know the genre.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.454
This is really weird.

00:27:16.454 --> 00:27:18.870
If you ever hear someone go,
let's go to a stand-up comedy

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.420
club, maybe you are
specifically going

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.450
to see Russell
Peters, or Chris Rock,

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.950
or Dave Chapelle,
or Jerry Seinfeld.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.540
But a lot of the
time, people aren't.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.956
They just go to a comedy club.

00:27:27.956 --> 00:27:28.830
And you have no idea.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.746
If you go to a concert,
it's different, right?

00:27:30.746 --> 00:27:33.010
You know if it's hip hop,
or classical, or country,

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.090
or if it's EDM.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.470
You know specifically
what it is.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.992
But that's not
true for stand-up.

00:27:36.992 --> 00:27:39.200
Same thing with movies, you
want to go to the movies.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.510
Right?

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.250
And it's a big thing.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.958
Is that a comedy?

00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:41.570
Is it a drama?

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.310
Is it an action?

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.400
You get up in the stand-up
comic, he could be clean,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.910
could be dirty, could be
sarcastic, could be ironic,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.865
could be slapstick.

00:27:48.865 --> 00:27:50.740
All these different
things, you have no clue.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.760
So the audience usually has no
idea what you're about to do.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.980
A lot of my friends
in LA are actors.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.822
We shot this.

00:27:57.822 --> 00:27:58.780
I was very proud of it.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.821
Rajiv, left to his own
devices-- I'm on my phone.

00:28:00.821 --> 00:28:02.520
It's brilliant.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.020
Anyway, the point being that
a lot of my friends in LA

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.810
are actors.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.630
And it's almost funny,
because it's very popular

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.770
to say that I'm great at drama.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.620
I'm a great dramatic
actor or actress,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.289
but I'm really bad at comedy.

00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:17.080
And to me, it always
sounds like a cop-out.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.491
Because drama, there's
no measurement.

00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:20.990
Right?

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.198
In comedy, there are metrics.

00:28:22.198 --> 00:28:23.240
You can count the laughs.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.656
So I think that's
what's different

00:28:24.656 --> 00:28:27.100
about it is if you don't get
laughs, then it wasn't funny.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.600
Right?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.964
And that's true even
with going to a concert.

00:28:29.964 --> 00:28:31.880
Like I'm saying, if you
go to a jazz concert--

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.570
I don't know how many people
have been to a jazz concert,

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.112
right-- no one knows
what's going on.

00:28:35.112 --> 00:28:36.570
You don't know if
it's good or bad.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.990
You just try to
act like you know.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.680
It's like drinking wine
up here in wine country.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.690
It's good, so good.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.510
I don't know.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.310
I have no concept.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.230
No one knows.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.340
No one knows if it's
good, but you have to act.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.840
It's like the
emperor's new clothes.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.839
That's how the kings are
getting slain, I guess.

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:49.916
But it's true.

00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:52.540
And a lot of people have walked
out of a jazz concert and gone,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.623
I guess that guy was good.

00:28:53.623 --> 00:28:55.540
I mean, yeah, people
were clapping.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.480
But no one's ever walked
out of a comedy show

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.821
and gone, that guy was
hilarious, but I didn't laugh.

00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.320
Right?

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.776
No one has ever
done that, right?

00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:02.900
If you laughed, it's funny.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.170
If you didn't, it's not.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.610
We have to watch what we say.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.530
This man, Michael Richards,
known as Kramer-- some of you

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.770
are nodding and laughing
and maybe groaning--

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.830
but he got in trouble
at the Laugh Factory.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.990
I was actually on that
stage on a Tuesday

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.857
and this happened on a Friday,
three days after I performed.

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:21.190
Hopefully I didn't jinx the
stage or anything like that.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.350
But he got up there and he said
some really, really horrible,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.210
racist stuff.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.760
And that was the
end of his career.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.780
And so I think what's
really scary for us

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.940
is, anything we say,
especially with society

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.322
being really touchy
as it's gotten,

00:29:33.322 --> 00:29:35.030
it's not just that I
could walk the room,

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.590
I could tell a really bad joke,
and you could all just leave.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.006
But in this day
and age-- and this

00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:40.930
is on YouTube and all
those sorts of things

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.050
being taped for YouTube--
you can lose your career.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:44.852
It could be over.

00:29:44.852 --> 00:29:47.060
If you say something really,
really awful that people

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.280
just kind of get
horribly offended by,

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.390
you can lose your career.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.986
So that's another
reason it's scary.

00:29:52.986 --> 00:29:54.360
And finally, a
lot of people love

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.612
to ask, do you practice
in front of a mirror.

00:29:58.612 --> 00:30:00.070
It's a question I
get all the time.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.240
People go, do you practice
in front of the mirror.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.867
And no, I don't.

00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:05.450
I don't practice in
front of a mirror,

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.420
because practicing in front
of a mirror is like walking.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.670
It's easy to do.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.034
Anybody could just walk
on the sidewalk, right?

00:30:13.034 --> 00:30:15.200
Well, not anyone-- there
are some people that can't.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.870
But a lot of people can, OK?

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.080
Babies-- that's what
I was going to say.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.570
But if you look at public
speaking, we've all done this.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.140
We all have to speak
publicly, right?

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.044
And you ran it at home
and it went so well.

00:30:31.044 --> 00:30:31.960
You ran it in the car.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.335
You had a joke or you had
something you were going to do.

00:30:34.335 --> 00:30:36.650
And then you tell it to
people and nothing, right,

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.327
just nothing.

00:30:37.327 --> 00:30:38.410
And you go, what happened.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.619
It's because when you
get in front of people,

00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:42.160
it's like you're on
a balancing beam.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.346
The audience is the height.

00:30:43.346 --> 00:30:44.970
All of a sudden,
there's a consequence.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.550
You ever think that?

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.045
You see a ledge, you go,
well, if the ledge were

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.150
on the ground, I could walk it.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.560
You can walk on a straight line.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.641
But it's very hard to walk
if it's up in the air.

00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:52.140
Why?

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.375
Because there's consequences.

00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:54.000
You could fall.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.105
You could hurt yourself.

00:30:56.105 --> 00:30:58.230
And if that's public
speaking, then stand-up comedy

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.190
is walking a tight rope.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.710
OK?

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.290
It is a completely
different game,

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.750
because this is dangerous.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.800
This looks really scary.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.390
I don't know if this person has
a net under him or her or not,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.890
but this looks really scary.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.390
And what's hard about this also,
there are outside elements.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:10.610
OK?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.220
So the outside elements
and whether this person

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.594
is going to do this, you've
got the rope element as well.

00:31:14.594 --> 00:31:16.852
With a balance beam,
right, you're in one place.

00:31:16.852 --> 00:31:17.810
It's not going to move.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.750
You may move.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.120
This, you're moving
and the balance beam

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.630
slash rope is moving.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.159
So that's the element of timing.

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.450
And that's what's so difficult.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.439
So practicing in front
of a mirror does nothing.

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:29.730
The audience is going to laugh.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.350
It's you.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.800
You can laugh and see
the audience laugh.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.675
It's a mirror, right?

00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:36.300
So it's not really
that hard to do.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.370
I think I do want to talk
a little bit about jokes.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:48.670
At their core, jokes
are one, two, four.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:53.350
That's what a joke is at
it's most basic, meaning

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.042
that when you saw
me going one, two,

00:31:56.042 --> 00:31:58.500
you thought maybe I was going
to say three and I said four.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.940
You can now look at
it and go, oh, you

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.870
we're doubling the numbers.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:01.920
That's what you were doing.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.990
And that's what
a joke is, right?

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.573
After the person
tells the punch line,

00:32:04.573 --> 00:32:07.360
you go, oh yeah, OK, I should've
been able to figure that out.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:07.860
Right?

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.760
So you kind feel, oh
yeah, that's right.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.677
And so it's the
element of surprise.

00:32:12.677 --> 00:32:14.510
It's not one, two, three
or one, two, seven.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.780
OK?

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.571
So I had a friend of
mine explain it to me.

00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:18.400
He goes, oh, jokes
are A, B, G. I go,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.740
no, that doesn't make any sense.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.261
One, two, seven isn't a thing.

00:32:21.261 --> 00:32:23.760
One, two, three-- if I got up
here and said one, two, three,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.680
you'd all look at
me and go, yeah, so.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.580
We can count, dude.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.390
I mean, what, we came
here out of our time,

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.230
took time out of our
schedule to watch you count?

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.660
So basically, the idea is
that jokes are one, two, four.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.850
Every joke actually contains
a setup and a punch line.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.240
You go from point A to point
B. And there's actually

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.770
a comedy club here
in San Francisco

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.340
and it's called The Punch Line.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.470
I don't know how many
people have actually

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.300
been to The Punch Line.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.740
OK, from your nods,
some of the people

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.906
have been to The Punch Line.

00:32:51.906 --> 00:32:53.090
Actually, I perform there.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.610
I do really well
at The Punch Line,

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.360
but I think I could do a
lot better at a club called

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.860
the Setup.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.760
You know what I mean?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.774
If all I had to do
was just set up jokes,

00:32:59.774 --> 00:33:00.690
I would be way better.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.220
It's way easier to find
setups than punch lines.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.430
I don't know how many people
have been to a 3D movie.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.750
By round of applause, how many
people have been to a 3D movie?

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.309
You know how they
give you the glasses,

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:14.600
the red and blue glasses, in
the beginning of the film?

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.820
Have you ever done
this thing where,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.236
in the middle of the movie,
maybe you take the glasses off

00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:20.100
your face just to see
what the screen looks

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.492
like without the glasses?

00:33:22.492 --> 00:33:23.200
Yeah, it's weird.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.320
You ever drive along in your car
and look down at your odometer?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.180
And maybe it's 9,993
or 9,994, maybe 1,999.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.640
You're getting very, very close.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.139
And you think, oh
my gosh, I'm going

00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:38.549
to see it turn 10,000
or 100,000 on this.

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:39.590
I'm going to see it turn.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.530
Then maybe go through a
drive-through or a Starbucks

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.910
or something and you look
down and it's, like, 10,003

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.480
and you go, oh, I missed it.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.110
Anyway, I've got
about 20 of those

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.651
that I'm not going
to subject you to.

00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:53.970
But it is very, very easy, I
think, in life, to find setups.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.080
It's much, much harder
to find punch lines.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.990
One, two is the setup.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.900
And I believe there
were five reasons why

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.030
I am Indian worked, why it
was shared by Bollywood stars,

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.820
why it was played in front
of Narendra Modi, why

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.111
it was seen 50 million times.

00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:12.610
Why is that?

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.039
And it's only
500,000 on YouTube,

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:15.580
but if someone here
can jack that up,

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.550
that would help me a little bit.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.341
So if you can just play
with those numbers,

00:34:18.341 --> 00:34:20.000
that's why I really came here.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.980
But no, it got shared
a lot on Facebook

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.630
and it got shared
a lot on WhatsApp.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.900
I think, especially in India,
it got shared on WhatsApp a lot.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.989
That was really the thing.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:29.989
I didn't even know a video
could go viral on WhatsApp.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.614
I wasn't even aware
of that phenomenon.

00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:33.090
But that's kind
of what happened.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.010
So I think what's
important for anyone,

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.110
if you're trying to
communicate a message-- so how

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.980
does this now become
useful to some extent

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.563
once you know about
humor and stand-up

00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:44.159
and jokes-- when you're
trying to convey a message,

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.190
whether it's an email, whether
it's a commercial, whether it's

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.870
a product launch,
whether it's anything,

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.995
I think there are principles
that we could all use.

00:34:50.995 --> 00:34:54.350
And of course, I'm going to
say humor as the number one

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.440
since I'm a comedian.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.810
But how do we find a setup?

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.980
When I said jokes are one, two,
four-- for some of you just

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.320
joining us, I said jokes are
one, two, four-- one, two

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:05.970
is the setup.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:06.470
Right?

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.710
And people always ask, how
do you find these setups?

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.260
Where do you find them?

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.069
How do you do that?

00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:13.110
Well, that's the same
thing as asking a comedian,

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.610
where do you get
your material from.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.660
It's the exact same question
and it's a really good question.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.020
We don't look for what's funny.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.489
I think that's a big misnomer.

00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:22.030
I think a lot of
people think that we

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.240
walk around looking
with a pad and a pen

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.830
and trying to note down
behavior that we think is funny.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.440
That could not be
further from the truth.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.420
We look for things
that are incongruent.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.760
We look for incongruity,
or incongruence,

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.870
or whatever the word is.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.130
I don't know what the noun is.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.810
It doesn't matter,
you don't need

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.650
to know that stuff for this job.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.150
It only deals in language,
why would I know that?

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.620
But we deal in incongruity.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.880
We look for what's different.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.020
So if you looked at this
grid of black and white,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.300
we'll all go to the pink one.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.655
We'll all go to the
red dot, and that's

00:35:52.655 --> 00:35:53.738
just because we're Indian.

00:35:53.738 --> 00:35:57.400
But we'll all go to that and--
it's a bindi or a tilaka.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.510
But no, the idea is
we're looking at this

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.961
and all our eyes go there.

00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:02.460
Right?

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.910
Why?

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.870
Because it's different.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.190
And you look at it and you
go, hmm, that looks funny.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.350
Right?

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.891
Just like when somebody asks
you and you're not feeling well,

00:36:08.891 --> 00:36:10.210
you might say, I feel funny.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.543
What you mean is you feel
different from how you usually

00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:13.170
feel.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.290
And so we sort of
play around with that.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.290
That's a big thing.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:21.270
What a lot of marketers
will call that is a way in.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.895
A lot of times you have to make
a commercial or reach somebody.

00:36:23.895 --> 00:36:26.394
How are you going to find this
consumer when and where she's

00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:26.930
receptive?

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.450
And I worked at Procter and
Gamble for years at P and G,

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.430
punjabis and gujaratis.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.147
And I worked there
for a long time.

00:36:34.147 --> 00:36:36.730
Actually, well, now is as good
a time as any to tell you this.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.702
I'm Punjabi.

00:36:37.702 --> 00:36:39.160
That's my wife
sitting right there.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.264
So we just got married
six months ago.

00:36:41.264 --> 00:36:41.930
She's gujaratis.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.280
So yeah, thank you.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.292
I did it for the jokes, really.

00:36:46.292 --> 00:36:47.500
But yes, we just got married.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.077
And thank you for
the jaded applause.

00:36:51.077 --> 00:36:51.910
That's really great.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.868
Some of the guys are
going, oh, so she's taken.

00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.580
OK.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.830
That's why I stayed this long.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.454
We can leave now and
turn around again.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.370
But why, when I made that
video, when I made I am Indian--

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.240
this guy's laughing.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.156
See, it's true, right?

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:07.990
So there's something to
that, I guess, hopefully.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.940
So the reason I made the video--
why did I make I am Indian?

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.380
What was the way in?

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.170
I was sick and tired of
calling myself South Asian.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.710
I just got tired of it.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.110
I know it's inclusive.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.530
I know it connects
into race better

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.667
to say South Asian
than to say Indian.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:25.500
But I really meant what
I said in the video.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.662
There's 1.3 billion of us.

00:37:26.662 --> 00:37:28.120
We don't need a
cardinal direction.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.360
Don't call us East Indian.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:29.860
OK?

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.530
We're Indian.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.030
That's it.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.071
It's not our fault
Christopher Columbus got lost.

00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:34.290
That's why I said that line.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.580
And it really bothered me.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.800
It really irked me.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.082
And I felt that as long as
we kept saying South Asian,

00:37:39.082 --> 00:37:40.790
we were going to lose
"Indian" as a word.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.248
People just aren't going to
say it anymore in this country.

00:37:43.248 --> 00:37:44.630
And I thought, that's not OK.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.720
And I got tired at--
that one that really

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.440
pissed me off was Asian Indian.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.865
I actually wrote a couple
of State Farm commercials

00:37:51.865 --> 00:37:54.690
and Omi Vaidya was
the star of those.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.204
And I realized that--
not that ad agency,

00:37:58.204 --> 00:38:00.620
but they were telling us that
agencies, a lot of the time,

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.828
will have people check a box.

00:38:01.828 --> 00:38:04.102
And they refer to us as
the Asian Indian market.

00:38:04.102 --> 00:38:06.310
And I was just thinking,
where do you think India is.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.930
It is in Asia.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.660
You're just saying it twice.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.700
I'm not a male man, right?

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.990
I'm sort of dressed like
one, I guess you could say.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.980
But I should say man
male, the other way.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.112
But no, we don't
have to say it twice

00:38:17.112 --> 00:38:19.570
and just get more general or
something like that, you know?

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.660
So I knew there was
something there.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.820
That was incongruent to me.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.028
There was something about
saying South Asian and East

00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:27.002
Indian that really bothered me.

00:38:27.002 --> 00:38:29.460
And that what we do is we write
the jokes around the facts.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.876
We don't write
facts around jokes.

00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:33.430
We don't try to
find stuff like that

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.050
and write jokes
around it, because you

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.000
stay in "sillyville."

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.720
If you really want to say
something, we don't go,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.190
what's funny about this, we
say, what are we making fun of.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.950
Who's the victim?

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.500
What are we really
trying to poke fun at?

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.100
And in this particular video,
I was making fun of ignorance.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.120
That was a big thing.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.495
And then I already explained
the versus the feathers,

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.370
dots versus feathers.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.724
So a lot of people
I know-- I wanted

00:38:54.724 --> 00:38:57.140
to use one of the Golden State
Warriors since I'm up here,

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.120
but we couldn't find
any unrestricted images

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.470
of Steph Curry.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.647
But this specific one was--
and it's an alley-oop, right?

00:39:03.647 --> 00:39:05.230
That's kind of what
a joke is as well.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.438
It's the setup and the punch.

00:39:06.438 --> 00:39:09.490
And a lot of times, we'll have
a miscommunication in life

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.220
when you're trying
to speak to somebody.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.740
And you'll tell
something and somebody

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.780
will just completely miss it.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:13.960
Right?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.010
We've all sent e-mails,
we got no response.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.510
Right?

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.550
You sent it to 50 people.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.341
Oh my gosh, I can't
wait to check my inbox.

00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:20.510
No one wrote back, right?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.170
And a lot of the time,
it was because the person

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.878
missed the setup.

00:39:22.878 --> 00:39:26.280
They just didn't get the context
of what you were trying to say.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.330
And so if this ball
is an errant toss

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.454
and it goes away
from the player,

00:39:30.454 --> 00:39:31.870
he's not going to
able to slam it.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.180
Right?

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.730
You need to set it up properly
and then you get the punch.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:37.380
Then you get the impact.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.279
There's actually a
third part to jokes.

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:40.820
So there's the setup,
the punch line,

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.040
and I'll tell you a little
thing that a lot of people who

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.260
are not stand-ups don't know.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.245
There's a third part
to a joke called a tag.

00:39:46.245 --> 00:39:47.870
And there's a four
part called walk out

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.630
when they leave the room.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.060
A third part called
the tag-- it's usually

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.040
further explanation
or an act out.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.825
You'll see a lot of
comedians say a line

00:39:56.825 --> 00:39:58.700
and then they'll act it
out, or do an accent,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.880
or something like that.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.000
A great example is Seinfeld
has a bit about laundry.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.970
And he talks about
washing laundry.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.900
And his joke is,
now they show you

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.110
how detergents take
out bloodstains,

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.172
a pretty violent image there.

00:40:11.172 --> 00:40:13.630
I think if you got a t-shirt
with a bloodstain all over it,

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.688
maybe laundry isn't
your biggest problem.

00:40:16.688 --> 00:40:19.187
Maybe you should get rid of the
body before you do the wash.

00:40:19.187 --> 00:40:20.810
Right?

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.360
So that's a beautiful joke, as
you can tell by the laughter.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.860
The set up is, now
they show you how

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.750
detergents take out bloodstains,
a pretty violent image there.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.440
The punch line is,
I think, if you've

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.273
got a t-shirt with blood
stains all over it,

00:40:31.273 --> 00:40:33.520
maybe laundry isn't
your biggest problem.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.391
And then after the
laugh, he tags it again--

00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:37.140
and this is why he's
one of the greatest--

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.170
maybe you should get rid of the
body before you do the wash.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.920
That's the tag.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.480
And he even has another
tag where he says,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.450
maybe you should try getting
the harpoon out of your chest

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:43.870
first.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.370
Right?

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.190
So again, right,
it's another laugh.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.190
It's another way of keeping
and getting these things.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.490
This is where it gets
interesting, finally.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.000
I used to work, like I
said, at Procter and Gamble.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.620
This is the structure of every
commercial you've ever seen.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.846
We-- I still say we-- we
were the world's largest--

00:41:00.846 --> 00:41:02.720
we're still the world's
largest-- advertiser.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.094
I just don't work
there anymore--

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:07.340
but world's largest advertiser
making a lot of commercials.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.740
And every commercial you've seen
is structured just like a joke.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.170
It's structured as an insight,
a benefit, and a reason

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.810
to believe.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:16.910
Every ad is like that.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:18.720
It doesn't have to go,
necessarily in that order.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.240
But now, when you
watch commercials,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.110
you will see-- you'll
start to notice this.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.180
Insight is also known as
an accepted consumer belief

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.080
and it gets us all on
the same page-- something

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.790
like, no guy likes
the irritation that

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.770
comes with shaving.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.070
Right?

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.230
And then all of the guys are
sort of nodding our heads

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.630
and going that's right,
unless you're you

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.046
and you don't shave very well--
very often-- I should say,

00:41:38.046 --> 00:41:39.902
not very well, very often.

00:41:39.902 --> 00:41:41.110
Really looking scruffy there.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.050
So but no, we don't
like the irritation

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.450
that comes with shaving.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.860
The benefit would be, the
new Gillette Fusion razor

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.021
provides a close shave
without razor burn.

00:41:50.021 --> 00:41:50.520
Right?

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.370
So now guys go, cool, OK,
so that's the benefit.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.170
And the reason to
believe could be

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.550
that's because Gillette has
added an 89th blade to it's

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.400
eludium pew 36 explosive
space modulator

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.120
or whatever the blades now have.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.750
There are so many blades.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.750
But I think that's what's
really interesting, is

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.454
that jokes and ads have
the same structure.

00:42:09.454 --> 00:42:11.370
You know, a joke is a
setup, punch, and a tag.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.930
And an ad is an insite,
benefit, and reason to believe.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.877
So a lot of people, after I
made that video, a lot of people

00:42:17.877 --> 00:42:19.960
said, oh, I liked your
commercial, which I thought

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.700
was really interesting.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.090
I thought, well, it wasn't
really a commercial.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.810
But I get, now, why people
say that it was a commercial.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:28.127
It's just like when, in
India, when we go to India--

00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:30.210
I did a tour there-- I've
done a few tours there--

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.870
it's really funny,
because Indians in India

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.286
have a different
way of explaining

00:42:33.286 --> 00:42:34.960
that they like your videos.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.400
You know, here, people will
come up to me and they'll say,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.560
oh, I saw your YouTube video.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.770
I liked your-- there, in India.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.180
They they're so
sweet-- they say,

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.575
you know, I saw your youtubes.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.920
I love your youtubes,
Jar, I love your youtubes.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.150
It just sounds very
personal, you know,

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.440
like you've seen my tubes.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.398
I don't have any tubes.

00:42:53.398 --> 00:42:55.480
I mean, I'm post-med,
I realize that,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.490
but I don't have any tubes.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.180
Folks, I'm going to stop there,
because even though I have more

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.190
things to say, I want
to probably leave

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.372
a little bit of time
for Q&amp;A. And if there

00:43:06.372 --> 00:43:08.330
are any other main things
that I wanted to say,

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.580
we're going to do a Q&amp;A here.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.080
And then I think we'll take
some questions from the audience

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.580
as well.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.339
But just so I can
wrap it up, I could

00:43:15.339 --> 00:43:17.880
say that the second thing was
making an emotional connection.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.350
So the first thing
was using humor.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.840
The second thing was making
an emotional connection, which

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.150
I think that that video did.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.000
And a lot of people felt
that it came from my soul.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.660
And I think that's
an important thing,

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.368
is when we write things
and convey things

00:43:31.368 --> 00:43:34.840
that we aspire with our head
and we pine with our hearts.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.500
We crave with our bodies, right,
but we yearn with our souls.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.420
And so if you want to make
something that really--N I

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.169
don't know when I turn
into Deepak Chopra,

00:43:41.169 --> 00:43:43.455
but the idea is-- I even
had a slide for that.

00:43:43.455 --> 00:43:44.080
That's too bad.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.389
I had a slide with me and
Deepak Chopra, but oh well.

00:43:46.389 --> 00:43:48.180
I don't know how many
of these other slides

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.420
I really wanted to show
you, but that's OK.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.030
There were more, but
why don't we stop there,

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.270
just in the interest of time?

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.831
And we'll go ahead and we'll
do the Q&amp;A. OK, thanks.

00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:00.330
All right.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:00.966
Thank you.

00:44:00.966 --> 00:44:03.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:04.286 --> 00:44:05.160
There's me as Ghandi.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.510
I at least got to show you that.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.468
So that's me as Ghandi.

00:44:07.468 --> 00:44:08.350
OK.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
you told us that you

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.340
did a lot of TV commercials.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.870
Is there any favorites?

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.250
And do you want to
tell us a story about

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.715
how you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:17.715 --> 00:44:19.580
RAJIV SATYAL: I think
the ones that we

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.890
wrote for-- so a friend
of mine and I in LA,

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.630
we co-wrote a couple of
State Farm commercials.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.650
And they were played
by Omi Vaidya.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.980
He was-- Vaidya, he
was the actor in them.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.260
And again, one of
them was called--

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.560
it was an Indian wedding.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.360
And it rains, you know?

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.439
And they have to somehow
all jump in a car.

00:44:37.439 --> 00:44:39.480
And they're just wondering
if they have insurance

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.438
and that sort of thing.

00:44:40.438 --> 00:44:43.269
So I think just the spectacle
of a huge Indian wedding

00:44:43.269 --> 00:44:44.560
was kind of a cool thing to do.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.050
So I think that's what's
really great about this job is

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:51.802
that you are always looking for
how you can express your jokes.

00:44:51.802 --> 00:44:53.260
And that was actually
another point

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.770
that-- I'll just go
to my talking points

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.645
like I'm Marco Rubio.

00:44:55.645 --> 00:45:01.106
But you know, Barack Obama
knew exactly what he was doing.

00:45:01.106 --> 00:45:02.230
I'll just keep saying that.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.021
But that's the idea.

00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:06.270
As a commercial, we were
always trying to reach people

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.880
and saying where
are they receptive.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.860
Should it be a TV ad?

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.990
Should be a billboard?

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.580
Should it be an internet pop-up?

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.840
Please God, no.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.630
And jokes are the same
way, right, where you go,

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.730
does this work as a tweet.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.271
Does it work as an
Instagram picture?

00:45:19.271 --> 00:45:21.110
Does it work on stage?

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.370
Is it a sketch or
is it a commercial?

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.000
So I think part of
being a comedian

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.790
is being able to tell jokes
in a wide variety of media.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:30.670
And so a lot of people
ask me that-- so,

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.840
how do you go over in India?

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.400
And I think it works,
I think, largely,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.710
because I try to talk about
our-- there's an old quote that

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.690
says we bond according
to our similarities

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.100
and we grow according to our
differences, which I think

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.680
is beautiful and I love that.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.679
But I think that
a lot of comedy is

00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:51.970
about bringing people together.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.180
What do we all do together?

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.940
And I find that stuff
to be a lot more

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.940
fun than the stuff that
sort of divides us apart

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.315
and go, well, I disagree with
this or disagree with that.

00:45:59.315 --> 00:46:01.740
So I think, in that way, being
able to write commercials

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.948
is kind of cool, because
you get to express something

00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:05.490
in a visual medium.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: How did
you get into comedy?

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.730
Like saying you were a
materials engineer, then

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.030
you worked with
P&amp;G as a marketer--

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.120
what was your in into comedy?

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.299
RAJIV SATYAL: I volunteered
at a tennis tournament,

00:46:19.299 --> 00:46:20.090
because I'm Indian.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.800
And you have to do something
with tennis, right?

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.340
It has to-- in this
country, especially.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.250
It's cricket in India.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.280
But here, the Indians who
couldn't play football,

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.154
we basically had to do
something with tennis.

00:46:28.154 --> 00:46:31.130
And so I worked in
the player locker room

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.730
in Cincinnati, which is one
of the-- there are the four

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:34.870
grand slams in
tennis-- I don't know

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.369
how much everyone knows about
tennis-- the four grand slams.

00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:40.094
And then it's the third
largest tournament after that.

00:46:40.094 --> 00:46:42.260
So it's one of the biggest
tournaments in the world.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.470
And I was working in the locker
room, got to see the players--

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.565
a little bit too
much of the players.

00:46:48.565 --> 00:46:50.190
And I actually was
going to go on stage

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.090
for the very first time.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.790
But then I ended up talking to
Pete Sampras, who, at the time,

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.290
was the world's
number one player.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.150
And I did my stand-up
act for Pete Sampras.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.358
That was the first time I'm
ever did stand-up comedy.

00:47:00.358 --> 00:47:01.920
It was just for
him, and his doctor,

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.800
and a trainer, and my
supervisor, and one other guy.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.262
And I did stand-up for him.

00:47:08.262 --> 00:47:10.220
And it was really this
mind-blowing experience.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.770
And it went kind
of not that well.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.100
Gut it gave me the
confidence of going with it.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.820
I had pictures
and posters of him

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.370
all over my room,
him and Andre Agassi.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.320
And to me, to be able to
do that and get through it

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.670
gave me a lot of confidence
to say, OK, let me go up

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:27.980
and enter this
contest in Cincinnati,

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.130
which is where I'm from.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.382
And I entered a contest.

00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:33.465
I made the semifinals and
the next year, I won it.

00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:36.102
So I sort of had this
knack to be able to do it.

00:47:36.102 --> 00:47:38.310
But I wasn't really sure I
wanted to do it for a job.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.334
Because I think, being Indian
was a real sort of-- you

00:47:41.334 --> 00:47:43.750
kind of go, well, that's not--
you have to be an engineer.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.135
You have to be a doctor.

00:47:45.135 --> 00:47:47.620
You can't go do that as a job.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.342
And that's not a
real thing, you know?

00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:52.050
And even when I would
go to comedy clubs,

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.760
I would never look
at the guys and go,

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.880
I'm going to be that guy.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.560
I never thought that that
would be something I would do.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.540
So the fact that
I do it full time

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.020
is still kind of a
mind-blowing thing.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.847
I'm surprised that I get
not paid to come here.

00:48:05.847 --> 00:48:06.430
Next question.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:12.990
I'm not bitter.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.740
I'm not bitter.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.550
Not bitter.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.990
Not bitter.

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: To
give others context,

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:22.300
Rajiv also hosts shows or,
like, motivation sessions

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.570
with corporations
and NFL players.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.620
What's people's
reactions when they

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.450
say-- when the
company tells them,

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.490
hey, a comedian is
here to motivate

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.580
you guys to do your job better?

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.640
RAJIV SATYAL: I think
people, at first,

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.550
are kind of going, well, what's
a comedian go to tell us.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.210
I think that's a
natural sort of thing.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.250
But I think it's funny
that you bring up

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:47.460
the NFL, because performing
for football players

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.300
was an interesting experience.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.775
And I actually had to do
a three-hour-- some of you

00:48:51.775 --> 00:48:54.150
are going, well, I can't even
take this guy for an hour--

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.460
a three-hour session
on personal branding.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.570
And it was all about
life after the NFL.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:00.690
And these were rookies.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.023
These were players who were--
first of all, you have a 1

00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.482
in 16,000 chance
of making the NFL.

00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:06.398
And that's if you played
high school football,

00:49:06.398 --> 00:49:07.180
not you, not me.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.760
I don't-- it's way-- it's
like Powerball numbers for US.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.260
OK?

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.780
But for these guys
who actually have

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.280
the speed, and the
strength, and all

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.200
that-- I don't know why
I picked on you for that.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.290
But anyway, point being that--
I don't want to play in the NFL.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.940
I'd rather be
[INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.040
But it's a very
difficult thing and so

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.870
it's not a receptive
audience at all.

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:28.614
I mean, these guys
just got to the NFL.

00:49:28.614 --> 00:49:29.530
They're all pumped up.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.161
Let me talk about
life after football,

00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:32.160
after you don't make it.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.660
Right?

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.570
I mean, what is that?

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.740
It could be not a more hostile
audience, you could imagine.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.440
It's a three-hour
mandatory session.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.270
They don't necessarily
want to be there.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.950
And at the time, I was 32.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:46.350
And I was a 32-year-old
scrawny Indian nerd

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:50.174
talking to 22-year-old
black and white jocks.

00:49:50.174 --> 00:49:52.840
You know, just football players,
guys who could good just mash--

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.214
you know, stuff guys like me
into a locker kind of thing,

00:49:55.214 --> 00:49:55.750
right?

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.320
And I won them over.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.839
Because I was trying to talk
and they're just stone-faced,

00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:00.380
just nothing.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.434
Just when do we--
that kind of thing.

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:05.100
I just tried to talk
to one of the guys.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.590
And I just said, so
what do you do, man?

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.039
I just go out to clubs
and stuff, you know.

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:12.080
And I said, do you dance?

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:12.890
He goes, no, I don't dance.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.910
I go, you just
roll up your pants

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.540
and do the Rockaway, which
was a line from a hip hop song

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.940
that was popular at the time.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.570
And he goes, oh, OK, OK.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:20.762
And then I got him, right?

00:50:20.762 --> 00:50:23.220
So there was something I had
to say that I had to go to him

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.082
to say, I speak your
language, right?

00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:26.790
It's the same thing
wherever you perform,

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.160
whether it's the Middle East,
or India, or it's Alabama.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.450
You have to say something.

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.250
I mean, I got out
in front of Alabama,

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.120
400 white and
black people, maybe

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.200
10 black people,
390 white people.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.160
No brown people
anywhere to be found.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.810
Alabama-- I mean,
not even Birmingham,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.180
but outside of Birmingham.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.370
And I got up there and I
went out there and I just,

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.475
in an Indian accent
I said, roll tide.

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:47.100
And they went nuts,
right, because they

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.930
love the Alabama Crimson Tide.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.680
They went crazy.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.890
Oh my god, this guy knows.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:51.390
Right?

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:56.350
So you need to say something
specific that will get people.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.550
I do a joke about how
I was trying to-- I

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.600
was on shoddy.com.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.130
It's not really shoddy,
it's shoddy-- S-H-O-D-D-Y--

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.840
shoddy.com.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.270
Or shady.com, right?

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:10.820
And so I was on that.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.015
And it asked all these questions
and it asked if I was a manglik

00:51:14.015 --> 00:51:16.080
And I didn't know what
a manglik was, you know?

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.240
So I looked it up online.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.710
And I always did
a joke about how

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.610
I felt bad looking
up my culture online.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:23.080
But so many Indians
work at Google,

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.321
it's like asking your uncle.

00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:24.820
Right?

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.600
So it was this big
thing, a big laugh

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.370
line that works everywhere
but at Google, apparently.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.289
OK, great.

00:51:31.289 --> 00:51:32.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.900
I will open up the
house for some questions

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.740
before I go and rant on.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.035
Anybody has any questions?

00:51:40.035 --> 00:51:40.534
Yes.

00:51:40.534 --> 00:51:42.909
AUDIENCE: You talked about
having a knack for this thing.

00:51:42.909 --> 00:51:44.368
Do you think people
can learn this?

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:45.867
RAJIV SATYAL: Can
people learn this?

00:51:45.867 --> 00:51:47.640
So it's sort of the
age old question of,

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.420
is it innate, right?

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.940
Is it congenital
or is it-- that's

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.140
not a bad word-- congenital--
or is it born leaders?

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.990
People always have
the same question.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.430
I think-- I just read a
book called "On Writing"

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:00.660
by Stephen King.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.960
And it's a great book, even
if you're not into writing,

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.034
because he breaks things
down so specifically.

00:52:07.034 --> 00:52:09.200
He tells you, hey, this
work-- it's different things

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.075
for different people.

00:52:10.075 --> 00:52:12.170
But you look at his
bio and it says,

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.550
Stephen King has written
50 books, all of them

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.700
worldwide bestsellers.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.090
OK, I'm going to listen
to this guy, right?

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:17.890
Because I've been
telling somebody,

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.306
he goes, well,
that works for him.

00:52:19.306 --> 00:52:21.130
I go, you haven't even
published anything.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.400
Yes, that works
for Stephen King.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.691
I think I'm going to read this.

00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:28.229
And he talks about where he puts
his desk, how many hours a day

00:52:28.229 --> 00:52:29.270
to write, how many words.

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.530
He really breaks it down.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:35.560
But he basically gives you four
categories of bad, competent,

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.760
good, and great.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.510
And he says people
like Ernest Hemingway--

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.280
great, just great,
just touched by God.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.949
There's nothing
that you can-- he

00:52:42.949 --> 00:52:44.240
doesn't have to read this book.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.031
And then there are
people who are just bad.

00:52:46.031 --> 00:52:46.800
They're just bad.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.475
You know?

00:52:47.475 --> 00:52:49.350
Because I get people
asking me that question.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.430
They go, how do I get better.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.388
And I watch their first
time on stage and I go,

00:52:52.388 --> 00:52:53.540
I was never that bad.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.560
I'm sorry, I was
just never that bad.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.060
I mean, I watch my first set
and I go, that's pretty good.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:58.560
Right?

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.890
I had some game.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.150
I had some chops.

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.270
But what he talks about is,
if you're bad, you're bad.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.550
If you're great, you're great.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.440
But the book is supposed to
take you from competent to good.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.690
And he calls himself good.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.190
Right?

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.350
So he's Hemingway--
so I would say,

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.960
Chris Rock, George
Carlin, Dave Chappelle,

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.240
these guys are great.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.215
Then you have the bad people
who are bad, who, you know,

00:53:21.215 --> 00:53:23.060
we've seen them.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.712
Then you've got people
who are competent.

00:53:25.712 --> 00:53:27.170
And then you're
trying to get good.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.490
I would call myself
competent and I would

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:30.880
say I'm trying to get good.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.930
But to say I'm
going to be great,

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.674
that's sort of,
wow, that's amazing.

00:53:35.674 --> 00:53:36.590
You're going to great?

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:37.590
I mean, how many people
could come to Google

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.990
and go, I'm going to be Sundar?

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.270
I'm going to be Sundar Pichai.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.510
I mean, you're going to.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.210
Then they take
entrepreneurial classes.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.070
I don't think
entrepreneurs have to take

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.170
entrepreneurial
classes, you just

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.920
know how to start a company.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.440
Sorry.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.940
But yeah, I think it's
a similar kind of thing,

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:56.577
that I think a lot of it--
it's similar to dancing.

00:53:56.577 --> 00:53:58.160
With dancing, you
have to have rhythm.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.576
But you don't have
to have rhythm.

00:53:59.576 --> 00:54:02.110
If you can count, you
don't have to have rhythm.

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.401
So if you can get on the
dance floor and you can count,

00:54:04.401 --> 00:54:05.790
you can bypass rhythm.

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.320
Timing is the same
thing as comedy.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.380
You can learn to tell jokes,
but you'll never have timing,

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.900
and so you won't be great.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.090
But you might be good.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:16.370
OK.

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:18.382
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any
other questions?

00:54:18.382 --> 00:54:20.840
RAJIV SATYAL: If you've got to
leave, I totally understand.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.820
I don't want to hold anyone.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.830
I know people have
meetings and stuff.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.455
AUDIENCE: It's
obviously awesome to see

00:54:24.455 --> 00:54:27.050
so many Indian American
comics emerge on the scene.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.272
So there's tons of
material for Americans,

00:54:30.272 --> 00:54:31.480
tons of material for Indians.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.510
And you put both
of them together,

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.718
it's like a nuclear reaction.

00:54:33.718 --> 00:54:35.380
You have 10 times the material.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.480
All that is awesome,
but do you see a time

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.220
when the Indian Americans
grow past their ethnic roots

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.460
and do secular comedy?

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.160
And when you see
an Indian American,

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.200
the first thing you
imagine is they're going

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.040
to tap their ethnic roots.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.210
Do you see that going
past their roots

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.550
and just do awesome comedy
like Seinfeld or something?

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.450
RAJIV SATYAL: Sort
of Asian fusion?

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:56.867
Sort of the fission
kind of thing.

00:54:56.867 --> 00:54:58.991
I always think that Indian
Americans, specifically,

00:54:58.991 --> 00:55:00.120
are very good comedians.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.850
A lot of that is because we are
products of the world's largest

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.000
democracy and the world's
most powerful democracy.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.571
So we're sort of
free speech squared.

00:55:07.571 --> 00:55:08.070
Right?

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.690
I mean, we're raised
to have free speech

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.824
and it's just
amplified, right, which

00:55:12.824 --> 00:55:14.240
is why I think if
you look at some

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.980
of the Indian American
actors, they're OK.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.300
I think they're OK.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.190
But I think the Indian American
comedians are really strong.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.630
And I think you're seeing
that with Aziz Ansari.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.255
I think Aziz Ansari
doesn't necessarily

00:55:23.255 --> 00:55:25.562
do a lot of ethnic humor.

00:55:25.562 --> 00:55:28.020
And when I say American, I kind
of include Russell in that.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.650
He's Canadian, but it's the
51st through 55th state,

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:31.210
so whatever.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:32.334
It's 30 million people.

00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:33.500
Come on, it's not a country.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.069
So the point is,
it's not America.

00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:38.110
It's certainly not India.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.820
But I think that there's
the idea that, yes,

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.987
I think you're seeing that.

00:55:41.987 --> 00:55:43.820
I think you're seeing
people who do mine it.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.030
I think that, hopefully,
I try to walk that line.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.240
I try to do stuff that, I
think, appeals to everyone.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.260
But there's that sweet
spot of targeting

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.490
of saying, if you're Indian,
you probably maybe get

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:53.390
it a little bit more.

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:55.545
But I don't think, any
more, people feel that.

00:55:55.545 --> 00:55:56.920
The first two
years I did comedy,

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.210
I didn't do any Indian
jokes at all-- none.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.270
And so I don't think
it's necessary.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:04.569
But I think we can support
Indian American comedians

00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:06.860
and I really appreciate the
support today and everybody

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:07.360
coming out.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.200
Because this is how we do
it to quote Montell Jordan.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would
put in one of my questions.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.744
So you said that you
guys just got married.

00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:18.410
Thank you for coming
here today, Harsha.

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:21.100
And I know that
there's a funny story

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.680
behind how you proposed to her.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.520
Do you want to tell
that story to everyone?

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.705
RAJIV SATYAL: Or do you?

00:56:26.705 --> 00:56:29.080
The way you said it I though
maybe you wanted to tell it,

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.038
so I thought, OK, fine.

00:56:30.038 --> 00:56:34.680
Well, I proposed to Harsha on
stage, which was kind of cool.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.070
We were-- I was performing
at the Cincinnati Funny Bone.

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:39.575
And I was opening
for Kevin Nealon,

00:56:39.575 --> 00:56:41.450
who you might know from
"Saturday Night Live"

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:42.400
or from "Weeds."

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.655
And I proposed to Harsha.

00:56:44.655 --> 00:56:46.280
There's actually a
YouTube video of it,

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.170
so you can Google it or
YouTube it, and look it up,

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.670
and see that proposal,
which is pretty cool.

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.670
And then I did that in
front of Kevin Nealon.

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:55.920
And then we had Russell
Peters perform at our wedding.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.080
So that was pretty sweet.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.640
That was a great comedic
arc to the whole thing.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.570
And since I had to be
the last one to speak,

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:04.445
I could say Russell
Peters has opened for me,

00:57:04.445 --> 00:57:05.740
so that was the whole idea.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.880
But we got married--
Harsha is from Austin,

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.280
so we got married in Texas.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.000
And we had a full-on
cowboys and Indians wedding,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.340
because it was kind of great.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.990
Because we're Indians,
but I'm a cowboy.

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.500
I'm Hindu.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.300
I worship cows.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.690
So I really am a cowboy.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:27.953
We have time for one more
question from the audience.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.220
RAJIV SATYAL: We exhausted it.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.886
It's like popcorn
that stopping popping.

00:57:34.886 --> 00:57:35.986
Rania.

00:57:35.986 --> 00:57:37.969
AUDIENCE: So in terms
of asking-- sorry,

00:57:37.969 --> 00:57:40.468
in terms of making jokes that,
sometimes, can offend people,

00:57:40.468 --> 00:57:42.958
I'm just curious about
any time that, maybe, you

00:57:42.958 --> 00:57:45.448
have made a joke that crossed
the line, how you recovered.

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.320
RAJIV SATYAL: I mean,
I've bombed many times.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.140
I mean, every comedian has.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.680
But I'm trying to
think if I've done

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:59.061
anything that was so over
the top that really offended

00:57:59.061 --> 00:57:59.560
people.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.560
I mean, I've definitely
had people come up to me

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.040
after shows and say, wow,
that was-- that one joke.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.750
Actually, there was a
joke I did-- OK, yeah.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:11.130
So I was in Chicago and I was
performing with Hari Kondabolu.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.720
Hannibal Buress,
actually, was there.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.970
Hannibal Buress
was our headliner.

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.600
It was all mostly
a Desi comedy show.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.183
It was an Indian
comedy show, largely.

00:58:17.183 --> 00:58:19.920
But we had Hannibal Buress
perform, actually, in Chicago.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.170
And it was for a
women's shelter.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.810
OK?

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.510
So I did one of my jokes that
I do that usually goes over

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.110
really well.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.859
And it didn't in the
beginning, because it

00:58:30.859 --> 00:58:32.860
had a certain-- I
did the joke where

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.850
I go, we all have a number
on a scale from one to 10.

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.090
And I'm a 6, and I know
that, and that's fine.

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:40.173
And she's looking at me
like, dude, you're a four.

00:58:40.173 --> 00:58:42.102
But seriously, the idea
is-- the thing is--

00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:44.060
and I'm Indian, so I've
come up with a formula.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.082
And the formula is,
you can only date

00:58:46.082 --> 00:58:48.040
and be happy with somebody
who's up or down one

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.300
digit from you on the scale.

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:49.800
OK?

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.430
That's-- really, it is.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:52.380
So if you're a six, you can
be happy with a five, six,

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:52.680
or seven.

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.105
Don't act.

00:58:53.105 --> 00:58:53.890
Ask how this happened.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.431
I don't know.

00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:56.667
But that's the rule, right?

00:58:56.667 --> 00:58:58.250
So you can date a
five, six, or seven.

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.010
But I married a 10.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.750
So at the time, I was single.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.780
And so I said, but
I've dated tens before.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.310
And people go,
well, how is that.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.310
Well, the thing is, women,
you are what you are.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.520
I go, you know, if you're
an eight, you're an eight.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.080
You're beautiful.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.660
But you can't go up
or down on the scale.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.993
We live in a chauvinist society.

00:59:13.993 --> 00:59:16.250
But fellas can go up on
the scale if we're funny

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:17.460
and we have money.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.279
So I'm a six for looks.

00:59:19.279 --> 00:59:20.320
I'm funny on most nights.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.090
I become a seven.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.298
I've got some money in the
bank so i become an eight.

00:59:23.298 --> 00:59:24.440
And that's how I date tens.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.680
And I know some people are
looking at me, like, yeah,

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.820
but that's still
two numbers apart.

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:28.320
Right?

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.890
What I do is I meet at 10 and
I break her self-esteem down

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.296
so she thinks she's a nine.

00:59:32.296 --> 00:59:33.030
Right?

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.655
It's funny.

00:59:33.655 --> 00:59:34.155
See?

00:59:34.155 --> 00:59:35.350
Everybody's laughing.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:39.170
But the room, being a battered
women's shelter kind of

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:42.770
went-- you know, one
of those moments.

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.950
And Hari comes back to me
backstage and just goes,

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:47.770
dude, telling that
joke at this place.

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:48.454
I go, I know.

00:59:48.454 --> 00:59:51.120
And I had a couple women come up
to me and say, come on, really.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.760
I said, yeah, it's funny.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.530
I mean, sorry, that's
a funny joke, OK?

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.550
It's just funny.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.330
But yeah, I think
that was definitely

00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:58.560
not knowing your audience.

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.643
And I didn't get to that
part of the presentation,

01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:03.000
but I do a whole thing
about knowing your audience.
