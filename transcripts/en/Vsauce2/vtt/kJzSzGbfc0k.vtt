00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.430
Vsauce! Kevin here. And you have a dilemma.
I have two envelopes and you can only choose

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:14.820
one. There’s door number one. And there's
door number two. Uhh.. Oh.There's actually

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.390
three envelopes here. Uhh great. Now we no
longer have a dilemma.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.440
Here's why.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.070
Di comes from the Greek for “twice” and
lemma means “premise”. So a di-lemma involves

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.620
two premises from which you have to choose.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.010
Adding a third envelope means this choice
isn’t technically a dilemma -- but it does

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.329
setup a very famous paradox. Wait. Let’s
dissect the word paradox like we just did

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.760
with dilemma to find out exactly what a paradox
is.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.710
Okay, Para comes from the latin “distinct
from” and dox comes from doxa, meaning “our

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.710
opinion.”

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.610
“Paradox” translates literally as ‘distinct
from our opinion.’ So there ya go. Now.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.520
Distinct from our opinion? That didn’t really
help at all. I thought a paradox was like

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.080
an unsolvable brain teaser? So how do three
envelopes setup a paradox?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.300
What is 
a paradox?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.299
In 1961, Logician and philosopher Willard
Van Orman Quine outlined the three categories

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.500
of paradoxes and I have them each hidden inside
these three envelopes. One represents the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.320
kind of paradox that you’re most familiar
with. Those that defy logic like the impossible

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.880
waterfall from this video's intro. The other
two are… what?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.560
Well. Let’s crack one of ‘em open and
find out.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.590
Falsidical.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.990
This is why Achilles can never catch a tortoise.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.810
We’ll use this bootleg Rambo to represent
Achilles and a Ninja Turtle PEZ will be our

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.840
tortoise. If the tortoise gets a 100 meter
head start, then Achilles starts running,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.760
by the time he gets to the 100-meter mark,
the tortoise will have moved another meter.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.700
It takes Achilles some more time to get to
that 101-meter mark and in that time, the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.180
tortoise has moved forward even further.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.230
Achilles will always be catching up to the
place the tortoise was as the tortoise inches

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.590
forward. The gap gets smaller, but the tortoise
is always slightly ahead. According to Greek

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.459
philosopher Zeno of Elea, who dreamed up this
paradox 2,500 years ago, the fastest runner

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.060
in the world can never overtake a tortoise
in a race because you can infinitely divide

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.150
the distance between them as the tortoise
advances.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.860
But that’s ridiculous. We know it’s not
true. Even with a head start I could outrun

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.459
a tortoise. And I’m no Achilles. So how
can this be a paradox?

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.470
Zeno knew Achilles could catch up to the tortoise
in real life, but he couldn’t prove it mathematically.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.110
He thought there would be an infinite number
of new points for the tortoise to reach that

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.550
Achilles had to reach… because he didn’t
know that an infinite series of numbers could

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.879
add up to a finite value -- no one knew that
for another 2,000 years. What we now call

00:03:47.879 --> 00:04:01.310
a convergent series. ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + 1/16
+ 1/32 goes on forever, but it eventually

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:12.190
adds up to 1. And at that 1 is where, mathematically,
Achilles finally reaches the tortoise.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.019
We knew that Achilles could catch up to the
tortoise, but it took inventing calculus for

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.759
us to prove why. Which is why this paradox
that confounded great minds for thousands

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.409
of years is falsidical. Described by Quine
like this:

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.369
“A falsidical paradox packs a surprise,
but it is seen as a false alarm when we solve

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:38.309
the underlying fallacy.”

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:45.150
Okay, that's one paradox envelope downand-
two to go. And behind envelope number two

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.749
we have: Veridical.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.469
For this, we need a game show.

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:59.051
Okay I’m gonna replace the two envelopes
we’ve already opened with some prizes. How

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:09.300
about we put a million dollars in one of them
and the globglogabgalab in the other. It's

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.849
a good enough prize as any. The third envelope
still contains the term for the final type

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.369
of paradox. Which we’ll get to later.

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:22.860
Alright, I’ll shuffle these up. So you don't
know which is which. Now you’ve got three

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.270
envelopes. X, Y and Z. Pick the correct one
and you win the grand prize.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.440
After you make your selection, let’s say
envelope X, the game show host reveals what’s

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:52.029
inside one of the two remaining envelopes.
It’s the glob. Now there are only two envelopes

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:58.419
left: the one that you chose and the remaining
mystery envelope. He gives you the option

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.560
to switch your envelope. Should you do it?
Does it even matter? I mean, your odds of

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.710
winning at this point are clearly 50/50, right?

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.710
No.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.469
You should always switch. And here’s why.
The odds of winning with your first chosen

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:26.179
envelope are 1 in 3. So you have a 33.33%
&nbsp;repeating chance of being right and a 66.66%

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:30.770
repeating chance of being wrong. When the
game show host revealed the glob it didn’t

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:37.629
suddenly improve your odds to 50/50. The proof
is in the options. After first choosing an

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:43.879
envelope, the thing revealed by the host will
never be the money because well that would

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:50.020
ruin the tension of the game show. So if your
initial 1 out of 3 pick wasn’t the money

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:57.179
and the money is Y, then the host will reveal
Z. If you chose wrong and the money is Z,

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:04.220
then the host reveals Y. If you luckily chose
the money the first time, then the host can

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.709
reveal either Z or Y. It doesn't matter. No
matter what you’re still stuck in that initial

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:20.300
33% chance that you chose right the very first
time. But if you switch, regardless of the

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:30.279
prize revealed, you now leap into the 66%
zone. You’ve doubled your chances of getting

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.279
the money.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:36.429
To put it another way, when you’re asked
if you want to switch, you’re actually being

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:42.360
given a dilemma: Do you want to keep your
single envelope, or do you want both of the

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.279
other two? It just so happens that you already
know what’s inside one of them. But since

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:52.699
the one revealed will never contain the money,
the chances that the other unopened envelope

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:58.800
has the money are twice as high as the first
one that you chose.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.580
The ‘Monty Hall Problem’ blew up after
a 1990 Parade magazine columnist advocated

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.550
switching doors in this same scenario from
the game show “Let’s Make a Deal.” When

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:14.619
she told readers they should always switch
to improve their odds of winning, nearly 1,000

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:23.849
people with PhDs wrote in to tell her that
she was wrong. She wasn’t wrong. They were.

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:29.309
So the Monty Hall Paradox, like the Potato
Paradox we recently covered, is an example

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:35.580
of one that is a Veridical Paradox -- one
that initially seems wrong, but is proven

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.180
to be true.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.349
Quine said: “A veridical paradox packs a
surprise, but the surprise quickly dissipates

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:44.350
itself as we ponder the proof.”

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:50.889
Okay. There are paradoxes that seem absurd
but have a perfectly good explanation, and

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:56.360
ones that seem false and actually are false
because of an underlying fallacy… even if

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.360
it takes a major advance in math to prove
it. This last envelope contains the kind we

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.199
all think of when we all think of paradoxes.

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:07.959
Antinomy.

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:14.330
The grandfather paradox where you go back
in time to kill your grandfather when he was

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.840
a child but that means your father was never
born so you weren’t born so how could you

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.940
go back in time to kill your grandfather?
It's ridiculous. MinutePhysics proposed a

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.779
solution to this but these types of paradoxes
are not true or false. Actually, they can’t

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:40.750
be true and they can’t be false. As Quine
put it, they create a “crisis in thought.”

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:46.579
I am lying.

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:52.339
If I’m lying when I say that, then I must
actually be telling the truth. But how can

00:09:52.339 --> 00:10:00.029
I be telling the truth if I’m lying? The
Liar’s Paradox is an example of Antinomy,

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:07.090
which literally means ‘against laws’ and
highlights a serious logical incompatibility.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:27.939
Quine said. Quine said this tape thing was
a good idea in theory but in practice not

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:30.149
so much.

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:35.649
Quine said: "An antinomy packs a surprise
that can be accommodated by nothing less than

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:39.600
a repudiation of part of our conceptual heritage."

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:48.129
Here’s the thing. Antinomies are paradoxes
to us ALL. Falsidical and veridical paradoxes

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:54.589
are only paradoxes to those who don’t know
the 'solution', but they still have value.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:11:01.490
Every time we resolve a scenario that runs
counter to our or someone else's initial expectations,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:08.750
every time we learn the how and why and share
that information.... we're refining and clarifying

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:16.350
knowledge. Which makes all three types of
paradoxes excellent tools for reasoning.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.879
Whether or not something is paradoxical to
an individual depends on the accuracy of THEIR

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:28.470
expectations. Today, modern mathematics has
given us the ability to show that Zeno’s

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:35.990
paradoxes are falsidical. But they were pure
antinomy, unresolved to EVERYONE, for millennia.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.320
Quine himself said, “One man's antinomy
is another man's falsidical paradox, give

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.329
or take a couple of thousand years."

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:51.139
Who knows which antinomies of today will be
solved in the future? Right now we struggle

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:57.639
with the paradox of the Faint Young Sun: our
current knowledge of stars says that billions

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:03.480
of years ago, our sun wasn’t hot enough
to keep the Earth from being a ball of ice.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.499
But our geological evidence shows an ancient
Earth with liquid oceans and budding life

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:14.249
when everything should’ve been frozen.

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:22.990
How could the Earth have liquid water without
a sun hot enough to melt ice? It’s antinomy

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:28.779
until we fully comprehend the situation. Maybe
our current understanding of the sun isn't

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:34.399
perfect. Or maybe our knowledge of early Earth
is missing some pieces.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:40.660
A paradox is a problem where the solution
is, or is made to seem, impossible. Sometimes

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.509
they’re purposely designed for fun because
our minds like puzzles. Sometimes we just

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:51.569
stumble on a gap between what we know and
how we talk about what we know, and what is

00:12:51.569 --> 00:12:58.830
actually true. When we solve an impossible
antinomy, it becomes falsidical or veridical.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:04.509
Someone who knows the answer can see what
the problem was all along: we tricked ourselves...

00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:10.920
by knowing too little or by asking the wrong
question. In one way or another, all paradoxes

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.399
come from people.

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:19.089
By challenging us to find the flaw or fill
the gap in our knowledge, paradoxes help us

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:26.240
define and push our intellectual boundaries.
There’s always more for us to know. Whether

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.399
we know it or not.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.850
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:39.670
Hey! If you want to play the Monty Hall Game
yourself you can do that right now over at

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.509
