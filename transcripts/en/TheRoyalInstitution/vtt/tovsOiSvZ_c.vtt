00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.870
Xtreme Everest 2 is building
on our previous experiment.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.990
And what we're looking at is the
staged ascent to altitude,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.780
as the air gets thinner and
thinner, trying to understand

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.460
how humans adapt to the low
levels of oxygen that we're

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.900
experiencing at altitude.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.070
The expedition is a huge
research project and we've set

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.970
up a number of laboratories to
test volunteers at they ascend

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.020
higher and higher up the
mountain to Everest base camp,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.270
where we are here.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.550
When we were here initially, the
temperatures at night were

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.020
dropping to almost minus
30, which is quite

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.110
difficult to sleep in.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.490
And when you get up in
the morning it's

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.610
still minus 10 or so.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.280
The investigative team is very
cold, as is all the equipment.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.850
So it's a hard, hard life.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.010
Not only is it an absolutely
brutal environment, you're

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.110
pushing towards the so-called
death zone.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.240
It's very, very hard to live
there both from the oxygen

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.670
availability, and
the temperature.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.230
You're living in tents on broken
ground and moving ice.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.120
So absolute heroes of this whole
endeavour, alongside the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.270
volunteers who are being tested,
are the researchers

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.138
who lived there for
three months.

00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:22.388
This place is nuts.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.220
So where we are now, 5,300
metres above sea level, and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.380
there's approximately 50% of the
oxygen in the atmosphere

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.970
that you're breathing, than
we will find at sea level.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.661
We will work in places where
patients are short of oxygen

00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:44.829
for diseases of the lungs or
hearts, or other parts of the

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.180
body mean there's less oxygen
available for the organs.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.780
And some people couple with that
and some people don't.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.910
If we look at a group of, let's
say, 100 people admitted

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.360
with a pneumonia, you treat them
in exactly the same way

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.320
and about 25% shake it
off straightaway

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.870
within a week or so.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.710
There's about 50% that we need
to bring into hospital and it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.009
takes them a month or
so to get better.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.370
Just another 25% that crash
and burn within a week.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.560
And they die as a result of
exactly the same pneumonia.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.470
Now, a fundamental difference
between those is how quickly

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.220
they can adapt to the
lack of oxygen.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.420
And that's exactly the same sort
of thing we see up here.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.700
25% don't notice it, 50% find
it difficult, 25% find it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.900
really hard.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680
We have very strong evidence now
to say they're exactly the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.000
same mechanisms.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.910
And if we can understand that,
we can come up with different

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.010
treatments, and possibly even
different drugs that will move

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.530
everyone into that rapid
adapting group, and therefore

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.480
increase survival.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.110
One of the striking things is
how tolerant the Sherpa people

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.430
are of the low levels
of oxygen.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.850
You look at them, they don't
look like incredibly

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.690
physically fit athletes.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.340
But when you see their
performance--

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.650
their ability to carry high
loads, their ability to work

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.460
when we're suffering, even
when we're acclimatised--

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.150
it makes you ask the question,
why are they so different?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.480
Now, there's been numerous
experiments in the past on

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.530
Sherpas, and classical
physiology tells us that they

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.850
are no different.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.100
But now we have questions that
couldn't be asked before.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.720
It's something going on at a
cellular level, right down in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.590
the tissues, in the muscles.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.030
And within there it's the fuel
cells, they're called the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.710
mitochondria, where the
oxygen is used.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.000
And that's what we're
exploring in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360
great detail this time.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.340
The three important things that
we're looking at are the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.390
micro circulation, the
mitochondria, and nitric

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.120
oxide, which may control those
two, are very relevant to the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.280
kind of things that we see in
our intensive care patients.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.690
And it may be that we need to
shift the way in which we

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.550
treat intensive care patients
based on what we find here.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.640
One of the big parts of Xtreme
Everest 2 is looking at

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.290
nitrates, which are little
chemicals that are released

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.770
into your bloodstream and help
to change how big or how small

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.170
your blood vessels are.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.240
So we think if your cells are
low on oxygen, then your body

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.075
might be releasing more of these
nitrate chemicals in

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:08.640
order to deliver more oxygen.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.430
It's a bit like if you've got
a traffic jam on a road and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.090
you get the builders in to
build more lanes so more

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.829
people can travel at
the same time.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.089
So nitrates are a bit like
the builders, perhaps.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.510
We believe that we're right
on the cusp of making a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.680
fundamental discovery that will
have a major impact on

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.280
our patients back at home.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.670
The science of it is just
so interesting.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.290
And to be able to come here and
not just do science, but

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.710
see this is amazing.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.090
The amount of data that we will
be able to take home from

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.920
this, and analyse, and hopefully
change the way that

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.230
people think about low levels
of oxygen in critically ill

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.580
patients, if we can change that,
then it will definitely

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.278
have been worth coming up here
time and time again.
