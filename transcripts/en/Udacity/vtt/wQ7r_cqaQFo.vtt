00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.750
Let's do one more exercise on the same problem. Note that,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.700
I have added one more rule into the procedural knowledge. This is

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.565
the rule that was the result of chunking. If two operators are suggested, and

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.535
throw-fast-ball operator suggested, and the batter is Parra.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:23.070
Then dismiss the throw-fast-ball operator. Okay, given these rules and the same

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
situation, what do you think will be the operator that will be selected?
