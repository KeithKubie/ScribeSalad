00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.320
So you can keep the ways to deal
with shoddy connectivity for free.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.660
It doesn't cover every situation though.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.630
For example,
you're probably very judicious about

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.820
cleaning up listeners
in Shopping Lists++.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.190
This means that when a user
navigates away from a screen,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.740
the listener is probably cleaned up.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.710
This is great for
memory performance, but

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.140
it also flushes our local cache of data.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.050
So say you're online and it shows
you your lists, then you go offline.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.832
Changes you do on that
screen are saved locally

00:00:37.832 --> 00:00:41.536
while you're looking at the data.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:44.219
But when you navigate away
from an activity in them back,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:50.710
It actually won't display the data
because we destroyed the listener.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.975
The solution though is not to remove
our clean-up code for listeners.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:59.708
Instead, there are two other options
that you should be aware of to leverage

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.823
what is saved in
the local Firebase cache.

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:07.031
They are setPersistenceEnabled,
and keepSynced.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:09.940
setPersistenceEnable keeps

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.460
any data you download from the database
around in the local cache.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.580
This would solve the problem I mentioned
before with cleaning up listeners.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.685
It also saves data between
restarts of the app.

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.877
Let's say you're shopping for
a very, very long time.

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:25.515
You've been recording all these
purchases you're making and

00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:29.802
then your phone runs out of battery and
shuts off, closing the app.

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:32.362
If you didn't use setPersistenceEnabled,

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:35.764
any data that wasn't sent to
the server isn't saved for free.

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:37.902
Since setPersistenceEnabled is so

00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:40.590
useful, you might be wondering
when you shouldn't use it.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.970
There are two downsides to using
separate setPersistenceEnabled.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.460
It does use more disk space
to store your data locally.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.831
Another downside is that if you
were offline and used lots of

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:55.600
addListenersForSingleValueEvent, it
will query the local storage if offline.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.060
If you then come online,
it will not query the database again.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.230
This makes it possible to show
old data to your user and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.878
can create tricky bugs to find.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:07.540
If you want to cache additional
parts of the database

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.990
that you don't have listeners for, the
method keepsSynced is available to you.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.725
For example consider this.

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.170
You're a user and you load up
your list of shopping lists but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.010
you haven't clicked on any
specific shopping list.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.326
Imagine you go offline.

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.770
And then select one of these lists.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.000
What will you see?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.750
You'll see a shopping
list with no items.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.230
You never had a listener for
these items.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.822
So the local cache will
not of save these items.

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:43.710
Using keepSynced though, you could
explicitly say listen to this data, and

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.480
it will keep the data sync locally.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.185
Then, if a user clicks on a shopping
list, even when you're offline,

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:52.910
you'd see the items when you open up the
activity and the state of those items

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.450
would match what they looked like
the instant the app went offline.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.890
Again, the downside of using keepSynced
is the amount of data you store locally.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.110
Even though these methods use a little
extra memory, they are important to know

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.400
about so you can keep the most important
screens of your app working seamlessly

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.710
for users, even in flakey
connectivity or offline situations.
