Thank you.

This is a guitar I stole
from my father.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.200
And it's been on tour for about
three months now, and he

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.565
is going to kill me.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.620
In time.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.770
It's retiring at Christmas.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:23.196
Thank you for having me and for
being so well-behaved and

00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:27.440
for having a kitchen
that I could raid.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.390
I've been on tour for about
three months straight, and I

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.289
was really glad that your
cupboard was a little more

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.470
stocked than mine.

This next song is a song that
I wrote called "Spring," and

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.060
it's about--

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.220
I don't know.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.200
Good songs are about more than
one thing, but you sort of fly

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.140
a flag and say it's
about one thing.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.750

I feel like I should tell you
funny stories about things

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.240
I've googled in my life.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.080
But maybe we should get to
know each other a little

better first.

00:19:24.518 --> 00:19:26.450
TIFT MERRITT: In this
next song, I was--

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.730
I guess on this whole record I
was thinking about how much

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:35.000
noise there is and what of it
is actually important, and

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.576
what of it is actually
just noise.

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:45.150
And somehow I got to thinking
about how Jesus and Robert

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.910
Johnson probably were in the
exact same position when they

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.430
were about to make these big
decisions in their life like,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.030
I need to get born, or, I need
to sell my soul to the devil

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.620
so I can play guitar.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.510
They probably felt very
similarly crazy and very

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.130
similarly hopeful
that they were

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.810
making the right decision.

TIFT MERRITT: Let's see.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.140
When people are so
quiet, I'm so

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.260
compelled to tell you things.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.370
I guess I should tell you that
when I was writing this

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.550
record, I lived fairly
close to here.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.660
I'm originally from North
Carolina, and I moved to the

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.370
City a number of years ago--
not so long ago, but--

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.600
I live very close to the
City Winery, and--

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.400
I love this story.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.690
I think it's such in
New York story.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.150
One night I was there to see
some friends play, and-- or, I

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.230
don't know, I was there
doing something.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.840
And I told them that they had
this beautiful grand piano

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.510
that I-- there's nothing--

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.780
there's very little in the world
I love as much as having

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.390
an instrument in my
hands, especially

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.240
playing a beautiful piano.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.170
And I said, well--

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.040
they said, well, if you love
playing our piano so much, you

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.290
can come down and play
it any time you like.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.445
And I said, you ought
to be really careful

00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:46.950
saying that to me.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.970
And they said, no, no, no,
really, we mean it.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.540
And I said, no, not,
really, I mean it.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:25:00.740
And so being a writer, being a
musician, I think you spend so

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.770
much of your time in the
landscape inside--

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.480
traveling alone--

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.390
and I was able--

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.960
going to the City Winery every
morning when I woke up to get

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.810
my cup of coffee, I would go--

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.790
and I was really a part
of their staff.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.000
They would be getting the coffee
cups and the table

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.050
settings ready, and the wine
was being made, and things

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.910
were getting chopped
in the kitchen, and

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.140
I got to know everybody.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.870
And I never felt so open.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.590
I think writing is a very
personal-- it's the most

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.170
personal thing I
can do, really.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.300
And they made me feel so
comfortable, I just was in the

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.710
corner, and my hair in a big
mess, and practically in my

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.750
pajamas, and I would play this
piano and get lost, but I

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.760
would have this beautiful
quotidian life

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.290
with everyone there.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.200

How are you doing

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.630
Are you well?

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.920
And I would play for about an
hour, an hour and a half, and

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.200
then when they opened the doors
for lunch, I would kind

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.690
of walk home with whatever I had
been drifting on at that

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.570
piano in my hand, and
then I would write.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.640
And this, in particular, was a
song that was born on that

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.570
piano, right here in
this neighborhood.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.260

play it for you.

TIFT MERRITT: Yeah, I've been
out for a long time.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.760
I'm at the point where I'm
really lonely if I'm not in a

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.470

clean clothes are

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.250
totally foreign idea.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.610
I've been on the road since
about the beginning of

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:20.045
September, and I've been
out with my band.

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:24.290
We were all around the US, and
then we were in the UK, and

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.730
then we went to Europe, and I
just got home on Friday night.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.725

is, and I haven't

00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:34.320
cooked in three months.

I don't know if you're
familiar with him.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.680
And he's an incredible player,
but he's also such an

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.430
incredible singer.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.840
He's really one of my favorite,
favorite people.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.040
And I don't say that lightly.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.050
You know, you sing with people,
you sing with a lot of

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.790
different people, and when
something really rings, you

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.630
go, oh, oof, wow.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.610

guys know each other

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380
back in North Carolina?

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.700
Like, were there any connections
back then, or--

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.570
TIFT MERRITT: Not really.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.560
I mean, I think we crossed
paths, and I knew he was with

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.310
the Squirrel Nut Zippers.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:27.420
And I think I was probably
shy, and--

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.030
so we met maybe two years ago.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.910
We did the Cabinet of Wonders
together, and we sang

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.330
together, and I think
we both went, oh.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:40.000
And then he was kind enough to
sing on this record, too.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.790
I wrestled him into coming
and doing a duet

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.890
with me on this record.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.230
RITA HOUSTON: Which is
beautiful, the song "Drifting

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.920
Apart," which is really nice.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:53.120
Tift, so this new album is
called "Traveling Alone." And

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.970
as the title suggests, and as
many of the songs that we

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.890
heard, there is a spirit, I
think, for a lot of writers of

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.540
traveling and gaining
perspective when you leave

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.570
where you're from, and then
you can look back.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.150
As a writer, is that a big
part, for you, of where

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.240
perspective and inspiration
comes from?

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.920
Because you almost have to leave
your world to be more of

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.590
an observer of it and
write about it.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.850
TIFT MERRITT: I think that's
true, and in fact--

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.760
my nose is itching, so that
means that my mother can hear

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.030
whatever I say about this.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.550
But I think that works
on two levels.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:31.740
I'm from North Carolina, and
North Carolina was a very,

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.930
very particular place in time
when I was growing up.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.010
I mean, it was very different
from any other

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:39.620
place in the world.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.960
It was sort of before everyone
had a cell phone, and there

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.230
weren't any chain stores, and
you knew everyone, and

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.040
everyone knew your parents, and
everyone knew everything

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.140
wrong that you ever did.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:59.940
And I like that kind
of closeness.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.520
But I also was always
encouraged to leave.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.770
I wasn't chained to a tree
in this small town.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:09.139
And I think that's why I can
feel so fondly about it.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.730
You know, you are encouraged
to leave your home

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.600
to find your home.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.170
But on another level, I think
that "Traveling Alone" really

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:23.315
is a way to talk about the
landscape inside, to talk

00:34:23.315 --> 00:34:26.340
about an interior life,
and a home inside.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.470
And I'm not--

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.710
obviously, I'm a performer and
a loud mouth, and I'm not an

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.250
introvert--

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:39.909
but I spend a huge amount of my
life in this landscape on

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:40.570
the inside.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.790
And I think that you can kind
of sound like a jerk unless

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.300
you give it a sort of
rough-hewn way--

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.800
find a way to talk about
it that is real world.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.110
And that's what I wanted
to do on this record.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.659
RITA HOUSTON: Do you hear things
from fans that are

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.750
meaningful to you?

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.440
Because when you write songs
of such personal nature, I

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.560
think people have a way of
internalizing them, and

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.440
putting their own stuff.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.160
You must hear all kinds of
things from fans who like,

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.510
relate to your music.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.970
Anything you could share?

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:09.750
TIFT MERRITT: I'm
trying to think.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:16.020
You know, I think the nicest
thing is when people come and

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.040
tell you that your music has
meant something to them.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.250
And must oftentimes they'll
say, well, it helped me

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.330
through a hard time.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:32.352
And I don't know, I'm just
grateful for that.

00:35:32.352 --> 00:35:37.050
I think that making work and
being a musician should really

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.250
be the reward in
and of itself.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.840
I mean you can't--

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.530
it's not about being
a celebrity.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.690
It's not about numbers.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.855
It's not about making
a lot of money.

00:35:45.855 --> 00:35:48.770
It's about making something
of meaning and beauty.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.150
And when that resonates with
someone else, you're just

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.900
grateful that your work actually
means something to

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.530
someone beyond yourself.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.600
RITA HOUSTON: But you're
really speaking

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.830
like a writer now.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.340
I mean, that's really--

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.690
TIFT MERRITT: Well, I think
that I am a writer first.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.210
I was a really crappy musician
for a long time.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.520
Now I've just been at
it long enough that

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.400
I know how to listen.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:12.830
.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.430
RITA HOUSTON: If you guys one
start to queue up with some of

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.730
your own questions, we'll
definitely take some.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.410
Don't be shy.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.420
There are two mics.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.870
So do that.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.120
Here's a question for you.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.650
Do you have to be a great
writer to be a great

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.860
songwriter?

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.280
Or, the reverse, do great
songwriters always make for

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:30.870
great writers?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.415
Because you studied creative
writing and stuff.

00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:36.560
So you have both of
those things.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.160
Do you have to be a great
writer to be a great

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.680
songwriter?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.230
TIFT MERRITT: No.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.150
I think you have to be
honest, and I think

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.470
you have to get lucky.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.125
And I think that those are
the two things that

00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:49.050
I can't find myself.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:53.220
But I also think that--

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.630
I think that creativity is one
of those things where, when

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.760
you start--

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.890
before your work is invented,
when you're trying to invent

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.430
this thing that isn't
invented--

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.900
you can go so many different
mediums.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.500
So when I was starting, I really
wanted to be a writer.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.610
I wanted to write books.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.230
I wanted to say heavy, serious
things about life.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:19.840
And I could have gone in that
direction, but I would have

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.350
needed to commit
to that medium.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:29.410
And instead, I committed to this
shorter form, which is--

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.150
a good song is about
three sentences.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.270
Four if you have a bridge.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:41.080
And now, I've spent the past 15
years of my life trying to

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.540
say something in
four sentences.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.800
And when I go back and I try
to write prose, I feel very

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.550
watered down.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.770
I go, this is moving
way too slow.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.900
Get to the point.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.990
And so I think the deeper
you can commit to

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.470
your medium, the better.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.540
RITA HOUSTON: And for you it's
about paring it down.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.840
TIFT MERRITT: I like
the intensity of--

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.570
I like the one-two punch.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.990
And I don't think there's
any going back.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.640
You get used to that.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.090
RITA HOUSTON: It's like
cooking, you know?

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.480
You've got to reduce
the sauce.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.050
TIFT MERRITT: That's right.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.990
Cook down those bones.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.370
RITA HOUSTON: Exactly.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.240
Tift, I read--

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.330
when I googled you
last night--

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.730
I read that your dad's record
collection was a big

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.170
inspiration to you.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.930
And I'd love to hear some
stuff about that.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.160
Because in the performance
today, there was one song that

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.350
just felt like a straight-up
kind of country tune.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.620
And I know your record, so I
know a lot of the songs are

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.330
fleshed out with pedal
steel, and stuff.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.750
But then when you play the tune
at the piano, that was a

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.090
straight-up soul, R&amp;B
kind of number.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.450
You could almost hear the horns
and the minor chords.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.590
So I imagine--

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.220
I don't know your dad, I don't
know his record collection--

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:56.510
but I imagine this visual
of country albums right

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:59.100
alongside, like, Otis Redding.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.270
So tell us a little
bit about that.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.470
TIFT MERRITT: OK.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.140
The first thing is that
my dad really

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.500
wanted to be a musician.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.610
And somehow, I talk about him
enough that he thinks he's

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:10.860
super famous.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:18.470
And so I call him and I go,
hey Dad, in Sweden today,

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.140
somebody yelled out that
they know they

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.060
you like to go fishing.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.290
And he's like, oh,
that's great.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.140
RITA HOUSTON: What fishing?

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.960
TIFT MERRITT: He just like--

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.360
fishing.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.420
He likes to fish.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.820
So now I'm going to have to call
him, and be like, I was

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.300
at Google today, and I talked
about you, Dad.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.510
Oh, he's going to so glad.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.880
So anyway, my dad taught
me how to play music.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.590
And my dad is really why I
consider myself a folk

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.100
musician, because he played
everything by ear.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.640
He played guitar by ear, he
played piano by ear in this

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.160
very simple, simple,
simple way.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.100
And he definitely thought
he was a genius at it.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.540
And it turns out
he kind of was.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.090
And he had--

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.490
I can remember being
a child and sitting

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.290
with him on a Saturday.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.540
And he would play Bob Dylan
songs, and play his harmonica,

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.440
and finger-pick.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.350
And then he'd play Percy Sledge
songs on the piano, and

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.020
then we'd drive around
in the car and sing

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.600
Dolly Parton songs.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.900
And in a lot of ways, I think
part of why I play music is

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.350
because I felt so close to
my father in those times.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.850
Playing music with someone
is such an expression

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.580
of the best of life.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:37.390
So my father really gravitated
towards a good song, and he

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.720
didn't really think about
it beyond that at all.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.130
And I have to say that it's
really hard for me to think

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.840
about that at all beyond
that, too.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.380
So--

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.040
RITA HOUSTON: So who are some
of the greats that you hold

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.350
high in the music world, and
then we'll ask you the same

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.540
for writers and stuff.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.480
Who are the guys who wrote
the blueprints for you?

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.410
TIFT MERRITT: Well, Dylan.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:59.660
I mean, what an innovator.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:09.010
And I think Dylan, and
I think Neil Young--

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:13.840
Dylan for his writing,
intelligence, and the power,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.710
and Joni Mitchell for how
expressive she is, and how

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:23.550
personal she is, and what
unique musical she has.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.640
I think Carole King as a writer,
and someone who's

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.960
earthy and unselfish,
and generous.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.530
I think she's a real
role model.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:35.180
Neil Young, I think,
for just the not

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.350
intellectual side of it.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:37.230
Not that he's not intellectual,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.442
but it's all heart.

00:41:40.442 --> 00:41:43.480
I think that if you're
songwriter it's really hard

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.490
not to go worship
at those places.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.700
And there's a lot
of the country--

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.670
I mean, people say, oh, you're
a country singer.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:56.690
And I go, I'm not mainstream
country.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.850
But I will say that a lot of
those leading ladies-- like

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.500
Kitty Wells, and Emmylou Harris,
and Bobbie Gentry, and

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.720
Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn--

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.610
I think they held themselves
with a great deal of dignity.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.620
And there was a sense of
abandon, and a sense of music,

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.160
and a sense of show,
but there's

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.770
also a sense of meaning.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.370
And when I looked at the music
industry and tried to see

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:26.650
myself, and there's like Madonna
and Bob Dylan, if that

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.660
were the spectrum, where
would I fit?

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.020
And I thought, these women
held themselves with a

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.520
sincerity and a dignity that
I could relate to.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.055
So--

00:42:36.055 --> 00:42:37.390
RITA HOUSTON: That's
interesting.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:38.060
We have a question.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:38.335
Go ahead.

00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:39.750
Give him the mic.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:40.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.430
First of all, I have two
questions, if that's OK.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.320
Great performance.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.310
Loved watching you.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.290
TIFT MERRITT: Thank you.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.185
AUDIENCE: I'm going to ask the
questions and then you can

00:42:48.185 --> 00:42:49.770
answer them both.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.090
Are you a keyboard player that
learned to play the guitar, or

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:53.890
vice versa?

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.080
That's the first question.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.760
And the second question is, how
strong is your emotional

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.780
attachment to that guitar with
the two holes at the bottom of

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.570
the bridge.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.060
TIFT MERRITT: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:10.620
Well, the first thing is
that I am probably a

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.590
piano player first.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.710
I took some lessons when I was
really little, but then my dad

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.550
showed me, and I got to the
point where you had to write

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:24.130
down how long you practiced
every day, and I had the moral

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.430
conundrum of lying or admitting
that I was not

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.710
practicing.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.330
And so I stopped taking
piano lessons.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:39.210
So I'm not trained like that,
but I find that I play the

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.060
piano like a melody
instruments.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.390
I can find melody.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.430
I can get lost in a piano for
hours and hours and hours.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:53.480
I started playing guitar when
I was a teenager, and so it

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.910
wasn't like one really led the
way, but I'm probably more at

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.250
home at the piano.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.490
Although I have really come to
pride myself on being a good

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.920
rhythm guitar player.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.800
I consider myself part of
the rhythm section.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.270
And I am endlessly fascinated
with how locked I can get with

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.940
the groove and how deep I can
get that pocket to go.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.590
At first I was really ashamed
that I couldn't solo, and now

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.660
I think that it's pretty
important to be

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.910
a good rhythm player.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.070
This is my guitar, Little Red,
and I'm really attached to it.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.030
Somebody gave it to me-- or
sold it to me when I first

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.880
started putting out records,
because they told me that I

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.315
had this big oversized guitar
from the '70s, and they said

00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:44.520
it made me look really short.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.370
So I really was upset about this
guitar, because it was a

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:50.860
short joke to begin with.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.200
But this guitar has been on the
road with me for 10 years,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.230
and it's kind of a work horse.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:05.550
And I play '60s Gibsons because
they have this great

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:10.370
warmth, sound that's great for
strumming, but they also have

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.480
really a small head stocks,
so that I-- my

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.260
hands are really small.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.970
This other guitar is actually
my father's guitar that I

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.300
stole from him for this tour.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.010
And he's going to kill me
because I've marked it up.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.850
But he says that he won
it in a pool game.

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.970
I don't believe him.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.840
So that one is actually--

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.540
I'm even more attached to that,
because he will kill me

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.865
if anything happens to it.

00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:34.350
So, yeah.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.620
Is that good?

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.211
Yeah, OK.

00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:37.270
Hi.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.660
AUDIENCE: Actually, I wanted to
jump on what you said about

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.550
being a rhythm player.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.910
I'm actually a singer-songwriter
myself, and

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.340
I've been having some trouble
with rhythm, and I was just

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.630
wondering how you got
to be so good at it.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.030
TIFT MERRITT: Well, first of
all, it took a lot of years,

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.630
and I'm married to drummer.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:46:06.570
And I think that things like
playing two records that you

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.570
love, like Carter family
records, where the rhythm

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.180
playing is really, really,
really important, playing to

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.490
the old country records where
the rhythm playing is really a

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.170
part of the band.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.570
And also, practicing
with a metronome.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:30.340
I mean, I have to say that
practicing is so much a part--

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.070
people think that rock and roll
is just, there are no

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.410
rules, and you drink
some whiskey and it

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.090
comes out of you.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.050
But being a good musician is--

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.890
there's a lifetime
of study there.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:46.890
And I think that practice and
listening, learning how to

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.690
listen, I feel like I just--

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.260
every day I get up and go,
god, I didn't even know I

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.420
could listen that hard.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.930
And I think listening is
kind of a Zen thing.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:01.030
You just have to practice and
listen, and know that it adds

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.320
up to something over time.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.484
Does that make sense?

00:47:06.484 --> 00:47:08.430
Sure.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.840
AUDIENCE: Rita, you started--

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.470
you asked about musical
and literary things.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.810
You didn't quite get
to the literary.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:18.060
And as much as having been to
the FUV Holiday Cheer concert,

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.290
and having heard Steve Earl, who
has managed to write and

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.770
play music, I was wondering if
you could list some of your

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.490
literary aspirations.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.520
Because when you talk about
home, I find myself thinking

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.150
of Frost and the idea of, home
is the place where, when you

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.800
go there, they have
to take you in.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.390
And of course, Wolfe saying,
you can't go home again.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.330
And whether--

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.650
if you could list that,
I'd be very intrigued.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.600
TIFT MERRITT: My literary
aspirations, or my influences?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:41.930
AUDIENCE: Influences.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.160
If you'd like to go into
your aspirations,

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:43.300
I would very much--

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.870
TIFT MERRITT: No, I was
about to say, I don't

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.240
think I have any.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.690
Except to be a good
songwriter.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:48.490
AUDIENCE: Well, your
musical gifts more

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.320
than make up for that.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.200
TIFT MERRITT: Well,
I appreciate that.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.890
My literary aspirations are
to be a good reader.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.980
In the beginning,
my main literary

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.790
influence was Eudora Welty.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.350
I think she's such a master
of the short form.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:11.340
And she has such a point
of view, and

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.470
such a sense of voice.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.800
And there were other reasons
that I loved

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.830
Eudora Welty, too.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:24.180
One was that she such a
unique artist and an

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.260
innovator as a woman.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.370
She traveled by herself, she
never married, she was a

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:34.360
photographer, she didn't-- she
broke a lot of rules, but she

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.460
broke them in a lovely way.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:43.530
And I really loved how
multifaceted she was.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:46.790
I also loved that she was from
this small southern town, and

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:50.670
she always lived there, and she
always looked out this one

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.140
window, and she didn't need
to leave completely.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.530
I'm sure she had journeys, but
I think that that's such a

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.960
beautiful way to make art.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.350
To me, that meant that she
always found so much in

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:08.160
humanity that she didn't have
to make up false dramas, and

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.120
she didn't have to have this
crazy life, that she could

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.570
come to that window every day
and find something of depth to

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.230
write about.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.010
And I thought that was
really beautiful.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.990
I'm a huge Cormac
McCarthy fan.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.320
I think his work is so
beautiful, if sometimes so

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.600
violent that I have
to turn the page.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.340
And Faulkner as well.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.620
I've spent the past year really
fascinated by this

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.870
poet, Jack Gilbert, who actually
just passed away, and

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.870
who was something of a character
in his life.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:48.340
And I also really, really love
Annie Dillard's nonfiction and

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.880
her writing about life
and nature and the

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.090
nature of being a writer.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.520
The intensity there is really,
really, really beautiful.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.970
So I'd say those are those
are my staples.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:04.540
AUDIENCE: I heard-- when at
college, Eudora Welty came--

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.340
I'm a Vassar boy.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.650
Eudora Welty came there, and she
read "A Wide Net." It was

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.940
just a lovely performance.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.170
You know, just there, just very
calm, just-- the story

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.370
spoke for itself.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.770
She just--

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:18.140
that was all she really
needed to do.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.220
TIFT MERRITT: She seemed
like she was a

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.815
really amazing woman.

00:50:20.815 --> 00:50:21.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:22.640
RITA HOUSTON: It's interesing
you mention the photography,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.000
because you're a photographer
too, right?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.170
TIFT MERRITT: Hmmmm.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:25.510
RITA HOUSTON: You dabble.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:26.470
TIFT MERRITT: Strong words.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.920
I dabble.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.880
RITA HOUSTON: You dabble.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.570
You have a camera.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.170
TIFT MERRITT: I'm really--
you know, I think--

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.980
RITA HOUSTON: You're more
than a dabbler.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.650
TIFT MERRITT: Wait, hold on.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:37.280
I feel like we live in this time
where we're all supposed

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.460
to be superhuman people.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.120
Where we're supposed to be
perfect parents, and perfectly

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.500
dressed, and perfect
overachievers, and eat

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.250
perfectly, and be perfectly
skinny, and all that crap, and

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:52.190
I feel like there's this impulse
to for artists to

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.720
conquer other mediums.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.910
And I don't feel that--

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:00.050
I think creativity doesn't fit
in a neat package, and

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.660
everything that I do creatively
points back to

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.720
being a musician and
being a songwriter.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.110
So I'm not out to conquer
any other mediums.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:07.910
I think that's important.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.600
I like to just be myself.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.320
I'm not a superhuman.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.210
But I love to take photographs,
because I think

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:22.310
that, first of all, using your
eyes to see other people is

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:26.330
such an important part of being
a compassionate writer.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:29.230
And you need to look outside of
yourself, and you need to

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.700
make yourself look outside
yourself, and find the beauty

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.880
and joy in these small things
that you see when you take the

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.120
time to really look
at other people.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.190
And a camera is a really
beautiful way to do that.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.890
And I also think that--

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:49.850
I'm so skeptical of how nice I'm
treated in situations like

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:52.800
this, and this sort of being
the center of attention.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.450
And I think it's my job as a
writer to keep turning my

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.500
attention back.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.620
And I think it's really
important to not rest on your

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.430
laurels and be the center
of attention.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:10.220
RITA HOUSTON: You seem to have
this sort of core humility to

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.760
everything that you approach.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.900
TIFT MERRITT: I'm a Southern
Protestant.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.150
I do not exist.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:22.080
RITA HOUSTON: But that is
a core kind of thing.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.820
At the end of January, January
26th, I just heard about the

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.010
show you're going to be
doing at 92YTribeca.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.240
Tell us about that, because
it's a pretty cool

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.640
collaborative kind of thing.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.310
TIFT MERRITT: Yeah.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:33.560
It's--

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.760
it stems from this--

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.740
I do a radio show for Marfa,
Texas Public Radio, which I'm

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.750
really behind on right now
because I've been on tour.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.760
But I seek out artists, and I
talk to one artist a month

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.870
about how they really make
their work, and how they

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:55.760
really live their lives.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.980
And usually these people who are
making really unique work

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.940
are making really unique
lives, too.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.630
And people who are doing their
own thing, I think, come

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.680
across the same problems, but
they are so off doing their

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.140
own thing that they don't--

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.470
it feels more personal.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.360
They forget that this is
a common situation.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.710
So I ended up inviting this
painter, Anna Schuleit, to

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.500
come on my show.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.850
And she was so beautiful.

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.480
And we were the same
age, and--

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.010
I don't know, I just felt like
I just met at a much better

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.170
version of myself.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.260
Much more evolved.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.340
And we--

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.280
RITA HOUSTON: And is
she from Texas?

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.570
TIFT MERRITT: No, she's here.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.980
She's actually from Germany.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.880
She lives here.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.300
And we had so much in common
that we became friends, and I

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.180
adore her work.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.080
And so, we were trying to find
a way to collaborate, and she

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.730
does these beautiful live
drawings with a

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:51.440
projector and light.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.360
And she's done it with dance
performances before, and we

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.320
thought performing "Traveling
Alone" with her creating a

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.580
life drawing--

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.070
"live drawing" is what
she calls it--

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:04.840
would be a really
beautiful thing.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.680
So I've never done anything
like that, but I think it

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.080
could be really, really
beautiful, emotional.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.170
And she's a very beautiful
artist.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.490
RITA HOUSTON: And tell
us her name again.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.310
TIFT MERRITT: Anna Schuleit.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.190
RITA HOUSTON: And that's January
26 at 92YTribeca.

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.640
That sounds very cool.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.500
Any other questions?

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.670
Well, thank you, guys,
and thank you, Tift.

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:27.140
TIFT MERRITT: Thank you, Rita.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.750
RITA HOUSTON: I mean,
beyond fun.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.150
Very fun, thank you.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.400
TIFT MERRITT: Thank you guys.
