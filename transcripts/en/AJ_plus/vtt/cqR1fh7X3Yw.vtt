00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.160
Add the cinnamon sticks,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.880
black peppercorn,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.840
green cardamom,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.740
cloves,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.900
butter.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.640
Put in onions, cook the onions down.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.200
That’s Moiz Subedar, head chef and co-owner of Mela Tandoori Kitchen

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.160
in the heart of San Francisco's Civic Center district.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.500
And he's making every South Asian restaurant staple:

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.400
Real aficionados don’t even call it “chicken tikka masala”

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.900
- to them, it's

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.480
And that's true from the British Isles
to the California coast.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.940
Our number-one selling item – by far, hands down – is chicken tikka masala.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.280
Hey guys, I’m Sana,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.600
and today we’re exploring the origins

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.720
of chicken tikka masala, its popularity –

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.060
and why the future of curry houses across the United Kingdom, in particular, is under threat.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.000
OK, so the first thing you need to know about CTM

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.840
is that there's a lot of people who say it's not from South Asia.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440
It’s actually British. Wuuuuuut?!?!?!?!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.240
Ok, kind of.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.480
Chicken tikka masala's origins are often
traced back to Glasgow, Scotland where a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.870
number of restaurants claim to have been
the first to cook the dish starting in

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.700
’50s, ’60s, and ’70s.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.550
These stories often center around one particular Bengali

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.690
immigrant and a restaurateur by the name
of Ali Ahmad Aslam, who ran the Shish

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.800
Mahal restaurant that still stands today.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.520
Reports from the time say that a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.310
customer at Shish Mahal sent back their
chicken dish claiming it was too dry or

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.660
bland, and when it was returned to the
chef he added a marinade consisting of a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.520
can of tomato soup, yogurt, and a mixture
of spices, or masala.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.660
Except that might actually not be that accurate, either.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.840
According to Sean Kerry, a researcher who

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.580
studied curry houses in the UK,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.960
CTM's origins are actually a lot more complicated.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.470
Some people claim its
origins lie at the Moti Mahal restaurant

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.590
in Delhi. Others say Glasgow, and others
say a Bangladeshi chef invented it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.320
somewhere in the UK.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.390
I think like all these questions it's very difficult to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.670
know the historical truth. But, what I
would say is that it's entirely possible

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.100
that it was simultaneously invented in
different parts of the world.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.320
Whatever the true story behind chicken tikka masala is, it took off, becoming a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.080
signature dish for South Asian
restaurants across the U.K. and the U.S.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.680
The curry industry, we have over 12,000 curry houses.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.980
And the curry house itself contributes

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.780
$4.2 billion to the British economy every year.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.840
So it's very popular.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.700
So when chicken tikka masala
become number one it means that the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.920
national dish is not fish and chips anymore.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.720
In the early ’80s, CTM was so popular in the U.K. that it was being sold,

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.040
pre-packaged, at the popular Waitrose
supermarkets.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.840
By 2001, the U.K.'s foreign secretary Robin Cook

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.360
hailed chicken tikka masala as a truly British dish and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.720
invention, with the chicken tikka
being "Indian" and the masala being

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.280
"British" - because the British desired a
gravy to be served with their meats

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.160
Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.200
It is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.670
And by 2009, Brits
were consuming 2.5 billion pounds of CTM

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.380
per year, with approximately 65,000
people employed all around the U.K.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.560
in restaurants also known as curry houses.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.800
The new migrants that come in very often

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.350
are looking to eat the kinds of foods
that they recognize from home. So if you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.350
look at supermarkets and that kind of
thing those reflect very often those

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.180
kind of new tastes. And the food market
is a relatively easy one for new groups

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.360
to enter into.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.960
But none of this would have been possible without the migration

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.300
of South Asians to the U.K. to begin with.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.280
And that's a story in and of itself.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.800
And it starts with … you guessed it: colonialism.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.400
The British landed on the Indian subcontinent beginning in the late 1600s

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.641
as merchants, establishing trading posts across a number of cities

00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.320
under what became known as the East India Company.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.560
By the mid 1700s much of
India had come under the control of the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.380
company and a century later India had
become a British colony.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.211
One notable immigrant to the U.K. from South Asia was Sake Dean Mahomed,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.720
who after becoming a captain with the East India Company moved to London.

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:13.300
There he established the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.140
first Indian restaurant in the U.K. known
as the Hindoostane Coffee House.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.100
Sailors, so-called lascars from Bengal,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.300
who were living in boarding houses and, of course,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.110
those boarding houses the men would have been supplied with food and out of that

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.580
supply of food started small waterfront
cafes.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.770
And that's really the origins of

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.860
the present-day Indian curry trade.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.080
Fast-forward to the 1950s and '60s when

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.070
immigration laws were eased, during that
time the UK saw significant increase in

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.660
the number of South Asian immigrants.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.240
And this changes a lot.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.180
Mass migration really happens after 1947,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.960
where you start to
get smallish numbers, through the '50s

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.380
of migrants coming for work because the
UK was looking for a kind of labor to

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.800
staff the shortages.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.360
And then particularly for South Asians through

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.360
the '50s and 1960s. And then in larger
numbers through the 1970s and 1980s when

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.940
you get family reunification,
particularly from Pakistan and

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.780
Bangladesh. So that's when you start to
get the formation of larger settled

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.920
communities across the UK, always linked
to kind of areas of work.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.660
Today, the South Asian community in the U.K. is approximately 5% of the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.920
population, with visible communities in
all major cities including

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.840
which is home to the famous curry mile.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.620
There's also the famous
Brick Lane in London's East End.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.140
It's the home of the country's Bangladeshi
community, known as Banglatown,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.560
and it's known for its many curry houses.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.820
This area of Banglatown was predominantly

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.720
settled by Bangladeshi families.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.980
It's always been an incoming area.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.380
You've had Jewish people, Irish people, all sorts of people come in here.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.284
But while the South Asian communities grown
considerably

00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:58.620
over the decades, it does face a number of political, economic and social challenges -

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.600
all of which are showcased around curry houses in the UK.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.300
Recently, immigration laws have deeply

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.460
impacted the ability of South Asian
restaurants to bring over chefs and

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:07.680
waiters from South Asia.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.129
This has resulted in a massive shortage of South

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.040
Asian workers and thus the shutting down
of numerous restaurants over the years.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.440
And with the lack of South Asian chefs,
restaurants have had to hire

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.320
Eastern European immigrants who now work in
curry houses in the thousands.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.160
But Brexit threatens the employment 
of even those workers.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.000
Brexit is going to happen very

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.159
shortly, not far to go. And we still
don't know what going to happen, it's

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.480
deal or no deal.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.880
And the thing is, if you don't have free

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.199
movements, then those European will be
also stopped, and they'll have to have a

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.940
visa to come to United Kingdom.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.130
Brexit is going to be a problem for the

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.520
catering industry nationwide, but
particularly in a place like London,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.029
where huge numbers of workers come from
overseas. The curry houses are

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.650
particularly affected, because if the
children of the restauranteurs are not

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.000
coming into the industry you're going to
have to pull in people from overseas.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.840
Former Secretary of State for
International Development Preeti Patel

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:09.050
even tried to gain support for Brexit
among curry house owners by saying that

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.219
the UK's withdrawal from the EU would
save the industry by keeping Eastern

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:17.060
Europeans out and thus prioritizing
South Asians for restaurant jobs.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.700
The future of curry in this country is at
risk because our membership of the

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.180
European Union renders us powerless to
control our borders.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.620
The Brexit campaign was sold to a number of South Asian

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.040
communities by people that wanted

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.860
us to leave Europe on the basis that, you
know, if we weren't tied to Europe we

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.220
could expand back into our broader
networks of people so that the routes to

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.479
South Asia to and from South Asia would
open up. It was a very strongly kind of

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:44.840
nostalgic imperial idea that Britain
could reconnect with its empire.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.259
We are actually struggling for the skilled chef, even low-skilled people that are needed

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:52.680
within the curry industry.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.640
So hence there is like three to four curry houses that are closing every week.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.620
And that's not a good
news for the British economy, neither for

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.100
the Asian community in the United
Kingdom.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.099
There's also the changing face of neighborhoods, as South Asian communities

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.140
like the Bangladeshi community struggles to keep their businesses and restaurants open -

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.710
especially in East London.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.470
Because of gentrification they're simply being

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.310
priced out of the market and I think
also they're being replaced by new

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.449
incoming forms of food. So somewhere like
Brick Lane or the Curry Mile in

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:27.259
Manchester, which is very close to here,
you'll see those traditional Indian

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.300
restaurants being replaced by kind of
shisha places or Lebanese places.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.120
And those reflect the churn of those areas
because often Indian restaurants are

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.360
located in areas of high migration and
and high kind of transition.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.520
And then there's the straight up racism

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.340
that South Asian communities have faced for decades.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.510
In the '60s and '70s violent
attacks on members of the South Asian

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.520
community by white skinheads became
commonplace

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.340
and they were fueled by anti-immigrant rhetoric of the time.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.520
Fast-forward to the early 2000s: and South Asian communities are once again the target of racism,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.800
and more specifically Islamophobia, following 9/11 and the 7/7 attacks on the London Underground.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.800
Every day violence and hostility is extreme, and that's ratcheted up a lot since Brexit.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.320
So incidents of Islamophobia,
in particular are massively high, but I

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.860
think that's true across all South Asian
communities as well.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.940
And in the aftermath of Brexit -another moment of anti-immigrant sentiment -

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.400
racially-motivated hate crimes in the UK spiked to their highest levels ever.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.600
And Islamophobic attacks in the UK have also
increased by 26% in 2017, with over 1200

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.854
incidents reported.

00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:37.550
So how do we make
sense of this dissonance or disconnect

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.019
in British society between its ongoing
love affair for South Asian cuisine

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:45.949
but also its long and complicated
relationship with South Asian immigrant

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:46.740
communities.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.820
It's always been a kind of
very global society.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.800
It's culture and identity has always been global,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.620
but it's never been happy with representing

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.440
itself to itself in that way.
