00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.940
Finding long lost relatives can be really tricky, especially if you don't

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.760
have a good place to start, but it's a lot easier if you

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.540
have the help from someone like a Genetic Genealogist, and today we lucky

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.030
enough to be joined remotely with CC Moore, a Genetic Genealogist. Hi CC.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.968
&gt;&gt; Hi Matt, how are you?

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.812
&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good, you know we pretty excited to be learning all

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.230
about this Ancestry and Human Evolution, and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.810
we're really curious at this point. You know,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.022
what is it that a genetic genealogist does?

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:30.682
&gt;&gt; A genetic genealogist uses DNA testing in

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.634
conjunction with traditional genealogy research in order to

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.503
learn more about our roots. And so, does this mean that you have to go through

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:41.766
a service like 23 and me, a similar

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.978
service like Family Tree, dna.com, what do you

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.533
need as an individual who is interested in

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.040
finding out more along the lines of genetic genealogy?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; Well you need to take a direct-to-consumer genetic genealogy test.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.700
So yes, that can be 23 and me, Ancestry DNA, or Family

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.910
Tree DNA. Also, also National Geographic Genome 2.0, although that's more

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.250
focused on ancient ancestry, then it is applicable to our family trees.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.590
&gt;&gt; I see, and how do, how do you get in touch with people? How do

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.030
you interact with people, do they come to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.710
you with questions, do you help them find relatives?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.152
&gt;&gt; We have a very active genetic genealogy

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:22.466
community. We have have lots of forums and mailing

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.730
lists and there's people posting questions and answers

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.340
all day long on these lists. So that the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.640
best way to, get involved and really learn

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.740
how we're using DNA testing for geneaology. Also, to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.140
get answers from a lot of the experts. We

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.065
have really an amazing community with incredibly intelligent and

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:47.150
knowledgeable people who are willing to help for free on these lists.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.310
So that's really how I would recommend getting started. You know, sign up,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.560
take the test with one of the companies, and while you're waiting for

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.430
your results, get on one of the lists and start learning right away.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.160
&gt;&gt; Now, what kind of consumers end up

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.950
interested in this kind of thing? Do you find

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.220
mainly just people with a generic interest, or

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.509
do you find a lot of, maybe adopted individuals?

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.940
&gt;&gt; I think all of the above. When we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.290
first started with Genetic Genealogy the early adopters were

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.918
highly educated. A lot of times retired scientists of

00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:21.650
not geneticists but other types of scientists, and professionals

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.080
from other industries, and now as we've gone further

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.750
with it and it's gotten more visibility, it among

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.330
the general populace. We have a lot more people

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.680
coming in from all walks of life, all different

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.690
types of jobs, different ages and certainly

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.810
adoptees. Because DNA testing for an adoptee

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.440
is just a revelation, especially for one

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.160
who had no knowledge of their biological roots.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.630
&gt;&gt; Now that raises an interesting question I think for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.160
me and other people is, we don't often put a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.320
lot of thought into the considerations, ethical or otherwise, even

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.250
just emotional or psychological. What are some of the important aspects

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.440
that you think people should be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.690
thinking about whenever they're approaching this idea

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.970
of finding family members, and trying to reach out and grow their family?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.220
&gt;&gt; I always say expect unexpected surprises. I give a lot of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.455
speeches about genetic genealogy, and I've

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:15.980
incorporated that in every one now, and

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.024
lots of my writings about genetic genealogy as well. And that's because my

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:24.920
experience has been that you just don't know what you're going to find.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.770
There have been a tremendous number of people who have

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.950
found close family members who had no idea that that

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.370
other person existed. So, be prepared. And if you are

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.010
not prepared to learn the truth, then you probably shouldn't test.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.210
&gt;&gt; I see. Now, that makes it sound very interesting. I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.850
take it not all the responses or reactions are always positive.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.825
&gt;&gt; The vast majority have been positive. But,

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:50.170
sometimes it just takes time getting used to.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.590
When you don't know that you have a half

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.400
sibling or a child out there sometimes. Or a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.180
first cousin, nephew. Aunt, uncle, all of these types

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.330
of relationships have been discovered. It's a shock, of

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.310
course, I've been, been a part of a lot

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.180
of great reunions where everyone was thrilled to meet

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.850
each other. But you know, it's not an easy

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.190
thing to add a new family member. Especially someone

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.860
so close.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.570
&gt;&gt; Is there any particular relationship that you help

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.050
people find or that you just find that other

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.230
people end up discovering on their own that seems

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.810
to be more profound than other kinds of relationships?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.170
&gt;&gt; I think a parent-child relationship is the most

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.534
profound one you can find. particularly a mother, though I

00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:37.240
think it's also true for fathers. But when mothers

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.290
have carried a child for nine months and then given

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.900
it up for adoption, it's an extremely emotional thing

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.800
to rediscover that person. So, I think it does take

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.730
a lot of, adapting. Sometimes those birth mothers have been

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.030
searching for their child they gave up for decades. And,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.360
or even if they weren't searching or was hoping

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.710
that that child would find them. And so they're thrilled

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.690
but a lot of times they already have another family.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.850
So they have a husband and they have children, and

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.760
they don't always know about the existence of

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.110
that other family member. So it takes a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.060
little bit of time and sensitivity to integrate

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.890
that new family member. I, I have not

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.700
actually personally seen any negative responses from birth

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.490
mothers or children being reunited. There have been

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.370
some birth fathers who didn't know of the

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.040
child's existence. Who have had a harder time accepting

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.810
the truth of it. And if they don't understand genetics

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.620
and they don't understand, you know, the test that we're using,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.510
I think sometimes it's hard to convince these people that

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.870
yes, this is your child. And I have been a part

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.870
of a situation where the father denied, the birth father

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.120
denied at the time that he could have been the father

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.940
and that's partly why the child was given up for

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.510
adoption. And when this adoptee found a match at 23 and

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.380
me which turned out to be a paternal aunt,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.060
he was still unable to accept the truth of this.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.150
Although the whole extended family has now accepted that

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.820
this adoptee into their family. And one of the really

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.682
interesting things about that case is, I used the

00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:14.620
MT DNA and the X chromosome inheritance in order to

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.320
narrow down exactly what the relationship was between these

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.730
people because they shared, I think it was 28% about,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.850
of their DNA. So as you know there could

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.400
be a couple of different relationships in this case.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.270
And by looking at the X chromosome inheritance, we

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.540
were able to narrow it down and say that this

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.970
is definitely a paternal aunt and she had her

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.260
other brother test. So also paternal uncle, we confirmed

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.810
it. And the father still denied it, the birth

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.850
father, so they hired a geneticist to look over it.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.690
And he thought that I was being too specific

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.480
with my claim but I think that's because he

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.620
doesn't understand how we're using DNA testing for genealogy

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.040
and for these adoption searches. And so later when

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.640
we found the birth mother. Which we found when

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.870
she transferred her raw data to family tree DNA's

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.320
family finder. Believe it or not we found a

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.850
maternal first cousin. So in half an hour I

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.220
was able to locate the birth mother. And

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.510
when she was contacted, she confirmed that the person

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.600
we had identified as the birth father was indeed,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.200
and they have gone to the same college, same

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.490
year, I mean it was very clear. So, that

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.750
case, has mostly turned out great, she's had a

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.040
wonderful reunion with her mother and with her paternal

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.910
extended family, but the father still has never admitted

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.770
that he is indeed the father. So, it's sensitive, yeah.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it seems amazing,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.600
I mean the, obviously the, the information is

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.920
very powerful. The, the, the genetic tracing.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.620
I'm curious to know from your perspective, do

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.380
you ever, what percentage of people do you think sign up for these 23 and

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.430
me services, and don't quite know that they're

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.910
getting themselves into a paternity test of sorts.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.740
is that common, or, or uncommon?

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.090
&gt;&gt; I think most people don't realize the

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.850
power of these types of tests. there's different

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.680
reasons that people test. As you know, they

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.566
might be testing for health reasons, if it's

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:19.720
23 and Me, whereas they might not realize

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.230
the genealogical implications. And it's not always that

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.890
a match finds their birth parent there, with

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.120
an adoptee, for instance. Or a donor-conceived individual.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.680
We may find a more distant relative that they're

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.380
related to, and still be able to triangulate this

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.530
adoptees matches, and identify the probable birth parents. So,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.659
you could be identified, even if you don't test.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.020
And I think that is just something that our

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.630
society is going to have to get used to.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.640
it's just the way things are going and I

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.280
believe very strongly in truth. I'm not a scientist by,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.110
training, but science is about truth, and

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.470
I don't think that, it's something that

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.960
we should deny. It's something that we

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.950
should definitely be moving towards and knowledge

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.190
is power so, hopefully, everyone will agree with me and get tested and not be

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.960
upset if they get contacted by a family member that they didn't know about.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.790
&gt;&gt; Exactly. We are definitely in the new

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.390
information age. where all of this can really change

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.640
our outlooks and our family structures in lots of different ways.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.360
What you know, for those of us. I, I, I sort

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.150
of just realized, for those of us who don't know very

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.080
much about genealogy at all, how, how far out do you go

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.420
in a family structure as a genetic genealogist? Are you interested

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.000
in, you know, up to grandparents and maybe second cousins, or

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.530
do, do, do you build out farther than that? Do you

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.550
connect whole families? Kind of just give us some idea of how

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.430
far out you go?

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.000
&gt;&gt; Well, we're interested in our family trees as

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.790
far back as we can go, so with Y

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.570
DNA testing which has been used in genetic genealogy

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.120
much longer than autosomal DNA tests like 23 and

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.430
me. We're looking way back. We could be looking

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.850
back into the 1400's even, because as you know

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.440
the Y chromosome changes very slowly. Therefore a father

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.480
and son will probably have an identical Y chromosome.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.520
And maybe a grandparent and a great grandparent, a

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.880
second great grandfather on that direct paternal line. So

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.490
we've used this surname studies to go many, many

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.550
generations back. centuries back. With autosomal DNA, we're not

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.990
looking quite so far back because of the recombination.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.750
However, when we first started using autosomal DNA for

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.970
genetic geneaology, we were told that it was only

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.060
going to work maybe five generations, six generations back.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.980
And especially with our adoption DNA research

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.650
we have proven that it works much further

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.340
back. We're able to identify ancestral couples,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.600
a couple centuries ago actually in these, trees

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.050
and the way we do that is for instance if an adoptee knows nothing about

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.850
their biological heritage. We would take all

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.290
of their family trees of their DNA matches,

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.440
so everyone who's willing to share at 23 and

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.470
Me, or Family Tree DNA, or Ancestry DNA. And we

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.140
would start comparing those trees, looking for commonalities and intersections

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.240
among their matches' trees, since they don't know anything about

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.320
their family tree. And if we see a certain

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.990
ancestral couple over and over and over and over, we

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.660
can be pretty sure that that's probably one of their

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.390
ancestors as well, and if not their ancestor, certainly in

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.270
an ancestral line. One of their branches of

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.100
their family tree would have that ancestral line in

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.050
it. And we've used couples very far back, like,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.050
late 1600s, 1700s, and been able to build down

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.200
to the present time. That takes a lot of

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.950
work, believe me. And we wouldn't just do it

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.170
with one couple, we would do it with various

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.200
couples, build their descendants down to the present, and

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.100
try to see where there's intersections between the

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.290
descendants from those ancestral couples. And if we can

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.590
do that, which we sometimes can, we can

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.770
sometimes solve this adoption search cases without a close

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.560
relative match. If we get second cousin or

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.490
closer, we can almost always solve it. if we're

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.930
only working with third cousins, fourth cousins, fifth

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.290
cousins and more distant, it takes a lot more

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.610
work, but it has been done.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.630
&gt;&gt; That's really amazing. you know, we have,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.230
an individual in our course named Sterling, who

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.196
is actually submitted his DNA sample to 23

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:33.750
and Me and gotten results back. And he

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:39.190
has been able to find a, as close a match as a second cousin on the relative

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:44.150
finder. Now, if you were chatting with him and he was looking for a next step,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.400
what advice would you give to him to sort of deal with trying to reach out

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.670
to that person or possibly, you know, finding

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.310
other connections that he could get more information from.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.660
&gt;&gt; There's a couple different things he should do. First of all, he

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.010
may want to join one of our adoption DNA mailing lists. We have

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.680
extremely helpful search angels on those

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.380
lists who started out as traditional adoption

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.230
search angels. So they know how to work with the records. And if

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.100
he has any non-identifying information, that can really help to

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.540
use that in conjunction with his DNA results. So we can

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.850
help to teach him on those lists what he needs

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.270
to do next. And sometimes, you know, do more than just

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.790
teach him, but hand-hold. And if he gets real close

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.400
to the answer, one of the search angels will jump in

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.820
and help. And when I say real close, a second

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.390
cousin is really close. So he probably could find someone who'd

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.370
be willing to help him work through this matches and

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.970
try to identify his birth parents. And the way we would

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.700
do that is, we would take that second cousin match

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.050
you happen to know what the percentage is that's in common?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:53.810
&gt;&gt; I believe it's, it's around, I think its above 1% ish?

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, we would look at the percent, and

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.490
try to determine if it's a solid second cousin match, or

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.560
if it might be a second cousin once removed,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.370
or third cousin. So if his match is around 1%,

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.960
that could be a second cousin, it could be

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.770
a second cousin once removed. Could be a third cousin.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.020
Could be a first cousin twice removed. depending on

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.910
the different ages. So we would look at all of

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.360
those possibilities, and we would want that matches family

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.990
tree back to great grandparents or preferably great, great grandparents.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.420
Because they may if they are true seconds cousins they

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.480
will share great grandparents, but if they're second cousins once removed

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.710
it might be his great, great-grandparent, and their great-grandparent, or the

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.230
other way around. Or if there's a bunch a removals, it

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.480
could even be a little further back in the tree.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.130
So as much as we can get of that family tree,

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.080
built from traditional genealogy, we want. If his match doesn't have

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.020
it, then we would build that for them. So then we

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.690
would look at all of those great-grandparents first. And we would

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.410
build, towards the present with their descendants. And we would try

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.910
to find somebody in the right place at the right time

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.920
who could be this adoptee's birth parent. So we don't know if

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.010
it's going to be the mother or the father. So we'd have

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.690
to look at both in this case. If it's an adoptee who

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.720
already knows their birth mother, which happens quite a bit, now

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.310
we know we're just looking for a male in the right place

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.790
at the right time, of the right age, to

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.420
be their birth parent. And if we don't find

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.600
anyone from those great grand parents descendants, we have

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.560
to go back one generation. And go to great, great

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.920
grandparents and try building them, to the present. And

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.920
if we still have trouble, what I would do

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.030
is start looking at his other matches. Preferably his

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.120
next closest matches, but all of his matches are important.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.380
And, we build spreadsheets. So, this is a little

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.100
complicated. But, this is what we do. We get

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.500
all of the matching segment data into a spreadsheet

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.300
and we sort it. So it's in order. Chromosome one,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.885
start with the beginning of the chromosome to the

00:15:55.885 --> 00:16:00.240
end of the chromosome, so, one base pair all

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.850
the way out to the very end, 230,000, whatever

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.330
it is. And we go to the next one, and

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.990
chromosome two, three, four, five, and then we start

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.340
looking at people who are overlapping. On these matching segments.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.310
And we try to find groups of people who all

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.950
would match each other. Now we since we know that

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.080
there's two chromosomes in each spot, right, it might look

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.160
like they're matching, but they're not So we have to

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.990
then triangulate, meaning do in common with, if it's Family

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.420
Tree DNA, they have a feature where you can compare

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.980
the matches and see if they match, or 23andMe, it's

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.750
even better because we can actually compare them to see if

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.530
they match on the same spot. So if I'm sharing

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.870
with someone and sharing with someone else, I can compare them.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.140
So, then we break those groups up into a paternal

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.800
and maternal chromosome. And we don't usually know which is paternal

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.410
which is maternal, so we just call them A and B.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.520
So, we will have chromosome one A and chromosome one B.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.868
And we'll have groups of overlapping matches. Now

00:16:59.868 --> 00:17:01.120
what would we would do is try to

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.220
get the family tree information, the regular genealogy

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.260
that, of, from documentary research. And compare these family

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.339
trees, of the matches since the adoptee doesn't

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.359
have one, and we look for commonalities and

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.240
overlaps. So if we can find an ancestral

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.200
couple that appears in some of these overlapping matches

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.500
then we know that that also has to be in

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.339
the adoptee's family tree, and why is that? That's because

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.710
each piece of DNA can only come from one of

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.160
our ancestors right? Now its probably an ancestral couple, so

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.220
we won't know if it's from the man or the

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.410
woman of the couple, but that's okay, because we know

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.550
that this couple then, goes in their family tree. And

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.360
in this way, we can give adoptees their family tree back

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.470
piece by piece. So even if we can't automatically

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.300
tell them who their birth parents are, we can start

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.550
giving them pieces of their heritage back. Which is incredibly

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.970
meaningful for adoptees I found. I think it's hard for

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.640
those of us who aren't adopted to understand that,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.870
but I've had a lot of adoptees say to me,

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.240
I have ancestors. Like it's so strange for them to

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.390
know that they have ancestors. And this also works well

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.980
for African Americans who can't get their genealogy,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.340
past slavery. I've been able to identify a lot

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.900
of their European ancestors by doing this. And

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.790
we don't know where they fit in the tree

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.940
yet, so they're just sort of floating around

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.820
in space you know, not connected to which branch

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.380
of the tree, but eventually, if you keep

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.420
doing this, you'll be able to attach these ancestors

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.800
to the correct branches of the trees.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.050
So it's really fascinating and exciting for genealogists,

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.970
adoptees, and anyone who has unknown parentage, to

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.820
discover these things that they didn't know about.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.480
&gt;&gt; I love it. That was a great answer. I mean, it

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.980
sounds like so much work, but it sounds like it really pays off

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.310
to everyone involved. you get a lot of information, there is a

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.490
lot of value in that and sort of re-establishing your, your identify and

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.520
your family structure. You know, I have to ask

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.050
I've never met anybody who is so confident in

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.140
their ability to actually say second cousin once removed,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.280
third cousin twice removed. You know, in just my

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.140
preparation for this course, you know, I, I, I

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.390
got, tried to get back into understanding those different

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.470
relationships. How long did it take you to actually,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.680
learn all those different, cousin relationships and does it make

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.500
sense to you?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.350
&gt;&gt; It does. And as a genealogist, that's something

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.980
we deal with anyway But I don't think I have

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.230
a really strong confident grasp on it until I

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.880
started doing genetic genealogy, and it's so important for autosomal

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.880
DNA because its going to half with, you know

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.380
the amount of DNA we expect to see on average

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.210
in common is going to half with each removal.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.040
So you have to understand that that the second cousin

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.780
is going to have an average of expected DNA

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.780
of 3.125%. I've seen it down to about 1% and

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.030
I've seen it up to almost 5%. So there is

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.980
this huge range. But if it's the second cousin once

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.690
removed we're only expecting to see about half of that.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.560
So about 1.6%. You really have to get a grasp

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.140
on it if you're going to do this work. Now

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.850
there's charts that we have on our, International Society of

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:23.650
Genetic Genealogists, I helped to found the wiki in 2010.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.700
So we have the charts on there. If you ask on

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.900
one of the lists, someone will help you with that.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.700
It's also on my blog. So the information's out there. You

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.830
don't have to have it memorized. And I do have

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.650
it memorized because I've done it so much. But it's still

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.970
get overwhelming and I, someone writes me and says, help

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.850
me figure this out. I think I have a first cousin

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.200
once removed. I'm still sitting there like writing it down

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.620
on paper. You know because it helps so much to

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.910
be able to visualize it and get it there. And

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.790
like okay this person's descended from this person, there must be

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.850
two people in between, and here's the matches' family tree

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.390
and count back and, you know, it does get confusing.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.310
So you just have to be really organized about it

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.090
and use all the resources available that we have out there.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.870
&gt;&gt; Sure, and I'm, I'm a very

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.110
visual person too. So when I think about it, it

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.080
definitely helps to see the graph in front of me

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.820
or, or be able to see those connections. Now, we've

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.290
skirted around it and you just mentioned it there, you actually,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.340
run a very popular blog called Your Genetic Genealogist. And

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.820
I'd love for you to tell us a little bit more

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.020
about how you, you started that blog and what it

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.670
means to you and, and what people use it for today.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.120
&gt;&gt; I guess that means I have

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.630
to start at the beginning a little bit

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.960
which is that I was a genealogist, just hobbyist.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.120
And I've always loved genetics. It's not my career

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.220
in the past, I wasn't trained in it, but

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.810
I've always been drawn into it, I always

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.530
really loved it. And so, when autosomal DNA was,

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.720
introduced for genealogical purposes, by 23 and me, I

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.250
jumped in with both feet, I was so excited.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.305
it was actually Katherine Borges who was the director of

00:22:01.305 --> 00:22:04.500
ISOGG, who first showed me what they were doing, and

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.490
I just fell madly in love and it completely took

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.250
over my life. So, it went from being a hobby

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:15.040
to a full time volunteer position and now a career,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.270
and part of that was starting my blog. I was

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.750
answering a lot of questions all the time, of people

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.730
who needed help right away. And so, I wanted a way

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.120
to be able to answer those questions, and not

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.810
have to keep repeating the same answers over and over.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.490
I was also doing some really fascinating research with my

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.940
own family and wanted to have a place to write

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.630
that up. And I was corresponding with 23 and Me

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.310
a lot. People who worked over there. Right away, I

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.360
established a good relationship with them, and it was actually

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.900
one of them who recommended that I start a blog.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.100
It was Alex from 23 and Me. He's not there

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.210
anymore, but he was one of the early, employees there, and

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.350
he said, you know, you should write a blog. And

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.380
so, I'd never done anything like that. And I enjoyed it,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.470
right off the bat. It was so fun to share

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.810
my research, and get input from everybody. And help people learn

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.790
what to do with their results as well. And it's

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.630
grown into something I never could've imagined. Looking at my analytics,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.630
it's just amazing. Almost from the very beginning there was people from

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:25.800
Stanford, and Harvard, and governmental agencies reading it. universities

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.970
all over the world, so it just literally blew my mind. I mean I thought

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.140
I would just have a few genealogists reading it,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.280
but I think it was the right time, the

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.180
right thing at the right time. There weren't many

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.780
blogs. Blaine Bettinger, the genetic genealogist, had been writing

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.890
since 2007, but he was really the only one doing it, and he's an

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.400
attorney, so he was pretty busy and wasn't writing as much, so there was a

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.520
real opening for me. So it was one of those niche things that just worked

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.540
out, and turned out to do this amazing thing that I never could have planned.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.970
&gt;&gt; Well I know so many people are

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.100
happy that you started, including us. we're actually

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.750
going to use it as a resource for our

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.950
students, who are really interested in the topic. So

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.060
I hope that they'll, all you students out there will make good use of that.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.200
now what I'd love to do is actually pivot a little bit now, and we'll talk

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.430
about sort of the, sort of more career side of this. As, as you sort of gotten

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.140
into explaining a bit how you, how you got to this point. Now, you mentioned.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.040
&gt;&gt; Could I add one thing about my blog? Sorry to interrupt.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.630
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.330
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say. So, early on, I started asking

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.190
relatives to test. Right away, I realized that that

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.790
was going to add a lot to my research. So now

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.420
I have about 35, 40, pretty close family members tested.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.630
But on my blog I started a second cousin study.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.160
So every time I would test a second cousin

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.210
I would write up the results from that. And I

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.070
would show the range of sharing. Sometimes it's low, sometimes

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.130
it's high. But the exciting thing about it for genealogists

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.790
was, I started talking about how when you test

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.590
a second cousin you can identify the DNA that

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.230
you receive from each of your great grandparent ancestral

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.900
couples. And that's an exciting thing for a genealogist

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.420
because we have spent thousands and thousands of hours

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.120
researching these people. And great grandparents aren't that far

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.300
back, they're not that far out of our reach.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.400
But most of us never got to meet them.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.710
And of course we know that they are inside of

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.520
us, but we've never had tangible evidence of it before.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.140
So to be able to say look, on chromosome ten,

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.730
from one million to 20 million, I know I got

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.180
this DNA from my proctor great grandparents on my mom's

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.390
side. And my allen great grandparents on my dad's side.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.960
To me that was fascinating, it sounds sort of like

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.380
nerdy, techy. But, for genealogist it really has been meaningful.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.040
And I think it's just going to get more meaningful as

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.310
we learn more about genetics. I mean, we all know

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.470
how fast genetics is advancing. So I think that will

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.580
start to mean a lot to us in real life. We'll

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.380
be able to say, hey you know, I know I

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.740
have that DNA in that area from this particular great

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.680
grandparent or great great grandparent depending how far back you've

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.550
been able to trace it. And that means that I got,

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.050
say, the shape of my nose, for instance. I'm

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.310
just making this up. But you know, but that particular

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:22.180
gene. From those, specific ancestors. And so for those of

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.530
us who just love our ancestors, and would dig in

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.730
dusty boxes for hours on end to find tiny

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.470
little tidbits, this is extremely meaningful for us. So I

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.650
think that's why Genetic Genealogy, in part, why it has

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.160
exploded the way it has. For our group, our community.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I, I completely. I, I completely

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.320
agree, you know, in lesson 11 for our course,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.050
we actually go over an example where you have

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.630
grandchildren who have blue eyes, and both parents have

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.640
brown eyes, and the question is, is, in general

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.785
eye color is controlled by several genes but a

00:26:56.785 --> 00:27:00.110
couple of really important ones. And we can actually

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.280
exactly trace which grandparent and which grandparent that eye

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.570
color gene came from. Which grandparent gave you that allele,

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.260
you can trace it all the way back. And it really

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.660
is fascinating. It gives you a new idea instead of this,

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.920
sort of mysterious, oh I know I got this from my

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.940
great grandparents but I don't know which one or, even

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.540
on which side, and you're like I know my great aunt,

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.760
you know, my, my great grandmother Norma, gave me my blue

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.140
eyes. And it just gives you a new sense of identity.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.070
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I'm so happy to hear that,

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.400
because I always talk about that in my speeches. But

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.630
I'm, like I said, I'm not a geneticist, so I

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.030
don't know the exact genes that are, you know, controlling

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.900
each of these traits. But I know that some of

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.250
the information is out there, and all the time there's

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.280
more and more, and more. because Ann Wojciciki from 23andme

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.760
has this slide she shows in her presentations where she

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.160
say's what we knew a couple of years ago. And it's

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.140
just like a few dots here and there across the genome and what we know now,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.250
like what's been identified. To be significant. And

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.720
it's just full of them now. So all though

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:09.040
that that's not my area of expertise. I know that this is meaningful and is just

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.460
going to get more and more so. So

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.910
hearing that from you just confirms what I thought.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.000
&gt;&gt; Great, I'm glad to hear that. Well you

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.970
know? We're really intriged that you say, you know,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.560
genetics is a passion of yours but it wasn't actually

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.430
what you studied. Can you tell us a bit more about

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.560
what you did before you got into this and sort

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.790
of what your segue was. Were you just a super, super

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.190
nerd spend all your free time in genetics. Or was

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.850
this just a, a really fun hobby for you. Genetics was

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.050
always something that I was interested in, but I had

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:44.250
not studied it. In fact, I was a music and theater

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.190
major in college, and I had fallen in love with genetics

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.550
just prior to that in my senior year in high school

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.640
when I was in AP bio. We had a little genetics,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.710
section as part of our course work. And I absolutely loved

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.340
it. So I should have taken the clue then. And I,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.490
I loved it enough that I did think about changing my

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.040
major. And I even investigated it. But I already had a

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.550
scholarship for music at USC, and they didn't have a genetics,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.730
undergraduate program or I very well may have done

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.370
it. But I just stuck with my original plan

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.380
and many years later, here I end up back

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.960
again loving genetics, but this time it took over my

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.020
life. So I had started as a genealogist in

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.630
2002, I think was when I really got involved,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.180
and I was looking at making a family tree

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.720
for my niece's wedding. And I, the type of person

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.060
who jumps in with both feet. And I did

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.450
that and, got kind of obsessed. did genealogy for a few

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.490
years before I got really interested in the genetics

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.890
part of it. we, we're just using Y-DNA and mtDNA

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.870
at the time, which I still thought was interesting.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.890
But I wasn't quite as fascinated as I am with

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.370
autosomal DNA. And that's really become my focus although

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.590
I use the other types in conjunction with it many

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.390
times especially in adoption searches. So how did

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.930
I get into it? So I started writing the

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.520
blog. And I got so many questions from

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.820
people, and so much interest, that it literally started

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:19.550
taking over my life. I had tons of comments on the blog, I had tons of private

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.090
emails of people wanting help, particularly people who

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.610
were searching for close family members like adoptees, and

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.630
people who had discovered close family members, and hadn't expected

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.540
it. there's so many people out there that this is

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.770
happening to, you'd be surprised. And I sometimes wonder if

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.540
there's much more of that in our society than we realize,

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.560
but then I think that it's also possible that the

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.410
people who are drawn to testing, are the people who maybe

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.110
felt a little different, or felt like something was missing

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.640
in their lives. So it's hard to say which it is.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.930
But anyway, the result was, that I was

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:58.260
completely overwhelmed. So I had been an actress,

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.000
for many years, and then when I had

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.180
my son, I had transitioned behind the camera, and

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.410
was producing commercials. And my poor partner has

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.440
had to completely take over our production business because

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:16.850
I work about 18 hours a day, 7 days a week doing genetic genealogy. And I never

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.300
would have imagined it would have become my career. I

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.200
don't have a science background, I've certainly taken science classes

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.510
and always loved them, but that wasn't the direction I

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.010
took with my career. So to go from entertainment and

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.818
to end up in a science career in my forties

00:31:32.818 --> 00:31:35.970
is definitely not something I would have ever imagined. But

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.970
it is so fascinating. Everyday, I wake up in the

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.230
morning and I immediately want to jump out of bed and

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.230
run down to my computer and see what

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.340
new fascinating things had tra, have transpired overnight and,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.640
believe me, there is always something. I'm very

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.540
involved with all of the genetic genealogy mailing lists.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.160
So I spend a lot of time answering

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.360
questions on those. And I do help adoptees for

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.650
free. So a lot of my time is spent

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.420
as a volunteer. I do some consulting. But probably

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.830
the most amazing thing that's come from it

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.930
is, I am now the Genetic Genealogy Consultant

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.165
on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates

00:32:16.165 --> 00:32:19.990
Jr. and also Genealogy Roadshow. And there's also

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.310
another Fox pilot, which I don't know if anything will come of it. So, there are

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.530
currently three television shows that I am doing

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:33.240
consulting for. And, so now, my entertainment background, and

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.600
this new career, that I never planned on, have

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.120
kind of come together in a way I would never

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.250
have imagined. So it's been quite a ride. I mean,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.240
amazing. They say sometimes you just fall into something. And

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.780
I wish I'd fallen into it in my twenties, but

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.360
still great that I eventually got where I am now.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.650
what do you think about the current state of genetic

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.360
genealogists in the country, or in the world? Do you

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.960
think that we're in need of, of more people who can

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.330
serve the same kind of role you and your blog serve?

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:06.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's a terrific question, Matt, and

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.644
it is something that I think about every

00:33:08.644 --> 00:33:13.170
day. Because I have so many people coming to me for help, I can't possibly help

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:17.750
them all. I stay up all hours of the night and I, you know, don't do

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.290
a lot of, social activities so I can

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.540
help these people. It's really fulfilling. And I prioritize

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.760
the ones who have a really emotionally important question.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.840
Like they have discovered something of great significance to

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.810
their, close family. And I just can't keep up

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.570
with it. And I need people that are doing what

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.440
I'm doing that I can send these people to.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.200
And I have a couple colleagues that I am able

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.160
to refer people to and there's a great network

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.890
of search angels who have learned to do genetic genealogy.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.540
Who are also helping adoptees and those like

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.220
them who have an unknown parentage, usually unknown father,

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.510
sometimes donor-conceived individuals. But it's even more than

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.280
just that. I have a lot of, just you

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.970
know, people interested in their ancestry and in

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.139
their genealogy. Who are either are genealogists or aren't

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.980
and are just interested in learning more, because

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.489
they've heard about DNA testing. There's such a huge

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:18.020
demand for this. And maybe a year ago, some

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.820
people had come to me and asked me you

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.449
know, if they wanted to have a career in

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:26.710
Genetic Genealogy, was there was there a demand for it?

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.719
And it's changed. Really then, maybe a year ago,

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.949
two years ago, there wasn't much of a demand

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.850
for it. And in the last year or two,

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.860
it has literally exploded. So now I absolutely would say

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.400
that there is room for genetic genealogy consultants. People who

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.110
are willing to learn what we're doing. And if they

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.920
have a background in genealogy that would be great. And

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.679
if they don't that's fine too. They'll have to learn both

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.989
sides of it. So they'll have to learn the DNA

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.120
part and the genealogy part. But if they're adventurous and

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.870
they're looking for a new career and they love detective

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.370
work because that's exactly what this is. Then I would strongly

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.380
recommend that they look into this as a career.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.720
&gt;&gt; Well, great. Sort of as our parting words here in, in the

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.100
same vein is there any other specific advice or resources you would give to

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.700
someone who's particularly moved by this

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.450
subject and wants to investigate about the

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.332
possibility of studying more? Are there some places they can go to? Sort of

00:35:23.332 --> 00:35:24.340
[COUGH]

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.250
learn more about how to become a genetic genealogist that you recommend?

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.290
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because the field is so fast

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.160
moving there are very few books that really address

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.100
the subject. And every day we have someone asking,

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.690
you know, is there are genetic genealogy for dummies

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.180
book. And there isn't. Not yet at least.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.270
And that's because those of us who've tried to

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.090
write them find that they are so quickly outdated.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.670
That trying to get something published is very difficult,

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.290
that's up to date. So we always recommend that

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.710
you read the blogs. You read my blog, Blaine's

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.110
blog, Rebre-, Roberta Estes blog. There's some other really

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.720
good ones out there. Kitty Cooper has recently started

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.550
writing some fantastic resources. And most of all, join

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.330
our mailing list, because that's where you really get

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.910
help from the experts. And the people who've been

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.730
doing this from the very beginning are very generous

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.080
with their time, and they're on those lists. So

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.120
join the International Society of Genetic Genealogy. It's free.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.120
It's ISOGG, isogg.org. And then you'll get an invitation

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.180
to join the DNA newbie list which I happen

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.100
to administer, and you can go there and ask

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.620
the most basic questions. and we have people who've

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.030
been on the list for quite a while, so

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.910
we also have more intermediate discussions and sometimes even

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:44.150
venture into more advanced. So, just keep reading everything you can.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.120
That's how I learned this. I got on the list and

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.540
I made myself read every single message, whether it made sense

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.530
to me or not, and it didn't at first. But I think

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.250
it works like you know, osmosis for a lack of a

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.180
better word. It starts to seep in after a while and

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.920
it starts to make sense, and you don't even know how

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.620
that happened because it, you didn't even know what you were reading.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.720
But our brains work, you know, mysterious ways.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.860
And, I, I promise you, if you get on

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.370
the list and you read everything that everyone's writing,

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.420
especially people like Ann Turner, who was one of

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.840
the first pioneer genetic genealogists, and she wrote the

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.630
book Tracing Your Roots with DNA. And she's on

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.350
those lists. I mean, you can't access a better

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.860
resource than her, and a lot of my other

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.580
colleagues, Tim Jansen is amazing, he's on those

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.270
lists. So join us, and we'll help you learn.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.540
&gt;&gt; Great. CC, it's been a pleasure chatting with you. I hope

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.169
you'll join us again maybe in the discussion forums for our course.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.660
&gt;&gt; That'll be great. I'd love to.
