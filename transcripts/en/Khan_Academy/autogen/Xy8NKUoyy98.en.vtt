00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.020
 We want to find the work of (x - 4) and (x + 7). 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.420
 Let's try to write it as a triple square in normal shape. 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.550
 This is just a modern way of naming the species, 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.900
 in which we have some coefficient in front of the second degree member ax ^ 2 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.040
 plus any coefficient b in front of the first degree member 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.520
 plus a free member. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.420
 This is a normal type of square triple. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.950
 This is the kind in which we want to express this work 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.150
 and I recommend pausing the video 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.260
 and try to do it yourself. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290
 Okay, now let's do it together. 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.890
 The key in multiplying two two- 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.820
 or, in fact, by multiplying any multiples, 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.420
 is simply not to forget the distribution property, 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 which each of us knows at this stage well enough. 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 We can treat it as revealing the brackets 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.720
 and multiplying (x -4) by x and 7. 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 We can say that this is the same thing 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.610
 such as (x -4) by x 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.220
 plus (x -4) at 7. 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.590
 Let's write it. 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.243
 (x-4) along x, 

00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:04.340
 or we could write it as x in (x -4). 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.650
 This is a multiplication of (x -4) by x 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.850
 This here. 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
 Plus 7 in (x -4). 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890
 By (x -4). 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.680
 Note that all we've done is multiply by (-4). 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.820
 We took this whole thing and multiplied it by every member here. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.890
 We multiplied x by (x -4) 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 and multiplied by 7 (x -4). 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.950
 We now see that we have these 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 two separate members. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.610
 To simplify each of them, we simply need to multiply again, 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 we uncover the brackets again. 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.790
 In this first we will have to multiply this blue x. 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.050
 And here we have to multiply on this blue 7. 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.620
 Let's do it. 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.160
 Here we can say x by x is x ^ 2. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.720
 Here we have a minus, 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.250
 so we can say -4 and it will be -4x. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.350
 And thus we get x 2 - 4x. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.150
 And then here we have 7 on x, 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.290
 so this will be plus 7x. 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.820
 And then we have 7 at -4, 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 which is -28. 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750
 And we're almost ready. 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 We can simplify it a little bit. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.020
 Here we have two first degree members. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.990
 If we have -4x and add to it 7x, 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.390
 how much will it be? 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.720
 Well these two articles together, 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.969
 these two articles assembled together 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.920
 will be (-4 + 7) x. 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.920
 -4 plus 7. 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.120
 (-4 + 7) x. 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.510
 All I do here is to make it clear, 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.220
 that I collect these two coefficients 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.050
 and then we have all the other members. 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.220
 We have x2. 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.660
 x ^ 2 plus this and then we have ... 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.480
 and then we have -28. 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.990
 And we're in the final right! 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.020
 This will be simplified to x ^ 2 ... 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650
 Now, -4 plus 7 is 3, 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.790
 so this will be plus 3x. 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.590
 Here's how those two members are simplified in the middle, up to 3h. 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.860
 And then we have -28. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920
 And so we're ready! 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.250
 An interesting thing we can look at because it's the same ... 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.400
 If we have to compare, A is one, 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.650
 B is three and C is -28. 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.950
 Interesting here is to follow the formula, 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.590
 when we multiply these two two-fold. 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.782
 Especially these two two- 

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:31.650
 where the coefficient in front of the x is one. 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.020
 Note that I have x on x, 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.710
 which in fact forms the member x ^ 2 here. 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.650
 We have -4, let's write it in a new color. 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.174
 We have -4 on ... 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.360
 this is not another color. 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.420
 We have -4 at 7, 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.590
 which is -28. 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.480
 And then how do we get this average member? 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.020
 How do we get this 3x? 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.220
 Well we had -4x plus 7x. 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.380
 Or (-4 + 7) on x. 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.610
 We had -4 + 7, 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.690
 by x. 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.390
 I hope you see some regularity here. 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.820
 If you multiply two two- 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.250
 where both the x coefficients of the members are units. 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.950
 This will be x ^ 2. 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.190
 And then the last member, the free member 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.920
 will be the work of these two constants. 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.720
 -4 and 7. 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.520
 And then the first degree member here is here, 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 its coefficient will be the sum 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.790
 of these two constants, -4 and 7. 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.290
 Now you can use it 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.950
 this formula if you exercise it. 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.250
 It's just something that will help you 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.985
 to multiply two members a little faster. 

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:39.250
 But it is extremely important 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.790
 to understand where it comes from. 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.280
 It is nothing more than 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.870
 applying the distribution property twice.
