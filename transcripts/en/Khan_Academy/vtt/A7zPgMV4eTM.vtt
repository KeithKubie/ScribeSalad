00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.020
So we've got two
figures right over here,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.110
and I want to think about
how much space they take up

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.700
on your screen.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.910
And this idea of how much
space something takes up

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.190
on a surface, this idea is area.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.810
So right when you look at
it, it looks pretty clear

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.560
that this purple figure
takes up more space

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.350
on my screen than
this blue figure.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.190
But how do we
actually measure it?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.910
How do we actually know how much
more area this purple figure

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299
takes up than this blue one?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.950
Well, one way to do
it would be to define

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.170
a unit amount of area.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
So, for example, I could create
a square right over here,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
and this square, whatever units
we're using, we could say it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.050
a one unit.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.500
So if its width right
over here is one unit

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.140
and its height right
over here is one unit,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.015
we could call this
a unit square.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.500
And so one way to measure
the area of these figures

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.790
is to figure out how many
unit squares I could cover

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.380
this thing with
without overlapping

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.560
and while staying
in the boundaries.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560
So let's try to do that.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.310
Let's try to cover each of
these with unit squares,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.010
and essentially we'll
have a measure of area.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.730
So I'll start with
this blue one.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:35.570
So we could put 1, 2, 3,
3, 4, 5, five unit squares.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.020
Let me write this down.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.331
So we got 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 unit squares,

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:45.330
and I could draw the
boundary between those unit

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.700
squares a little bit clearer.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.330
So we have 5 unit squares.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.090
And so we could say that
this figure right over here

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.720
has an area.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.730
The area is 5.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.436
We could say 5 unit squares.

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.810
The more typical
way of saying it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.290
is that you have 5 square units.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.570
That's the area over here.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.150
Now, let's do the same thing
with this purple figure.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:30.215
So with the purple figure, I
could put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:38.210
8, 9, 10 of these unit squares.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.025
I can cover it.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.150
They're not overlapping,
or I'm trying pretty close

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.191
to not make them overlap.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.710
You see, you can fit 10 of them.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.830
And let me draw the
boundary between them,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.770
so you can see a
little bit clearer.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.675
So that's the boundary
between my unit squares.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.760
So I think-- there you go.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.910
And we can count them.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.845
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:07.970
So we could say the area
here-- and let me actually

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.720
divide these with the
black boundary, too.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.910
It makes it a little bit
clearer than that blue.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.760
So the area here for the
purple figure, we could say,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.060
so the area here is equal to 10.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.110
10 square, 10 square units.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.740
So what we have
here, we have an idea

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.207
of how much space does
something take up on a surface.

00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:34.040
And you could eyeball
it, and say, hey, this

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.873
takes up more space.

00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:37.230
But now we've come up with
a way of measuring it.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.500
We can define a unit square.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.710
Here it's a 1 unit by 1 unit.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.430
In the future we'll see that
it could be a unit centimeter.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.300
It could be a 1 centimeter
by 1 centimeter squared.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.420
It could be a 1 meter
by 1 meter squared.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.440
It could be a 1 foot
by 1 foot square,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.500
but then we can use
that to actually measure

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.570
the area of things.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.110
This thing has an area
of 5 square units.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.710
This thing has an area
of 10 square units.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.350
So this one we can actually
say has twice the area.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.810
The purple figure
had twice the area--

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.600
it's 10 square units--
as the blue figure.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.009
It takes up twice the amount
of space on the screen.
