Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a whole nother TJ things. Oh bummer. That's a bummer. If you don't know what we're talking about. Tj Dillashaw tested positive for injectable EPO, which is a serious performance enhancing substance. And in some circumstances, according to Jeff Novitsky, it's given people strokes. Um, and I had heard this too, that like young guys doing like Tour de France type shit would have strokes because they were taking too much apo. Cause you know, like if you're supposed to take one, take two, fuck it. [inaudible] right, right, right. That's the mentality. This mentality's anybody who's going to do that. Yeah. You know, I shit turns your, your, your blood to paint. And I think that's what, I guess that's probably the discipline might have held, people were always getting away with things beforehand, right. Is to try to, uh, maybe try to do it in a way where they won't get caught.

Speaker 1:          00:52          But I think that's like, Oh, if this much is good and this is much more, it's going to be better. And Yeah. And we know guys who've done that with TRT. You know, there was a few our t tests where they, when tea, our tea was legal testosterone replacement therapy. Um, where you would hear about guys tests and like 14 hundreds, 14, 70, like, which is insane. It's like superhuman. No person has ever lived that as 1400, uh, like as a natural walking around testosterone level. That's crazy. Hyper human. But they just get these benefits from that with some of these people though who walk around naturally. I wonder if they'd never been tested though. That's true. Yeah. Some of these people I see walking around like genetic freaks do. Looks like he was born on steroids. Yeah. There are some freaks, man. There's some legit genetic freaks to deny.

Speaker 1:          01:40          That would be crazy. There's some people that just like, Yo, all Ramiro. What in the fuck? It doesn't matter how many steroids you take. It doesn't matter what you do like to do look like that. You have to be a genetic freak. Yeah. They're out there walking around. It's not fair. Who you'll always talking about. He would say go to Cuba. Yeah. Jeans, go see the jeans. What have you been look around? Yeah. What's his name? Um, think a fighter from France, the heavyweight from France. I mean he presents in Ghana for Francis in Ghana was a guy who used to be the one who had the, the crazy fat would pat. Pat Barry. Oh, we Congo check Congo. Oh yeah. Adonis. Yeah. Sculpted Greek statue. Yeah. He's just always imagine like I want to go to where he comes from. What, let's just take a look around.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Probably super athletes. Probably a lot of mediators. Um, the TJ thing, apparently they went and tested his old fight. A piss with Cody too. And that tested positive for EPO as well. And then Cody started freaking out. Yeah, that's right. What do you do if they, if they go back, like what did they decide to go back? Hey and say fuck it, let's test all the fights and it finds out that he was doing it like five, six, seven fights. What do do well, yeah. And then what do you do if you, uh, but then that's a whole nother can of worms too. Because like all the fights and then what about all the, because right, like when we get a test, everybody, Chad Brenton job and I were joking around last night and I was like test them all and he's going, no, no, didn't test them all.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Test everything. Let's find out, let's know what it was, let's know what it was. And he's like, what if they had pissed samples from you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago. Like what if they could use you sada style testing today from the past. I'm so glad that all these things are above my pay grade to deal with that. Yeah. Yeah man. If I was the guys in the office right now in charge of that program, you have to really wonder where is the line. You certainly want to test a guy for a fight that happened a week ago. You certainly want to hold, you know and check is if some new testing methods come out. If there was a fight from a year ago, you certainly would check that. How many years back do you go though? Yeah, especially if it's not expensive. Like, what if it's easy and cheap to do a test run 500 tests in the last 500 championship fights and then you have like 400 fights that you now have to like change the result of yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          04:21          I Dunno either. Yeah. Last night I was joking around, I was saying testimonial. I was, I was taking the, the fun position test a mall. I Dunno. I mean look, we all know at one point in time performance enhancing drugs were a huge part of mixed martial arts and that's why the UFC stepped up and decided to institute this program. There's a big part of it. I think it's a big part of professional sports in general. Sure. 100%. Yeah. And I think that, um, you know, uh, combat sports, you know, has a government oversight that other sports don't have. So I think that we're kind, we're going to be, it's going to be coming up regardless anyway. So I think maybe that's why the, you know, to the UFC took a position, right? Because I think of the other sports. I mean guys, you get caught doing things, but a lot of the other sports regulate themselves, right? Yeah. I don't know. I think the NFL regulates itself. What are those core has? What does this board has a government body like athletic commission saying, Hey, we're going to show up and do this or do that. I don't know. Like what do they do with baseball? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know much about other sports, but I didn't. I've heard of, I've never heard, I've never heard of like a, we all know about we, you know that's something different. Our support, the government involved

Speaker 2:          05:36          have a commission would not, not, not like he's saying a government commission, but they just, yeah, they're governing themselves. The NFL would have a vote. They hand down the suspension. They're not fair from this. This guy suspension at that guy's suspension and baseball. They have like a three strike rule. Like that first time is like somewhere in the 10 to 25 game range and then the second one is like half the season. Third one out for a whole year and if you do it again, your

Speaker 1:          05:58          band, there's no outside getting it shows up and decides to test your champion. Right. Just the baseball or NFL or basketball and the side. What's the best? You have a big moneymaker in your sport and then somebody outside of your company just comes along and says, yeah, I'm, I'm the government by, they have the right to test this guy. Yeah. Like what happened with John Jones? Yeah. I mean that's, that's a perfect example. I mean the UFC did not want John Jones to test positive. He is the biggest star right now other than Connor and Connor is not active and Jon Jones is fighting all the time. He wants to fight all the time. That if there that's, but that's the only way you ever find out what's really going on is you hire a bunch of werewolves and he just let them loose. Right. Go check, Piss, go, go out there, check, check everyone.

Speaker 1:          06:48          They checked the shit out of people. I was looking at this list of people that Holly Holmes been tested more than like, I think, I think Novitsky might've put it, oh, Steve paid meo chick tweeted it because he'd been tested 38 times. Really? Yeah. Some people, it's like in the forties, cris Cyborg got tested a lot. Yeah. And Holly Holm got tested a lot, Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Holly Holm got tested. A lot. Lot of people get tested. Um, it's just, uh, like crazy numbers and a lot of them are guaranteed their waking them up, you know, get 'em up like six in the morning. This is what I've heard. I mean, I don't know what they go by. I've heard conversations a little bit is, doesn't seem like it's, no, they want to make sure you're there. So they get there really early in the morning and fucked up.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Tell him where you're supposed to, where you're going to be at and think, yeah. Yeah. The problem is if you're training hard, that eight to 10 is so huge. You might get hit with a punch. If they wake you up after like six hours or five hours, it's possible that a punch my connect on you that wouldn't have connected if you got eight that's not brash. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's real. That's real. That's real. Everybody knows when you, how you feel good in the gym and everybody, even if you just lift weights, there's days you feel good days. Daisy feel like crap. I made sure I showed up here. Well rested, you look well rested and I'm hydrated. I'm like, can we get bathroom? I did. I did hydrate. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's, it's just not smart to stop athletes in the middle of their training camp and wake him up.

Speaker 1:          08:15          Yeah. I mean I get the testing but I feel like the testing so sophisticated, you could get to them at noon. Okay. Just so you could get to them at noon. You got good testing now. So we don't we, I mean I don't know that. I don't know that either. I'm talking shit cause I think the best time, right? That best time is that, you know, maybe the early years earlier the better. Right. Maybe, I don't know. The thing about this EPO apparently, and this was a shop was telling me was that they didn't, it didn't use to be a detectable the way it is now. They've, they've got these new methods of detection and a eps one to that. Apparently from what I've read, don't listen to me, I'm not a doctor. Um, they can absolutely tell that you injected it. It's a, it's injectable. It comes in the injectable form.

Speaker 1:          09:02          That's what's in the bottle. So there's no chance of a tainted steroids or tainted, um, a supplement. Right, right. It's definitely EPO. So that's, that's fucked up. Cause apparently that stuff has a giant advantage. Um, it gives you an anabolic advantage. It also gives you crazy recoup recuperative powers. So like you could train really hard and then be ready to go the next day. What do you think the answers cause like for me, like this is all stuff that like, to be honest, I don't really pay that much attention to it because I don't have, I always say it's out of my wheelhouse to deal with. But also it's hard to have an answer. Like you said, like do we go back and keep testing them when these new things come and says what do we do with the history to haul? Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's very interesting.

Speaker 1:          09:45          You know, what do you do with the history books? That's what you'd say. Look at what point if, if you have samples that date back 10 years too, you do chest them all like what do you do? I don't know. I don't know how long they keep samples or how, who has them or how they, you know, what's the chain of command? Um, I don't know man. It's just, but if you find out that TJ tested positive for the Cody fight too, well, Cody shirt has an argument there. And what if it's the fight before that? What if you took a lot of that was a lot of people have arguments. There's a lot of guys. Yeah. So it's, yeah, it's, it's tough. To me it's a shame too because I'm a Tj fan and I think he's a phenomenal fighter and a, I'm, I'm a big fan of watching him perform.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Um, but just, it taints his legacy. It just does. There's no way around it when you get caught cheating, which is this stuff is, there's no way it's not cheating. I mean this is just cheating, right? I mean this isn't any accident. It's, it taints your legacy right there. And the guy had an amazing legacy, you know, two times bantamweight champion, one of the best pound for pound fighters. The way he beat Hanan Barao I was like, Holy Shit. Did he went out and fought Hanan Barao he was sparring with, yeah. Yeah. His stuff, the stuff, some of his fights were amazing. He's amazing. Yeah. It doesn't take away from the fact that he's amazing. Tj is an amazing fighter. But fuck man, that to test positive for EPO. And the Henry. So Hutto funding is also crazy to watch the progression, all the work he did and how much, you know, he was getting better every fight.

Speaker 1:          11:19          And so he came to this. Yeah, but you got to think like how much, like if you're on EPO, how much does that really allow you to train extra time? How much does that allow you to recover? What's the benefit? Like what is the quantifiable benefit? And it must be pretty significant because there's a lot of, you know, the cyclists, a lot of heavy duty endurance athletes use it. Yeah. I almost want to try it. You know, they say that these executives are trying, they're doing EPO and entering into triathlons and shit like that for bragging rights. Yeah, just assholes, assholes with money or take an EPO. Like really I was reading the thing about an epidemic of a really a boost you that much like, okay, you're going to take it and you're going to notice that you're able to like, like the other day you could barely finish a role, a loop around the rose bowl, a three mile loop.

Speaker 1:          12:09          And then you started taking it and you can get what, five, six miles in. I wonder. I wonder. I think what it does is it raises your threshold if you're already an elite insurance athlete too. I think for them that's what it is. It's like they're already looking for that extra edge. So they're already in elite endurance athletes are already in the Tour de France and they take that EPO and it's like, whoa, just just Jackson mom. They could just do more work. They have more oxygen, they don't run out of juice. And for a guy like Tj, his style is so kinetic. There's so much movement, explosion, switching stances. Like he needs that juice. It's not like a calm, easy game where he's, you know, everything is fast, fast, fast, fast, fast. It's crazy. It's hard. It's, it's a hard one to swallow. Yeah, man.

Speaker 1:          12:56          So for me, like I was like, man, I was to come on Joe Rogan's show and let's see, what was he? Could he talk about to make me uncomfortable to talk about maybe some hard stoppages? Man, I've talk about some hard stop at, just give me what's the wars went a little, let me talk about when I made a mistake. I don't want to talk about this. You know what I'm talking about? No, I'm just being, I have no answer for it. I don't understand that. It's like, oh, I'd want to like, I just doesn't feel like a good conversation because all I could do is just, it just get, like you said, it's just going to take away from what I've seen of Athens and the more I imagine about it, it's just going to be more takeaway and then anything I could say or think about.

Speaker 1:          13:37          I can't think of anything. That solution or our sister. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think anybody, I mean I think we're in this stage right now where they're probably looking at the data going, okay, what does this signify and how many more people should we test? You know, once, once they develop a new method of testing, that's the whole reason why they want to keep the old samples anyway in case new, more sensitive methods of detecting are invented. And you know about this stuff because I know the truth. You're a science freak and you're saying, especially, especially when it comes to anything that can enhance the, this life that we have on this earth. So yeah, I'm sure you know a lot about this stuff. While I've had a really amazing conversation with um, many people about it and, uh, David Sinclair was one more recent ones who did, uh, this discussion about life extension and different, uh, anti aging, uh, solutions and different things that they're coming up with.

Speaker 1:          14:37          But what I've come through with is at the other end is there are probably hundreds of thousands of people that are involved in either legitimate supplements or molecules or testing hormones on people or, you know, trying all these different things to try to figure out how to get the body to perform better. Some of them are legal and some of them are illegal and that's where it gets strange. She get like the guy, like the ball co Guy Vic to contact comes along. It's like, live, I've got one. You just rub it on. No one's gonna know shit. They don't even know what this stuff is yet. Uh, and for a while, yeah, that worked then, but, but [inaudible] but while it worked, everybody was like, hm, why is Barry bonds getting so big? You know, people just started wrecking like, mmm, come on man, look at me. Sammy Sosa, look at me in the eye. What are you doing? You know? And they all, they all like exhibited these obvious physiological changes where the, you could tell them whatever they were doing was really effective stuff. There's hundreds of thousands of people working on that right now, all the time on all the time trying to get it better. There's probably thousands of people that are trying to come up with stuff that sneaks past this testing.
