00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.510
Next to the bark of a dog or the gentle meowing
of a cat, the crow of a rooster is one of

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.260
the most recognisable animal noises on Earth;
but why exactly do roosters feel the need

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.700
to crow and is there any truth to the idea
that they crow more (or only) in the morning?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.680
Surprisingly, although chickens are one of
the most ubiquitous (and delicious) animals

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.320
on the planet, it wasn’t until 2013 that
scientists definitively answered these questions.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.040
First and foremost, it’s important for us
to point out that roosters will crow at all

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.620
times and in response to a range of seemingly
innocuous stimuli, like the sound of a car

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.410
or someone walking into their coop.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.400
This is because the crow of a rooster serves
several functions.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.710
Along with being used as a warning of sorts
to let other roosters known the boundaries

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.310
of its territory, the crow can be used to
communicate with other birds and sometimes

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.610
to celebrate getting lucky; roosters really
aren’t picky when it comes to excuses for

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.610
crowing.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.190
That said, although roosters have been observed
crowing at all times of day and in response

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.149
to even the most mundane of stimuli, they
will indeed typically crow just before or

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.329
at the crack of dawn.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.200
Because of the rooster’s tendency to crow
at everything, for many years scientists and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.179
bird nerds (ornithologists) were under the
impression that roosters crowing at day break

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.664
were simply crowing in response to the changing
levels of light, as they’ve been observed

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:30.664
doing when they see car headlights or other
artificial light sources.

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:33.770
However, after years of anecdotal stories
about roosters seemingly knowing when day

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.960
break was about to occur, scientists at Nagoya
University in Japan decided to see if this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.049
was just in people’s heads or if roosters
really were anticipating, rather than reacting

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.070
to, the sunrise.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.659
In the research helmed by Takashi Yoshimura
several experiments were run on roosters to

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.009
answer these questions.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.630
To start, roosters were exposed to different
environments for a couple weeks.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.750
As expected, with all groups, the roosters
crowed at all times of day in response to

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.139
a variety of stimuli, like being fed.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.429
So what about the mornings?

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.789
First, a group of roosters were exposed to
an environment where it was light for twelve

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.349
hours, then dark for twelve hours, repeating
for two weeks.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.390
As many have previously posited, the roosters
really did anticipate the light, generally

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.060
starting their pre-dawn crowing around two
hours before the light was to turn on.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.331
Another interesting observation was that the
most dominate rooster was the one who would

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:27.480
start the crowing off, lending credence to
the idea that crowing is about marking territory

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000
and asserting dominance.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.940
As Yoshimura stated, “Our preliminary data
suggest that the highest ranked rooster has

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.400
priority in breaking the dawn, and lower [ranking]
roosters are patient enough to wait and follow

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.770
the highest ranked rooster each morning.”

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.220
In a second experiment, roosters were exposed
to a constant, near-dark environment 24 hours

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.220
per day.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.870
Despite this, Yoshimura and his colleagues
noted that the roosters quickly settled into

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.880
a “23.8 hour day” and would begin crowing
the same time every day, just before dawn.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.960
The lighting didn’t seem to factor in.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.610
Going further, when Yoshimura’s team tried
to trick the birds by randomly exposing them

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.400
to bright lights or loud sounds at various
times, while this did induce some crowing,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.620
they consistently responded more strongly
to the stimuli (crowed more) when it occurred

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.010
around what would normally be dawn.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.500
Yoshimura et al. concluded that the birds
must have an internal body clock that tells

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.560
them when to crow.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
Furthermore, due to the fact that roosters
can’t be tricked into crowing at other times

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.120
of day as strongly as they do around dawn,
the researchers concluded that their “internal

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.130
clocks take precedence over external cues.”

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.110
As for why roosters seem to love to crow in
the mornings, this isn’t fully understood,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.150
but is thought to be tied with the aforementioned
notion of crowing being primarily about announcing

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.110
territory and where a particular rooster sees
itself on the pecking order.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.900
This would also explain why roosters seem
to crow in response to things like the sound

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.210
of cars; they assume that such noises must
be a potential rival and respond in kind.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.020
Similarly, when being given food, the crowing
acts as a way for them to assert that it’s

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.020
their food.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.430
And, of course, in the morning after a good
night’s rest, they are re-announcing to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.120
the world their presence at the first opportunity.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.220
Though it is often portrayed as being a behaviour
exclusively observed in roosters, female chickens

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.150
can and sometimes do crow.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.500
Contrary to popular belief, both a wolf’s
howl and a duck’s quack echo.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.900
(Wolves have even been known to use this to
their advantage when hunting, making it sound

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.520
like there are more wolves around than there
really are.)

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.380
Further, wolves do not howl at the Moon.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.410
This would give away their position and invite
attack from wolves from another pack.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.220
Wolves have even been known to kill their
own young who don’t learn when it’s appropriate

00:04:41.220 --> 00:05:22.370
to howl and when it is not.
