00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:16.345
New research shows that it's definitely better
to make love not war.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:20.795
Hey I'm Carin for DNews and today we've got
a story about the evolution of cooperation.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:25.875
To get a better understanding of this idea,
researchers from Emory University looked at

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.325
spontaneous cooperation in a population of
eleven chimpanzees.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:30.415
Here's what they did.

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:33.745
The chimps were housed in a large outdoor
enclosure.

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:38.825
This kind of complex environment is far different
than the simple setups normally used when

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:44.035
testing social behavior in primates - and
this is significant because it more closely

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:46.935
resembles the chimps' natural setting.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:52.654
Researchers rigged up an experimental apparatus
that required either one or two chimps to

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:57.325
move a barrier while another pulled in a tray
that was baited with food.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:02.475
That meant that the task could not be completed
by one individual alone.

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:06.265
Researchers undertook a large scale set of
observations on how the chimps handled the

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:13.254
task at hand, and they found that they spontaneously
cooperated more than 35-hundred times over

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:15.584
almost a hundred hour-long sessions.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:20.624
Interestingly, it turned out that an individual
chimpanzee was more likely to lend a helping

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:24.385
hand when another chimp of a similar rank
was around.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.334
And it didn't seem to matter to the chimps
whether they were related or not - the most

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.324
important factor was social status.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:36.294
The researchers say this shows that chimps
have a direct preference for cooperating with

00:01:36.294 --> 00:01:42.565
socially tolerant partners - AND they're able
to do this spontaneously in a complex environment.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:46.684
Similar studies have been done before, in
much more controlled settings.

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:52.394
But the high level of cooperation exhibited
in this study wasn't thought to exist in chimps.

00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:57.484
Last week my buddy Trace brought you a story
about how the facial features of human males

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:02.084
may have evolved due to the fact that we hit
each other a lot; however, this week's story

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:05.934
gives us a different perspective on the evolution
of our social behavior.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:11.254
What it tells us is that spontaneous cooperation
between individuals DOES happen in a natural

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:12.254
setting.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:17.085
However, the fact that social rank played
such a large role in whether the chimps cooperated

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:22.975
also tells us that there could easily be violent
clashes between individuals of different social

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.204
status.

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:27.924
Researchers still have a lot more to learn
about the similarities between chimps' and

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:28.924
humans' behavior.

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:33.055
But since they're our closest primate relatives,
this work is still really exciting because

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:37.954
it sheds important light on the evolution
of cooperation in us as well.

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:41.215
So does this study make you feel a little
better about humanity?

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:45.294
Let us know in the comments below and keep
coming back for more DNews every day of the

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:45.424
week.
