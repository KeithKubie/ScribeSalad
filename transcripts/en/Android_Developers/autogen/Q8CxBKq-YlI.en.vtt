00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699
 
so one of the things I've learned as

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709
so one of the things I've learned as
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.470
so one of the things I've learned as
I've been jumping in Android is about

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480
I've been jumping in Android is about
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.910
I've been jumping in Android is about
all of the features that you can really

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
all of the features that you can really
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.440
all of the features that you can really
take advantage of and one of those is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
take advantage of and one of those is
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.720
take advantage of and one of those is
stateful drawables now I've come from a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
stateful drawables now I've come from a
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850
stateful drawables now I've come from a
swing background in Java and so I'm used

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
swing background in Java and so I'm used
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.410
swing background in Java and so I'm used
to okay let's say I have a button on the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
to okay let's say I have a button on the
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.879
to okay let's say I have a button on the
screen and when the user clicks on that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
screen and when the user clicks on that
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.379
screen and when the user clicks on that
button or maybe they mouse over it I

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
button or maybe they mouse over it I
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900
button or maybe they mouse over it I
want that icon to change to maybe an

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
want that icon to change to maybe an
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090
want that icon to change to maybe an
inverted icon I so the way I'd write

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
inverted icon I so the way I'd write
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.380
inverted icon I so the way I'd write
that in swing is you'd write an

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
that in swing is you'd write an
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570
that in swing is you'd write an
onclicklistener or a non mouse over a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
onclicklistener or a non mouse over a
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.220
onclicklistener or a non mouse over a
mouse move listener to watch for those

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
mouse move listener to watch for those
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710
mouse move listener to watch for those
actions and then swap out the image but

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
actions and then swap out the image but
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.910
actions and then swap out the image but
with Android you don't have to write

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
with Android you don't have to write
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.859
with Android you don't have to write
those with stateful drawables you can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
those with stateful drawables you can
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.870
those with stateful drawables you can
have a single image that changes the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
have a single image that changes the
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970
have a single image that changes the
image that changes what it is based on

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
image that changes what it is based on
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340
image that changes what it is based on
the state so I don't have to write that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
the state so I don't have to write that
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.530
the state so I don't have to write that
code as the user moves over something or

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
code as the user moves over something or
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.880
code as the user moves over something or
when they touch something or as they

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
when they touch something or as they
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799
when they touch something or as they
check an item that I that image

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
check an item that I that image
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319
check an item that I that image
automatically changes for me a second

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
automatically changes for me a second
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.610
automatically changes for me a second
thing I've really found valuable is the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
thing I've really found valuable is the
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830
thing I've really found valuable is the
hierarchy viewer I found myself a lot of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
hierarchy viewer I found myself a lot of
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.270
hierarchy viewer I found myself a lot of
times as I'm trying to lay out a view

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
times as I'm trying to lay out a view
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.979
times as I'm trying to lay out a view
and really see how things work on the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
and really see how things work on the
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720
and really see how things work on the
screen that it doesn't look the way I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
screen that it doesn't look the way I
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250
screen that it doesn't look the way I
want it to something's not working out

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
want it to something's not working out
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990
want it to something's not working out
and so many times instead of just

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
and so many times instead of just
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.849
and so many times instead of just
tweaking little changes one at a time to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
tweaking little changes one at a time to
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529
tweaking little changes one at a time to
see you know how can i fix this how can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
see you know how can i fix this how can
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.000
see you know how can i fix this how can
I make this layout work the way I want

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
I make this layout work the way I want
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950
I make this layout work the way I want
it to I can use the higher key viewer to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
it to I can use the higher key viewer to
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870
it to I can use the higher key viewer to
really drill down and see how things are

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880
really drill down and see how things are
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910
really drill down and see how things are
being laid out on the device where the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
being laid out on the device where the
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710
being laid out on the device where the
boundaries of the objects are so that I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
boundaries of the objects are so that I
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330
boundaries of the objects are so that I
can clearly see where things are being

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
can clearly see where things are being
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010
can clearly see where things are being
laid out and how I could reorganize to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
laid out and how I could reorganize to
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690
laid out and how I could reorganize to
solve the problem and fix the view to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
solve the problem and fix the view to
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570
solve the problem and fix the view to
make it the way I want it
