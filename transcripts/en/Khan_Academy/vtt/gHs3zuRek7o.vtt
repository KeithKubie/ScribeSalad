00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:01.825
&gt;&gt;In the last few videos,

00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:04.457
we constructed a marginal
product revenue curve

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:06.677
for our little competitive car wash,

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:08.921
and we essentially figured out

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.648
how this is really just the demand curve

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:14.647
for labor from this firm.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.074
I talked about on the very first video

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:18.977
that if you know the demand curve for,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:19.876
in a certain market,

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:22.526
and this is the market for
labor of a certain kind,

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:23.839
maybe the type of labor that would work

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.062
at a car wash,

00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:26.453
then if you knew it from one firm

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.007
and all of the other firms in the market

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:28.999
for that type of labor,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.421
you could add their demand curves

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.360
to get the entire market demand

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.799
for that type of labor,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.642
for that good or service.

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.342
What I want to do in this
video is to make sure

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:39.715
you understand what it
means to add demand curves.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.045
It's, on one level, straightforward,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.998
but on another level,
a little non-intuitive

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:47.271
because of the ways that
the axes are defined

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:48.600
in economics,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.908
that the price axis is the vertical axis.

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:53.001
Let's draw the demand curve for two firms.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.024
I'll do simplified versions.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.600
I won't use this one right over here.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.692
I'll just do two simplified demand curves.

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.345
This doesn't apply just to labor markets.

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.661
This applies to any demand curve.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.083
If I want to add two demand curves,

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.799
this is one entity's demand,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.040
so this is one firm's demand.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.988
That's price, and this is quantity.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.717
This is quantity.

00:01:13.717 --> 00:01:16.710
Let's say at a price of 10,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.040
they demand nothing,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.713
if that's the hourly wages,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.043
and if the price were 0,

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:24.049
they would essentially get up to

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.060
they would demand 10 people.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.685
And so you have a situation.

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:31.960
You have a demand curve
that would look something,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.048
a demand curve that would
look something like that,

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:35.978
a dot,

00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:37.990
a demand curve that would look like that.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.004
I'll do one other point
on the demand curve.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:44.042
At a price of 5 a
quantity, or $5 per hour,

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.395
this firm would demand,

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.087
if we're thinking of it in terms of labor,

00:01:47.087 --> 00:01:49.060
at a price of $5 per hour of labor,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.607
this firm would demand 5 people per hour.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:54.337
Obviously,

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:56.360
what I'm going to do is
general to any demand curve,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.060
but we'll just keep it
in the labor mindset.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.082
This is Firm 1.

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.044
This is a firm's demand.

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:02.036
Firm 1.

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:03.361
If we're talking about
this as demand for oranges,

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.414
then this wouldn't be a firm.

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:06.910
This would be a consumer
or maybe a wholesaler

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.010
or something like that.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.739
This is Firm 1's demand for labor.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.001
Let's say Firm 2's demand
looks something like this.

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.007
I'll try to align them.

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.052
Firm 2's demand looks something like this.

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:19.951
The axes are going to have
the exact same labels.

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:20.958
This is Quantity.

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.694
This is Price right over here.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.923
This is 5.

00:02:23.923 --> 00:02:25.578
This is 10.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.010
Then this is 15.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.705
Let's say that this is 5,

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.021
and let's say this is 6 right over here.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.387
Their demand curve looks like this.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:38.082
It looks like that.

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:41.036
Let me make it a little bit neater.

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.059
That looks less neat.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.041
It looks something like that.

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:46.040
I could put some extra points here.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.004
At a price of 10,

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.266
this firm will demand 2 units.

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.073
If we're thinking of labor,

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:53.111
$10 per hour,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:55.091
they'll get 2 people per hour.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.975
At a price of 5,

00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:00.001
they will demand 4.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.057
They will demand 4 units.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.033
These are all ...

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.270
We've looked at a couple of points

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.308
on this demand curve.

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:07.307
Now we are ready to add them together.

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:09.734
This is Firm 2,

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:11.539
Firm 2's demand for labor.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.583
Let's add these two curves.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.036
When I said it's unintuitive,

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:15.950
we're actually going to look at ...

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.997
For a given price,

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:20.682
how much total quantity
of labor is now demanded?

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:22.565
We're going to essentially
add it horizontally,

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:23.587
and you're going to see
what I'm talking about

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:25.056
in a second.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.944
When I add them together,

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:28.074
I add them together,

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:31.080
I'm going to have the same axes.

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.995
Let's say this is 5.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:36.601
This is 10.

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:37.885
Actually, let me get a little bit further

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:40.999
on this axis, on this second axis.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.704
The second axis,

00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:44.320
I'll make it as straight as possible.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.913
Let's say that this is 5, 10, 15,

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:50.904
5, 10, 15,

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:54.357
and this is 5, 10, 15.

00:03:54.357 --> 00:03:56.486
I'm doing my best to
align it horizontally,

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.052
that this 15 is this 15,

00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:00.972
that this 10 is with this 10,

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:01.548
is with that 10,

00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:05.031
and that 5 is with that 5 and with that 5.

00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:07.078
At a price of 15 in the market,

00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:09.091
what is the total quantity demanded?

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.402
It's still going to be 0

00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:14.025
because even this firm
is still demanding 0.

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:17.948
But then if we go to a price of 10,

00:04:17.948 --> 00:04:19.032
this firm,

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:20.412
the Firm 1 is demanding 0,

00:04:20.412 --> 00:04:23.066
but Firm 2 over here is demanding 2.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.519
So we're going to go 10.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.034
It's going to be right over there.

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:28.496
This is right about 2.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.608
That distance is right about 2.

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:32.016
Then if we go to 5,

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.686
at a price of 5,

00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:35.461
Firm 1 is going to demand 5.

00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:39.016
Firm 2 is going to
demand 4 units of labor.

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:40.462
At a price of 5,

00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:42.966
you're going to have 5 plus 4.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.035
At a price of 5,

00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:48.990
you're going to have 5
plus 4 or 9 units of labor,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.795
9 units of labor.

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:53.345
Then at a price of 0,

00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:54.183
if labor is free,

00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:55.658
this firm would demand 10 units,

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:57.329
and this firm would demand 6 units.

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:57.736
You add them together,

00:04:57.736 --> 00:04:59.556
you get 16 units.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.585
You'd get 16 units.

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:05.798
The combined demand for labor curve

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:06.981
will look something like ...

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:07.772
I'll do it in ...

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:08.964
or actually, I'll do it in blue.

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:11.398
The combined demand for labor curve

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:12.728
will look like this.

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:14.058
Between $15 and $10,

00:05:14.058 --> 00:05:16.740
only Firm 1 is interested
in getting any labor.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.443
So this part right over here
will look just like that.

00:05:19.443 --> 00:05:20.525
But then after that point,

00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:22.212
you're going to essentially add Firm 1

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:23.096
to the mix,

00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:24.057
and then Firm 1,

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.012
maybe I'll do that part
in a different color,

00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:27.538
it will look something like ...

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.747
it will look something like that.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.985
We have essentially added,

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:35.754
we've horizontally added
this line to this line.

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:37.038
You could imagine taking this line,

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.076
and at any given point,

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.390
so at 5 right over here,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.042
you're taking its value and quantity

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:42.979
and adding to this quantity here.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.002
The reason why I said this is
a little bit nonintuitive is

00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:47.781
this would have been easier
at least for me to add

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.043
with the background of
the traditional algebraic

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:51.752
conventions we're used to.

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:54.668
We're used to adding vertically.

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:55.965
If we were to flip price and quantity,

00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:58.189
then we could stack these
on top of each other

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.027
and add them vertically.

00:05:59.027 --> 00:06:00.731
That's why it's a little nonintuitive.

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:01.769
But hopefully, this makes sense.

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:03.976
We're just looking at each
of their demand curves

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:05.721
at any given price,

00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.451
and we're saying,

00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:08.000
"OK, what is the demand from Firm 2?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.252
"What is the demand from Firm 1?"

00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:10.535
and we're adding them together,

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:11.884
and then we get this.

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:14.945
We get this combined market demand curve,

00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:17.097
Firm 1 plus Firm 2.
