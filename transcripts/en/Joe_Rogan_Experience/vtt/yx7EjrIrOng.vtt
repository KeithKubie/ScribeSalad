1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Done done. Done. Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.250
one of the greats. Jim Gafcon. Hi Sir. Thank you. Thank you.

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.840
It's great to be here. Great to see you, man.

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm excited that you're doing a special on Amazon. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.490
I think it's important that there's a,

6
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:18.120
a bunch of other platforms for all of us to do specials on.

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.680
And when a guy like you goes over to Amazon legitimizes it. Makes it a big deal.

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
It's exciting. Yeah. It's uh, it's fascinating how the,

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.850
the outlets for specials has changed so dramatically because when we were,

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.390
when we were kids it was just HBO. Yep.

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.190
And then comedy central when, uh,

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.990
our release beyond the Pale, it was at that perfect moment where, uh,

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.120
in every dorm room in America, comedy central was on. Yup. You know,

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.820
it had shifted from MTV to come to central probably cause of Chappelle and,

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
and John Stewart. And so, but it shifts, you know,

16
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.620
it's like the Netflix was big and um,

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.560
and we see these other platforms coming out. So it'll be,

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.260
it'll be interesting if I can convince people,

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.800
cause everyone goes to Amazon or someone in their family does.

20
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:17.811
So if I can convince them the next time they're buying paper towels and socks to

21
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:22.070
just go over to prime because they, everyone has a prime membership.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.900
That's the weird part about it. Right? It's like, it's shopping,

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.120
but it's also like the same as iTunes. It, yeah. People have asked me,

24
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.390
they're like, what if, uh, you know, one person asked me, they were like,

25
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.120
what if someone doesn't have a prime membership? And I'm like,

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.300
then they're probably not on the internet, you know, who are you? Right.

27
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.230
They probably can't afford even a, you know, high speed Internet.

28
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.370
So it's like, but I don't know. It is going to be interesting.

29
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.030
I've watched stuff on prime, but it's like,

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.190
it's like every time you, you know, I think comedians, we like the,

31
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.140
we like to explore and do things different. You know, even, you know,

32
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.860
new rooms and stuff like that. We, we kind of are risk averse,

33
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:09.240
but there is always the possibility of like, I don't know,

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.330
I mean it comes out Friday. Um,

35
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.410
there is some support, but I don't know.

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.930
And I know that Amazon is this enormous company, but I don't know. I don't know.

37
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.720
They could, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, you know,

38
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.540
my special is really not that big.

39
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.050
It's not as important as the toothpicks they sell on Amazon.

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.470
So I don't know if they're going to get behind it or not.

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.310
It's so weird that it's an entertainment company and also a massive shopping

42
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.520
outlet. I mean, it's huge. It's two giant things.

43
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.650
But they do support like Mrs Meson. Oh yeah. That everywhere. Yeah.

44
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.880
So if they have a hit, they will get behind it and make billboards and,

45
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:54.000
and I've see a lot for a fleabag as well.

46
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.980
I've seen a bunch of ads for that,

47
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.010
so I think they're really picking up their support.

48
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.310
But I haven't seen any support

49
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.250
<v 1>so far for how many specials are there that they've done besides your,</v>

50
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.300
yours comes out Friday. Mine comes out Friday and then, uh,

51
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.750
a week later there's four that come out

52
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.280
[inaudible] boat and has one coming down for sure. And, uh,

53
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.470
there's three other people with him. And then, um, I don't know. They, you know,

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.150
there's also something of, uh, you know, the, the free,

55
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.730
the flow of information is an as,

56
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.650
as dynamic as you'd imagine. Cause I'm like a nerd for like,

57
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.930
if people follow me on Instagram, they're probably like, yeah,

58
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.120
we know you promote. So it's like,

59
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.590
I'm not shy about saying I'm coming to Atlantic City and, uh,

60
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.130
so I'm like, Hey, when is this going? You know, what do you, how can I help?

61
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.250
And there to like, uh, there's a little bit of an attitude of like,

62
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.590
we've got it, you know what I mean?

63
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.000
We know all the information there is, or they don't care,

64
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.530
but I'm not sure. Yeah, I think they're probably overwhelmed. Right.

65
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.100
It's probably a new thing or they just, you know,

66
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:08.101
some of how it was explained to me was I released a no belay my special before

67
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.770
this, uh, independently, you know, through a lot of different plants.

68
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.740
Why did you decide to do that? Well, some of it was,

69
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:22.180
I got an offer that was attractive. Uh, I knew that,

70
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.450
I mean, I, I love Netflix. I have five specialists there. Uh,

71
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.500
but I kind of looked at Netflix,

72
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:34.030
I always described it as it's a, it's a swimming pool. Swimming pools are great,

73
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.980
you know, a special having a special is kind of like a floaty,

74
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.330
but like Netflix, there were just hundreds of floaties in this,

75
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.040
in this pool. So how do you know people are going to watch yours?

76
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.990
You get like a week at Netflix, uh, for, for accessibility.

77
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:57.580
And I also thought that, uh, it would have a greater impact internationally.

78
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:01.030
I don't think it did for me personally. Um, and,

79
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.640
and it was something to try differently. You know,

80
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.910
it's weird to is you never really know what the numbers are. No,

81
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.550
you don't know them, they don't tell you, you don't know the numbers.

82
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:12.750
And it also shifts like, so like the,

83
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:17.751
the great success that Segura and Allie Wong had.

84
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.930
And you know, like we're Comedians,

85
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.400
we watch all of the specials on Netflix.

86
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.460
I mean, whether we watched the whole thing is another thing, right?

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.880
That's like with Ted Alexandro and I were always like, I'm like,

88
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.670
did you watch it? And he goes, I 10 minutes. Did you watch that?

89
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.400
It's like the best compliment is I watched the whole thing.

90
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.000
I watched Chris Rock's whole special, you know, and um,

91
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.100
so I wanted to do something different, you know, I was offered, uh,

92
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.820
and it's, it's, you know, it's uh, you know,

93
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:53.821
it's expanding your audience and I also understood that a lot of people consume

94
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.250
things on demand. Like I have young

95
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>kids, so I'm just, I'm still buying on iTunes. Like it's 1981,</v>

96
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.980
you know, and people consume things on demand. I was convinced on that.

97
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.380
And so it went a,

98
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.060
we did this kind of like everywhere button at flicks and then there was a second

99
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:19.061
window that was on Amazon prime and it got a real,

100
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.790
a lot of viewers.

101
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.980
And so that prompted Amazon to approach for this special.

102
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.220
So independently, when you released your last one,

103
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.590
did it like a production company come to you and say, Hey Jim,

104
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.430
this is what we want it. Yeah, it was comedy dynamics. And they were like,

105
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.540
we're going, we're going to distribute it, we're going to sell it piecemeal,

106
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.000
different places. And so I was like, yeah, you know what I wanted on, uh,

107
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.750
airplanes and I, you know, I have net flexed but not everyone has Netflix.

108
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.920
And also, you know, the swimming pool metaphor, it can get Kinda lost in there.

109
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.480
So yours was available on Apple TV? He was available on everything.

110
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.000
It was on available on everywhere. Yeah.

111
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.500
And it was even in theaters to get a sense of the numbers from them. Oh yeah,

112
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.980
definitely.

113
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.100
So the Netflix is the only one doesn't give you the numbers that yeah,

114
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.340
supposedly Amazon will give the numbers. Supposedly.

115
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.020
I think they would you gotta get in a room with them. I think that they, um,

116
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.940
you know, it's, it's gonna be so interesting cause I have no idea.

117
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.950
But I also, you know, just as how we consume specials has changed.

118
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.210
I think that, uh, you know, getting,

119
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:36.620
I think specials serve almost the very personal for us. Right. By the way,

120
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.770
your last one was great. Thanks. But it's very personal for us,

121
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:44.771
but it also indirectly serves as like an infomercial for our sense of

122
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.430
sensibility. So it's like you want other people to see it so that they can go,

123
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.780
yeah, I liked this kind of stuff.

124
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.380
And so the appeal of it being in different places was appealing to me.

125
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.120
Yeah. I liked the idea of it too. I mean,

126
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.560
I really do enjoy that Netflix has gotten so big in the standup specials because

127
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.770
they've given so many people opportunities and expose the world to so many great

128
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.560
comics. I don't like the fact they don't give me the numbers.

129
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.070
That's a long ongoing, but I do like the fact there's other options now.

130
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.640
I think it's great. And I think, look, HBO now has a streaming option. You know,

131
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.390
they're trying to get really behind HBO go and hopefully more people do that.

132
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.110
So HBO specials will be what they used to be used to be.

133
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:27.830
If someone got an HBO special, like Holy Shit, it would transform their lives.

134
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.491
Oh my God.

135
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.540
Like Kennison and all these different people we found out about them because of

136
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.260
the HBO. Yeah. I think it's, it's going to be interesting. I think that,

137
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.720
uh, you know, seeing what Disney plus does and seeing, uh, you know,

138
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.260
HBO Max and Apple, but it's, I had, I had approached, um,

139
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.190
Amazon back, I think with my special obsessed,

140
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.000
I wanted to do it on Amazon. They had prime at that point and I was like,

141
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.900
I'll give it, you give me this amount of money and you guys own the special.

142
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.940
And they're like, at that point, they weren't, you know, there,

143
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:06.630
there were a packaged goods company, they're like, no,

144
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.390
we'll give you 6 cents for every view. And I'm like, no, no, no.

145
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.380
You don't understand.

146
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.330
I'm going to drive people to amazon.com. And they're like,

147
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.680
Nah, we're not interested, but, so it'll take some time. So yeah. You know,

148
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.090
we might think that apple and Disney will step up immediately for comedy

149
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.750
specialists, but we don't know. We don't know.

150
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.560
I think in the future there's not going to be anything on live television except

151
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.170
sports. I really, oh yeah.

152
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.410
I definitely TV like the idea of like tuning in at eight o'clock on Tuesday

153
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.310
night and I was the only time to see something. Yeah,

154
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.180
no appointment television is absurd.

155
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.320
That's a great way of putting in appointment television. It's just, it's insane.

156
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.160
Yeah. No Lee's date. And that's one of the other great things about Netflix.

157
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.150
Like when stranger things comes out, you get the whole damn season. Yeah. Yeah,

158
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.990
definitely.

159
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.280
And so like the bingeing thing is really,

160
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.820
it's absurd. Like there's, there's gotta be some consequences of that.

161
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.960
Cause yeah, it's unhealthy. We're just not getting enough sleep. Now,

162
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.340
this life friend of mine,

163
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.630
she told me that she was up watching stranger things till six o'clock in the

164
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:16.500
morning. She had to get up at 10 to take your kid to school. Yeah.

165
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.400
It's just theirs. And we binge it like,

166
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.200
like there's some reason behind it. There's dress convenience.

167
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:27.500
Just get obsessed. I want to find out what's next. Oh yeah.

168
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.720
They left me hanging next. And you're like one more just one.

169
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.970
And those suckers that would wait. You know, like a,

170
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.650
we have my family, I don't want to sound too macho,

171
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:40.230
but we watched Jane the Virgin, cause my, uh,

172
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.130
teenage daughter was really into it. So as a family we watched Jane the Virgin.

173
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.550
I don't even know what that is. It's a TV show. It's amazing. And it's, I mean,

174
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.270
it's one of those things where my family would be watched again and I would come

175
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.290
in and I would kind of criticize it and then after like two episodes,

176
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.840
I was like, move over. It's totally, it's a telanovela.

177
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.320
It's about Hispanic culture. It's, it's great. [inaudible] Virgin, what's it on?

178
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.790
Great performances. It was on the CW. I don't,

179
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.930
I feel like in my adult lifetime,

180
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:14.931
the CW appeared and I still have never watched this show on the CW.

181
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.560
Like, have you ever watched the show on the CW? I don't believe so. Right.

182
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.580
It's a real network. Yeah. But it's like be, yeah,

183
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.140
I think the WB was, I think the CW is [inaudible]. Right.

184
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.990
There was a few of those little fringe networks way back in the day.

185
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.010
Like I remember the Wayans brothers had a TV show on one of them. Yeah. There's,

186
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.060
it's one of those weird networks that was, I think it was owned by CBS,

187
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:43.980
but they're like, it's just kind of like, uh, uh,

188
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.270
you know, like it would be teen shows, like teen romance shows.

189
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.910
And you liked this show, Jane the Virgin. I liked it. I liked,

190
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.780
you know, I'm not ashamed to say it.

191
00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:01.150
I feel like if I asked myself six months ago would I be on Joe Rogan's podcast

192
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.910
saying that I like Jane the Virgin? I would say no, of course not.

193
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.630
Well I remember when, you know,

194
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.350
people used to think that being on one of those networks wouldn't do you any

195
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.150
good when those little small networks,

196
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.740
but then true TV put on impractical jokers and those guys are selling out

197
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:22.510
arenas. Amazing. That fucking show is so crazy popular.

198
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.220
It's, you know,

199
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:28.280
it's fascinating watching that show because I, you know,

200
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.210
you're trying to understand it because, but I think it's the authenticity. Yeah.

201
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:36.340
Those guys, they're pals and it's not manufactured. Right. And,

202
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.840
and I think people like that. Yes. It's very appealing. You're like, you know,

203
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.690
and I think that's also like real guys.

204
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:49.230
I think there is so much beautiful people that we consume so,

205
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:54.820
so much beautiful people that were shocked when we see a regular looking person,

206
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.530
we're like, wait a minute, what did that person, that person must be a bad guy.

207
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.060
I used to have a joke about them.

208
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.480
They seem like you could hang out with them too if they seem like regular guys

209
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.530
that would be fun to hang out with. It's like, oh, I want to be with them. No,

210
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:13.030
look, when I first heard the premise I was like, oh this is, but by the way,

211
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.800
it's been going on for a while,

212
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.830
quite awhile and I was doing shows in London and we have the same agent and they

213
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:24.370
were doing an arena three nights in a row and London.

214
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.720
It's crazy. Crazy. It's amazing. Like who the fuck saw that come in?

215
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:30.370
When I heard about it from Ari Arusha,

216
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.620
fear was telling me that these guys were selling out theaters. I was like,

217
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:35.080
really? I'm like, God, that's incredible. I go, how big?

218
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:37.750
They were like 5,000 people. I was like, what? Yeah,

219
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.390
what and that was years ago. Now it's, they've moved to arenas. Yeah. And,

220
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.970
and they just keep going and they have like a whole multimedia show. Right.

221
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.610
Let's show videos and all kinds of crazy shit. And they interact with it.

222
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:51.800
And they're also like, they're still the same guys. Yes.

223
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.170
So they were always those guys. Yeah.

224
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.340
It wasn't like a some cute boy who's trying to act like he's one of the guys.

225
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.120
Right. Look, a record company produced boy band. Yeah, yeah. No,

226
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:04.810
that's who they are.

227
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.130
Well that's probably why it resonates with people because it is authentic.

228
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.630
I think authenticity is really important.

229
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.820
I think that's what people like about,

230
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.540
I think that's the success of this podcast is the authenticity.

231
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:26.590
That it's not pre-packaged. There isn't, um, like, I mean,

232
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.000
people that you should understand, it's like even it's, it's a,

233
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:33.190
it's a weird thing. I don't know.

234
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:34.630
I don't know if you want to talk about this or,

235
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.210
and that's why I won't talk about that. It's a weird thing to me.

236
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.060
It's an I do it, but like did you,

237
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.120
cause I did this back when it was at um,

238
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.050
the ice house and it's like, oh,

239
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.000
it's amazing. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. It's pretty, yeah. With

240
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.090
<v 2>the fucks all that are coming. I didn't see it coming. Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.210
<v 1>It's like it's a perfect example of doing something on your terms and it working</v>

242
00:14:59.211 --> 00:14:59.740
out.

243
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.390
<v 2>Yeah, for sure. And also zero promotion of it. I'd never promoted it at all.</v>

244
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.980
I never did any television shows to promote or took out any ads or did other

245
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:12.190
people's podcast to let people know about it. I just kept doing it.

246
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.430
Always felt like, let me just keep doing it. I enjoyed doing it.

247
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:19.570
Just keep doing it. And it totally, 100% built by word of mouth.

248
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.400
<v 1>And so w articles that are written about it, do you read those or no. No.</v>

249
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.630
Nothing. I don't think it's wise because also like,

250
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.370
even generally when there are articles written about Comedians,

251
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.760
uh, you're kind of, there's always like, all right,

252
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:38.000
let's see what this half day of research,

253
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.090
how they interpret it. I mean, I remember in their body of work in the 90s,

254
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.480
there would be like New York magazine would be like d end of standup con and

255
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.790
you'd read the article and you're like, crowns, I guess. Oh,

256
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:54.020
they followed that person. They don't even really even do stand up. Uh, um,

257
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.690
so it is, there is no point behind it,

258
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:02.050
but I'm just kind of a sucker for trying to understand where the zeitgeists is

259
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.040
trying to steer things. But in the end, I think comedy, you know,

260
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:10.760
Seinfeld describes it as like, it all comes down to butts and seats,

261
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.530
butts in seats. Like they can kind of promote, uh, you know,

262
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:18.800
like the new best thing. But you know,

263
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:22.370
those people show up to shows. They, you know,

264
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:23.990
they're not told where to go.

265
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.670
<v 2>I think what's also important to note is that the,</v>

266
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.810
is no longer being controlled by media. Like you,

267
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:34.510
you can't an article in Newsweek or uh,

268
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.400
on a website or, uh, some youtube piece. It doesn't define things anymore.

269
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.530
The, the landscape is too big.

270
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:47.130
Not No media outlet has any sort of monopoly on how to define someone or

271
00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:52.690
something that the people decide. Now. It's really a meritocracy in that way.

272
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.570
If you, if you have something that's good,

273
00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:59.530
people find out about it and they like it and you can write all your hit pieces

274
00:16:59.531 --> 00:17:03.100
that you want, they don't work anymore. It doesn't work. You know, you'll,

275
00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:05.830
you'll change a few people's minds cause they'll buy into it.

276
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:08.440
But then if they investigate themselves like, oh,

277
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:11.530
you're a piece of shit journalists, this is a terrible article about something.

278
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.660
It's,

279
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.860
<v 1>you know, but I sometimes think, well, like I have two theories on this one.</v>

280
00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:20.880
I sometimes think, was it always like this and I didn't see it?

281
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:22.380
Or here's my other theory.

282
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.300
My other theory is that in the collapse of traditional media,

283
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.220
meaning the collapse of newspapers and, and just, you know,

284
00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:35.880
television news bureaus that there,

285
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.890
because there's no money to pay, uh,

286
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.370
someone to be, say like a, a movie review. My Wa, my, uh,

287
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.480
father-in-law is,

288
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.010
he used to write movie reviews in Milwaukee and he would review movies and that

289
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v 0>was his job.</v>

290
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:56.270
And that job is really only present in,

291
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.620
in very rare situations.

292
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.890
Otherwise it's just the opportunity of someone that does it out of a passion

293
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.720
thing, meaning someone who has a blog or it's someone who is,

294
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.710
doesn't need a financial incentive. So in other words, they're like,

295
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.420
you've got 50 bucks to write a review of this thing or so it ends up not being

296
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.360
close to objective. Does that make sense? Yeah, no it does.

297
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.960
And I think if you're going to really study something, like if you,

298
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.410
if you want to know about a person, you know,

299
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.620
say if it's a politician or you know,

300
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.470
an actor or comic or whoever you're writing about,

301
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.490
the idea that you're going to figure them out with just a few hours of Google

302
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.730
searching is kinda crazy. It's absolutely crazy.

303
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.100
And the rushes to define someone in either very flattering or very unflattering

304
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:53.060
ways that this,

305
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.330
that's really where most of the energy goes.

306
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.160
Most of the stories are either hit pieces or they're fluff pieces that seem to

307
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:04.770
be propped up by a publicist. Yet there is,

308
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.780
I feel as though like I did this movie that came out, um,

309
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.290
it was just a small indie comedy where I was a guy, uh,

310
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.960
who had two separate families and they didn't know about each other.

311
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.580
So it's like he's a good guy now, but he had two families and it's a comedy.

312
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.280
It's set in the 90s. And you know, the,

313
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:31.830
the reviews that didn't like the movie, that didn't surprise me, you know,

314
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:33.120
or the criticisms,

315
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.680
but like a lot of the reviews were kind of,

316
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.810
um, there was a tone of like,

317
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:45.110
how dare this white male have to felt like they couldn't get beyond.

318
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.400
Like, it wasn't like they would insert like, uh,

319
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.890
a social commentary, uh,

320
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.480
onto a platform that was not for that. Yeah. Do you remain like it was,

321
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.760
there was, there was a portrayal of, and there were great female actor,

322
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.800
uh, actors that played my wives and there, there was some reviews there,

323
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.810
like bay under served them. And it's like, you know,

324
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.640
the movie was really about my character and his son, you know, and, but like,

325
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:21.870
people were frustrated about story. But because of the day we live in,

326
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.540
it had to be kind of deciphered through this,

327
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.290
uh, kind of social, uh,

328
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.060
critique that is just absurd and it wasn't here and there,

329
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.210
it was a lot of reviews like that. Well,

330
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:41.880
they feel like there's an obligation to discuss that now too,

331
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.400
if they feel like there's some sort of an imbalanced sexually,

332
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.640
like between genders on, on a, on a television show or, or intersectionality.

333
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:49.511
It's a,

334
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:54.310
if it has some to do with race or gender or politics or they feel like this is

335
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.660
something that must be discussed.

336
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.300
And one of the things that I hear from friends that, that are,

337
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.090
that are very frustrated is that when they pitch shows,

338
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.300
when they pitch shows to the network, if they have a story, an idea,

339
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.910
like this is what we're trying to, this is the thing. They're like, okay,

340
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:09.760
where's the diversity? Yeah. I was like, one of the first questions,

341
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.940
they're like, well, it's about an Irish family that lives in the box. Like,

342
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:16.510
I don't know what to tell you. You know, it's, this is what the story's about.

343
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.740
Like, well, where's the diversity?

344
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.130
Like you have to insert diversity to meet their criteria.

345
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.660
Like you can't just have a,

346
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.410
you can have a story as long as the person's like,

347
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.450
you could have a story about an h,

348
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.980
a Haitian family and it just be all about the Haitian family.

349
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.690
No one's going to say, well what about white guys?

350
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.510
We need to get some white guy on the show. No,

351
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.420
cause if you inserted the white guys, then it's the white savior story.

352
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.540
So you can't be the white guy. Yeah, yeah.

353
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.310
I just can't wait until we're done with all this. I mean maybe,

354
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.110
maybe it'll be long after we're done wet long after we're dead,

355
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.280
but when there's no more racism and this is no longer a viable storyline and

356
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.650
they'd like, no one gives a fuck if you're Chinese or India or from Pakistan,

357
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.240
we legitimately don't care.

358
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:58.210
They're just different varieties of people and there's no judgment whatsoever.

359
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.370
I can't wait for that time. But until then,

360
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:04.600
we just have to deal with these observed people that pedal in this narrative

361
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.490
that you have to have, you know, x amount of what?

362
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.010
Like I was reading something where someone was saying that I should run for,

363
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.770
uh, I should, uh, moderate the presidential debates about NBA man,

364
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.730
someone's, it's never gonna happen to them all smoked pot before.

365
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.050
Sure isn't ever going to happen. But someone said,

366
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.410
why do that when you can give it to a talented black woman? I'm like, okay,

367
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.790
I'm out. We're out. We're not talking to, by the way, here's the thing. If,

368
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.110
and I think you'd agree with me,

369
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.340
I do think there's an imbalance and we do have to correct it.

370
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.550
And I do think that like, uh, you know,

371
00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:42.640
and it's great that we have the knowledge and the foresight,

372
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.590
but humans were just clumsy. Yeah. We're just clumsy, you know, with,

373
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.150
um, you know, we're just like, oh, let's just stick this here. When,

374
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.890
when, you know, creativity is much more complex than that. Like even,

375
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.010
even any comedian, we could have Cara top here.

376
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.550
There's a nuance on every joke he does. Like,

377
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:06.610
people can sit there and be dismissive, but like, he's like, you know what,

378
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:10.360
I can't do that joke before I do this joke. Whereas people just think it's like,

379
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:13.810
no, just stick this in there, stick it speech in there.

380
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.910
But I almost feel it's like when greenbook one, cause I saw it after the fact.

381
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.560
I was like, cause you know, like there's this, this belief of, Oh, you know,

382
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.060
you, if you play a a disabled person, you win. And,

383
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.040
but it's much more of like that movie winning was like, Oh yeah, you know,

384
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:37.510
it's, it's, you know, the great crime of America and race.

385
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.560
So it brings that up. It also deals with, uh, you know, uh,

386
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.820
homosexuality and like the struggle of that, which is profound.

387
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:51.500
I can't even contemplate it. But it's like, that's why the movie won.

388
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.870
And it was also, we love Italians. America loves that. You get to talk.

389
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.310
Lacey, who doesn't love that America loves Italians. They love Boston.

390
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.250
And you know, that's, you know, that's,

391
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.540
there's certain things that America loves. So I was like, oh, that's why at one,

392
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.930
I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I'm not saying Vivio wasn't great.

393
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.980
I'm just saying that's why I won. Yeah. And it's weird.

394
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.590
It is a little weird. But on the other hand,

395
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.790
one way to look at it is the like design the idea that there can be no darkness

396
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:24.500
without light, right? There can be no,

397
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.950
there can be no real appreciation of true diversity without an understanding of

398
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:35.450
racism like in it to, to have it around in its ugliest form.

399
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.960
It makes you appreciate the people that don't express that, that aren't racist,

400
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:43.550
that are just even keeled. People that appreciate everybody. Well, you know,

401
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:48.280
there, there's, there's also this too is that, you know, um,

402
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.330
I tend to lean left, um, pretty uh,

403
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.050
liberal socially and um, but I, and you know,

404
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.360
when Trump was elected and like there was the women's march and all this stuff,

405
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.100
there was this, I had this thought process of like, how do I,

406
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.760
how do I, you know, content, how can I contribute?

407
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.980
How can I help make this country better? Which is sounds grandiose, which it is,

408
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.670
but the thing is, it's like I'm not changing anyone's mind.

409
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.390
I really believe that it's like, and if anything,

410
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:28.391
I think at my shows it's like people are kind of like a break from it.

411
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.020
Yes. You're, I mean like it's, we're all thinking about it all the time.

412
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.830
They're like, all right, there's a a tariff, a Chinese tariff.

413
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:38.000
What does that mean? I don't know.

414
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:42.440
What that means is that our American farmers destroyed what's going on,

415
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.090
but like when they come to my show, they don't want me to rehash it. Yes. Yeah.

416
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:47.241
No,

417
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.900
I think that's one of the keys to your success is that you provide a vacation,

418
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.790
fun, silly, well-thought-out, comedically, brilliant,

419
00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.800
sort of vacation from the also pointing out that humans are,

420
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.280
we're absurd. We're stupid. We are so stupid.

421
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.820
Like we just think humans think we have every generation.

422
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:11.480
We think we have it figured out. Yeah. That's like the, the,

423
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.650
the sharedness of people makes me concerned. Like,

424
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.770
you know, there were people at a time that were like,

425
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.720
here's how we serve the how.

426
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.720
Here's how we solve the flow is we're going to put these layers on. People.

427
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.670
Trust me, it's working. Like they, they were convinced that would work.

428
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.190
Yeah. Yeah. It makes me wonder like, what,

429
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.820
how we're going to view this generation a hundred years from now or 200 years

430
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:37.090
from now. Oh, it's going to be fat. I mean, I've got,

431
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.050
I've got a 15 year old who, uh, is so,

432
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.190
uh, my children are, they're

433
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.480
<v 1>so fascinating. And you live in New York City? I live in New York City. Yeah.</v>

434
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:49.830
Which is crazy. I, I was,

435
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.950
we talked about this a long time ago that that's a wild place to raise kids.

436
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:58.260
Is it, I don't know. I don't mean, I feel like there is,

437
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:05.190
um, there is socio economic, uh, cultural,

438
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.380
more diversity. My kids walking to a subway station. Sure.

439
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.900
Then if we lived in the suburbs preacher, um, and uh, yeah.

440
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:20.340
You know, it's, you know, they don't have a yard, but like, I'm kind of like,

441
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.620
I dunno, it seems like people that have yards,

442
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:27.450
they're like paranoid about their kids getting snatched anyway. So, uh,

443
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.380
but I dunno. It's what I also, you know,

444
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:35.340
I feel like there's a lot of convenience in New York that I like and I also,

445
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.790
to be perfectly honest, it's like in La,

446
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:44.390
I feel like I feel kind of smothered by the entertainment industry and maybe

447
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.850
it's my insecurity, but it's like, no, I think you're right.

448
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.680
There's like you drive down the street,

449
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.980
they're selling these billboards and each of those billboards is saying you're a

450
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:56.250
failure. Look at this person, this person,

451
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.720
this is their fifth show where they're going to get an Emmy nomination and

452
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:04.290
people don't even know your name. Yeah. You know, so it's,

453
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.330
I mean obviously just fate had it where I stayed in New York because there's

454
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:10.840
plenty of reasons to live in Atlanta.

455
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.850
<v 2>Foremost, you're a comic, you always recognized as a comic,</v>

456
00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:17.810
but you do a lot of other things as well. But like being a,

457
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.240
you do a lot of other movies and television shows and stuff,

458
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.400
but being in New York City,

459
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.510
I think in some ways you get the best of both worlds because you get in many

460
00:28:26.511 --> 00:28:29.390
clubs to perform in many clubs to practice in.

461
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.720
But you also don't get that sort of scrutiny of the the agents and the managers

462
00:28:34.971 --> 00:28:37.520
in the entertainment industry, so you can work on your shit.

463
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.750
And then on top of that, you're not surrounded by the business. Right. You're,

464
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.300
you're around fucking regular folks just hustling and doing your thing. Man,

465
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.120
I'm traveling

466
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.510
<v 1>blink constantly too. So it's, but there is, yeah, I just like do it. I mean,</v>

467
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:55.260
here's where I think I'm doing the doing it wrong or doing it right.

468
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.580
It's like I just care about good stage time,

469
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.570
quality stage time. Whereas I think, uh,

470
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.210
you know, even, you know,

471
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:09.030
like I don't work at the cellar in New York City and that's, you know,

472
00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:10.620
some of that goes back history,

473
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:15.621
but like some of it is I just want stage time and I can eat dinner with my kids,

474
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:21.180
put some of them to bed and decide to do a spot, go do the spot,

475
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:25.290
come back and wrangle my two other kids to get to sleep.

476
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.150
Whereas, uh,

477
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.500
if I went to the seller or if I had to make the journey,

478
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:35.130
the drive in La, it would be a different commitment.

479
00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.730
Let's think about the seller that makes it more difficult. Well, you know,

480
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:42.880
some of it is his peers and friends. Like I don't like the idea,

481
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:48.640
you know, the hierarchy of, I always kind of get, you know,

482
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:52.840
a little bit. Look, I'm just kind of like, I just want to do, stand up.

483
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.180
I just want to do it. Uh,

484
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:59.390
I spent a lot of time hanging out in comedy clubs and some of it is like in at

485
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:03.990
the cellar. I don't want to bump some of my friends that I started with. Right.

486
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.250
And I also don't want to get bumped by somebody else. It's like I, you know,

487
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.850
I, you know, I'm not gonna abuse doing a set,

488
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:16.420
but I'll go in and I'll do 15 minutes and want disrupt anyone's night.

489
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.860
But I also know that at the cellar, you, you know,

490
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.940
there's going to be people that show up.

491
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.020
Sometimes there's a pack of three or four people that are going to do sets and

492
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:30.250
everyone's kind of off, uh, for that night. But also it's,

493
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.500
you know, it goes back like 20 years ago. I'm a low energy kind of comedian and,

494
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.690
uh, it used to, you know,

495
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:41.320
I used to put in avails at the cellar and it would kind of determine,

496
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.820
I would get, you know,

497
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:46.840
like you get a spot Wednesday at 1:00 AM and so like,

498
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:50.500
I would be bummed for the week. So I don't want to,

499
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.490
I don't want to give my power away in know situation. I just want to do,

500
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:59.330
stand up or just do [inaudible] gossip. Yeah. And, and also great.

501
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.850
And I, and I, look, I love this Heller, but I feel like that's also, uh, the,

502
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:06.580
the layout of the room is far more interactive,

503
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:11.370
whereas I want to try out material. Um, but I dunno,

504
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.320
it's shift. It's shifted because the seller is,

505
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.820
it's a great club with a great complex. I mean there's three rooms,

506
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.190
so, but some of it is,

507
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:26.250
I'm now at the point where I just wanna do one set and I also don't want to,

508
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:29.920
like, I don't want a friend like Todd Barry looking at me like,

509
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.790
you're bumping me dry man. Do you call in or do you just show up? I call in,

510
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.350
so I'll call, but sometimes I'll decide at like eight,

511
00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:43.330
10 I'll call Gotham and I'll go, is that okay if I come in and they'll say,

512
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:43.960
yes,

513
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.400
it's better if you come in at eight 40 or nine 10 just so that I don't screw

514
00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:52.210
anyone up. And then, you know, but like a Gotham Seinfeld always goes there too.

515
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:55.150
So it's like, I'm like, I got to get there before Jerry.

516
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.880
<v 2>Well, that's the beautiful thing about a big city like New York,</v>

517
00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:02.010
particularly about New York. There's so many different options.

518
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:06.390
Like in Los Angeles, we really only have the comedy store, the Improv,

519
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.570
the laugh factory, and then the, there's a few on the outskirts,

520
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.680
but New York City has so many more options. It's amazing

521
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.740
<v 1>the transformation the comedy store has gone through. Yeah.</v>

522
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.753
Look it is the,

523
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.260
I would say it's probably one of the most important clubs in the country beyond

524
00:32:25.261 --> 00:32:28.230
a doubt. Maybe I'm thinking it's like up there,

525
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.910
right as like the sure fire thing. If you're an audience member,

526
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.090
you go to the store, you're going to see a great show,

527
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.950
but like 15 years ago, I don't know if that was case. No,

528
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.720
<v 0>no, it wasn't the case in 2008 yeah,</v>

529
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.490
it was [inaudible] who was responsible cause that that comes down to management.

530
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.040
That has a lot to do with it. It also the Internet,

531
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.820
a lot of us talking about how great the comedy store is also getting rid of the

532
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:58.070
old management, firing them. Right.

533
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.790
They found the old guy was running the place was stealing money and they fired

534
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.860
him. If there's, how many is a piece of shit. Anyway,

535
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:06.670
it was just so many stories where it's like,

536
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.010
and then it was revealed they were stealing and you're like, yeah, no, they,

537
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.030
they, they did a sting operation and caught him stealing money. Oh yeah.

538
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.670
It was bad guy. But just running the place poorly too.

539
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.990
And he was the reason why I was in there for seven years. Yeah. Yeah.

540
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So I came back and you know all the talking about the store with comics on

541
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:28.730
podcast to get people so excited about it and then you'd look at the line up

542
00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:30.950
like on a Tuesday night. It's just a murderer's row.

543
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.440
And also those rooms are great.

544
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.940
[inaudible] layout of the rooms are like great for performing.

545
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.350
They're not kinda like this, you know, like I love Zany sense Chicago,

546
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:43.160
but it's like,

547
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.500
it's not like the stage is three feet higher than the audience is.

548
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.140
It's almost perfectly designed and laid out. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

549
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:53.330
You don't want to be above like the, the store,

550
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:56.750
like the original room is probably the best room in the world to figure out if

551
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.210
your jokes are any good. Yeah. Cause if,

552
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.300
if you have any weird fat in your material or just extra words or fakeness or it

553
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.550
just gets exposed in that room. Yeah. I love,

554
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.930
I love going to different places and I call it purifying a joke.

555
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.960
Are you doing spot tonight? Anywhere now? I'm a probably not. Come on down.

556
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.860
I'm an old man. Get the fuck Outta here. You're going there? Yeah. Alright.

557
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.570
Maybe I'll go. I'm up at nine 30 all right, I'll go. I'll get up here.

558
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:28.430
I'm going to go and pump you up. I'll call in for you. I'll make you bump me.

559
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.450
Ah, yeah. I mean it's just,

560
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.910
I've been doing this, all this promotion for this Amazon prime thing.

561
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:43.010
There's so many shows, like there shows that I'm like, I've heard of them,

562
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.510
but I'm like, how many? Like it's, it's getting to the point where people,

563
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.340
like we're doing individual shows for just one person. Like I feel like,

564
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:56.240
I'm like, I'll do these shows and I'll be like, alright, you know,

565
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.270
and I don't want to name but, but you know,

566
00:34:58.271 --> 00:35:00.680
like I think like I'll look at my publicist, I'm like,

567
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.730
it's their people that listen to this and he's like, yeah, a million people.

568
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:08.600
I'm like, there's so many people, Jim. That's what it is. It's just,

569
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:13.400
it used to be the theory, but like,

570
00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:18.080
it's strange to do a show, have a great time, you know,

571
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.340
really kind of engaged in conversation and it drops.

572
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:27.290
And no one says anything on Twitter or on Instagram or Facebook. Well there's,

573
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.100
if you really stop and think about how many television shows there are in terms

574
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:34.160
of like shows that you can binge watch, it's impossible.

575
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.890
You would literally lose your entire day every day of the week

576
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.550
<v 2>just trying to keep up with the hits. There's no way it's impossible.</v>

577
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:43.530
And then you have how many people have talk shows?

578
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.300
How many of them is James Corden and there's the tonight show and there's Cole

579
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.440
Bear.

580
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.920
<v 1>Did you want me to not because you used to do those shows. Yeah,</v>

581
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.720
was there was, it's a time management thing.

582
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.520
<v 2>It's a time management thing and it's also,</v>

583
00:35:58.521 --> 00:36:02.780
I don't believe that they have a good format. I think that format is nonsense.

584
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.470
I think the format of waiting for commercials and the audience being right there

585
00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:08.570
and playing to the audience, it's not,

586
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.090
it's not an effective way to have a conversation.

587
00:36:11.091 --> 00:36:14.690
It's definitely not an effective way to express ideas that are complicated.

588
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.130
You want to be able to like air them out in a long form.

589
00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:22.250
Wang [inaudible] and you can't do that on those shows. You just can't.

590
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.700
It's in it's out. And if any weird or controversial comes up,

591
00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:27.950
you stick your foot in your mouth, you'd never have a chance to take it out.

592
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.880
Nobody really gets a chance to see how your mind really works. Like what?

593
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.360
What are you thinking? What what? Where is your head at?

594
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.940
How do you come to these conclusions? What's your thought process?

595
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.510
Who are you as a person? Are you a good person? Are you trying to do good?

596
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.880
Are you flawed? Are you what? What are you?

597
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.100
And you find that out in a long form.

598
00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:49.100
Conversations like when I had Bernie Sanders on,

599
00:36:49.101 --> 00:36:51.050
one of the things that people said was most interesting.

600
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.960
It's like this guy's not a cartoon. He's a really nice guy.

601
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.320
I see him on these shows and he seems like this fucking cartoonish character.

602
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.060
But now you see him here in this long form conversation where it,

603
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.570
there's no interruptions at all.

604
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:07.550
He's just has a chance to think and talk and express himself. And he'd go, oh,

605
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:11.090
now I know the real Bernie because I never knew him in these goddamned debates.

606
00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:14.850
And he's screaming for 12 seconds, right, about healthcare,

607
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.820
about taxes or about whatever it is. Yeah,

608
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.270
<v 1>it's fascinating. It's like, all right, here, let me, let me ask you this. Okay.</v>

609
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.210
Give me one of them. So let me try that. Beautiful. They're delicious.

610
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.640
I go original flavor. And you used to use to do the chew, right?

611
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.200
I used to tip and then I used to smoke cigarettes. Like there's, my wife has,

612
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.040
uh, uh, videos, like, you know,

613
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.020
we have all these old videos of us doing stand up and she was transferring them

614
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:45.030
to like DVDs at the time.

615
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:49.020
Now we're going to have to get them off the DVD and she would find these videos

616
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:53.640
of me doing standups smoking on stage. Whoa. Back in the day some.

617
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.930
And she was like, what are you doing? And I'm like, yeah, I used to smoke.

618
00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.830
I used to, you know,

619
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:03.330
I had yellow fingers [inaudible] cigarettes before I go onstage. Even recently,

620
00:38:03.331 --> 00:38:06.180
I smoked one of Chappelle cigarettes, uh, last weekend.

621
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.180
It gives you a crazy head rush before you go on stage. I like it. It's,

622
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.690
I want to smoke cigarettes. Sorry for the smacking in the microphone folks.

623
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.700
It's a terrible thing to smoke cigarettes,

624
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:21.420
but there's a weird rush that you get from, from the nicotine.

625
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.050
I was like a head rush. It's like you feel good. It's fine as you feel it,

626
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.480
you feel it the first couple times and then you're chasing it for the rest of

627
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:34.830
your life. Well, if you only smokable money into a garbage can once a week,

628
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:39.490
if smoke a cigarette once we, for you on stage, that's a real,

629
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.170
that hey kids out there. Just listen. Just listen to uncle Joe.

630
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.770
Just smoke one cigarette a week and it'll be fun. Well,

631
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:50.770
I'm thinking maybe you're nicotine gum might be the a substitute for that.

632
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.510
Cause what I'm getting is the nicotine, right? I mean,

633
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:55.750
that's what the rash is great by the want to start smoking cigars before I go on

634
00:38:55.751 --> 00:39:00.190
stage. I, uh, I the, the, the nicotine gum,

635
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.550
it used to curb my hunger. It used to curb. Nothing does, ma'am?

636
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:11.020
Nothing at all. Curves. It's like, but we're talking about this outside.

637
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:14.320
I'm like, there are times when I've been more in shape than others,

638
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:16.330
but I feel like at this point I'm like, you know what,

639
00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:19.850
maybe I'll just go in all in and fat guy. I might just be like, you know what,

640
00:39:19.851 --> 00:39:23.800
I'm just, I'm just going to go all in, you know, like, you know, I'll just,

641
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:27.190
you know, I'll take the place of Pinette, you know, I'll just do that.

642
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.660
You know what I mean? You seem thinner though then I've seen you before.

643
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.770
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not at all, but it's just,

644
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.680
I have low t. I don't know what that even means. Like I'd see those commercials.

645
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.050
Testosterone. Do you take testosterone or take testosterone?

646
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:47.410
You seem like you'd drink it every morning. Have you ever like,

647
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.720
but like, I feel like I just need like energy. Yeah. That'll give you energy.

648
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:54.790
Your body's dying and it is dying.

649
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.550
<v 2>Current system no longer produces the hormones. [inaudible] um,</v>

650
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.520
I mean [inaudible] when you see an older person,

651
00:40:02.521 --> 00:40:06.660
when they have diminished muscle and their, their mass is like shrinking.

652
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.680
That's what's going on.

653
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.920
Their body doesn't produce the hormones in order to keep the mass going.

654
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.770
So which you have to do is two things. One, you have to lift weights.

655
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.620
That's one thing. And two you have to supplement your hormones.

656
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.320
<v 1>Um, no,</v>

657
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.030
but some of it is I'm so focused on eating.

658
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:28.160
No, I'm so focused on, I sometimes listen to my set while I work out.

659
00:40:28.161 --> 00:40:30.920
It's like when you work out you have to focus on working out. Yeah.

660
00:40:30.921 --> 00:40:31.500
But that's a good

661
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.080
<v 2>the thing to do. I do that when I'm on the elliptical.</v>

662
00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:37.550
Sometimes I'll listen to listen to comedy. I think listening to sets is uh,

663
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.560
one thing that not enough comics do.

664
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.800
They record their sets but they don't listen to them cause it's gross and you

665
00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:44.750
feel, oh it's annoying. You don't want to hear it.

666
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.250
But it's way the way you learn. And I feel like, I mean, I don't know,

667
00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:50.870
I would like to know how you feel about this,

668
00:40:50.871 --> 00:40:52.880
but I feel like the amount of time,

669
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.020
the span concentrated on your material has a direct result in how good it is and

670
00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.200
how good it gets quick. Especially when you're producing specials,

671
00:41:00.201 --> 00:41:03.650
so you abandoned all your material and then you have to write new stuff. For me,

672
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.560
that process is greatly accelerated by physically writing.

673
00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:07.970
Physically writing is very important. Yeah.

674
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.150
I devote a lot of time to sit in front of a computer, staring at it,

675
00:41:11.151 --> 00:41:14.390
smoking pot, writing things out, looking at notes, writing things out,

676
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.210
performing. Those are critical, but also listening,

677
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:20.690
listening to those recordings and then writing notes on the recordings.

678
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.830
<v 1>Yeah. For me the process is it shifts all the time,</v>

679
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:30.710
right? So there's some times you just give birth to a chunk, it'll [inaudible].

680
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.310
It just comes out and you're like, oh my gosh, thank God.

681
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.670
And sometimes it's just like you're chiseling away at granite and it's just bit

682
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:41.540
by bit underneath.

683
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.560
But for me it's doing these longer sets,

684
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.930
like doing an hour and 10 minutes.

685
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.300
I will and it's a shift from before it used to be like I needed the sits of sets

686
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:56.510
in the city to like a build piece by piece.

687
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:01.020
But now I'm kind of all talk about like something that happened, uh,

688
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.790
when I was a kid and then I'll polish it over a long period.

689
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.850
Cause in an hour show it's, you know,

690
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:12.851
I believe you have to do a material every time you do a theater and it has to be

691
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:17.360
new because you want people leaving going, I'm coming back when it comes back.

692
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.010
Yeah. And so, but the writing process, it's, it's always moving for me.

693
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:23.060
Sometimes it is,

694
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.050
it's a lot of times like something will bump me and I'll write it down on my

695
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:32.051
phone and then sometimes I'll write around it or I will just go on stage and

696
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:37.850
talk a little bit about it. Are you, um, when you are doing sets in the city,

697
00:42:37.851 --> 00:42:39.830
are you ever doing long sets? Like an hour?

698
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.440
Not usually because it's, I mean, my, when I'm in New York,

699
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.280
you know, having five kids, it's just,

700
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.050
just the commitment for like, I'm looking at September and I'm like, oh my gosh,

701
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.913
like the,

702
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:59.360
the curriculum nights alone are going to be insane.

703
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.960
And there's going to be, you know, uh, you know,

704
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:07.100
my daughter's in soccer and there's going to be all these meetings and there's

705
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:11.210
just innumerable things. So like assemblies, school assemblies, you know,

706
00:43:11.211 --> 00:43:16.100
like chatting with the principal who talks about their philosophy.

707
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.720
And so like, there's, there's a commitment, but like doing the hour,

708
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:25.100
I don't really usually do it in New York, but what I do do is I will,

709
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.880
I like to do, uh, I dunno what they're called now,

710
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:33.800
but all chose in Brooklyn, which is, it'll kind of like,

711
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.170
uh, I'll do material that would work in a comedy club. But like in, uh,

712
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.700
in Brooklyn in front of like a more, I don't know how to describe mortars.

713
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.800
Hipsters are more precious audience, precious dear. I mean, where,

714
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.690
you know, like when I go on stage in New York City in Manhattan,

715
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.630
I'm a white guy who's like fat.

716
00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.130
When I go on stage in some of these rooms in Brooklyn,

717
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.740
I'm a white man. You know what I mean?

718
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:08.480
So it's a different experience and it's very important to see that because how I

719
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:12.890
characterize things, uh, you know, it's,

720
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.640
it's good to like be educated on like, ah, you know? All right.

721
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:20.600
Maybe that does sound a little piggy. So I'll pull back. Right, right.

722
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:22.010
And then I'll go on the road.

723
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.210
Like I used to like a great example is I used to have back when USA,

724
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.860
I'm sure USA today is still there,

725
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:31.830
but I used to have all this material that I developed in, uh,

726
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.350
in Brooklyn about the USA Today. How like, it's just like a coloring book,

727
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.200
you know what I mean? And how it's just kinda like, do you like news?

728
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:44.850
But also pictures of news and it was just great and it would kill in Brooklyn

729
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:45.810
and we would kill in New York.

730
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.460
And then I would go on the road and people would be like,

731
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:49.560
what the hell are you talking about? And unlike the USA Today,

732
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:51.660
that's what I get when I travel. You know what I mean?

733
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.550
Or it's got a great sports section.

734
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:58.170
So it's like there's so much value in traveling around with material cause you

735
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:01.740
gain different perspectives. Oh sure. The road is so critical for that.

736
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.430
<v 2>Yeah. Get a sense of how people, especially when you're doing clubs,</v>

737
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.590
I've found that the road, when you're doing clubs,

738
00:45:06.591 --> 00:45:10.100
you really get a sense of like the feel of a city, whether it's Cleveland or,

739
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.620
<v 1>oh, yes. Yeah. I mean I loved the fact even, you know,</v>

740
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.340
how, uh, you know, doing a, talking about, you know,

741
00:45:18.341 --> 00:45:23.240
I make a point of not doing too much material on having, uh,

742
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.060
five kids. But like I'll do,

743
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:30.180
like if I talk about having five kids in New York City and at a show in New York

744
00:45:30.431 --> 00:45:33.430
City, people are like, you're crazy.

745
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.270
And then if I talk about having five kids and Boston,

746
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:41.350
and I'm generalizing, people in Boston might be like, you're crazy.

747
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:45.910
I came from one of those families, and if I do it in Utah, people will be like,

748
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.430
yeah, we are crazy for having five kids.

749
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:52.300
So it is the same joke and it's the same point of view,

750
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:55.030
but it's tweaked a little bit and it's so fun.

751
00:45:55.031 --> 00:46:00.031
Kind of traveling around and learning that material and learning the impact and

752
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:03.190
how it's digested. Well, comics have a unique

753
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.600
<v 2>perspective on America because of that,</v>

754
00:46:05.601 --> 00:46:07.880
because we don't just go to these different places,

755
00:46:07.881 --> 00:46:12.710
but we also perform material in all these different places. So I think, like we,

756
00:46:12.711 --> 00:46:16.880
I've been talking a lot with comics lately about like what was your reaction to

757
00:46:16.881 --> 00:46:18.230
Trump winning the election?

758
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:23.590
Comics sought coming more than most people who live in La because most people

759
00:46:23.961 --> 00:46:27.410
live in la, very liberal, very left wing, convinced that, you know,

760
00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:29.810
this is even, it didn't, it didn't matter who you voted for.

761
00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:32.450
Hillary was gonna Win California no matter what. Yeah. Like we were,

762
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:37.400
this was a pro Democrat state and when Trump won,

763
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.840
I ran into people that were shell shocked. They couldn't fucking imagine.

764
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.180
<v 1>I mean I think, I mean I was surprised. I was definitely,</v>

765
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.860
I was definitely surprised. But that being said,

766
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.450
I wasn't surprised by um,

767
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.760
the uh,

768
00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.360
the logic behind some of the people that voted for Trump last time that are

769
00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:03.760
sheepish to admit it now. Yes. Um,

770
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:08.440
I understood some of that logic but I thought it was fascinating cause there was

771
00:47:08.441 --> 00:47:11.710
a time for me, cause I tour with uh,

772
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.890
Ted Alexander a lot and he's like a mock ted. He's like,

773
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.570
he's like an occupy Wall Street guy.

774
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:21.630
Like he is like a very progressive and we would tour and he would have,

775
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:27.460
during the election he would have some material on Hillary and some material on

776
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:30.820
Trump. And it worked everywhere in Texas, worked in Tennessee,

777
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:34.490
which I think is the most conservative place outside of Nashville. And,

778
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.950
and so it will work everywhere.

779
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:41.200
And then the election happened and that same material,

780
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.760
and it wasn't just the context of the post election, it was,

781
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:46.900
I call,

782
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.900
I described it as people looking at the ceiling is that people didn't want to

783
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:53.014
hear it.

784
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.310
And I think some of it is people like we deal with this all day,

785
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.340
we need a break from it. But it was both sides.

786
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.390
So like Trump voters were more embolden kind of like that's right.

787
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:09.880
And then also the left people were like, please can I,

788
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.490
I just want to hear Jim talk about horses for 10 minutes during meeting.

789
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.190
And so there is something fascinating that occurs.

790
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:22.840
And there's also something fascinating about international shows because when

791
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.660
Bush was, when w was precedent,

792
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.430
there were much more people coming up to me going, how dare he, you know,

793
00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:34.180
start the Iraq war and with with Trump, they're like, yeah,

794
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:37.400
you probably didn't have anything to do with that. Yeah,

795
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.250
I would say that's my takeaway. Yeah, it's,

796
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.440
people are definitely fatigued. I think we have [inaudible],

797
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.850
we have political discourse fatigue. It's neverending,

798
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.510
neverending. And if it's, how much of it is your life,

799
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.780
if you really stop and think about it, if you're alive for 75,

800
00:48:55.781 --> 00:49:00.781
85 years on this planet and most of your waking time interacting with people is

801
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:01.960
discussing politics,

802
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.800
how much of it actually does affect your life other than those conversations,

803
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.860
those conversations. It's a,

804
00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:12.400
a giant part of a lot of people's anxiety, a giant part of the arc.

805
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:15.040
But the real life, like getting up in the morning,

806
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.650
fixing breakfast for your kids, taking them to school,

807
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:20.950
how much fucking Trump play a part in any of that. I did,

808
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:25.951
I did a CBS Sunday commentary on how all conversations lead to Trump.

809
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.120
Like it's just every conversation eventually gets to,

810
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.930
and then Trump did something like that. But it is,

811
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.840
I was also thinking like, cause we,

812
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.070
we live in this very precarious time and, uh, you know,

813
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:47.230
a very divided country on a lot of different levels and there's so much drama

814
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:50.350
and there's, you know, uh, you know,

815
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:54.820
environmental disaster and pending and I, and again,

816
00:49:54.821 --> 00:49:57.610
to my point of like is we finally figured it out.

817
00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:01.570
This is the most dramatic period, but compared to World War II, no,

818
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.750
this is nothing. Nothing. This is nothing.

819
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.880
I was in central Europe what the, like human beings like we, I, you know,

820
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.210
you know, and we're going around this, uh,

821
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.530
terrorists in this place outside of Prague where they stuck all the Jewish

822
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:22.531
people and with my children and my children who like just want to play on iPads

823
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.070
were just mesmerized. They're like, what? And,

824
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.990
and the takeaway was not, oh,

825
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:34.130
the Germans are bad and Nazis are bad. The takeaway is, oh,

826
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:36.290
humans are crazy.

827
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.720
Like it's just a matter of months that the same people that we're your

828
00:50:41.721 --> 00:50:42.261
neighbors,

829
00:50:42.261 --> 00:50:46.670
that you would go to their kids' birthday parties you were waving goodbye to

830
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.200
because you got their apartment. And I'm like, oh. Like it was terrifying.

831
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:55.940
Like human beings, it's very easy for us to go. Yeah. It was the Germans.

832
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.990
It was the Germans that did that. You know, it was Lithuanians did it,

833
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:04.010
but it wasn't, it was human beings that were like manipulated like that.

834
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.690
Yeah.

835
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:08.890
<v 2>You catch the wrong leader. Yeah. Yeah. But we're right next to you. That's,</v>

836
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.300
that is a World War II helmet.

837
00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:13.960
That's a legitimate world war two helmet in a bay in that, wow. That uh,

838
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.680
it's a good reminder. It's filled with little holes and shit.

839
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:22.090
There's apparently places in Europe where you can find thousands of those things

840
00:51:22.091 --> 00:51:23.920
just scattered out there. You know,

841
00:51:23.921 --> 00:51:28.921
there's the areas in France that are impossible for people to go to because

842
00:51:29.381 --> 00:51:33.970
there's so many rounds that have been shot into the ground there and so much

843
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
toxic chemicals and stuff from World War II that to this day they don't want

844
00:51:39.821 --> 00:51:43.270
people traveling to, I mean it's an enormous size. The size of Paris.

845
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.970
It's in Braylee. Yeah, see if you can find that.

846
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.120
<v 1>That's amazing. There's also from the forties,</v>

847
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.250
so like when I was in Prague and you know,

848
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:55.270
you go on these tours and the punishment,

849
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:59.140
like they would just be like, and this I also learned this in Greece.

850
00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:01.990
They'd be like, they'd be like, uh, okay.

851
00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:06.460
So as punishment we are gonna murder an entire village.

852
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.240
So we're going to in your look what, and by the way, again,

853
00:52:10.241 --> 00:52:13.930
we can characterize this, this of cause on the internet, everyone's coming back.

854
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.870
Gaffigan was defending Nazis. That's not my point at all,

855
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.820
is just that human beings.

856
00:52:18.821 --> 00:52:23.821
Like it wasn't that long ago when like rape and pillage was the goto tactic.

857
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.520
It's like, all right, we'll conquer then we'll rape appellate. You know,

858
00:52:27.521 --> 00:52:30.640
there were some guys who were like, you know, what can I just pillage? I just,

859
00:52:30.641 --> 00:52:33.460
you know, I got a girlfriend now and I don't really feel like raping.

860
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:39.090
<v 2>Well we were talking about Kurdistan the other day that to this day 20% of all</v>

861
00:52:39.191 --> 00:52:42.460
marriages begin in kidnapping. What? Yes,

862
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.120
20% so one out of five marriages started with the groom,

863
00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.380
kidnapping the bride.

864
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.040
Like that's how they had to get married because he raped her.

865
00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.730
So in order for her, it's romance. It's fucked. Unbelievable.

866
00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:02.020
It's fucking crazy. Here it is.

867
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:05.920
The Red Zone in France is so dangerous that a hundred years after World War Two,

868
00:53:05.921 --> 00:53:07.540
it's still a no go area.

869
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.790
There's all sorts of rounds and munitions and there's all sorts of, I mean,

870
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:17.680
there's so many rockets were fired into this area that this shit is still in,

871
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.720
in the soil and everyone,

872
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.170
<v 1>I, you know, this also brings up a, a separate point. Why,</v>

873
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.070
why is this surprise? Like what

874
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
<v 0>humans also have a really w a real short term memory problem.</v>

875
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:36.490
Like we don't remember things, right? Like, I don't think people really, uh,

876
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.760
appreciate, you know, that World War II was like 70 years ago,

877
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:45.390
right? Like, it was not that long ago. Right? Like even the, you know,

878
00:53:45.391 --> 00:53:49.350
like Serbia, I was in Dubrovnik and they're like, yeah, up there,

879
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:52.770
the Montenegrins used to shoot at us. Now those guys, you know,

880
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:56.910
now we go to their bar and you're like, what? Like that was the nineties. Yeah.

881
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.320
It's just, it's just terrifying. It's, it's hard to believe,

882
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:05.760
but if you're in the wrong place in history at the wrong time,

883
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:10.680
like right now, if you're in Libya, Libya right now, or Syria, yeah,

884
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.260
well, Libya is a failed state. I mean, Syria is horrible.

885
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:16.300
You got Assad running it, but Libya has no one running it. Libya.

886
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.200
They're selling slaves on youtube. I mean,

887
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:23.580
you can watch slave auctions in real time right now. It's a terrifying,

888
00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:24.600
terrifying place.

889
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.130
And it's because they killed a Momar Kadafi and then the rebels took over and

890
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:31.320
then it became a felt a failed state. It's chaos.

891
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.150
And this is right now in 2019 if you were unfortunate enough to be born in

892
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:39.780
Libya, you are stuck there right now and you're living in hell.

893
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:42.800
You're not living in Manhattan in 2019 where it's wonderful.

894
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:47.770
Jim Gaffigan can hop on over to golf. Yeah, hi to Jerry Seinfeld. Do a second,

895
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.700
have a meatball sub and you know, do whatever the fuck you want. No,

896
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:55.730
you're living in a chaos filled environment where Bob barbarians are running the

897
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:59.130
show. And this can happen. This can happen.

898
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.780
And this is one of the reasons why our democracy is so important.

899
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.860
One of the reasons why compassion is so important and kindness and talking to

900
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:05.390
people.

901
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:09.750
And it's also important to look at things objectively and label things based on

902
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.950
compassion. And, and looking at things in an intelligent,

903
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:17.820
non-biased way so you can really get a sense of what the landscape really is.

904
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:19.800
If you're, you know, you're,

905
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.100
everybody's a fucking Nazi and everybody's terrible and white privileges,

906
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.130
white privilege that everyone's a criminal, everyone's bad. No, no, no.

907
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.530
There's real crime in the world.

908
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:32.070
There's real terror and real awful things and we have more unity.

909
00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:35.760
We have more in common than, than we promote. You know, what I think is,

910
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:41.010
and I think this is also a reflection of the success of Comedians,

911
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.760
podcasts is that w what people don't realize is that comedians really appreciate

912
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:50.610
a different point of view. We actually, like,

913
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.660
we have friends that like we don't agree with. In fact,

914
00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:56.700
we almost find it entertaining. Like,

915
00:55:56.701 --> 00:56:01.260
let's talk to this friend because I know I disagree with him and we can have

916
00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:05.500
that banter. And I think that particularly in this, uh,

917
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.320
cancel culture there is. And so like you get these comedians,

918
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:15.420
like you hosting these podcasts, having these discussions and,

919
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:20.660
and comedians have kinda like the boldness to step in it and say,

920
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:24.060
Hey, I don't know about that. Tell me about that, where it's like,

921
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.760
from a societal basis, there's like, don't question,

922
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.560
don't question a why we're pursuing this, because if you question it,

923
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.150
that means you're not a true believer. And we're looking for true believers.

924
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.910
Whereas, and by the way, it's,

925
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.300
it's just interesting because I think, you know,

926
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:48.280
I have a friend Tom Chaloo who I love who is, who has a show on,

927
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.090
uh, on Fox, uh, nation.

928
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.300
And it is weird cause like six years ago,

929
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.840
and I did this interview and I talked about it and,

930
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.650
and I could see the interviewer go,

931
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.150
you're friends with someone that works at Fox. And I'm like,

932
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.310
yeah, you know, it's like, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

933
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:13.120
He's not a monster. Yeah. He's not killing, you know,

934
00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:17.290
he's not putting children in cages. He's friends with Steve Hilton.

935
00:57:17.291 --> 00:57:20.970
He has a show on Fox. He interviewed Trump by my family and his fan.

936
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:25.900
Go on vacations together. And this guy, it's like, why?

937
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.570
Like it's, it's,

938
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.240
it's this strange thing where I'm like,

939
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.720
I can understand how important these beliefs are and I can understand how

940
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.120
threatening, um, democracy is.

941
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:44.380
And I can understand how we have to face our history and, and all these things.

942
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:49.300
But it's like the discourse has to remain,

943
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.760
doesn't it? Yes. We have to be able to talk to each other.

944
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.300
And I think that's one of the things that kind of died with the Trump election.

945
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.850
People were like, you're with us or against us.

946
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:03.350
You're the for him or you or your fear for the future and compassion and caring

947
00:58:03.641 --> 00:58:06.940
about everyone. Or you're a monster and there's no,

948
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:11.970
there's no discussion about finances or the best way to run the economy or

949
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:15.460
international trade. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are.

950
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.700
You're with the good or the bad. You're binary. It's one or zero.

951
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:20.770
You're black or white. You're one or zero.

952
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:25.950
And that is the same thing that they criticized about w saying you're either

953
00:58:27.011 --> 00:58:31.210
with us or against that. Which by the way, being a father of daughters,

954
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:34.810
you know, is also a line from beauty and the beast. Yeah.

955
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.580
But isn't this true? Appropriately so. Right.

956
00:58:39.581 --> 00:58:43.570
It's like very childlike like that. That perspective is very childlike.

957
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.090
There's a lot of people that are conservative that are very good people.

958
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:48.430
Absolutely. That's, I, you know,

959
00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:52.180
here's another thing that I find very frustrating.

960
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.010
I feel it's though I'm sometimes, and sometimes I'll get, uh,

961
00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:00.820
messages on social media and there'll be like, you know,

962
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:04.840
that some of the people that like your comedy are Trump supporters.

963
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.240
And I'm like, I hope so.

964
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:12.400
I hope that I appeal to a lot of different people. Uh, you know,

965
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:16.540
I, it's, it's a very strange look.

966
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:21.541
I remember the success I had and I'm so grateful for the success that I've had,

967
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:23.960
<v 1>uh, on, beyond the Pale.</v>

968
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.530
I remember it like I came back to New York after I had done this tour and you

969
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.900
don't know with stand up, you don't know how long it's going to last.

970
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.950
You don't know what's going on.

971
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.700
And I came back and I remember someone reading an article,

972
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:38.750
maybe it was in out in New York and they're like, he's very mainstream,

973
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:42.830
mainstream. And there was recently in New York Times article,

974
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:46.400
he is very conventional and I'm like, what is that?

975
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:50.540
Do you mean like conventional in that people want to go and see me perform?

976
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:55.430
Like a lot of people like that, like that's a crime. Like that's he's,

977
00:59:55.431 --> 01:00:00.380
you know, he, you know, it's like, it's, so we live in this age,

978
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.440
like there used to be comedians and I think it's inhibited some people's success

979
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.970
where like if it's like bill burr, one of the best comedians today,

980
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:15.620
and I think people are sometimes people in the media or like, you know,

981
01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.980
the wrong people might like his material and you're like,

982
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.180
that doesn't do what I'm saying. Yes, maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm like,

983
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:27.590
no, I get that from this podcast. It's, it's a very strange,

984
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:32.390
it's, it's, it's almost kind of a, you know, and I,

985
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:34.940
and I don't know if I've talked about this, but like, you know,

986
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:39.800
like there's this cultural revolution that is occurring that is,

987
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:45.020
it's well-intended, but it's almost, it's almost puritanical.

988
01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.180
And, and by the way, I'm not somebody I'm against any form of censorship,

989
01:00:50.181 --> 01:00:55.181
but I'm also somebody that believes that if we can articulate a transgender

990
01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:00.980
terms that make people that are transgender or feel comfortable, there's,

991
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.410
there's nothing wrong with that. We can adjust our language.

992
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.310
We do it all the time.

993
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:09.850
But I do think that there is kind of this almost puritanical thing that's

994
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.810
ironically happening on the left. That is what we,

995
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.130
you know, as Comedians we use to make fun of the right four.

996
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.420
Does that make sense? Yes. It's a very strange kind of like, wait,

997
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:27.620
you guys are doing what you accused these guys of doing forever.

998
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:31.070
If they don't see it that way because they feel like they're right and if you're

999
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:35.150
right, then it doesn't matter if it's well intended. I do think it's Wellington.

1000
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.450
I don't question someone's motive. So like I don't think that, like,

1001
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:41.090
I remember and I'm going to get blow back on this. Look,

1002
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.920
I don't think that w uh, what had malicious intent,

1003
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.100
I think he was well-intended, you know, he failed at things,

1004
01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:53.120
but I think he was well-intended. I think that's probably a logical perspective.

1005
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:56.180
And I think Dick Cheney's probably Satan. You think so?

1006
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.910
I think Dick Cheney was run. I mean straight from hell.

1007
01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:01.160
That's why I had that bunker deep, deep down under the,

1008
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.640
I think that bunker existed. He was right. It wasn't like, he was like,

1009
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.860
it's not like he was like, yeah, I need a bunker.

1010
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.220
He had a straight shot straight to hell. That's what it was. It was,

1011
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:13.190
it was down there. That's how it was heated. That's why it was so warm.

1012
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.580
That's what he would remember when he was in the bunker after nine 11 there was

1013
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.270
like Dick changes in a bunker. How come George Bush is playing golf? W's

1014
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.740
<v 0>is out there. [inaudible] target on the forehead.</v>

1015
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.870
He was in DC and there was a separation of, of powers. I Dunno.

1016
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.320
And then we all saw the Adam McKay movie. You're like, how much is that true?

1017
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:35.010
I not right. Um, how much is that true? Imagine the power

1018
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:41.130
too, because Dick Cheney, like I, you know,

1019
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.570
I also doubt everything I always caught, you know, like everything I hear about,

1020
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:47.010
I'm Kinda like cut it in half,

1021
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.840
which makes me kind of still think Trump is absolutely crazy. But,

1022
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.550
but like, you know, Dick Cheney is there,

1023
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.940
like is he is and I don't think he cares,

1024
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.380
but like there's no, like w w the,

1025
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.390
the narrative has been set for him. Yeah. There's no kind of like,

1026
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.650
you're not going to believe this,

1027
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:14.940
but Dick Cheney is like one of the funniest storytellers. Like that's,

1028
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.710
there's no, there's no changing the narrative of Dick Chamie.

1029
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.150
Right. Like George W's painting and he does a lot of painting.

1030
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.550
Painting is kind of lovely. It's like, it's cute sweet stuff.

1031
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:28.320
It's like good shows you where his mind is at.

1032
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.630
This is where he chooses to spend his time. Katrina,

1033
01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:32.370
he didn't go there right away. Well,

1034
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.880
he hates me on people according to Kanye West. Right.

1035
01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:39.270
But Dick Cheney w is a completely different animal.

1036
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.950
Like he shot his friend in the face and his friend apologized. Yeah.

1037
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:47.730
But he didn't do it. He obviously didn't do it on purpose, probably drunk.

1038
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.890
And then he disappeared for 24 hours.

1039
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.150
Do you know that he didn't immediately turn himself in and he won't. Yeah,

1040
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:55.350
he was most likely drinking.

1041
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.610
They were doing what's called a canned hunt where they open up these gates and

1042
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:02.850
they let these birds fly out and they just start blasting him and he shot his

1043
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:06.660
friend. But it was, it could've been a mistake. It was a mistake.

1044
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.110
I probably have known as the Dick Cheney apologists. Nice.

1045
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.210
So explain this Halliburton.

1046
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.010
So he was the CEO of Halliburton leaves Halliburton and then he becomes a vice

1047
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:22.011
president and then he gives Halliburton these no bid contracts to rebuild Iraq

1048
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:27.030
after they blew it up. So explain that as a, as a apologist. Um, you know, uh,

1049
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.410
I would say one,

1050
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:32.760
a no bid contracts happen often and that's what I've heard.

1051
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.050
How can you chew another one of those?

1052
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:37.920
My heart is pounding on my chest cause I'm a real man. I'm more manly than you.

1053
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:43.410
You know, like you're real type A, I'm a real, like I get up.

1054
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.490
I do. What are those bells that you kinda sounded the bells. Kettle bells. I,

1055
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.310
you know what? I eat a bowl of those for cereal. Nice.

1056
01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.320
When you're a man like me, that's what I do.

1057
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:55.620
I put CBD oil on my knees and then I just lift.

1058
01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:00.080
I lift bulldozers. That's what I do for breakfast.

1059
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.480
Then I jog up mountains and just yell and then I just come home and I just eat

1060
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:08.070
elk meat. But you know, unlike you, I don't Cook it.

1061
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.310
I just eat the elk when it's alive. Sometimes it's better to cook though.

1062
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.140
What is elk meat tastes like and wants them around here? Not really.

1063
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:18.040
You don't care kitchen here. If

1064
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.420
<v 2>I had a kitchen here and I cook some, would you eat something? I'm sup.</v>

1065
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:23.200
We're at this compound. You have this huge place.

1066
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.050
You've got a horse track in the back. You don't have a kitchen here.

1067
01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.320
I'm going to open up a kitchen here. Seriously. I'm actually, I'm going to,

1068
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.210
I'm thinking about putting together a restaurant,

1069
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.320
so friends come over and you saying what makes you,

1070
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:38.200
maybe you've talked about this and I haven't heard the episode, but elk meat,

1071
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:42.230
is that good or it's just, yeah, it's a wild animals.

1072
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:47.110
What does it taste like? Deer. It feels like deer. Well, venison, you're like,

1073
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:51.280
oh, this is good. You know, if I have really strong mustard and I'm not hungry,

1074
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.730
oh man. It's just prepared poorly. This is delicious.

1075
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.540
It's all of it is how the meat is taken care of. After the animal dies,

1076
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:01.660
whether it's cooled quickly and how it's processed, that's all it is.

1077
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.910
How it's cleaned, how it's cut up,

1078
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.320
how it's vacuum sealed and frozen almost immediately after the animal dies.

1079
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.180
How you don't let it in the glands.

1080
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:13.270
Like they have tarsal glands that they can get. They have hormones.

1081
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:16.060
Like a lot of times when you shooting these animals, it's during the Rut.

1082
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.790
So their, their breeding and this is, this is when they hear,

1083
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:22.600
they get these hormones and these tarsal glands,

1084
01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:26.290
they put these any why don't get it on the more out. Why don't we eat more out?

1085
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.170
Cause it's a wild animal. It's an illegal animal to sell.

1086
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:30.860
You have to go out and hunt them. You're,

1087
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:34.100
but why doesn't someone just started an elk farm? Because it's,

1088
01:06:34.101 --> 01:06:37.710
it's just Ark Eldoret down on those. Well there's a lot of,

1089
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:41.800
there's a lot of factors there. First of all, you can buy [inaudible] lobby. No,

1090
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:45.880
no, no. You can buy it from New Zealand. New Zealand sells a lot of it.

1091
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:50.350
And I think there's some places where you can buy commercially raised elk in

1092
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.630
North America. I'm not exactly sure if that's the case,

1093
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.820
but it's illegal to sell wild game.

1094
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.870
And there's a difference between an animal that's been penned in and force fed

1095
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:01.720
and just, you know, big bales of Hay and whatever,

1096
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.670
or a wild ass paper. Yeah. Um,

1097
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:09.130
I'm interested in wild animals because I think wild animals are healthier. Also.

1098
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:12.310
I think the Karma of what you're doing is very different.

1099
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.700
You're just going after a wild animal that's in the Rut and they wind up killing

1100
01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:18.820
each other. They get killed by mountain lions and wolves and bears.

1101
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:24.130
And what I'm doing is I'm dipping my toe into the natural world and I'm a circle

1102
01:07:24.131 --> 01:07:24.520
of light.

1103
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.030
I'm going after them the way a mountain line would go after them and she's

1104
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:30.850
choosing a bow and Arrow and I'm getting them to bring it back.

1105
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:35.110
And then I eat that one animal a hope for a whole year. I'll feed my family.

1106
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:39.610
You know, Tom Papa, Tom Papa is a giant consumer read Arabic pop,

1107
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.430
let's say with bread out of, it's like,

1108
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:46.640
you wouldn't pop it like at your restaurant. You have to pop it to the pressure.

1109
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.570
He'll be the bread man and like,

1110
01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:52.840
good for [inaudible] sell the weed and then anybody could tell the wheat today.

1111
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:57.640
Right. I guess anyone could today. Yeah. But uh, but like you love elk,

1112
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.400
you wake up and you're like, you know what? I want to,

1113
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:03.640
I had a do you want to from breakfast? Well who doesn't have help for breakfast?

1114
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:07.270
You have the elk. Syria. I had sausage, sausage, breakfast.

1115
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.000
And do you make your own elk sausage? No, I get that made.

1116
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:11.560
I get it made by a butcher that I know.

1117
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.800
And so do you think that when I come back,

1118
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:17.750
cause I do this podcast every six years.

1119
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.770
Do you think when I come back and do it as often as you want? Oh well thank you.

1120
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.360
We just didn't have the right phone numbers.

1121
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:28.310
Do you think that we will that uh, what is the,

1122
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:29.330
um,

1123
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:34.330
what is the it do you think that elk is the new Kale that you are going to that

1124
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:38.990
we're going to track it back to? Hard to do. Did to go out and get it yourself?

1125
01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:39.880
It's very difficult.

1126
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:44.360
You have to be like really committed to learning how to hunt and then to be fit

1127
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:48.080
enough to climb the mountains and then what do you track it back?

1128
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.630
You have to carry it out in chunks. Yeah.

1129
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:52.800
Trop it up and then you carry it out in chunks.

1130
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.340
Quarter it meaning you take the legs off and you take the backstraps,

1131
01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.220
you know that there's like grocery stores for and it does not the survey elk and

1132
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.370
it's a different experience.

1133
01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.680
Why we're saying why wouldn't someone listening to this start an elk ranch and

1134
01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:09.200
so that they can sell illegal, it's not legal,

1135
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:12.560
it's not illegal to sell wild game. And then there's a reason for that.

1136
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.840
And also when you have these farms,

1137
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:17.210
there are farms that raised deer and some other animals.

1138
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:22.160
There's a real problem with a chronic wasting disease and certain diseases that

1139
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:25.220
get easily spread when all of these animals are eating off of the same food

1140
01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:25.521
source.

1141
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:28.640
So if they have like a bin where they're all eating at him and they share,

1142
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:33.260
saliva actually contributes to the contamination of certain diseases.

1143
01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:36.200
And there's a real problem in this country with something called CWD,

1144
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:37.820
which is chronic wasting disease.

1145
01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:42.710
And it's the same exact thing of is a mad cow disease.

1146
01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.190
It just hasn't jumped over to other animals. It's jumped over to mice,

1147
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.690
but it hasn't jumped over to humans.

1148
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.050
But if it did jump over to humans it would be a gigantic fucking problem.

1149
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.220
And part of that problem they believe stems from farms,

1150
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.070
from farms that are raising deer. It's very controversial.

1151
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.300
I mean there's people. Where do you go to hunt elk? Cause we're

1152
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.560
different from where I hunt elk. I go to Utah every year.

1153
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:08.210
Go to Colorado is a great place to hunt.

1154
01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.230
Montana is a great place to kind of l l content area.

1155
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:16.140
Just got to go into your job. You should come with me. You kick out,

1156
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.330
you kick out. I would have, unlike you, I wouldn't corridor it.

1157
01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:24.320
I just drag it back, throws down strong enough and I'd put some kettlebells on.

1158
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:27.830
Stick your Dick in kiss, carry it out like a condom. You just sit.

1159
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.890
So they're big animals. So like if they,

1160
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.080
if you missed will they charge you elk? Most of the time won't do that.

1161
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:39.500
But a moose certainly would moose or get into certain nest if fucked you up.

1162
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:42.080
That's the elk right there. There you go. Yeah,

1163
01:10:42.081 --> 01:10:44.210
I shot that one in central California.

1164
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:50.030
And so how do you get that on an airplane? Well, you have to a quarter it up,

1165
01:10:50.031 --> 01:10:54.140
chop it up into portions, freeze it, and then stick it in like a Yeti cooler.

1166
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.160
And then I'll seal the Yeti cooler and you have to bring it through customs and

1167
01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:02.240
then they have to, uh, they have to look at it, not customs, but uh, TSA.

1168
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.350
They have to open it up and check it and inspect it and make sure it's human.

1169
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.110
Yes. Not a human. Yeah. And then they, uh,

1170
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:12.200
they wouldn't really wouldn't know if it was a human, as long as you package it,

1171
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.110
you could say it's wild pig idea. Holla.

1172
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:20.040
And so what is that thing there? That is for my friend Adam Green Tree.

1173
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:24.600
That is an easy adic water buffalo that he shot in Australia. Yeah,

1174
01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:28.690
he's a buddy of mine. He gave it to me, so I decided to put it. And so, uh,

1175
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.190
how many, how many elk have you shot? Like you, you really,

1176
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.330
it takes you a year to eat it. Yeah, yeah. About, no,

1177
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:39.150
I can eat one in about six months. My family eats a lot of it.

1178
01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:41.580
I give a lot of it to my friends. And Do,

1179
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:46.160
do people's like th or your daughter's like elk again? Sometimes. Yeah.

1180
01:11:46.161 --> 01:11:49.830
Sometimes we get annoyed. We eat a lot of meat and a lot of elks do.

1181
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:52.860
And it's healthier than beef. Oh yeah. But why is it healthier?

1182
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:57.550
It's got more protein per ounce. It's got more amino acids. It's,

1183
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:59.820
it's a darker Richard Color.

1184
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.120
Like if you look at grass fed beef versus grain fed beef,

1185
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.240
one of the things you noticed is the grass fed beef is a darker color.

1186
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.810
The meats are dark cars. Just a healthier animal. That's what,

1187
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.100
that's what beef is supposed to look like. What don't you eat? Um,

1188
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:17.730
I eat a lot of food. Fast food occasionally. Yeah. Occasionally. Man, I'm not,

1189
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.370
uh, I'm not rich. Like I'll eat in and out burger. I love it. Yeah.

1190
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.150
I'm not that rigid burger.

1191
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.640
Are you imagining that it's an elk burger? No. No. I'm just enjoying it.

1192
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.830
Do you consider yourself an elk meat, elk meat advocate? Yes.

1193
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.450
You are. Human milk becomes want to convert people? No. No.

1194
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:42.720
Why not buy a ranch? No, no, no, no. I don't want people to buy it like that.

1195
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.600
I'm not even saying that you should go out and hunt.

1196
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.830
I'm not saying that people should do it,

1197
01:12:46.831 --> 01:12:48.390
but what I'm saying is if you did do it,

1198
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:50.550
you'd have a completely different relationship with your food.

1199
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.930
When I'm eating something,

1200
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.040
there's like a real good feeling that I know that I harvested that thing.

1201
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:58.350
I was out in the woods. I chased it for days.

1202
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.770
I was trying to like get the wind right so that my,

1203
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.470
the wind is on at my back blowing towards the animal I got to sneak up on.

1204
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:09.420
It's slowly I have to figure my way to where I can get a clean shot on this

1205
01:13:09.421 --> 01:13:12.630
animal. Then once I kill it, then we have to drag it out of there.

1206
01:13:12.631 --> 01:13:17.420
We have to cut it up and aim for the head or do you aim for the heart game from

1207
01:13:17.421 --> 01:13:21.450
the heart. But if you have a high powered rifle, there's a lot of um, um,

1208
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.230
people that are chefs that shoot him in the head. There's a,

1209
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.580
they think that it's quicker. Like the, if they die quicker, they taste better,

1210
01:13:29.581 --> 01:13:31.620
but I, they taste delicious. I don't,

1211
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.170
I don't really think there's any need for that. I mean, there's a,

1212
01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:37.110
there's an idea that if the animal has too much adrenaline in it,

1213
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:40.500
like if it's spooked, then it will taint the flavor of the meat.

1214
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:45.000
But what is the universal, I hijacked your show,

1215
01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:46.250
but what is the unit?

1216
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:50.610
What is the unifying thing that comedians,

1217
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:55.530
UFC, fighters and hunters all have in common?

1218
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.760
It's difficult. We're doing difficult things. That pretty unifying thing. Yeah.

1219
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.500
This is difficult pursuit.

1220
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:05.940
Self-Appointed yet comedy is an extremely difficult pursuit.

1221
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.260
The idea of taking an idea, crafting it, and then distributing unit,

1222
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.070
performing it in front of people

1223
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.120
<v 0>who paid money to hear you talk when they can talk to you got to pay money.</v>

1224
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.600
You're not, you're not doing, there's an audacity. Yeah, you're not doing flips.

1225
01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:22.300
You don't have a fucking multimedia show. There's no pyrotechnics.

1226
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.090
But you're just talking and people will pay money,

1227
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.970
get a babysitter dry and you've got to make sure it's right man.

1228
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:32.440
Cause they'll get fucking angry at you is there's a direct correlation between

1229
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:36.760
how happy people are when you make them laugh versus how angry they are if you

1230
01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:40.120
don't make them lie the way I believe that, you know,

1231
01:14:40.121 --> 01:14:44.020
people talk and my tickets are or are not high or anything.

1232
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:48.640
But I think people care more about their time than they do about the money. Yes.

1233
01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.590
It's like, cause if you're a parent, you're like, I got this is my one night.

1234
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:56.350
Yeah. It better be good. Yes. Yes. It's like,

1235
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.770
it's like when you go to a restaurant and you're like, really this is my entree.

1236
01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.330
You know what I mean? Granted I eat out every night, but um, but,

1237
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:09.340
but I used to be healthy when I used to be healthy and I'd have that burger like

1238
01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:11.410
once a month you'd be like,

1239
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.090
this is my burger and it's fat shitty. Now I have like two burgers a day.

1240
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.500
Yeah. And it's like I'm always happy. Well that's good. That's good.

1241
01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.800
But the thing they have in common is that they're all difficult things.

1242
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.110
[inaudible]

1243
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.720
<v 2>incredibly difficult. E there's no bullshit in martial arts.</v>

1244
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.330
You have to hit someone that you don't either hit you or they don't.

1245
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.590
You either win or you don't.

1246
01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.920
It's like it's really cut and dry and it's just a matter of how much effort you

1247
01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:37.170
put into it, how much you've learned, your craft,

1248
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:41.310
how much you've recognized your weaknesses and shored up your holes and your

1249
01:15:41.311 --> 01:15:45.030
defense and your offense and then you execute when you have to.

1250
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.360
Which is means like when it's time for a fight, you perform,

1251
01:15:48.361 --> 01:15:52.170
you rise to the occasion or you don't. Very similar to going on stage,

1252
01:15:52.171 --> 01:15:55.980
not with the same consequences but very similar in terms of like rising to the

1253
01:15:55.981 --> 01:15:56.480
occasion.

1254
01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.570
<v 0>Is it something you have to be, you have to like stand up.</v>

1255
01:15:59.571 --> 01:16:04.280
You have to be doing it like it's not, you know, Eddie Murphy is amazing,

1256
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.110
but the reason he didn't just pop back into doing standup is he understands I

1257
01:16:09.111 --> 01:16:10.790
target like, like I'm friends with him,

1258
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.740
but he understands you have to do it often too. I mean, that's,

1259
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:17.720
by the way, Chris Rock,

1260
01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:23.140
amazing that he literally took like 10 years off and then got back into the

1261
01:16:24.801 --> 01:16:27.050
ritual and the cause. It's a commitment.

1262
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.480
There's nothing really that fancy about it,

1263
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.770
but like when it comes to UFC, Eh, you have to,

1264
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:38.480
you can't just pick it up, right? But hunting, you can pick it up, right?

1265
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:43.410
Or No, you can pick up some kinds of hunting, right? Like you could, you could

1266
01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:46.350
<v 2>pick up rifle hunting for certain animals.</v>

1267
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:50.190
All you'd have to do is understand how to keep your breath under control,

1268
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:53.340
how to not flinch when you pull a trigger, how to aim,

1269
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.390
how to use a weapon properly and have someone that puts you in a good position

1270
01:16:57.391 --> 01:17:00.630
where you know you have a guide, maybe that helps to bring you along.

1271
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:06.110
Bow Hunting is a another level of commitment that requires athleticism.

1272
01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.220
You're most likely going to have be in really good shape

1273
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.010
<v 0>because you're going to have to go into the mountains and just the altitude</v>

1274
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:16.910
alone and then going climbing up hills. You're going up several up and down,

1275
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:21.380
several thousand feet of elevation in a day. And there are grocery stores,

1276
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:24.530
there's grocery stores, grocery stores that serve wild up shocked yourself.

1277
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.420
Fascinating Facet. I think it could sometimes I'll look at,

1278
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:34.970
you know, the, the, the community of Comedians, which I truly enjoy.

1279
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:37.150
I re and you obviously do too. Yeah.

1280
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:42.490
It's like you'll sometimes run into other communities that cause there is this

1281
01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:48.800
solitary nature to it. And then there's this shared obsession.

1282
01:17:48.801 --> 01:17:53.000
Like I sometimes feel like chefs or people that,

1283
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:54.051
you know,

1284
01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:59.051
just even cooks that really get true enjoyment out of it are have that shared

1285
01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:03.620
kind of, you know, like you the prep time, the kind of, uh,

1286
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:05.780
you're doing it for yourself. Like, you know,

1287
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.300
a chef will come to the table and say, do you like your meal?

1288
01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.990
But they don't need someone to approve it. They know.

1289
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.910
So it's like with stand up, it's, it's the respect of your peers too.

1290
01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.390
It's like, it's great. It's gratifying the audience liking it.

1291
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:25.391
But there is something about the creation of the material that is so profoundly,

1292
01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:30.080
uh, uh, approving.

1293
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:35.410
And the also the feedback that you get from an audience that is separate from

1294
01:18:37.311 --> 01:18:40.730
like the supposed fame, dare you put an alarm. I know.

1295
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.070
What are you trying to do? I that's, that's, that means it's time to eat. Help.

1296
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.843
Yeah. No,

1297
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.900
I mean I think many communities that are like important communities have, uh,

1298
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.780
are important to the people involved. They have like,

1299
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.090
they share a lot of common aspects, whether it's comedians or, I mean,

1300
01:18:59.091 --> 01:19:01.700
I think anything that's difficult, right? If there's not,

1301
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:04.820
like when you think about Comedians, there's not that many of us.

1302
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.990
If you really stop to think about there's 300 million people in this country,

1303
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:13.090
how many professional comedians is there? Even a thousand. I mean,

1304
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:17.150
how many people are really making a living off of just doing stand up? I mean,

1305
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.340
I would venture that might be about 250,

1306
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:24.770
which is amazing because by the way, when I started and uh,

1307
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:29.000
and you're around the same period it was, there was like nobody,

1308
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.430
there was no, and by the way and Seinfeld's era, there was even less, nobody,

1309
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.810
Lenny Bruce's era there was like him. And Mort Sahl and like one other guy.

1310
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.290
Yeah. Yeah. Insane. Insane and saying,

1311
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:45.940
but now there's like professors. Yeah, let's stand up.

1312
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:47.660
[inaudible] they're all ridiculous.

1313
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:51.380
I interviewed one guy and he wrote a book on Kaleo.

1314
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:56.090
Well that's ridiculous ideas really. I think that uh,

1315
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:00.530
I think that stand up when people,

1316
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.700
it's like when we try and figure out why a joke works so that we can figure out

1317
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:08.700
how to do another one, we lose it. Like there is some magic,

1318
01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.930
<v 1>there's some magic not to get too, there is something of like,</v>

1319
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:17.520
there's a moment, you know like sometimes singer songwriters talk about this,

1320
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:22.521
that like a song just appears and some of it is we put in the time and we,

1321
01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:28.830
we put in the work on ourselves and kind of like self reflection and we're open

1322
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:33.570
to understanding who our point of view is and we're embracing our embarrassment.

1323
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.430
That kind of opens us to material.

1324
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:40.770
<v 2>Yeah. Then there's also, the more you do it in, the more frequently you do it,</v>

1325
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.030
the more you kind of have a feel for it. And when you take time off,

1326
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.250
that's when it's really weird. Like for me,

1327
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:51.000
I went on vacation recently to Italy and then I went back on stage after like 12

1328
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:55.050
days and I was like, Whoa, do I know how to do this weird feeling until we,

1329
01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.960
oh yeah, you gotta be immersed in it all the time.

1330
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:01.620
But I also think it's great to take those little vacation. Oh,

1331
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.740
you get a great perspective. [inaudible] yeah.

1332
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.540
It's like suddenly you come back and you, you find the piece to the puzzle.

1333
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.910
You make it work, you need like little breaks.

1334
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:15.840
But I think that's the case with virtually everything that we all need

1335
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:20.841
perspective and you need discipline and you need the work ethic to do all,

1336
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.120
to put all the time in and do all the work.

1337
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:28.710
But you also need to think clearly and you need an enthusiasm.

1338
01:21:28.711 --> 01:21:33.600
And sometimes that like it's intelligent and it's disciplined to take a break.

1339
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:36.960
Yeah, it is. It's, I find it hard.

1340
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.860
<v 1>I mean I also like I'm somebody who,</v>

1341
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:45.810
like I always arrive in a market with an hour of new material,

1342
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.060
but, and I have,

1343
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:52.860
there's plenty of people that they do a special and then they take a break and

1344
01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:57.810
they uh, hang out and they might kind of slowly develop more material.

1345
01:21:57.811 --> 01:21:59.430
And to me that is,

1346
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:05.040
I dunno if that's am on both sides of it. I understand the value of it,

1347
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:08.040
but I also, there's, I don't,

1348
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.420
I don't have control of when the stuff's gonna come out. So I kind of want,

1349
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.470
I want to be paying attention when the material comes out cause sometimes,

1350
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.720
you know, the comedians all have this,

1351
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:23.721
it's like you had a great idea but you didn't reach over for your phone when you

1352
01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:25.500
were falling asleep.

1353
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.780
<v 2>It's gone. It's gone. Yeah. That's, I jump up,</v>

1354
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:31.440
I'll, I'll put,

1355
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.620
I'll plug my ears and run out of the room if my wife and kids are talking.

1356
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:37.940
If I was like, yeah, I used to not, I used to not idea,

1357
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:40.530
but my wife is awesome about it. Like shit, I'll just go.

1358
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.410
I have an idea and I just have to say it to her so she doesn't think I'm just

1359
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:46.140
playing with my phone while we're at dinner. I just go, I've got an idea.

1360
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.370
She'll let me chill. Let me do that. But you have to do that.

1361
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:53.220
If you don't do that, those things slip away. They're like a salmon in a river.

1362
01:22:53.221 --> 01:22:57.450
Like grab it, grab it. That's right. And it's gone. The bear. We are the bear.

1363
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:02.430
And then the elk is watching and then Joe shoots the elk and the idea guys,

1364
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.020
what does an elk sound like? Like that bird

1365
01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:11.770
like 500 pounds. And what are they just, are they vegetarian? Yes. Yeah,

1366
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:15.340
they're vegetarians. And what about a bear? Have you ever shot a bear? Yes.

1367
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:20.050
You've been to a brown bear. Black bear. They're very good.

1368
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.840
They taste good, and you have to shoot him. Otherwise they eat everything.

1369
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:26.440
They eat each other, they eat all the elk babies, they eat all the deer babies.

1370
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.200
50% of all elk and deer, Fonz,

1371
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.460
r a l l calves and deer fawns are eaten by bears.

1372
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:38.290
50% wow. Yeah, they devastate populations, but it's a balance of life.

1373
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.290
You know what I mean? It's the circle of love. Yes, but it's a balance.

1374
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:45.310
It's like you have to, there has to be some control predators. Yeah.

1375
01:23:45.311 --> 01:23:47.230
It's so interesting. So interesting.

1376
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.280
It's a wild world and I've been involved in it since like 2012 that's when I

1377
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:53.140
really got into. When you were growing up, you were,

1378
01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:56.020
did you hunt for when you were a kid? I did a lot of fishing.

1379
01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.400
And where did you grow up? Well, I was born in New Jersey, but a,

1380
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:01.540
I lived a lot of places.

1381
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:06.160
I lived down in San Francisco for a while from age seven to 11 I lived in

1382
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:11.161
Florida from 11 to 13 and then Boston from 13 to 24 then New York.

1383
01:24:12.101 --> 01:24:13.870
Then I was in nature or nurture.

1384
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.440
Are you because of you because of life experience or were you born like this?

1385
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:25.570
I think there's a little bit of both for sure. And also some of it is, you know,

1386
01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:27.850
you've been on this self, you know,

1387
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.720
I feel like characterizing this as an insult, but it's not.

1388
01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:35.290
But you are somebody who's like, I'm going to self-improve myself.

1389
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:39.790
I tried to do that all the time. Mentally, physically, everything. Looking buff.

1390
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:42.610
I think you can always do better. Right.

1391
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.120
And so how do you find out if you can do better? What's that?

1392
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.530
Your mentality? Was that your mentality in your early twenties yeah.

1393
01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.520
Then it came from martial arts. Cause if you, if you don't try to get better,

1394
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.230
you wind up getting fucked up. Like as dangerous. Like you get hurt. You know?

1395
01:24:59.231 --> 01:25:01.840
Cause I grew up from, from high school,

1396
01:25:01.841 --> 01:25:06.490
from the time I was 15 until I was 21 all I did was travel the country and

1397
01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:11.020
fight. I competed with Mr Miyagi. No, he wasn't around back then.

1398
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:16.270
But that's, that's really what I did. That's all he did. And so that,

1399
01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:20.140
the mentality had to be constantly looking to improve,

1400
01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:23.310
figuring out what you're doing wrong and figuring out how to do better and,

1401
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:27.340
and being brutally honest about your strengths and weaknesses.

1402
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.710
Oh yeah, we'll be right back.

1403
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.440
It's a weird transition from that in the stand up comedy, you know?

1404
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:33.850
But I think there's some parallels.

1405
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:38.770
There's some parallels because bombing on stage is one of, I've lost fights,

1406
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:41.500
but bombing on stage might feel worse.

1407
01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:45.670
It might be the worst feeling you could ever feel other than like physical pain.

1408
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.700
Yeah, he know there is something about it.

1409
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:52.990
I always think it's weird when people will say, oh, I could never do that.

1410
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:58.180
And in some ways I think comedians we forget because there are,

1411
01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.220
particularly at the beginning there at dark days, there are levels,

1412
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:04.730
humiliation

1413
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.780
<v 1>that most normal people would go, don't ever do this.</v>

1414
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.630
But comedians are such lunatics that they're like,

1415
01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:17.810
that's fine, that's fine. And by the way,

1416
01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:22.450
what they don't realize is there's some of us that break through and we can kind

1417
01:26:22.451 --> 01:26:26.240
of figure it out, but there are some people that try stand up,

1418
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:30.770
fail miserably, have the perseverance, and never get better.

1419
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.980
That's true. It's brutal. There's certain,

1420
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:39.010
there's a certain mindset that never improves and I don't know what that is.

1421
01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:42.470
I don't know if it's a genetic thing.

1422
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.500
If it's a lack of a brain horsepower,

1423
01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.350
there's certain people that just never get it. They never get it.

1424
01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:50.600
And they try and they don't and they just, they never,

1425
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:54.500
they never figured their way through. And there is also something about,

1426
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.510
I have a big belief that comedy changes just as we were talking about,

1427
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.883
you know,

1428
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:04.640
there's a difference between political correctness and like there is a,

1429
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.440
um,

1430
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.440
a cultural trend that's almost kind of looking for someone making a mistake that

1431
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.470
it's shifted every, I, I call it decades.

1432
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:20.390
So like there is a, uh, in the 80s,

1433
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.340
the, uh, you know, at the peak of kind of Seinfeld stand up,

1434
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.680
which transformed into his show.

1435
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.900
He didn't need to provide any autobiographical information.

1436
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:37.430
It was just jokes and there was also, um,

1437
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.240
and it was even Carlin at his peak, he, he wasn't, he,

1438
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:46.520
he would provide some, he was grounded in authenticity, but it wasn't like,

1439
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:51.530
uh, you know, I struggle with whether I'm a good dad or not. It was,

1440
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:55.340
but in this day and age, there is, we're,

1441
01:27:55.350 --> 01:28:00.350
we're such an exhibitionist and voyeuristic culture that there is a requirement

1442
01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:05.690
of that where I think that when I watch stand up and you know,

1443
01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:08.900
and by the way, I also believe that when people go, all my stories,

1444
01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:13.460
everything's true. That's true. It's like it's not true. It's, it's, it's,

1445
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.860
it's inspired by truth, but,

1446
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.590
but authenticity is so important.

1447
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:23.590
So when you hear a comedian say my girlfriend or my father,

1448
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.500
and it's not true,

1449
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.360
like that could have worked in the 80s but I think now the authenticity is the

1450
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:34.820
audience is like, oh, that's a great joke,

1451
01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:39.200
but that's not your girlfriend or your dad or your brother or like,

1452
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.970
do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. You have to.

1453
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Maybe if you are like a real absurdist and like it is obvious you're lying about

1454
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:50.180
everything and that's part of the joke. Oh yeah, yeah. Other than that, yeah.

1455
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:52.160
If you just make up a story. And by the way,

1456
01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:56.960
I also think that in 10 years it might be all light,

1457
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:02.430
but like now in this Kardashians kind of reality

1458
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:07.260
<v 0>show era, people want to see a little bit behind that. You know?</v>

1459
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.620
I mean I think that whether it's a

1460
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:13.140
Bert or Sagura,

1461
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:18.350
there's these stories that people relish in their lives in seeing their lives

1462
01:29:19.081 --> 01:29:21.540
and sharing the experience. And,

1463
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:25.920
and that's something that wasn't necessarily, uh,

1464
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:29.220
prevalent or maybe I'm just talking out my ass. No, no, I think you're right.

1465
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.220
I mean, I think we didn't really know much about comics back in that day.

1466
01:29:32.221 --> 01:29:35.700
We just know about their, I mean prior did this 40 years ago,

1467
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:40.590
but he was an anomaly. He was, he was, you know,

1468
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.750
so unique.

1469
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:47.730
And wouldn't it be amazing to see prior back then on a podcast like see Pryor

1470
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:51.630
and gene wilder sitting down just shooting the shit for hours.

1471
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:55.440
It was an incredible, unbelievable. It's, it's,

1472
01:29:55.441 --> 01:29:58.480
I don't remember when I saw when I, you know,

1473
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:03.530
it was deep into stand up maybe like eight years and I went and consumed prior

1474
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.680
stuff again after, you know, being in the business.

1475
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:12.810
It was so shocking how much had been stolen from him.

1476
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.120
Like entire acts. You're like, oh my gosh, yeah. You know,

1477
01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:21.870
that's in so and so special that's in, you know,

1478
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:26.871
every comedian that comes from a certain area does these jokes and it was like,

1479
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:32.500
he was really revolutionary on so many different levels. Forget the,

1480
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.400
the true gift of like, uh,

1481
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:39.150
being funny and autobiographical and kind of vulnerable.

1482
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:43.530
Like people don't realize that like when he did that show in Long Beach,

1483
01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:46.570
it's like any open for Patti labelle like,

1484
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.810
and people were coming in at the beginning. It's like, yeah,

1485
01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.550
that's absurd that someone that was someone special.

1486
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:56.370
Do you remember when he was doing that special in Long Beach and there was a guy

1487
01:30:56.371 --> 01:30:59.400
who walked up right to the stage with a camera. He's like,

1488
01:30:59.401 --> 01:31:02.010
get the fuck Outta here, man. Go sit down. And he left that in there.

1489
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.810
I left it in the end. And by the way,

1490
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:08.220
people have to understand that that wasn't, you know,

1491
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:12.770
half those people were not, they were there to see Patti labelle. Yeah. Like,

1492
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:17.610
that's really amazing. Yeah. Like that super talent that's like,

1493
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:22.500
you know, like, and I think Chappelle has that [inaudible] it's like just,

1494
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:24.120
you know, I don't know. It's like a,

1495
01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:28.110
almost like a level of genius where he is almost kind of like,

1496
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.120
I'm going to set up a hurdle for myself. Yeah. It's absurd. Well, shit,

1497
01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:36.240
it makes me also constantly working, man.

1498
01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:40.230
Like he just popped into the belly room, uh, two nights ago, just showed up,

1499
01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:43.620
does a set in the belly room two does a set in the, in the main room,

1500
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:46.930
goes over to the Improv, constantly hopping around. You know,

1501
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.090
I've told this story before, but it's a, it's a crazy one. I was in Denver,

1502
01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:55.380
I was doing the comedy works and it's a Friday night at 10 o'clock show I get

1503
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:58.740
done. I go into the green room, Dave's there. I go, what are you doing man?

1504
01:31:58.741 --> 01:32:00.370
He goes, oh, what's up Joe?

1505
01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.610
<v 2>I was just, I decided to come by like he decided to come by,</v>

1506
01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:08.611
meaning he flew into Denver on a private jet with no show set up because he knew

1507
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:11.200
that I was going to be there and wanting to do a set.

1508
01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.190
So he just does what he wants. Like it just shows up when I go,

1509
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:18.190
do you want to go up? He goes, Oh shit. I go, fuck it. Hold on a second.

1510
01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:21.280
I run back on stage. I tell the audience, I go, come back,

1511
01:32:21.281 --> 01:32:24.370
sit down Dave Chappelle's here. They're like, what?

1512
01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:27.640
And so everybody comes back in and sits down. I go, ladies and gentlemen,

1513
01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:32.200
please welcome Dave Chappelle. He goes up and does 40 minutes just free,

1514
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.280
just does it. But he's just doing that all the time. It's not all for money.

1515
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:40.090
It's all for the craft. It's all for performing, working out.

1516
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:43.930
The material just travels around and does these things and just shows us.

1517
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:48.170
He does like 18 shows at the Warner just shows half weeks.

1518
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:52.420
Just does this is always, always on top of it, you know?

1519
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:55.530
And that is why it's not just his, his,

1520
01:32:55.531 --> 01:32:59.290
his obvious talent and his brilliance, but also his work ethic.

1521
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:03.190
All those things combined. It's, there's not one without the other.

1522
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.250
You don't just get the guy who takes six months off and he's just brilliant

1523
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.370
always. And you wake him up and he's got the best set ever. No,

1524
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:12.340
it's like he's constantly grinding constantly.

1525
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:17.710
And I think with our s with this art form that we do, it requires diligence.

1526
01:33:17.711 --> 01:33:21.310
It requires maintenance. It is totally diligent. Yeah.

1527
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:24.280
Do you write on paper? Do you write on a laptop?

1528
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:28.580
<v 1>I do. I don't even have my stuff here, but I'm always putting stuff down.</v>

1529
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:34.160
But like I, uh, you know, some of it's bits and nubs, you know,

1530
01:33:34.161 --> 01:33:38.090
like these are notes from like Ireland. I mean,

1531
01:33:38.091 --> 01:33:43.091
I love being in other cultures cause I not only do you see the eccentric side of

1532
01:33:43.461 --> 01:33:47.030
their culture, but it also exposes how absurd our culture is.

1533
01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:52.760
But yeah, no, it's, some of it is just, and also, you know, it's just,

1534
01:33:54.650 --> 01:33:57.890
uh, just absurd. You know,

1535
01:33:57.891 --> 01:34:01.760
it's like also in another country as opposed to cities.

1536
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:05.240
It's so different. And I am an American so I,

1537
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:10.790
I can just kind of hoarse around for 10 minutes and sometimes I'm doing the

1538
01:34:10.791 --> 01:34:13.220
equivalent of like the subway joke, you know,

1539
01:34:13.221 --> 01:34:14.960
like when people would come to New York and go like,

1540
01:34:14.961 --> 01:34:19.520
I was on the subway and you're like, don't do that. But when I'm like in Spain,

1541
01:34:19.521 --> 01:34:22.790
I'm like, you know what, I'm probably doing the equivalent of a subway joke.

1542
01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:26.870
But they appreciate the research and I really do.

1543
01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.790
I do. I am fascinated by other cultures and I am fascinating, you know,

1544
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:35.780
and kind of observing different things and understanding the history.

1545
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:36.643
It's kind of like,

1546
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:41.730
I think that like visiting other countries is kind of similar to talking to like

1547
01:34:41.731 --> 01:34:44.450
a, a really drunk, angry guy.

1548
01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.110
Like if you're talking to a drunk angry guy and you're like, I understand you.

1549
01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.400
I understand that.

1550
01:34:49.401 --> 01:34:54.401
Like for 400 years the English didn't let you make cheese.

1551
01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.030
Like the drunk angry guys. Yeah. Thank you for understanding that you're,

1552
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:04.820
I mean, and that's, you know, they're not asking for it, but it's fun.

1553
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:09.110
So do you mostly just write down notes and then work those notes out on out on

1554
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:13.850
stage? Yeah, some of it it's, you know, like when I was in Ireland,

1555
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:18.980
uh, and I, I s I went to a Donegall, which I love and I, what is Donnie Gall?

1556
01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.330
It's a county in the Northwestern part of the republic that should be part of

1557
01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:28.310
Northern Ireland, but it was so Catholic, uh, that the British really, you know,

1558
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.690
you guys can keep that one like it's way up there and it's kind of um,

1559
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:35.330
relatively isolated. So there's,

1560
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.940
there's not American tourists.

1561
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.720
It's really kind of just people that live there. And uh,

1562
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:47.770
I spend a week and then I did a show in Letterkenny and um,

1563
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.790
and I kinda was like picking on them, but it was not, you know,

1564
01:35:52.791 --> 01:35:56.450
not the roasting form, but it was just, you know,

1565
01:35:56.451 --> 01:36:00.980
cause it's all Gail talk, you know, like they speak Gaelic. That's so weird.

1566
01:36:00.981 --> 01:36:05.150
What does it sound like? It sounds nothing like English. It's,

1567
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.270
it's really weird cause it's, you know,

1568
01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:11.270
it doesn't have some English sounds in it. I'm not really, well,

1569
01:36:11.271 --> 01:36:13.880
there'll be an English word that they'll just,

1570
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:17.750
I think they add a sheen to the end of an English word. They're like, oh,

1571
01:36:17.751 --> 01:36:19.880
you have to go to the airport itching. And you're like,

1572
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:23.330
well that's what I can barely under. It's kind of like the Scottish,

1573
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:27.290
I can barely understand when they're speaking English, but I loved it.

1574
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:30.500
Northern Islands. Very interesting in that regard. I was in northern,

1575
01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:34.670
I was in Belfast and uh, listening to people that were drunk talk. Oh yeah.

1576
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.430
You might as well been on another planet. Well, by the way, those,

1577
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:42.050
the British isles, including a of the Republic of Ireland,

1578
01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:46.910
there is something so tribal there,

1579
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.620
like there's something really interesting as an American that, you know,

1580
01:36:51.621 --> 01:36:56.240
we have this cute notion of like, I am Irish, I, Hey, I drink too much.

1581
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.880
Whereas like the, uh,

1582
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:02.480
the Irish and the English and the Scottish and the Welsh,

1583
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:05.360
there is something that is there.

1584
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:08.360
It kind of comes out of 11 o'clock at night. You're like,

1585
01:37:08.361 --> 01:37:11.390
you'll see a different side. Like I was at this,

1586
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.190
I was at this House party in Donegall and the next day I ran into the guy who

1587
01:37:16.191 --> 01:37:19.350
goes and there was probably 10 adults there. He's like, catch him.

1588
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:23.750
We drank 29 glasses, 21 nine bottles of wine. And I'm like, what,

1589
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.670
29. And I know that I may be drank one of them,

1590
01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.680
but not, I don't think all the adults drank. You know, by the way in Ireland,

1591
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:38.720
not everyone drinks. It's just the people that do drink really do it.

1592
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.470
Yeah. So there's like, I think someone told me the percentage of,

1593
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:44.750
uh, you know,

1594
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:49.460
Irish that drink is smaller than the rest of Europe,

1595
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.210
but the percentage that do drink and um, I can't even remember was,

1596
01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:56.520
I remember what I going to say, but it's just,

1597
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:59.790
I could talk about Ireland forever cause it's so fast. Oh,

1598
01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.760
but around 11 o'clock at night, there's something that happens. And this,

1599
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:08.550
by the way, this guy was not drunk, but I was at this cocktail party,

1600
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:11.430
this dinner party, and the kids are, everyone has five kids.

1601
01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:14.460
So there's like five kids, there's 400 kids in the backyard.

1602
01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:19.410
And this guy's just railing into me. He's like, he's like, you're, you know,

1603
01:38:19.411 --> 01:38:23.520
the media has already decided that it's Kamela Harris. How can you decide that?

1604
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:27.030
And I'm like, wait a minute. I'm like, first of all, what are you talking about?

1605
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:32.280
And he just consumes. He's doing all this research and this guy, you know,

1606
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.020
uh, but he's convinced. He goes, it's camel Harris, the media, big Bro. Uh,

1607
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.150
big brothers have decided it's Kamilah Harris. And I'm like, whoa.

1608
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.510
And it's just fascinating, but it's, how do they know?

1609
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.440
We don't know a fucking goddamn thing about their people. The, the,

1610
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.860
some of it is, and by the way, people were kind of, how do you know this?

1611
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.840
And some of it, but I bring that up because there was a behind,

1612
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:02.010
it was this tribalism kind of like this. Um,

1613
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.640
you know, and obviously the Irish are very different than the English,

1614
01:39:05.641 --> 01:39:10.050
but there was something about this that was, um,

1615
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:15.100
you know, you, you see it a little bit, you know, uh,

1616
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:16.770
with southerners that are kind of like,

1617
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:19.950
we're going to give you hell kind of thing. But like, and I've see it,

1618
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:22.800
you see it in England all the time, like 11 o'clock. You're like,

1619
01:39:22.801 --> 01:39:25.900
what happened to like Hugh Grant? You know,

1620
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.730
it's just like a different world. Well,

1621
01:39:29.731 --> 01:39:34.150
once they abandoned all the, the niceties, you get to see who they really, yeah,

1622
01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.530
yeah. With a couple of pints home to, it's super authentic,

1623
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:41.160
but it's also like that culture, and I know that you're the,

1624
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.190
but like the whole like, oh, you know,

1625
01:39:44.191 --> 01:39:48.120
what would be fun is to go out and drink a bunch of pints and then we'll get in

1626
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:52.740
a fight. Like, to me, that sounds horrible, but you would like that,

1627
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:55.140
wouldn't you? No, no. I'm not interested in bar fights.

1628
01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.080
I think it's a terrible idea. That's how people die. People get crippled.

1629
01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.250
But people do that all the time. I saw Andy Dick guns conscious.

1630
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:05.700
Did you see that? Oh Man. Yeah. I just saw that video.

1631
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.020
It's really fucked up. Um, I'll send it to you. I hope he's all right.

1632
01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:13.110
He's definitely not all right. He's a frail little fella.

1633
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.870
You got to get out of here. I do. Oh, that's a car. I'm waiting for you.

1634
01:40:15.871 --> 01:40:18.420
I was wondering what's, I have a meeting. What do you happen? What's going on?

1635
01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:20.160
You're a fucking moving around in a shaker.

1636
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:22.470
You're applying or out here in Holly and no, I'm not at all.

1637
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:26.580
But like I have this meeting of, uh, you know, for a TV show.

1638
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:30.230
It's a big producer meeting, but it is you. The last question that you do,

1639
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.460
you do, is it hard for you to balance,

1640
01:40:32.461 --> 01:40:35.940
because I know you've done a lot of acting gigs, but I know you love standup.

1641
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:39.530
Is it hard for you to find like the time balance? It's,

1642
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:44.460
it's different because I love standup. I am a standup.

1643
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:47.580
It's something that I'll have to do. I'm sure it's the same with you.

1644
01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:50.820
It's like it, you're gonna do it until you die. Yes.

1645
01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:53.700
I think some people are like, I can't believe Seinfeld went back to standup.

1646
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:56.200
I'm like, of course he did. He's a comedian,

1647
01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:59.740
but the acting is something that I love,

1648
01:40:59.741 --> 01:41:03.550
but I don't view it as an income source.

1649
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:07.810
He viewed it as a live view. It as it's, it's,

1650
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:12.970
it's something that, and by the way, you're a good actor. Thank you. I love it.

1651
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.180
I love playing a character. I love playing a bad guy. I love kind of,

1652
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:21.610
it seems fun justifying, you know, every actor wants to play someone flawed,

1653
01:41:21.611 --> 01:41:26.611
but I love playing these people that you don't have any sense of doubt why

1654
01:41:28.931 --> 01:41:31.630
you're doing something in a scene. Like you're like, this is all I can do.

1655
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:33.250
And afterwards,

1656
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:36.550
I love the moment when you're at craft service and there's somebody that looks

1657
01:41:36.551 --> 01:41:40.690
at you like the character, they're like, Huh? You know, I mean I usually,

1658
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:42.340
I used to play it a lot of nerds,

1659
01:41:42.341 --> 01:41:45.670
so people would be like dismissive of me and annoyed that I'm like, look,

1660
01:41:45.671 --> 01:41:46.690
I'm not the character,

1661
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:51.490
but I love it when I'm playing someone who's kind of doing something maniacal.

1662
01:41:51.491 --> 01:41:53.870
And people were like, why would you do that? Oh look,

1663
01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.370
I'm just playing a guy that would condemn somebody. I'm not going to kidnap you.

1664
01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:02.230
I enjoy that kind of stuff, but I just, I do too many things as it is. So I've,

1665
01:42:02.231 --> 01:42:05.160
I've kind of sworn off all acting. Really? Yeah. Bam.

1666
01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.440
And at a couple of years ago, what if it was the perfect role? I mean, it's,

1667
01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:12.280
it's highly inefficient, but I just think it's so fun.

1668
01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:16.270
Like I sent you that link to the movie and I want you to watch it because I

1669
01:42:16.271 --> 01:42:19.810
think if you watch it, you're going to go, oh, I get it. Oh, I do get it.

1670
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.790
I get it. I just can't do it. But it's like, that was like, uh,

1671
01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:27.310
I remember that was like three weeks and every, you know,

1672
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.180
on weekends I had shows it was really inefficient. It was all night shoots.

1673
01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:34.390
It was utter insanity. But you're happy with the result.

1674
01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.790
But that's one of those were worked.

1675
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:42.060
There were more experienced in life in general that I think enhances your stand

1676
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:45.070
up. And I think it's difficult for us to look at it that way,

1677
01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.870
but I think the more different things you do,

1678
01:42:46.871 --> 01:42:48.610
the more different experiences that you have,

1679
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:51.640
the more your perspective gets enhanced. And there's,

1680
01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:55.900
there's moments that are almost paralleled that, you know,

1681
01:42:55.901 --> 01:42:59.800
obviously as a comedian, we love the laughs and we love kind of creating,

1682
01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:04.090
changing someone's mood and similar to, you know,

1683
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.600
alleviating the attention and stand up and acting like sitting in that tension

1684
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:15.280
and just kind of twisting the knife and the audience.

1685
01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:20.340
It's kind of exhilarating and something unique that you only going to get an

1686
01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.880
acting. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Jim Gaffigan, you're a bad motherfucker.

1687
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.920
Please tell everybody when your new special drops Friday is Friday,

1688
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:34.540
I think Friday the 16th what is today? Wednesday? Yes. You have two days folks.

1689
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.270
Two days, two days. But they can add it to their watch list.

1690
01:43:37.271 --> 01:43:40.990
But next time you go to Amazon to buy your paper towels, your socks,

1691
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:44.680
just check it out. Checking out bitches please. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1692
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:47.830
Pleasure. Thank you. Thanks for nicotine gum too. Now I'm addicted.

1693
01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:49.960
I totally.
