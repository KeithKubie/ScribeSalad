00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.049
The controversy over "SCIENTIFIC" Japanese
whaling has raged since the banning of commercial

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:14.860
whaling in 1986 -- are the Japanese going
to finally stop their slaughter?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.190
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.300
Whaling has been practiced by humanity in
some form for centuries.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.390
Ancient man hunted whales to ensure our species
survival -- whale oil, meat, blubber, bones

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.390
and skin.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.960
In ancient times, every part of the massive
mammals was used, but today, whaling is a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.230
very profitable enterprise coming at the expense
of these gentle giants.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.190
Many species have seen their numbers drop
to near-extinction levels.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.640
After four years in court, this week, the
United Nations International Court of Justice

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.150
issued a ruling on March 31 ordering Japan
to stop its annual whale hunting around Antarctica.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.079
Their ruling states that Japan was killing
whales illegally, and not for scientific research,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.360
as the country has claimed.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.420
In 1986, the International Whaling Commission
banned whaling for profit, though allowed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.150
for some whaling for scientific research.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.810
Under this ban, countries are allowed to catch
enough whales to determine if whaling could

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.220
be allowed in the future... but the court
found that Japan was taking advantage of that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.340
loophole; catching as many whales as they
wanted and then writing scientific research

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.290
to match how many they killed.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.030
The country's own scientific witness said
he didn't know how the Japanese researchers

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.940
calculated their sample sized, and admitted
their catching of fin and humpback whales

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.940
was useless, scientifically speaking.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.550
The Japanese continued to hunt whales after
the ban, they say, because of tradition.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.910
Whaling has gone on for many generations.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.620
One thousand years ago, the Basques began
the first commercial whaling company.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.299
As technology advanced, the number of whales
killed annually grew.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.090
By 1863, the ships were steam-powered and
by 1868 the harpoon cannon was invented to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.980
shoot explosives into a whales body.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.950
By 1925, the British had built factory ships
which could catch, kill, and process a whale

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.369
without bringing it to port.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.650
In the sixty years that followed, 2 MILLION
whales were slaughtered for profit.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.980
Slowly, the public perception of whales has
changed.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.589
By the 20th century, humans no longer NEEDED
to whale for meat, oil, blubber, bone or skin

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.540
-- they'd all been replaced by newer, more
reliable technologies like modern farming,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.930
kerosene, gasoline, synthetic fabrics and
so on.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.290
As the public tide began to turn, countries
around the world appealed to the League of

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.200
Nations -- the predecessor to the United Nations
-- to do something about it.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.019
Regulations were put in place in 1931 to stop
whales from becoming extinct, but they weren't

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.370
binding.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.680
Bringing us back to the present day, companies
in Japan, Norway and Iceland now have fleets

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.819
of ships accused of whaling for profit and
flaunting the ban.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.459
The Japanese claim their catches are for research,
but since 2005, there have only been TWO scientific

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.930
papers published on only seven whales.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.439
Not to mention the whale meat from this research
ends up in commercial markets anyway.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.459
Activists like the Sea Shepherd follow and
taunt Japanese ships on the open sea in an

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.379
attempt to make whaling more trouble than
it's worth.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.989
Full disclosure, a show about the Sea Shepherd
airs on Animal Planet, one of Discovery's

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:16.989
networks.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.939
In the end, Japan has publicly agreed to stop
whaling.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.049
This doesn't mean they'll never whale again,
but if they do so they'll have to justify

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.629
it with some actual science, and justify KILLING
and not non-lethal methods like tagging or

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.629
sedation.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.629
What do you think?

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.629
Is this tradition?

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.629
Are people making too much of whaling?

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.799
Or is it a horrendous practice?

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.400
We've got comment boxes for a reason, or we're
on twitter at DNews or I'm at trace501 -- let's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.499
wrap about it.
