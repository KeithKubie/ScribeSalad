1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,740
Butterflies. Beautiful. It isn't that
crazy. Orange and black like we love them.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,750
Love them. You find a
spider. You stomp it.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,440
You would never go to a zoo and go into
the moth house. If you kill a lady bug,

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,950
you're an asshole. Oh, completely. You're
a type of person who kills lady bugs.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,600
Yeah,
but if you don't kill Roach,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,880
I can't hang out with you because you let
a roach run across your kitchen floor.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,200
You like sod nom roach,
sadness. I save all.

8
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:27,510
Kill that fucking thing. You got
a roach in your kitchen, lady?

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,080
Yeah.
A lady has little couple dots on it.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,330
Why are we racist with bugs? Because
there's such a thing as beauty. Okay.

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,740
That's why I squirrels get a pass and
rats don't. Yes. Bushy tail. Yeah.

12
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,050
Looking Kewill style,
like a fringe jacket.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,470
She's a tail was just because they found
that if the tails group bushy people

14
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:52,530
would stop killing them. Yeah. I mean,

15
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,640
what's more disgusting than just a
skin tail with nothing on it. Awesome.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,730
Awesome. Tail possums don't
even causing any problems.

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,100
They just see us doing possum.
Taylor do you little fucking get you bat.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,220
We'll give a little that little hands
and your little reptile tail create a

19
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,720
little beady eyes. Disgusting. Yeah,

20
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:17,370
but like we have certain animals
that we liked like raccoons. Look,

21
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,070
we don't wreck like raccoons and they're
eating out of your garbage button. No.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,130
If someone had a pet raccoon, you would
think that's the dopest thing ever.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Can we have, we secretly
want relationships. Raccoons.

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,760
If they would only be nicer to us,
we would embrace raccoons.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Raccoons don't want to have shit to do
with us. They don't. I don't get it.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,850
We got smart. We're too smart
for us. We're nice to them.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,350
I'd like these people are assholes.

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,200
Just wait til they go to sleep and either
trash. We'll just eat their garbage.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,650
Savory ether garbage. They put
lids on it. That shit doesn't work.

30
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,830
They've got the cool black mass. You
lift the lid, you throw it aside.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
He pulled the bag out of hands.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,830
I know if people and say to
the little tiny people, hey,

33
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:56,160
I know you can grab stuff. Smoke
cigarettes, hang out. Yeah. The text,

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,570
they also was kill
chickens. Well, so do we.

35
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,200
Do you know who's a real predator?
Skunks. Skunks are predators.

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,430
There's a skunk living in the back
of my yard. Whew. Sprayed my dog.

37
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,840
Oh No, it's still there.
I think so. Come on Bro.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,470
Man Up. What am I going to do?
Take out the skunk hazmat suit.

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,360
He'd be gun time to go to war.

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,070
I got to go crawl under the thing and
find them crawling to the thing. He goes,

41
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:27,150
look at this fucking hand.
That shit's crazy.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,300
It's like he's flaunting. He was
like, yeah, look at that, huh?

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,120
His hand is so much smaller than his face.
It's crazy.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,180
Imagine if your hand was that small and
relationship is the size of your head.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,070
He's adorable though, isn't he? He is cute
little fellow. I'm just like, look at,

46
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,290
look, you think I've stayed
out of your garbage? No Way.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,570
Look what I'm working with.
Do they have opposable thumbs?

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,890
Because what I'm working with didn't
quite seem like now it's just like five

49
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,370
fingers with no thumb. Right. That's
the thing. They never figured out.

50
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,710
Look at his teeth. They never figured it
out like they had meetings as hands to,

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,230
we just need a thumb. Let me see the
teeth there. He's got his mouth open.

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,940
Your that. Whoa, that. Well that would
really hurt your fucking suck. Look,

53
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,180
one of them's chipped. If, uh,
yeah, from biting you in the head.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,280
Do you think if a rocket attack
do you could fight it off? No.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,770
What do you think you could stomp it?
What'd you do? What'd you give up?

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,030
It might cut your neck.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,800
When would you decide we're going to
to the death immediately. Immediately.

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,050
He wouldn't try to talk to
raccoon out of this. No. Fuck off.

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,240
As soon as he makes a move.

60
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm ready because I've been thinking
about it since childhood. Oh,

61
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,200
look at that one. I don't want that one
bite my nose. Yeah. Looks like a Hyena.

62
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,850
The raccoon I made that thing.

63
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,760
I've been thinking these things
are coming after us my whole life,

64
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,870
so if he makes a move, it's on, Bro.
Those teeth are God damn terrifying.

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,010
Yes. Look at those teeth now and
they're sneaky. That's a big thing.

66
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,670
And they're filled with rabies.
Filled. Yeah, to the top.

67
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,230
Like their balls are heavy with rates.

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,470
It's just oozing out of him
to water balloons. Raccoons.

69
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,800
Is it the sensus touch? Oh, I touched you.

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,250
When raccoons rely on their hands more
than their eyes and going through tachy

71
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,870
study suggested their sensitivity to
touch increases when their hands are wet,

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,930
which might be why they
always wash their food. Wow.

73
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,140
I just washed my hands and now I am
going to touch you when you sleep.

74
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,180
I ain't going to do you and your children
where he was sleeping with my finger

75
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:22,510
hand.
