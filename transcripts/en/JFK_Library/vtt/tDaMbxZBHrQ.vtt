00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:02.133
- And you have people
out there saying, listen,

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.409
I want my representatives
to go to Washington

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:06.642
and repeal Obamacare,
but I want them to keep

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:08.384
the Affordable Care Act.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:10.249
(audience laughing)

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.763
Where do you go from there?

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:16.939
And that, you get to a
situation where we combine this

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.315
immense amount of
cynicism with this immense

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:23.534
amount of ignorance, you can do anything.

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:25.148
You can accomplish almost anything.

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.283
You tell people the moon's
made of green cheese.

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:29.139
I mean, we're almost there, right?

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:30.368
We're back to a flat earth society.

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.219
We have people on the Internet, you know,

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.618
going back to, that the
moon landing was fake.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.949
It shouldn't surprise
us that that's possible.

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.257
And when all of those
things become possible,

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.368
and people have almost
no political literacy,

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.385
you cannot sustain the practices

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:47.179
that sustain a democratic republic.
