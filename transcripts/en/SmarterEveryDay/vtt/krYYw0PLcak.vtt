Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So we're in my daughter's bathroom?

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
I have been informed that there is a spider that ah,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.070
well I'm the dad. It's what I do. I slay spiders.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.120
And so before I destroy him in a fantastic way,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.160
however I choose to do that, I'm going to use

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
these macro tubes on this camera to see if we can get some

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.240
close-up of a brown recluse. So anyway

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
this should be interesting. So here he is.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.310
Let's put one more tube on here. Brown recluses have six

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.350
eyes instead of eight like spiders normally do. They're venomous

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.420
so they inject venom into the body. Most people say poisonous but it's actually venomous.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.440
When brown recluses come in contact with people they only bite

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.480
about 50% of the people, they're not very aggressive. But, one other fact

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.540
that's interesting is that when they come in contact with daddies,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.540
that have little girls, they die by fire

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.580
100% of the time. I wonder if that's the web?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
making material that just blew out the side?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.620
Whatever. It's dead, and it won't hurt my girl.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.780
OK now that seemed a little bit cruel but I don't normally mess around when it comes to my kids. Now before you complain

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.810
in the comments, the reason I didn't kill him immediately is I wanted people who live in this area

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.830
which is where brown recluse spiders live, I wanted them to know exactly what

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840
they look like. You're looking for that upside down fiddle on their back.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.850
Those are the spiders that have hemotoxins in their venom and will hurt you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.910
really bad. These things can live for months without eating or drinking. They hide in

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.020
bedsheets and you get em out of your closet, not even thinking about it. Put em on your bed

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.050
and they bite you and before you know it you've got pieces of your body rotting off.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
I don't always kill spiders, but when I do I try to do it with fire. Anyway, I'm Destin,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.140
you're getting Smarter Every Day. Just kill em with fire, just do that for me. Have a good one.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.190
Going back to the amazon next. Later.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.520
[music]

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.270
It's a scorpion without a tail.
- Oh man.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.280
That is the ugliest beast I've ever seen.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.300
