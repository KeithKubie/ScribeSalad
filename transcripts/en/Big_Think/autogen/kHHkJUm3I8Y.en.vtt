I think we have tremendous tremendous
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120

growth remainders tremendous potential

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130

in exploring the frontier of human

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
in exploring the frontier of human
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020
in exploring the frontier of human
beings we are at just at the very very

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
beings we are at just at the very very
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.749
beings we are at just at the very very
beginning of a very exciting adventure

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
beginning of a very exciting adventure
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.630
beginning of a very exciting adventure
and think of of diseases as common cold

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640
and think of of diseases as common cold
 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.160
and think of of diseases as common cold
right there is nothing terribly unusual

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170
right there is nothing terribly unusual
 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.710
right there is nothing terribly unusual
about common cold right yet we don't

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
about common cold right yet we don't
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.759
about common cold right yet we don't
have a cure for common cold yet which is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
have a cure for common cold yet which is
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.729
have a cure for common cold yet which is
kind of ironic right which means that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
kind of ironic right which means that
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190
kind of ironic right which means that
innovation could be very small for small

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
innovation could be very small for small
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.680
innovation could be very small for small
things like common corn or big things

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
things like common corn or big things
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869
things like common corn or big things
like Alzheimer's and diabetes we have

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
like Alzheimer's and diabetes we have
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030
like Alzheimer's and diabetes we have
multiple products for the diabetes today

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
multiple products for the diabetes today
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.510
multiple products for the diabetes today
we don't have a cure for diabetes yet

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
we don't have a cure for diabetes yet
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700
we don't have a cure for diabetes yet
actually if you add Alzheimer's and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
actually if you add Alzheimer's and
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.920
actually if you add Alzheimer's and
diabetes it could bankrupt our

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
diabetes it could bankrupt our
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560
diabetes it could bankrupt our
healthcare system yet we don't have a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
healthcare system yet we don't have a
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.099
healthcare system yet we don't have a
cure for diabetes and we don't know how

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
cure for diabetes and we don't know how
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.529
cure for diabetes and we don't know how
to deal with Alzheimer's yet so if I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
to deal with Alzheimer's yet so if I
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060
to deal with Alzheimer's yet so if I
look at the future a couple of things

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
look at the future a couple of things
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.820
look at the future a couple of things
will happen one we have phenomenal tools

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
will happen one we have phenomenal tools
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450
will happen one we have phenomenal tools
that will enable us to diagnose and to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
that will enable us to diagnose and to
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210
that will enable us to diagnose and to
be more specific in better understanding

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
be more specific in better understanding
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.789
be more specific in better understanding
the mechanism of virtually any disease

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
the mechanism of virtually any disease
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.999
the mechanism of virtually any disease
and the second aspect would be based on

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
and the second aspect would be based on
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.660
and the second aspect would be based on
that we can start now chartered the the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
that we can start now chartered the the
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240
that we can start now chartered the the
road to better understanding the brain

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
road to better understanding the brain
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340
road to better understanding the brain
we don't know much about the brain we

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
we don't know much about the brain we
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140
we don't know much about the brain we
know a few things here and there but the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
know a few things here and there but the
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.870
know a few things here and there but the
brain is a huge unknown scientifically

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
brain is a huge unknown scientifically
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.660
brain is a huge unknown scientifically
still we don't have a lot of tools yet

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
still we don't have a lot of tools yet
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450
still we don't have a lot of tools yet
to better understand how we think the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
to better understand how we think the
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429
to better understand how we think the
memory and everything related to our

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
memory and everything related to our
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.950
memory and everything related to our
behavior so the brain will be probably

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
behavior so the brain will be probably
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020
behavior so the brain will be probably
the next frontier but we should not

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
the next frontier but we should not
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.859
the next frontier but we should not
forget that we have still about 6,000

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
forget that we have still about 6,000
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539
forget that we have still about 6,000
rare diseases that do not have a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
rare diseases that do not have a
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.179
rare diseases that do not have a
treatment so we have a lot of work to do

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
treatment so we have a lot of work to do
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100
treatment so we have a lot of work to do
and we cannot do it alone I mean money

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
and we cannot do it alone I mean money
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.679
and we cannot do it alone I mean money
and the investment is one thing but we

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
and the investment is one thing but we
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719
and the investment is one thing but we
need to continue working on the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
need to continue working on the
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.630
need to continue working on the
framework of the regulatory agencies and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
framework of the regulatory agencies and
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.600
framework of the regulatory agencies and
how we can partner with the regulators

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
how we can partner with the regulators
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.350
how we can partner with the regulators
to have a clearer path forward to having

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
to have a clearer path forward to having
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300
to have a clearer path forward to having
the new drugs approved the biggest

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
the new drugs approved the biggest
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.089
the new drugs approved the biggest
challenge we face is science is moving

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
challenge we face is science is moving
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.950
challenge we face is science is moving
that so fast

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960
that so fast
 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.020
that so fast
that the regulator's have to catch up

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
that the regulator's have to catch up
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.720
that the regulator's have to catch up
they have to catch up to understand and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
they have to catch up to understand and
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.650
they have to catch up to understand and
catch up even more to regulate us which

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
catch up even more to regulate us which
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.770
catch up even more to regulate us which
is a very daunting challenge and I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
is a very daunting challenge and I
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.190
is a very daunting challenge and I
really believe that the regulator's are

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
really believe that the regulator's are
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.960
really believe that the regulator's are
doing the right things in most of the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
doing the right things in most of the
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.480
doing the right things in most of the
cases but at the same time I can only

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
cases but at the same time I can only
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.240
cases but at the same time I can only
see the challenges that they have to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
see the challenges that they have to
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.190
see the challenges that they have to
better understand how the science is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
better understand how the science is
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.470
better understand how the science is
progressing and you hear every every

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
progressing and you hear every every
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.660

every day about the genomes and our
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.820
every day about the genomes and our
