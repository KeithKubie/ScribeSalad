thing you know it's worked to a certain

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330
thing you know it's worked to a certain
 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.340
thing you know it's worked to a certain
extent with some people but for the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350
extent with some people but for the
 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.690
extent with some people but for the
majority of people they just don't want

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700
majority of people they just don't want
 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.250
majority of people they just don't want
to do it they they can't do it actually

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
to do it they they can't do it actually
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.280
to do it they they can't do it actually
they're literally too busy with things

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290
they're literally too busy with things
 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.680
they're literally too busy with things
that are higher priorities like their

that are higher priorities like their
 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.000
that are higher priorities like their
kids in their family and their job or

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.670
matter it's stuff that they choose to do
and that's fine that's their life and we

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680
and that's fine that's their life and we
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.480
and that's fine that's their life and we
shouldn't kind of require that you

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
shouldn't kind of require that you
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.689
shouldn't kind of require that you
have to spend ages figuring out this

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699
have to spend ages figuring out this
 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.219
have to spend ages figuring out this
political stuff and that's why we're

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229
political stuff and that's why we're
 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.659
political stuff and that's why we're
trying to make it really simple for

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669
trying to make it really simple for
 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.520
trying to make it really simple for
people but based on quite a lot of

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530
people but based on quite a lot of
 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.439
people but based on quite a lot of
complex what technology allows you to do

complex what technology allows you to do
 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.710
complex what technology allows you to do
you can take quite a lot of complex data

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720
you can take quite a lot of complex data
 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.420
you can take quite a lot of complex data
and information like we're doing with

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430
and information like we're doing with
 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.830
and information like we're doing with
the campaign finance records where it's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
the campaign finance records where it's
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.960
the campaign finance records where it's
literally hundreds of millions of pieces

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
literally hundreds of millions of pieces
 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.320
literally hundreds of millions of pieces
of information and we're boiling it down

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
of information and we're boiling it down
 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.420
of information and we're boiling it down
into one piece of information which is a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
into one piece of information which is a
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.700
into one piece of information which is a
score like where is this candidate on

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710
score like where is this candidate on
 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.980
score like where is this candidate on

one of the these experiments that
 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.559
one of the these experiments that
happened was in Holland I think I'll get

happened was in Holland I think I'll get

happened was in Holland I think I'll get
that right um in Europe and they did

they took away traffic lights they even
took it we know stop signs everything

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719
took it we know stop signs everything
 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.959
