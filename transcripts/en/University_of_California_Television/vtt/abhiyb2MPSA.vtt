00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:08.336
(cheerful music)

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:24.457
- I'd like to tell you
about some of the processes

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:28.521
that unfold as the baby
brain grows and develops,

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.683
in particular I'm gonna focus on

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:32.601
the underpinnings of language,

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.941
since language learning
impairment is a feature

00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.973
of so many developmental disorders,

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.330
which we're gonna get into later.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.784
So why look at baby brain function?

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:44.726
Because while we watch
this magical unfolding

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:47.262
of early abilities across development,

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:49.553
we can begin to answer
some very big questions,

00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:52.609
including how do early
events of development

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.275
influence later cognition
and later competence?

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:58.005
What risk factors during early development

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.834
have consequences for
adult behavior or disorder

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.743
and how that might, how
might that be altered,

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:07.075
and how can very early
abnormalities in the functional

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.968
organization of brain networks be causal

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.854
in developmental disorders,

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:16.194
such as language learning
disorder, autism, or ADHD.

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:20.517
And importantly, how early
might biomarkers be detected,

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:24.434
measured and perhaps
remediated with non-invasive

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.517
technologies?

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:30.611
So as newborns, babies can
discriminate the sounds

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:34.778
of every language acoustically
but not linguistically.

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:38.803
So starting at birth, the
baby's developing brain

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:41.517
is constructing an
acoustic map of the sounds

00:01:41.517 --> 00:01:43.110
of his or her native language.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.263
And this gradual process,
perceptual narrowing,

00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:49.726
is thought to be completed
by the end of the first year.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:52.521
Mapping of these acoustic
contrasts is important

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.089
because their salient to
the surrounding language

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:57.349
ultimately allows the
child to respond in a

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.957
fast automatic way to the
incoming language stream,

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:03.574
and it's problematic if
this doesn't go well.

00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:07.741
Because it impacts mounting
of fluent native language

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:11.490
as well as cognition and later reading

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.980
due to difficulties in what's called

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.336
phoneme to grapheme mapping,

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.449
that is matching speech sounds to lens

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.603
which you need to do to read.

00:02:20.603 --> 00:02:22.976
Efficient processing of
basic auditory events

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.024
in the 10s of millisecond domain,

00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:27.153
called rapid auditory processing,

00:02:27.153 --> 00:02:30.192
is critical to mounting language
in normative development,

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.452
and allows the most optimal acoustic maps

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.866
to be constructed.

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.816
And this is because many speech sounds,

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:39.983
phonemes like "da" or "ta"
only differ by brief spectral

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:42.952
and or temporal changes
specifically within

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:44.658
the 10s of milliseconds.

00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:48.559
And differences in these basic
acoustic processing abilities

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.225
have been shown to be
related to both concurrent

00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:54.362
and later language learning difficulties.

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:56.540
Research from my lab strongly suggests

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.206
that the ability to
perform these very fine

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:02.424
acoustic discriminations
within speech or non-speech,

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:05.951
because we mainly look at
pre-linguistic non-speech,

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.633
is critically important
to normative language

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:12.128
and it may go awry in a subset
of developmental disorders.

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:14.826
Moreover, these skills
predict language outcomes

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:17.199
through early pre-reading
and have an impact

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.711
on later learning.

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:20.629
So many of our studies,

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.327
we examine populations at higher risk

00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:26.057
for various disorders as
a consequence of a child

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:29.438
being born into a family
with such disorders.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:31.828
And heritability to study suggest

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:34.493
the risk can be 30 to 60% higher,

00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:37.988
depending on which
disorder and which study.

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:41.856
So how do you measure
brain responses in infants?

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:45.497
You can use eletroencephalography, EEG,

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:48.080
which reflects the summation of

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.706
the synchronous activity
of millions of neurons

00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:54.177
that have similar spatial orientation.

00:03:54.177 --> 00:03:57.606
You can also use brain
invoked related potentials.

00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.223
And this is an average across many trials

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:03.393
to generate an average
wave-form that is timelocked

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:05.327
to external stimulation.

00:04:05.327 --> 00:04:08.253
This permits examination
of the time course

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:11.552
in the brain areas related
to sensory processing,

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:15.421
and you can compare and
contrast group response

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.322
as well as compare individual
responses to group norms.

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:22.020
Research suggests that brain oscillations,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.864
which are cyclic fluctuations
of the membrane potential

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.839
in brain cells control
neuronal excitability,

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.497
integrate sensory inputs

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:31.918
and may coordinate higher-level functions

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.210
such as language, memory and learning.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.331
However, neural dynamics whose
just beginning to be studied

00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.631
in the human infant, our
previous studies in pilot data

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:43.540
strongly suggest that oscillatory dynamics

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.621
and their hierarchical organization

00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:47.620
have a developmental timeline

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.496
and may capture disruption
in normative development.

00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:53.748
So how can you look at that?

00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:56.446
You can look at the EEG.

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:59.241
And you can do something called
a fast foraying analysis,

00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:00.818
this is one way of doing it,

00:05:00.818 --> 00:05:03.568
which breaks the EEG pattern down

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.230
into its component frequencies.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.074
Synchronized neural oscillations
in these low frequencies,

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:14.000
Delta, Theta and Alpha
are thought to provide

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.381
key mechanisms that orchestrate
network coordination

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.770
during development, and may
be involved in information

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.485
transfer among brain areas.

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:24.435
Theta oscillations in particular

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:27.474
are important for perceptual
and cognitive functions,

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:30.319
such as declarative and episodic memory,

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.806
and have been proposed
as a neural mechanism

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:34.724
subserving phonemic discrimination,

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:37.227
which is one of the reasons
we're very interested in it.

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:40.852
Gamma oscillations from
30 to 80 or 90 Hertz

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:43.306
may represent synchronized activity

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:46.313
of local neuronal populations

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:48.426
during sensory and cognitive processes,

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:51.092
but may also, particularly high Gamma,

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:54.554
play a role in coupling
of remote cortical areas.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.382
So given that activity
in this Gamma frequency

00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:59.527
has been linked in humans and animals

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:02.274
to a wide variety of
higher cognitive processes,

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:04.696
including attention, memory and language,

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:08.288
we first examined power
density in frontal cortex

00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:11.750
across the language burst
in two groups of children.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.116
And I'm gonna give you
a few little snippets

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:14.449
of some studies.

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:20.024
We studied the power of spectra
in two groups of children

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:21.698
with and without a family history

00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:23.404
of language learning impairment,

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:26.151
at 16, 24 and 36 months of age,

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.402
when this huge burst in language occurs.

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:32.474
We found that individual
differences in frontal gamma power

00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:36.473
during rest highly correlated
with concurrent language

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:39.154
and cognitive skills at all ages.

00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:40.666
Children with a family history

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.901
of language learning impairment

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.526
had lower frontal gamma at all ages.

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:48.582
Power was also associated
with attentional measures,

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:51.215
children who were observed as having

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:53.312
better inhibitory control

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.360
and more mature attention
shifting abilities

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.278
had higher power.

00:06:57.278 --> 00:06:59.569
We continued to follow this group

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.121
and we found that examining gamma across

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.991
the language burst strongly predicted

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:08.158
to both cognition and language
at ages four and five years.

00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.111
We saw that at 16, 24 and 36 months,

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:17.368
resting gamma was
associated with four year

00:07:17.368 --> 00:07:19.919
language comprehension scores

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.999
and word structure and
sentence structure scores.

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.112
And at 24 and 36 months,

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.241
gamma power was significantly associated

00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.159
with five-year sentence imitation,

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.500
which is really important for pre-readers,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.011
36-month gamma power was
also significantly associated

00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:38.888
with five-year syntactical skills.

00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:40.973
So what's the take-home message here?

00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:45.422
We believe that the capacity
to generate higher power

00:07:45.422 --> 00:07:48.705
in the gamma range at these
crucial developmental periods

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:51.615
may index better modulation of attention

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:55.077
and allow easier access to working memory,

00:07:55.077 --> 00:07:58.279
providing an advantage
for overall development,

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.944
particularly in the linguistic domain.

00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:02.619
We were then interested in examining

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:04.894
oscillatory support in younger infants,

00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:08.642
so using event-related
potential, source localization

00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:12.241
and a time-frequency analysis
of event-related oscillations,

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.833
so from source, we examined
the neural substrates

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:19.279
of rapid auditory processing
in four-month-olds.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:21.376
Animal models and adult experiments

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.944
suggest that oscillatory synchrony,

00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:26.658
and in particular
low-frequency oscillations

00:08:26.658 --> 00:08:28.576
in the delta and theta range,

00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:31.486
play key roles in rapid
auditory processing

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.664
and auditory change detection.

00:08:33.664 --> 00:08:36.232
So we hypothesized that
synchronized activity

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:38.312
in brain oscillations in left and right

00:08:38.312 --> 00:08:40.734
auditory cortices would support

00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:43.562
rapid frequency discrimination in infants.

00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:47.236
Moreover, we thought that
infant perception of rapid pitch

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:49.901
and timing changes, which is so critical,

00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:52.648
should be mediated in part at least

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:55.184
by oscillatory mechanisms.

00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:57.736
These issues had not been
looked at in infants at all

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.020
in human infants.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.187
We used two sets of stimuli,
speech-like tones (beeping),

00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:09.308
and a control condition

00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:13.063
that was out of the speech-like range.

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:15.355
So we found, this is a very busy slide,

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.948
but I'll walk you through it.

00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:19.289
You're gonna see some of these figures

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:22.832
that show pooled
oscillatory power over time,

00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:26.457
with frequency on the
x-axis, time on the y-axis

00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:29.496
for these complex tone
pairs in the control rate

00:09:29.496 --> 00:09:32.389
and in the rapid rate,
the speech-like rate.

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:34.795
And these are for standards,
the background sounds,

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:37.168
these are deviants, the ones that change,

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:39.411
and this is the difference
between the two.

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:41.752
Base synchronization is in red,

00:09:41.752 --> 00:09:43.930
desynchronization is in blue.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.838
And what we saw was that there
was enhanced phase-locking

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:52.235
to variant tones in both rate conditions.

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:55.161
Larger and faster activation
in the right hemisphere

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.591
at both rates.

00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:59.631
However, left auditory
activity was enhanced

00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:02.882
only during Rapid Rate presentation.

00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:06.766
We also gave these babies
a go/no-go behavioral task

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:08.652
at their second visit.

00:10:08.652 --> 00:10:11.464
Auditory perception was
measured by the infant's ability

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:15.544
to learn a reward contingency
for a deviant tone in a pair,

00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:17.592
and the number of trials it took the baby

00:10:17.592 --> 00:10:21.590
to get four out of five
correct was their criterion.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.507
And we did a median split with
faster and slower learners

00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:28.287
and what you see is
that tone discrimination

00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:31.456
is strongest for the
children who learn faster.

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:33.374
We also saw that slower learners

00:10:33.374 --> 00:10:35.325
had smaller power differences

00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:38.770
between their standard
and deviant responses.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.785
And this is, suggests that
they had a lot of difficulty

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:45.613
discriminating one signal from another.

00:10:45.613 --> 00:10:47.873
So the take away message here is that

00:10:47.873 --> 00:10:50.408
local low frequency oscillatory synchrony

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:53.740
underlies rapid processing
and can robustly index

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.244
auditory abilities in young infants.

00:10:56.244 --> 00:10:58.454
And recruitment of the left hemisphere

00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:01.526
during rapid frequency change
suggests a difference in the

00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:03.607
spectral and temporal resolution

00:11:03.607 --> 00:11:05.069
of the right and left hemispheres,

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:07.312
even at this very early age.

00:11:07.312 --> 00:11:10.124
Moreover, we were able to predict behavior

00:11:10.124 --> 00:11:14.871
in a go/no-go task by looking
at oscillatory brain power.

00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:16.870
So the question is if we can find deficits

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.243
so early in life, can we alter them

00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:21.567
using the exquisite plasticity typical

00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:23.892
of this early developmental time period,

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.467
while infants are setting
up their acoustic mapping?

00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:29.499
Can we make the baby a better processor

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:32.685
and can we see
intervention-specific changes

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:35.188
in the brain waves and
oscillatory patterns

00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:37.821
that reflect enhanced processing?

00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:40.617
So can we look for some causal mechanisms?

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.169
And so we did a study, we
did a couple of studies,

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.046
and looking at plasticity
in developing brain

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:48.451
and seeing if active auditory exposure

00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.848
would impact prelinguistic
acoustic mapping.

00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:54.091
And I'm gonna go through
this pretty quickly,

00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:57.310
but the paper's published if you need it.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.268
So we looked at the neural
correlates of acoustic mapping

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:03.210
with dense array EEG/ERP before and after

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.013
a six-week interactive,
progressive acoustic experience.

00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:10.713
We used a operantly-conditioned
go/no-go active paradigm

00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:12.182
with an eye-tracking control,

00:12:12.182 --> 00:12:16.349
so the baby could actually
manipulate the experiment.

00:12:17.822 --> 00:12:20.390
And we used a passive control

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.072
and a naive maturation control.

00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:24.145
And here's the study design,

00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:27.266
two longitudinal arms,
one with active training,

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.054
one with passive training,

00:12:29.054 --> 00:12:32.126
and two, a cross-sectional sample

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.613
of children who were not trained.

00:12:34.613 --> 00:12:37.002
So what did they get
when they were trained?

00:12:37.002 --> 00:12:40.496
Once a week for six weeks,
for six to eight minutes,

00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:42.609
the babies were trained
on three different types

00:12:42.609 --> 00:12:46.120
of paired stimuli, complex
tones, bandpass noise,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.469
frequency sweeps presented at varying ISIs

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:51.062
and varying complexities,

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.418
using an up-down staircase procedure.

00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:55.434
So if the baby got it
right, it got harder,

00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:57.319
they got it wrong, it got easier,

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:00.229
and so they went up and down
until they reached criterion.

00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:02.391
The passive group got the same stimuli

00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:06.145
and the same time exposure,
but passive with no feedback,

00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:08.811
and we didn't train the naive children.

00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:10.804
After they were trained,

00:13:10.804 --> 00:13:13.387
we collected data on ERPs, EEGs

00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:16.413
that they had been trained on,

00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:20.948
as well as different types
of generalization stimuli,

00:13:20.948 --> 00:13:25.115
so we looked at deviants with
spectral temporal parameters

00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.221
that significantly differed
from the training stimuli,

00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.691
one with the gap, one with
the differing duration,

00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.227
and one with frequency.

00:13:34.227 --> 00:13:35.105
So what did we see?

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.828
Yes this is a monster figure,

00:13:36.828 --> 00:13:41.102
so we're not gonna talk about
the grand average wave-forms,

00:13:41.102 --> 00:13:43.606
I'm gonna just pull out the information

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:47.133
about these time-locked
age appropriate topograms

00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:49.633
to first of all, this P2 peak.

00:13:50.709 --> 00:13:52.415
And this is a peak that happens

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.658
that's an attentional peak.

00:13:54.658 --> 00:13:58.819
And what we see here is
around each topogram,

00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:01.192
if it has a red box, it
means there was significantly

00:14:01.192 --> 00:14:02.948
faster latencies.

00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:05.776
So the active group was
significantly faster

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:09.943
than both the passive and the
naive groups on this peak.

00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:13.935
And then we also were
interested in looking at

00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:16.227
what's called the N2 star.

00:14:16.227 --> 00:14:18.178
And this is the change discrimination peak

00:14:18.178 --> 00:14:21.315
that happens right before
the baby discriminates

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:22.232
the signal.

00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:27.394
And it's important because
it's been shown to be

00:14:27.394 --> 00:14:31.311
a robust infant predictor
of later language.

00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:35.472
So both of the auditory
groups, experienced groups,

00:14:35.472 --> 00:14:38.511
were significantly faster
than the naive controls,

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:40.755
but the actives had a larger amplitude

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.258
compared to both other groups

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:46.925
and showed a left
hemisphere lateralization.

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:52.652
We then looked at the signals that were

00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:54.835
generalization stimuli,

00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:56.846
and what you can see in these bar graphs

00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:59.008
is mean latency of each deviant

00:14:59.008 --> 00:15:01.527
at each of the nine electrode sites.

00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:04.892
For P1, that's the first
sensory peak that signals

00:15:04.892 --> 00:15:07.232
that a stimulus has been perceived.

00:15:07.232 --> 00:15:10.207
And what you can see here for the gap,

00:15:10.207 --> 00:15:12.482
for the duration and the frequency is,

00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:15.554
the active group was significantly faster

00:15:15.554 --> 00:15:18.708
at all nine electrode sites.

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:22.982
So we demonstrated that
while both active and passive

00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:26.136
acoustic experience from
four to seven months

00:15:26.136 --> 00:15:27.972
modulated non-speech stimuli,

00:15:27.972 --> 00:15:31.955
active experience conferred
a significant advantage,

00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:34.328
that active experience increased attention

00:15:34.328 --> 00:15:37.205
to environmental acoustic stimuli,

00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:39.740
and that faster latencies were seen

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.561
for the change discrimination peak

00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.064
that has been shown to be
a robust infant predictor

00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:45.445
of later language.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.534
Moreover, we saw a
generalization to both trained

00:15:48.534 --> 00:15:51.118
and untrained stimuli
over and above that seen

00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:52.868
for maturation alone.

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:57.489
And do these intervention
effects generalize to language?

00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:59.700
I can just say yes because I think

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.407
we're just about at the end,

00:16:01.407 --> 00:16:03.699
but just let me show you this high gamma

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:07.453
at nine months, we can
look at them longitudinally

00:16:07.453 --> 00:16:09.160
and you can see that for the actives,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.394
you have this very high gamma input here,

00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:14.247
which is a prominent characteristic

00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:16.214
of early sensory processing

00:16:16.214 --> 00:16:18.408
and may index cortical activation,

00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:21.903
given larger high but
not low gamma responses

00:16:21.903 --> 00:16:25.739
are correlated with increases
in overall firing rates,

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:29.526
particularly during
attentional modulation.

00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:32.143
And with that, I'll show you our prototype

00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:36.310
that does the same intervention
in the baby's home.

00:16:39.425 --> 00:16:40.258
And that's the end.

00:16:40.258 --> 00:16:42.919
(applauding)

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.666
- So yeah, I wanna, I
really wanna follow on

00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:49.388
in this wonderful vein
of discussion and thought

00:16:49.388 --> 00:16:52.152
that we've had so far this, today.

00:16:52.152 --> 00:16:54.660
Thinking about this question,
making an brain young,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.930
as I get older, I want to be younger.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.181
So this is part of it, but
I really wanna consider

00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:04.407
how we can take lessons from understanding

00:17:04.407 --> 00:17:07.398
the child's brain and
see if we can apply them

00:17:07.398 --> 00:17:10.031
to the adult brain or the aging brain

00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:14.631
or the neural, the brain
with neuralpathology.

00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:17.849
And so first before I actually do that,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.932
I really wanna talk about

00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:24.269
the concept of what a critical period is,

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:26.675
and just remind you that

00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:28.723
a developmental critical period

00:17:28.723 --> 00:17:31.600
is a period during which time

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.769
its special experiences are essential

00:17:34.769 --> 00:17:37.581
for the later functioning of the brain,

00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:40.426
and that's because these
experiences are essential

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.263
for tuning up brain circuits,

00:17:42.263 --> 00:17:45.270
and I wanna talk about that in
much more detail in a minute,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.439
but a good example of a
developmental critical period

00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:50.357
that I've experienced alas myself

00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:52.226
is one for language learning.

00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:53.770
Obviously you can learn throughout life,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.090
you can learn languages
just throughout life.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.508
But learning a language
without an accent as an adult

00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:02.466
is extremely difficult,
whereas we all know now,

00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:06.010
it's extremely easy to learn
many languages perfectly

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.009
as a young child.

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:10.756
And this has been my regret my whole life.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.763
Now how, so here's the concept, basically,

00:18:13.763 --> 00:18:16.932
which is if we could only understand

00:18:16.932 --> 00:18:19.760
the underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.881
that regulate these
developmental critical periods,

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:24.653
maybe we could then apply them.

00:18:24.653 --> 00:18:26.555
Either in aid of repair,

00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:29.513
to reverse developmental neuropathology,

00:18:29.513 --> 00:18:31.496
or maybe even as a cognitive enhancer,

00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:34.633
so I could learn French for
example without an accent.

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:38.127
Now in trying to
understand how this works,

00:18:38.127 --> 00:18:42.158
obviously at the level
of molecules and cells

00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:44.792
we really need to get into the brain,

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:48.400
and it's possible to
do this in mice models.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.163
And in fact, mice as far as I know,

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:54.755
have not been learning
second or third languages.

00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:58.868
But mice, just like us,
have binocular vision.

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:01.111
So here's the question.

00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:03.955
Have you ever thought about
why it is you don't see double?

00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:06.621
I mean, what's happening
right is you have two eyes

00:19:06.621 --> 00:19:10.001
and each eye is sending a
complete view of the visual world

00:19:10.001 --> 00:19:13.594
to your brain, and yet, we
only see one view of the world

00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:15.707
unless there's some pathology.

00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:18.193
And one of the reasons
that we don't see double

00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:22.403
is because in fact, the
neuro circuitry for vision

00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:26.223
brings the connections
from the two eyes together

00:19:26.223 --> 00:19:28.807
in the central part of
the visual pathways.

00:19:28.807 --> 00:19:31.766
And let me just show you
a very simplified diagram

00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:32.806
of that now.

00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:36.951
So the point is, that the
output neurons from the eyes,

00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:39.275
these RGCs, the ganglion cells,

00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:44.119
send their connections to
central structures, like the LGN

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:47.191
and then beyond that from the LGN

00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:48.735
to the primary visual cortex,

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:51.644
so vision doesn't happen,
visual perception doesn't happen

00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:53.513
in your eye, it happens in your brain.

00:19:53.513 --> 00:19:56.634
And so these first few
steps you can see already

00:19:56.634 --> 00:20:00.047
how the wiring is bringing
the two eyes together.

00:20:00.047 --> 00:20:03.054
So for example, one of these RGCs here

00:20:03.054 --> 00:20:06.598
is sending its connection
across to this LGN,

00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:10.060
another one from the other
eye is sending its connection,

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.222
and already you can see
that the information

00:20:12.222 --> 00:20:14.757
from the two eyes is
beginning to be combined,

00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:18.252
and then at the next stage
in information processing,

00:20:18.252 --> 00:20:21.470
that information is
again even more combined,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:26.015
in fact there's a rather
beautiful, in this case,

00:20:26.015 --> 00:20:28.481
left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye,

00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:31.165
left eye, right eye kind of
intermixing of the inputs

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:34.736
from the two eyes and actually
those intermixed inputs

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:38.008
make connections finally with
these little gray circles

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:40.722
and these connections
are the target neurons

00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:44.477
that fall off, become the basis
for your binocular vision,

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:45.631
in other words they're getting input

00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:48.085
from both the right eye and the left eye.

00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:51.385
Now before I go further, I
wanna define more what I mean

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:53.563
about connections, I'm
talking about connections,

00:20:53.563 --> 00:20:56.554
but what I really mean
in neuroscience terms

00:20:56.554 --> 00:21:00.016
is synapses, the synapse,
what is a synapse,

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:02.226
so let me just define a synapse.

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:05.119
A synapse is the junction or connection

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:08.988
between one neuron and the
next neuron along the line,

00:21:08.988 --> 00:21:10.873
passing information and by the way

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:15.863
also doing some computations
as the information is passed.

00:21:15.863 --> 00:21:18.821
And in fact, you are your synapses.

00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:21.926
What I mean by that is
your synapses get tuned up

00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:24.332
during developmental critical periods,

00:21:24.332 --> 00:21:27.842
and even if you are genetically
identical to your sister,

00:21:27.842 --> 00:21:30.020
your twin or whatever, in fact,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.052
your brain synapses are different

00:21:32.052 --> 00:21:34.767
because the pattern of
tuning is slightly different

00:21:34.767 --> 00:21:36.473
in each case.

00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:38.050
So you are your synapses.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.927
Synapses change with learning.

00:21:40.927 --> 00:21:43.430
Memories are stored at synapses.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.916
And sadly, in Alzheimer's
disease, synapses are lost,

00:21:47.916 --> 00:21:51.589
and so let's just remember
that as I talk further.

00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:53.756
Now what's amazing is that

00:21:55.182 --> 00:21:59.349
in animal models, it's
possible to visualize synapses.

00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:04.934
So we can go down to the
level of just a few microns

00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:07.925
and actually see and test synapses

00:22:07.925 --> 00:22:10.558
and understand how they
work in the animal models,

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:14.670
like in the mice or
even in higher mammals.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.011
And many years ago this
experiment was done,

00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:19.953
and it's actually possible to visualize

00:22:19.953 --> 00:22:22.456
this really beautiful left eye, right eye,

00:22:22.456 --> 00:22:25.536
left eye, right eye, left
eye, right eye pattern

00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:29.022
of synapses in the visual cortex,

00:22:29.022 --> 00:22:32.289
and I just wanna show you
a very famous picture now

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:34.955
from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's lab.

00:22:34.955 --> 00:22:37.296
And at this scale, let me just point out

00:22:37.296 --> 00:22:41.379
that these white blobs
over here on the left are,

00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:43.862
they're supposed to be grains of rice,

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.829
so this gives you some sense of scale,

00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:48.037
those are grains of rice,

00:22:48.037 --> 00:22:51.403
and here you see one eye,
let's say the right eye,

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:55.207
was labeled with a white tracer substance

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.856
that gets all the way to the visual cortex

00:22:57.856 --> 00:23:02.375
and labels all the synapses
that are functionally connected

00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:05.008
to the white right eye.

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:07.706
And so you can see, what I
told you that there's this

00:23:07.706 --> 00:23:10.778
beautiful right eye, left
eye, right eye, left eye,

00:23:10.778 --> 00:23:13.005
right eye, left eye striping pattern.

00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:15.340
And at this scale, what
you're looking at really is

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.165
hundreds of thousands of
these synapses at this scale,

00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:21.749
where every little dot is
about the size of a synapse.

00:23:21.749 --> 00:23:24.464
Now when neuroscientists first discovered

00:23:24.464 --> 00:23:28.544
this beautiful striping pattern
of synaptic connections,

00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:30.754
they thought it had to be hard-wired,

00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:32.895
it's much too beautiful,
much too reproducible

00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:34.915
to be left to chance.

00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:37.126
But in fact it turns out

00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:41.417
that during post-natal,
critical period of development,

00:23:41.417 --> 00:23:44.781
this pattern has to be
tuned up, in other words,

00:23:44.781 --> 00:23:48.861
even using both eyes
together for binocular vision

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.901
requires an experienced dependent period.

00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:54.989
And in fact, one way
that this was discovered

00:23:54.989 --> 00:23:57.492
is in trying to understand
what's different between

00:23:57.492 --> 00:23:58.906
childhood cataract

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:01.442
and cataract that you
might get as an adult,

00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:03.148
or your grandmother might get as an adult,

00:24:03.148 --> 00:24:06.139
where if you have normal
vision your whole life,

00:24:06.139 --> 00:24:10.024
and then you lose vision in one
eye for some period of time,

00:24:10.024 --> 00:24:12.153
when the optics are corrected,

00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:14.819
then you can see again
perfectly as an adult,

00:24:14.819 --> 00:24:18.151
and that's because these
beautiful stripes are stable.

00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:21.434
However, during a developmental period,

00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:24.197
these stripes are not stable,
they're getting tuned up.

00:24:24.197 --> 00:24:26.944
And if a child has a congenital cataract

00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:30.195
that's not corrected
early on in development,

00:24:30.195 --> 00:24:34.031
then the eye that's good gets way more

00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:36.176
than its fair share of territory,

00:24:36.176 --> 00:24:39.915
so way more white synapses
in the visual cortex

00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:42.174
than the bad eye gets.

00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:45.929
And the bad eye actually
loses synaptic connections,

00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:48.058
in fact those connections are pruned

00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:52.642
and Jay referred to this, I
think several of our previous

00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:54.885
speakers talked about
this idea of a period

00:24:54.885 --> 00:24:56.819
when there's a lot of synaptic remodeling

00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:58.802
and pruning going on.

00:24:58.802 --> 00:25:01.386
And that's what I wanna
really talk about now.

00:25:01.386 --> 00:25:03.597
So let me just summarize by saying,

00:25:03.597 --> 00:25:06.132
what you see now before your
eyes is a really beautiful

00:25:06.132 --> 00:25:10.131
example of synaptic plasticity, that is

00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:13.691
the ability of a neural
circuit to change its pattern

00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:16.031
of connections based on use.

00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:18.697
And this is an experience
dependent change,

00:25:18.697 --> 00:25:21.785
and in this case, it happens
only during a developmental

00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:23.638
critical period in the sense that

00:25:23.638 --> 00:25:25.556
after the critical period is over,

00:25:25.556 --> 00:25:27.962
which in us is around the age of six,

00:25:27.962 --> 00:25:30.660
these connections become stable

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.862
and they can't change this
dramatically at later ages

00:25:33.862 --> 00:25:37.069
which is why grandma can see
even after having a cataract

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:39.827
for a long period of
time, whereas the child,

00:25:39.827 --> 00:25:42.996
if the cataract isn't fixed quite soon,

00:25:42.996 --> 00:25:46.003
will be permanently blind in
the eye that was not used.

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:48.913
So this is a real use it
or lose it kind of thing.

00:25:48.913 --> 00:25:52.034
So let me just summarize
here again by saying then

00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:55.918
that the baby's brain, just
like the adolescence brain,

00:25:55.918 --> 00:25:59.120
is not a miniature version
of the adult brain.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.623
It's a dynamically changing structure.

00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.671
And part of the change that's happening,

00:26:03.671 --> 00:26:05.589
and we can see it in the animal models,

00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:08.044
like mice for example,
is that there's this

00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:11.376
synaptic remodeling,
so synaptic plasticity

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:14.627
is the basis for these
developmental critical periods,

00:26:14.627 --> 00:26:16.252
and during this time,

00:26:16.252 --> 00:26:20.754
many immature synapses,
the ones that are used

00:26:20.754 --> 00:26:23.290
get strengthened and stabilized,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.281
and the ones that are not are pruned away.

00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.244
So there's a kind of pruning
versus a growth period.

00:26:29.244 --> 00:26:33.156
So now, the question is, how
in the world does this work?

00:26:33.156 --> 00:26:36.505
How is this happening and if
we could only understand it,

00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:39.723
we could restore plasticity
maybe to the adult brain,

00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.933
but in order to do it,
really have to understand

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.762
what are the underlying
molecules and mechanisms

00:26:44.762 --> 00:26:46.972
that actually are
responsible for this kind of

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.630
pruning process.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.702
So for many, many years
ago, we worked very hard

00:26:51.702 --> 00:26:54.709
to discover molecules that
might be involved in pruning.

00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:57.342
And I wanna tell you about one.

00:26:57.342 --> 00:26:59.634
So this molecule is a big mouthful.

00:26:59.634 --> 00:27:01.812
It's called PirB.

00:27:01.812 --> 00:27:06.477
It's called paired
immunoglobulin-like receptor B.

00:27:06.477 --> 00:27:08.899
And it's very cool that it's a receptor.

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:10.930
The reason I emphasize that is because

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.807
if you have a receptor, it
can be targeted for a drug

00:27:13.807 --> 00:27:16.083
or a pill, as I said
this is like my dream,

00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:19.355
but we're not there yet, but
it's good that it's a receptor.

00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:23.316
And the question is, how can
we show that this molecule

00:27:23.316 --> 00:27:26.437
is actually involved in plasticity?

00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:30.305
So one way that it's
possible in a mouse anyhow,

00:27:30.305 --> 00:27:33.296
is, well first of all I
should say that this molecule

00:27:33.296 --> 00:27:36.270
is present in the brain,
it's in the neurons,

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.757
happily it's in our
favorite parts of the brain

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.594
that we like to study all the time.

00:27:40.594 --> 00:27:42.577
The visual cortex in the mouse

00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:44.576
and the hippocampus in the mouse.

00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:45.828
So it's there.

00:27:45.828 --> 00:27:48.412
Now how can we actually
study its function?

00:27:48.412 --> 00:27:50.216
Well in mice,

00:27:50.216 --> 00:27:53.256
it's possible to remove
that particular molecule

00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:55.759
by taking away just that gene

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.531
from the whole genome of the mouse,

00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:59.286
so there're 30,000 genes or so,

00:27:59.286 --> 00:28:01.285
and one can remove just that gene

00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:05.007
and from the very beginning
of development for instance,

00:28:05.007 --> 00:28:09.591
so we can make what's known
as a PirB gene knockout.

00:28:09.591 --> 00:28:12.403
And we can then either remove the gene

00:28:12.403 --> 00:28:14.061
from the very beginning of development,

00:28:14.061 --> 00:28:16.791
or if we're really fancy we
can take it away at any time

00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:21.148
of life and then we can
test is this gene needed

00:28:21.148 --> 00:28:23.326
for whatever, synaptic plasticity.

00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:26.024
And the bottom line
is, what we discovered,

00:28:26.024 --> 00:28:29.973
is that in fact, in these gene knockouts,

00:28:29.973 --> 00:28:33.501
in fact there is not
always the gene needed,

00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:36.313
but there's actually
more synaptic plasticity

00:28:36.313 --> 00:28:39.092
than normal, and I'm happy
to talk about this later,

00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:40.604
but just take my word for it,

00:28:40.604 --> 00:28:44.196
PirB is needed for synaptic plasticity.

00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:46.487
And so then we asked
how is this happening,

00:28:46.487 --> 00:28:48.552
what is actually going on?

00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:52.063
And you already know the
answer because I told you.

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:55.330
I told you that during
that synaptic plasticity

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.865
involves both pruning and strengthening

00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:59.393
of certain connections.

00:28:59.393 --> 00:29:02.368
So we thought let's look
at pruning in these PirB

00:29:02.368 --> 00:29:04.074
knockout mice.

00:29:04.074 --> 00:29:07.358
And to make a long story
short, what we discovered

00:29:07.358 --> 00:29:09.259
is that pruning is deficient.

00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:11.177
And the way we did this experiment

00:29:11.177 --> 00:29:14.298
was to label some of our
favorite neurons in the brain,

00:29:14.298 --> 00:29:15.615
these little green dots,

00:29:15.615 --> 00:29:17.533
with a green tracer substance.

00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:20.231
And then we could actually look at

00:29:20.231 --> 00:29:22.230
very high power over here.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.448
We could look at these
little protuberances,

00:29:25.448 --> 00:29:28.228
which are the sites of the synaptic inputs

00:29:28.228 --> 00:29:29.593
to these particular neurons,

00:29:29.593 --> 00:29:32.096
and then we could count them all.

00:29:32.096 --> 00:29:35.396
And when we did that
experiment in normal, wild-type

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:37.541
versus PirB knockout mice,

00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:39.362
what we discovered is
that there were actually

00:29:39.362 --> 00:29:42.385
way more of these connections
in the knockout mice

00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:43.799
than in the wild-type mice,

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:46.627
and that actually persisted
all the way into adulthood.

00:29:46.627 --> 00:29:49.244
And what we'd actually discovered is that

00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:53.486
somehow PirB is required
for synaptic pruning.

00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:56.900
And in the absence of PirB,
so in this knockout mouse,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.435
what we discovered is that
pruning was deficient,

00:29:59.435 --> 00:30:04.133
the see-saw went in favor
of synapse formation,

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:08.180
genesis and stabilization, and
away from synaptic pruning.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.130
Okay now there's a lot more
one could say about this

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.162
but actually what I
really wanna talk about is

00:30:12.162 --> 00:30:15.137
boing, a light bulb went off for us,

00:30:15.137 --> 00:30:16.990
actually a few light
bulbs went off for us,

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.647
but I wanna tell you about one.

00:30:18.647 --> 00:30:20.192
Here's the light bulb.

00:30:20.192 --> 00:30:23.946
The light bulb is that
in Alzheimer's disease,

00:30:23.946 --> 00:30:27.083
there's excessive synapse pruning.

00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:30.562
And this is thought to be
caused at least in part

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:33.229
by these bad plaques and tangles

00:30:34.706 --> 00:30:39.420
that are formed by the
accumulation of a substance called

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.920
Beta amyloid, which actually conglomerates

00:30:43.825 --> 00:30:46.474
to make very large plaques and tangles.

00:30:46.474 --> 00:30:48.831
And it's thought that this Beta amyloid

00:30:48.831 --> 00:30:52.862
is part of what's responsible
for loss of memory

00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:55.203
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:30:55.203 --> 00:30:58.340
So question is, is PirB involved

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.282
because remember PirB is
pruning is needed pruning

00:31:01.282 --> 00:31:04.077
and here we have too much
pruning in Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:04.077 --> 00:31:05.703
So how would you study that?

00:31:05.703 --> 00:31:08.352
Well we studied it in a large
variety of different ways,

00:31:08.352 --> 00:31:10.806
but the first way is PirB knockout mice,

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:13.667
please meet Alzheimer's disease mice,

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:15.244
so what do I mean by that?

00:31:15.244 --> 00:31:19.470
So neuroscientists can make
mouse models of disease,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.964
and what they can do is they
can actually put into the mouse

00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:26.670
the human disease gene, the mutated gene,

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.872
and sadly for the mice,
but thank you mice,

00:31:29.872 --> 00:31:33.351
the mice can then end
up with a human disease.

00:31:33.351 --> 00:31:35.301
And in the case Alzheimer's mice,

00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:36.748
there are a variety of models,

00:31:36.748 --> 00:31:39.478
but in this case there are two genes

00:31:39.478 --> 00:31:43.396
that are known to cause early
onset family Alzheimer's.

00:31:43.396 --> 00:31:45.606
Both of these are put into the mouse,

00:31:45.606 --> 00:31:48.581
and the mouse, at about
nine months of age,

00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:51.490
gets the plaques and
tangles, and sadly also

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.323
a serious memory loss.

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:57.455
So what we did is we decided,

00:31:57.455 --> 00:31:59.991
let's see what happens if we removed PirB.

00:31:59.991 --> 00:32:02.299
Remember, if we remove PirB,

00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:05.078
then there's no pruning that happens.

00:32:05.078 --> 00:32:09.435
So what happens in Alzheimer's
mice that don't have PirB,

00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:12.344
and amazingly when we studied
their memory performance

00:32:12.344 --> 00:32:15.546
at nine months of age, they were protected

00:32:15.546 --> 00:32:20.276
from memory loss in the
absence of the PirB molecule,

00:32:20.276 --> 00:32:21.609
so that actually kinda makes sense,

00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:24.356
it's rather exciting
at least to me, it is.

00:32:24.356 --> 00:32:26.356
So how does this happen?

00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:29.980
So again to make another
really long story short,

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.922
what we discovered is this PirB receptor

00:32:32.922 --> 00:32:36.422
is actually hijacked by this Beta amyloid,

00:32:37.408 --> 00:32:38.610
and what do I mean by hijacked?

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.690
What I mean is, that PirB
as I said is a receptor,

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.478
which always gets everybody excited

00:32:44.478 --> 00:32:46.087
in terms of making drugs.

00:32:46.087 --> 00:32:48.639
A receptor is a protein on a cell

00:32:48.639 --> 00:32:50.297
that does work for the cell.

00:32:50.297 --> 00:32:52.654
It takes information
from outside of the cell

00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:54.864
and it actually transfers that information

00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:57.888
to inside of the cell,
where it can do work.

00:32:57.888 --> 00:32:59.350
And in the case of PirB,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.731
that information is part
of the pruning process.

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:05.218
And there are normal ligands for PirB,

00:33:05.218 --> 00:33:07.510
including this thing called MHC Class One.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.501
So what we think is happening
is that Beta amyloid

00:33:10.501 --> 00:33:12.988
is also binding to this PirB molecule

00:33:12.988 --> 00:33:15.816
and driving pruning to excess.

00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:17.766
So the other point I wanna make

00:33:17.766 --> 00:33:22.155
is that it turns out that
there are actually human

00:33:22.155 --> 00:33:25.243
homologues of PirB, there
are quite a number of them,

00:33:25.243 --> 00:33:27.356
and what we discovered
is that one of them,

00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:28.819
called another mouthful,

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:30.054
I'm not even gonna write it out for you,

00:33:30.054 --> 00:33:34.137
it's called LilrB2, so
it's very similar to PirB,

00:33:35.516 --> 00:33:38.880
and this human homologue is also binds,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.082
it seems to be hijacked by
the PirB, by Beta amyloid,

00:33:42.082 --> 00:33:46.064
and it's also present
in the human forebrain

00:33:46.064 --> 00:33:50.762
and the signaling caused
by binding of Beta amyloid

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:52.956
seems to be also derailed in the same way

00:33:52.956 --> 00:33:55.866
the human Alzheimer brain
as it is in the mouse brain.

00:33:55.866 --> 00:33:57.670
Okay so now I'm gonna summarize.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:02.192
Okay so what I've suggested
is that Alzheimer's disease,

00:34:02.192 --> 00:34:05.357
which is thought to be a
problem of synapse pruning

00:34:05.357 --> 00:34:09.404
may be driven by Beta
amyloid-PirB interactions,

00:34:09.404 --> 00:34:11.143
definitely worth following that up.

00:34:11.143 --> 00:34:14.638
So pruning is accelerated in this case,

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:17.221
and what it also suggests to us

00:34:18.555 --> 00:34:20.961
is there might a pill in there after all.

00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:24.976
And what's great is that we
could even maybe make a pill

00:34:24.976 --> 00:34:26.975
based on the fact that
there's a receptor here,

00:34:26.975 --> 00:34:29.315
we know exactly what to do, and in fact,

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:32.030
we have made a little pill
and tried it out in mice

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.841
and so the last point I
wanna make is stay tuned.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.344
So I think it's really interesting

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:43.301
that PirB or LilrB
blockade might represent

00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:46.577
a slightly different therapeutic approach

00:34:46.577 --> 00:34:47.715
for treating Alzheimer's,

00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:49.877
but maybe also other pruning disorders.

00:34:49.877 --> 00:34:52.169
Now this might be good in the sense that

00:34:52.169 --> 00:34:53.761
I don't know if you read recently,

00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:56.167
but there was another
failure of another major

00:34:56.167 --> 00:34:59.084
Lilly Alzheimer disease drug trial,

00:35:00.133 --> 00:35:02.295
so it's really, I'm getting older,

00:35:02.295 --> 00:35:04.310
I would really like something soon.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.415
I want these trials to succeed.

00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:08.536
But maybe there's a pill,

00:35:08.536 --> 00:35:10.828
but even more interesting I think is

00:35:10.828 --> 00:35:14.095
that in fact lessons from
neural development may offer

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:16.647
new treatment avenues
for Alzheimer's disease

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:17.720
and other pruning disorders.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.898
So with that I just wanna thank everyone.

00:35:19.898 --> 00:35:23.149
Thank you all, and also I
wanna thank our organizers

00:35:23.149 --> 00:35:26.253
and I have to remind
everyone that this experiment

00:35:26.253 --> 00:35:28.496
was done, these kinds of experiments,

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:31.698
with many many students and
colleagues, and someone,

00:35:31.698 --> 00:35:33.941
and I would also like to thank the mice.

00:35:33.941 --> 00:35:35.524
So thanks everyone.

00:35:36.412 --> 00:35:39.472
- What I'm gonna try to do is to

00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:43.401
tell you what the challenge
is and how far we've gotten.

00:35:43.401 --> 00:35:47.568
So first of all, this diagram
which Pat Churchill and I

00:35:49.094 --> 00:35:52.470
first published in our book in 1992,

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.689
The Computational Brain,

00:35:53.689 --> 00:35:57.232
illustrates the real difficulty here of,

00:35:57.232 --> 00:35:59.313
because there's 11 orders
of spatial magnitude

00:35:59.313 --> 00:36:03.636
between molecules down
here at the very bottom

00:36:03.636 --> 00:36:05.099
and the entire central nervous system

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:08.383
that gives rise to
behavior at the very top.

00:36:08.383 --> 00:36:09.966
At the meter scale.

00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:14.705
And we've heard talks today
at every one of these levels.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:19.061
We've heard about hormones,
the important impact

00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:22.442
that they have on remodeling the brain,

00:36:22.442 --> 00:36:23.726
especially during adolescence.

00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:27.188
Synapses, we've heard that pruning

00:36:27.188 --> 00:36:28.895
may be of critical importance,

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:31.691
both in the development
and the generation.

00:36:31.691 --> 00:36:35.543
So that's clearly very
important and understanding

00:36:35.543 --> 00:36:39.005
how the molecules at the
synapses in particular

00:36:39.005 --> 00:36:43.166
are responsible for maturation
is going to be critical.

00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:47.295
We know that there are
changes occurring in networks,

00:36:47.295 --> 00:36:51.212
for example, we heard
about the impact of sound

00:36:53.942 --> 00:36:58.266
on the maturation of a
baby's auditory system

00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:02.433
and how important that was
for being able to later

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.213
have normal language and learning ability.

00:37:08.213 --> 00:37:12.098
If you can't hear properly,
then it's very difficult

00:37:12.098 --> 00:37:13.626
to know what people are saying,

00:37:13.626 --> 00:37:16.178
and especially if you
start going to school,

00:37:16.178 --> 00:37:18.762
it puts you at a great disadvantage.

00:37:18.762 --> 00:37:21.282
We heard about the brain imaging,

00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:25.508
the important technique
that allows us to tap into

00:37:25.508 --> 00:37:28.157
large scale patterns of brain activity.

00:37:28.157 --> 00:37:31.099
But how do you jump from
these large scale patterns

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:33.098
way up here, global activity,

00:37:33.098 --> 00:37:37.259
down all the way through all
the systems and the maps.

00:37:37.259 --> 00:37:39.389
We heard about the visual system,

00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:42.526
it's a sequence of maps
from primary visual cortex

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:46.036
to dozens, up to the very higher areas

00:37:46.036 --> 00:37:50.848
that are responsible for being
able to recognize objects.

00:37:50.848 --> 00:37:55.334
How are we gonna connect the
dots between all these areas,

00:37:55.334 --> 00:37:57.667
that's really the challenge.

00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:00.860
And it's not gonna be necessarily

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.729
jumping from molecules to CNS,

00:38:02.729 --> 00:38:05.102
although we'd always like
the magic pill right?

00:38:05.102 --> 00:38:07.817
That is targeting a specific molecule

00:38:07.817 --> 00:38:10.410
and then hoping that that will solve,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.530
I don't think that's a good a model,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.530
the fact that we've had
how many clinical trials

00:38:18.138 --> 00:38:20.706
for Alzheimer's that
have failed in the last

00:38:20.706 --> 00:38:23.632
two or three years, it's
at least a dozen trials

00:38:23.632 --> 00:38:26.623
saying that amyloid plaque is by itself,

00:38:26.623 --> 00:38:28.849
is getting rid of it
isn't necessarily the way

00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:30.962
to solve the problem.

00:38:30.962 --> 00:38:32.377
Now there's something missing from this

00:38:32.377 --> 00:38:35.367
and I had to say that there's
a lot missing from it.

00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:38.082
But just from today's
talks, I think you've heard

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:41.170
that we have to add at
least one more type of cell

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.503
to this diagram.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.826
That half the cells in
your brain are glial cells.

00:38:46.826 --> 00:38:49.021
And in particular, there's the astrocytes,

00:38:49.021 --> 00:38:50.532
you're heard a lot about the microglia,

00:38:50.532 --> 00:38:52.369
the oligdendrocytes are very important too

00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:54.514
because they're the ones
that wrap around the axons

00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:57.343
and they speed the action
potential down the axon.

00:38:57.343 --> 00:38:59.098
That has to do with timing.

00:38:59.098 --> 00:39:01.569
And so we really have to
put that front and center

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:02.938
if we're gonna especially understand

00:39:02.938 --> 00:39:06.444
something about when things go wrong.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.277
Now,

00:39:08.557 --> 00:39:09.974
when I was young,

00:39:11.694 --> 00:39:15.953
I was told that space
is the final frontier

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:17.871
from watching Star Trek.

00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:20.260
(laughing)

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.576
But I've now come to believe that

00:39:23.576 --> 00:39:26.566
the final frontier is going to be time.

00:39:26.566 --> 00:39:29.606
Understanding how the temporal processing

00:39:29.606 --> 00:39:32.450
occurring in different
circuits and delays that occur

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.660
between communication, between
different parts of the brain

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.537
may be critically important
and we've neglected it.

00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:42.447
So I've worked on networks
for my entire career.

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:44.153
And I've always thought of networks

00:39:44.153 --> 00:39:46.868
as being the tightly
interconnected group of neurons

00:39:46.868 --> 00:39:48.688
typically in the cortex,

00:39:48.688 --> 00:39:51.988
a single neuron connecting
to 10,000 neighbors,

00:39:51.988 --> 00:39:54.182
and in a single column 100,000 neurons

00:39:54.182 --> 00:39:55.765
and that adds up to

00:39:58.034 --> 00:40:02.276
at the end, billions of
synapses in a single column.

00:40:02.276 --> 00:40:04.194
But there's another kind of network,

00:40:04.194 --> 00:40:06.112
and that's a communication network.

00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:08.664
A communication network
is the one that extends,

00:40:08.664 --> 00:40:11.753
broadcasts the signals in
your cell phones, right,

00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:14.629
they're being broadcast through
a communication network.

00:40:14.629 --> 00:40:16.531
And the brain has one that
is just as sophisticated

00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:18.644
as anything that we've ever come across.

00:40:18.644 --> 00:40:21.407
But I want to take you
back to the early days

00:40:21.407 --> 00:40:23.824
when Carla was a young puppy.

00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:29.356
And, or a young kitten I guess,
I'm not sure what (laughs)

00:40:29.356 --> 00:40:31.209
would be the proper way of putting it.

00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:36.150
When she made a very important (laughs)

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:40.067
sorry Carla (laughing).

00:40:40.067 --> 00:40:44.017
It was a very important observation about

00:40:44.017 --> 00:40:45.301
traveling waves in the retina,

00:40:45.301 --> 00:40:47.219
the reason why it's
important is that these occur

00:40:47.219 --> 00:40:49.088
even before the eye opens.

00:40:49.088 --> 00:40:51.510
So those dynamic patterns
of activity that are

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.639
already spreading through the retina.

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:56.061
And here you can see,

00:40:56.061 --> 00:40:57.881
this is now from a more recent paper,

00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:00.728
but this is from an array of
electrodes that are put on

00:41:00.728 --> 00:41:02.367
the retina, that's slapped down

00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:04.188
and these are the action potentials

00:41:04.188 --> 00:41:05.764
coming from the ganglion cells.

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:07.357
And you can see over seconds,

00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:09.194
this wave of activity
sweeps across the retina,

00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:11.616
now why is that interesting,

00:41:11.616 --> 00:41:14.151
well it turns out that this,

00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:16.281
these waves are giving
a temporal structure

00:41:16.281 --> 00:41:18.784
to the action potentials
going up to the next stage

00:41:18.784 --> 00:41:19.946
in the lateral geniculate,

00:41:19.946 --> 00:41:22.329
and it's essential for
getting that pathway

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:23.954
wired up properly.

00:41:23.954 --> 00:41:26.587
Being able to sort out the
input from the two eyes,

00:41:26.587 --> 00:41:28.457
first of all, 'cause the
waves are independent,

00:41:28.457 --> 00:41:30.488
but secondly there's
information about location

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:35.193
because as the waves spreads
from one location to the next,

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:39.037
the action potentials arrive
one position to the next

00:41:39.037 --> 00:41:42.270
and that helps sort out the map in LGN

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.228
and ultimately into the cortex.

00:41:45.228 --> 00:41:47.811
Now very recently we discovered

00:41:49.763 --> 00:41:52.180
waves in the cerebral cortex.

00:41:53.973 --> 00:41:55.550
Global waves.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:59.694
Unbelievably large scale
patterns of activity

00:41:59.694 --> 00:42:03.482
that we still don't understand
the significance of,

00:42:03.482 --> 00:42:05.692
although I have a pretty good hypothesis.

00:42:05.692 --> 00:42:08.975
And they occur while you are sleeping.

00:42:08.975 --> 00:42:11.218
When you go to sleep, you
go through several stages

00:42:11.218 --> 00:42:13.949
from awake down to deep slow wave sleep,

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:15.640
but on the way you go through stage two,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.557
what's called intermediate sleep,

00:42:17.557 --> 00:42:20.272
and it's characterized
by these sleep spindles.

00:42:20.272 --> 00:42:23.571
These are bursting activity
that originates in the thalamus,

00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:25.311
projects to the cortex.

00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:28.025
They are 10 to 14 Hertz,

00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:29.358
they last one or two seconds,

00:42:29.358 --> 00:42:31.357
they recur every five seconds,

00:42:31.357 --> 00:42:32.349
and there are some people who spend

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:35.892
up to half of the night
in this slow wave sleep,

00:42:35.892 --> 00:42:38.964
during which the spindles are occurring.

00:42:38.964 --> 00:42:42.052
Now I've done some very
detailed biophysical modeling,

00:42:42.052 --> 00:42:44.507
so I can tell you precise mechanisms

00:42:44.507 --> 00:42:47.351
that give rise to the
spindles, it's a bursting,

00:42:47.351 --> 00:42:50.423
it has to do with new ion
channels that are uncovered

00:42:50.423 --> 00:42:52.840
when the cells hyperpolarize,

00:42:53.674 --> 00:42:56.161
it means the membrane potential goes down.

00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:58.583
But what I would have never guessed

00:42:58.583 --> 00:43:03.264
is how the activity between
the thalamus and the cortex

00:43:03.264 --> 00:43:07.246
organizes itself, in the
textbooks what you hear is

00:43:07.246 --> 00:43:09.310
that it's synchronous,
that is to say it occurs

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.480
at the same place in the cortex

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.090
at exactly the same time.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.008
And it is approximately synchronous.

00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:16.186
But I wanted to let
you decide for yourself

00:43:16.186 --> 00:43:18.152
how synchronous it really is.

00:43:18.152 --> 00:43:20.347
So this is an array of
electrodes, eight by eight

00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:23.191
64 electrodes that have
been placed on a surface

00:43:23.191 --> 00:43:26.003
of the cortex in an epilepsy patient,

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:28.506
who has been, gone to the hospital with

00:43:28.506 --> 00:43:32.131
a form of epilepsy that can't
be treated with any drugs.

00:43:32.131 --> 00:43:34.504
And so what they have to
do is isolate the focus

00:43:34.504 --> 00:43:37.251
so they can go in and
take it out and hopefully

00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:41.217
keep that epilepsy, the person,
from having seizures again.

00:43:41.217 --> 00:43:43.460
So here's the electrodes,
and by the way they have

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.784
these electrodes in for about a week,

00:43:45.784 --> 00:43:47.117
waiting for a seizure to occur,

00:43:47.117 --> 00:43:50.546
so it's a fantastic opportunity
for someone like me,

00:43:50.546 --> 00:43:52.708
a neuroscientist who wants
to ask fundamental questions

00:43:52.708 --> 00:43:54.740
about a human brain.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.658
About things like language,
for which there was

00:43:56.658 --> 00:43:59.324
no other model system.

00:43:59.324 --> 00:44:02.916
Okay so what we've done
is color each in gray

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:04.583
from white to black.

00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:07.921
As you can see, the amplitude.

00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:10.424
And this is the one that
you're gonna see here in red

00:44:10.424 --> 00:44:13.057
is this one, but all the other electrodes

00:44:13.057 --> 00:44:15.398
are gonna be represented that way.

00:44:15.398 --> 00:44:19.936
And I want you just to
follow the white dots.

00:44:19.936 --> 00:44:22.853
And tell me what pattern they form.

00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:30.928
This is going around one
77 milliseconds right,

00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:34.595
so this is going around
at roughly 14 Hertz.

00:44:36.357 --> 00:44:39.607
And you can see as it goes up and down,

00:44:42.322 --> 00:44:44.989
so did everybody see what I saw?

00:44:46.028 --> 00:44:49.361
It's a rotating circular traveling wave.

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:52.627
And it's global.

00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:54.512
It goes from, as you can see,

00:44:54.512 --> 00:44:57.145
it goes form the temporal
cortex to the parietal cortex

00:44:57.145 --> 00:44:59.356
up to the prefrontal cortex.

00:44:59.356 --> 00:45:02.542
And if you look at the pattern
on the side of my head,

00:45:02.542 --> 00:45:04.915
this should remind you of Princess Leia.

00:45:04.915 --> 00:45:07.165
(laughing)

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.636
Now what are these...

00:45:10.636 --> 00:45:12.012
So this of course occurs
thousands of times

00:45:12.012 --> 00:45:13.431
during the night, what are they doing?

00:45:13.431 --> 00:45:15.853
We think it has something to
do with synaptic plasticity.

00:45:15.853 --> 00:45:18.129
Because the timing is just
right for something called

00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:20.177
spike time dependent plasticity.

00:45:20.177 --> 00:45:22.793
And so it may be that
we know there's replay

00:45:22.793 --> 00:45:24.874
from the hippocampus during the night.

00:45:24.874 --> 00:45:26.841
It's called memory consolidation

00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:28.905
and it occurs over many many nights

00:45:28.905 --> 00:45:30.449
and this might be the mechanism.

00:45:30.449 --> 00:45:32.692
So we have a really great opportunity here

00:45:32.692 --> 00:45:34.609
to actually explore it.

00:45:36.122 --> 00:45:39.373
Now we know that there are connections,

00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:41.274
long range connections
between different parts

00:45:41.274 --> 00:45:43.566
of the cortex, these are
called association fibers,

00:45:43.566 --> 00:45:46.996
and also across between the hemispheres.

00:45:46.996 --> 00:45:50.913
And it's really these
that we think are carrying

00:45:50.913 --> 00:45:53.383
the time delay signals,
and it may be that these

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.724
time delays are really
important to getting them right.

00:45:55.724 --> 00:45:59.170
We know that for example
in traumatic brain injury

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.209
when soldiers come back
from the Middle East

00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:05.292
with traumatic, problems with trauma,

00:46:06.289 --> 00:46:08.971
they often have problems
with concentration

00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:12.693
and attention, and concussions
on football players

00:46:12.693 --> 00:46:15.521
and so forth, and when you
look in the brain with MR,

00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:16.805
the only thing you can find

00:46:16.805 --> 00:46:18.350
are little spots of the white matter,

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.934
so it could well be that the white matter

00:46:20.934 --> 00:46:23.226
is really important for
integrating globally

00:46:23.226 --> 00:46:25.518
all the information,
different parts of the cortex,

00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:28.394
and it could be that by
strengthening connections

00:46:28.394 --> 00:46:31.759
between these distant
areas through spindles

00:46:31.759 --> 00:46:32.848
or some other mechanism

00:46:32.848 --> 00:46:36.099
that we're able to connect
up all the different parts

00:46:36.099 --> 00:46:38.261
of the sensory cortices and association

00:46:38.261 --> 00:46:40.813
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:46:40.813 --> 00:46:42.646
Now the timing is also

00:46:45.055 --> 00:46:47.282
obviously very important
in the auditory cortex

00:46:47.282 --> 00:46:48.501
and the motor systems,

00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:52.207
so this is I think something
it hasn't been explored,

00:46:52.207 --> 00:46:54.612
we focus so much on the gray matter

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:56.270
and not so much on the white matter.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.098
There are some really
intriguing observations

00:46:59.098 --> 00:47:02.868
that when learning takes place,
it's not just the synapses

00:47:02.868 --> 00:47:04.266
that change their strength,

00:47:04.266 --> 00:47:06.526
the volume of the white matter changes.

00:47:06.526 --> 00:47:08.151
How could that be?

00:47:08.151 --> 00:47:12.318
Well the oligdendrocytes
that wrap around the axons

00:47:14.116 --> 00:47:16.164
change the speed, so
maybe what's happening

00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:19.009
is you're adjusting
the timing of the spike

00:47:19.009 --> 00:47:23.170
as it goes across these
large scale connections

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.218
between two different parts of the cortex.

00:47:25.218 --> 00:47:27.558
That's all speculative but
I think it really means

00:47:27.558 --> 00:47:30.386
we have to start looking
carefully at the axons

00:47:30.386 --> 00:47:32.467
as well as the dendrites.

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:36.823
Now I'm gonna play a science
fiction movie for you.

00:47:36.823 --> 00:47:40.990
It's an animated, but it's
based on the connections we see

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:44.414
and it's also, it gives you,
you'll see an impression

00:47:44.414 --> 00:47:46.413
of the activity that might be taking place

00:47:46.413 --> 00:47:47.794
within the cortex.

00:47:47.794 --> 00:47:50.211
So these little white flashes

00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:55.450
are actually action potentials, spikes,

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.661
going down the axons that you just saw

00:47:57.661 --> 00:48:00.115
between these different cortical areas.

00:48:00.115 --> 00:48:01.740
And this gives you an
impression of what it might be

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.186
if you could actually see into your brain.

00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:08.990
You know, the person sitting next to you,

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.387
and actually see what they're thinking.

00:48:12.387 --> 00:48:16.554
Or what they're seeing, or
what it is that they're doing

00:48:17.523 --> 00:48:22.090
in terms of their motor
system, every single thought

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.512
is gonna be represented by
some pattern of activity

00:48:24.512 --> 00:48:26.934
in some part of your
brain, and specifically

00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:30.087
in different parts of the cortex.

00:48:30.087 --> 00:48:34.254
Now, right now, this is
science fiction for the human,

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.977
but, on April 2nd 2013,

00:48:41.888 --> 00:48:44.358
Obama announced this grand initiative,

00:48:44.358 --> 00:48:46.894
this only, these grand
initiatives only occur

00:48:46.894 --> 00:48:49.673
once every decade or two.

00:48:49.673 --> 00:48:52.014
And when they do, it really has an impact.

00:48:52.014 --> 00:48:54.842
And it has had a huge impact
in the neuroscience community

00:48:54.842 --> 00:48:57.178
over the last three years.

00:48:57.178 --> 00:49:01.116
The key letters by the
way in the acronym, IN,

00:49:01.116 --> 00:49:03.148
is innovative neurotechnology.

00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:06.886
And I have to say that our
sponsors, the Kavli Foundation,

00:49:06.886 --> 00:49:11.389
were critically important
in bringing this opportunity

00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:14.135
to the notice of the White House,

00:49:14.135 --> 00:49:16.980
and Miyoung Chung in
particular was the spark plug

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.670
who actually got the thing off the ground,

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.133
so we really owe the Kavli Foundation

00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:22.214
a great debt of gratitude.

00:49:22.214 --> 00:49:25.123
But what's happened
since this announcement

00:49:25.123 --> 00:49:28.309
is really astonishing because
new tools and techniques

00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:31.348
are coming online that
are accelerating research

00:49:31.348 --> 00:49:35.249
by orders of magnitude, and
let me give you one example.

00:49:35.249 --> 00:49:37.379
And this is not science fiction.

00:49:37.379 --> 00:49:38.462
This is real.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.707
This, you are seeing a zebra
fish in a larval brain.

00:49:45.002 --> 00:49:48.090
You can see it's not, it's
only a millimeter or so across.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.252
Contains about 80,000 neurons.

00:49:50.252 --> 00:49:54.575
It has a genetic marker that
will light the neuron up

00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:57.160
when it's activated,
see here's the neuron,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.492
here's the neuron, these
are the ones that are firing

00:50:00.492 --> 00:50:02.442
at this particular moment in time.

00:50:02.442 --> 00:50:05.612
And this is looking at it
from below, from above,

00:50:05.612 --> 00:50:07.660
from the front and from the side.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.740
We can record from all the
neurons at the same time

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.259
from this brain, okay?

00:50:14.259 --> 00:50:18.092
And I'm gonna play a
movie just to prove that.

00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:24.694
Now I have to tell you
this zebra fish larva

00:50:24.694 --> 00:50:27.343
is just sitting there, it's immobilized.

00:50:27.343 --> 00:50:30.383
And there's no sensory
input, there's no light.

00:50:30.383 --> 00:50:33.812
So what you're seeing is
called spontaneous activity.

00:50:33.812 --> 00:50:37.778
But every once in a while,
the spontaneous activity,

00:50:37.778 --> 00:50:40.314
the pattern changes like
right there, what's happening?

00:50:40.314 --> 00:50:43.321
Something happened in the
brain of the zebra fish

00:50:43.321 --> 00:50:46.165
that is unrelated to
anything that the zebra fish

00:50:46.165 --> 00:50:49.332
is experiencing or is actually moving.

00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:53.086
But it's really clear,

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.721
to me at least, that we don't
understand the first thing.

00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:01.971
(laughing)

00:51:03.682 --> 00:51:07.849
And as a Chinese curse, may
you get what you wish for,

00:51:09.002 --> 00:51:11.180
and this is something we've always wanted

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.138
to be able to have access
to all of the neurons

00:51:14.138 --> 00:51:15.845
and the activity occurring,

00:51:15.845 --> 00:51:17.714
I mean for all we know, the zebra fish,

00:51:17.714 --> 00:51:19.957
this is what the zebra
fish does when it thinks,

00:51:19.957 --> 00:51:21.534
I mean what do you do when
you go to bed at night

00:51:21.534 --> 00:51:23.777
and you're sitting there right.

00:51:23.777 --> 00:51:25.955
There's no sensory input
coming, you're not moving,

00:51:25.955 --> 00:51:27.402
but thoughts go through your head right?

00:51:27.402 --> 00:51:29.157
I mean so that's gotta
be represented somewhere,

00:51:29.157 --> 00:51:32.457
so this is getting tools
and techniques that allow us

00:51:32.457 --> 00:51:35.025
to decode what those patterns are,

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.690
it's really the challenge.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.828
And we're very fortunate
that tools and techniques

00:51:40.828 --> 00:51:44.046
are coming online exactly
when we needed them.

00:51:44.046 --> 00:51:45.590
It's called machine learning,

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:48.077
and there's a meeting that's
been held for the last 30 years

00:51:48.077 --> 00:51:51.084
called Neural Information
Processing Systems, NIPS,

00:51:51.084 --> 00:51:55.082
and the next meeting will be
held in Barcelona next week.

00:51:55.082 --> 00:51:57.249
6,000 people will show up.

00:51:58.447 --> 00:52:00.544
At the first meeting there was 600,

00:52:00.544 --> 00:52:03.339
so it's a factor of 10 greater,

00:52:03.339 --> 00:52:05.924
and every single high
tech company is showing up

00:52:05.924 --> 00:52:08.037
to recruit and why, it turns out that

00:52:08.037 --> 00:52:10.654
these tools and techniques
that have been developed

00:52:10.654 --> 00:52:14.821
and have been inspired by
the brain, the N is neural,

00:52:16.326 --> 00:52:19.024
turns out have fantastic
applications to the real world,

00:52:19.024 --> 00:52:20.373
you've heard about deep learning,

00:52:20.373 --> 00:52:23.526
well deep learning came
from this NIPS community.

00:52:23.526 --> 00:52:26.858
And those same tools and
techniques can be used

00:52:26.858 --> 00:52:29.605
for understanding those
patterns of activity

00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:32.807
that you just saw for analyzing,
large scale recordings,

00:52:32.807 --> 00:52:35.863
for working out the
detailed wiring diagram

00:52:35.863 --> 00:52:39.747
called connectomics, and
for quantifying behavior.

00:52:39.747 --> 00:52:43.778
Turns out that we can
go way beyond the simple

00:52:43.778 --> 00:52:45.566
having an animal press a button

00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:47.354
with having it move around freely.

00:52:47.354 --> 00:52:51.466
And this can be done
automatically and scored

00:52:51.466 --> 00:52:56.244
and it's been done on flies,
it's been done on mice,

00:52:56.244 --> 00:52:58.536
they have a sequence
of stereotype behavior,

00:52:58.536 --> 00:53:00.665
they groom themselves and so forth,

00:53:00.665 --> 00:53:02.291
and interestingly on humans.

00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:05.883
We can now detect and automatically score

00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:07.508
your facial expressions.

00:53:07.508 --> 00:53:10.093
Like we saw some pictures
of the fearful face,

00:53:10.093 --> 00:53:11.426
well we've worked with Paul Eckman

00:53:11.426 --> 00:53:13.392
and we've developed
these deep learning tools

00:53:13.392 --> 00:53:15.635
to actually be able to
do that automatically

00:53:15.635 --> 00:53:18.545
and we can detect these
fleeting moments of expression

00:53:18.545 --> 00:53:21.129
across your face, they're
called micro-expressions.

00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:23.665
And they're very telling
because they're brain leaks,

00:53:23.665 --> 00:53:26.591
they're feelings you're having
inside that leak through

00:53:26.591 --> 00:53:28.460
and you may not even be
aware of them yourself,

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.960
but they can be picked up now.

00:53:32.052 --> 00:53:34.880
And that could be a way
that we can understand

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.204
a little bit more about the
internal state of your brain.

00:53:39.204 --> 00:53:42.568
Okay so I just wanna end by saying that

00:53:42.568 --> 00:53:45.930
Lyle Muller who was responsible
for doing that beautiful

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:49.226
rotating traveling wave
is out on the job market

00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:53.393
so if you have a job for a
budding young experimentalist,

00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:58.481
and a theoretician and a
data analyst, he's your man.

00:53:58.481 --> 00:53:59.976
Thank you.

00:53:59.976 --> 00:54:01.683
(applauding)

00:54:01.683 --> 00:54:04.433
(cheerful music)
