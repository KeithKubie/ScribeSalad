00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.600
The tortoise and
the hare are racing

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.920
to see who can run 100 feet in
the shortest amount of time.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.690
Their positions in feet as a
function of time in seconds,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.820
T of t and H of t respectively,
are plotted below.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.500
So T of t is the position of the
tortoise as a function of time,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.600
and it's in feet.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.060
H of t is the
position of the hare.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.630
What is the meaning
of the rate of change

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.530
of T of t on the interval
t is greater than 0

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.750
and less than 20?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.280
So T of t, they were talking
about the tortoise here.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.530
This is the function T
of t right over here,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.880
this blue line.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.610
And it looks like it's moving
at a constant rate of change.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.090
The slope of this
line is constant.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.350
So let's see what this
rate of change is.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.470
If we start-- so
we could even start

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.970
from the starting position.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.060
When 1 second goes
by, each notch here

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.770
in the horizontal
axis is 1 second.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.440
You see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.340
So every time 1 second
goes by, it looks like--

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.129
and we have to be
very careful here.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.370
At first it looks like,
oh, maybe he moves 1 feet.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.140
But we have to be careful about
what these notches represent.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.278
It looks like these notches
represent 5, 10, 15, 20,

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:15.420
25 feet.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.710
So every time 1 second goes
by, he moves forward 5 feet.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.150
Another second goes by,
he moves forward 5 feet.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.800
So it looks like the
rate of the tortoise,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.240
so I'll say the
tortoise rate, the rate

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.770
of the change of distance
with respect to time

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.650
is 5 feet for every second.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.290
So let's see which of our
choices seem to match that.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.970
And that is over
the entire interval.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550
The interval starts
here, this is 0,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.090
and 20 is right over here.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.840
And it looks like we
have a constant rate,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.390
we have a constant slope.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.100
We have the same
inclination of this line

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.840
the entire time all the
way until t is equal to 20.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.880
So this first choice
says the tortoise walks

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.000
at 5 feet per second the whole
time, and this looks right.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.900
Our tortoise has a constant
rate of 5 feet per second.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.550
This walks might be
an understatement.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.410
5 feet per second is a
pretty good speed, especially

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.510
for a tortoise.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.364
But we are going to
go with that one.

00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:18.280
Now, let's just look at
the other ones for fun

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.970
to see how true they are
or see if they could have

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.030
somehow applied to this problem.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.490
The hare stops moving
after 5 seconds.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.580
So let's see, this is
time 0, this is 5 seconds.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.820
So if we look at the hare's
position after 5 seconds,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.360
so after time
equals 5 seconds, it

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.270
does indeed look like the hare's
position-- the hare is just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.230
sitting there at the
90-foot marker line

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.640
and is not moving at all.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.450
The rate of change of
position with respect

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.510
to time for the hare
at that point is 0.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.561
So this does seem true, it just
doesn't apply to the question.

00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.310
It's not the meaning
of the rate of change

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.940
of T of t on this interval.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.940
This is applying to H of t.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.340
The hare runs at a speed of 18
feet per second for the first 5

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.240
seconds.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.860
So let's see if this is true.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.330
For the first 5 seconds, so
this is 5 seconds going by,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.570
the hare is able to cover
a distance of 90 feet.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.130
So the hare is able to
go 90 feet in 5 seconds,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.100
so for the first 5
seconds, the hare

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.030
is-- hare's rate is 90 feet.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.240
You could say average rate of
change is 90 feet in 5 seconds.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.850
And 90 divided by 5 is
indeed 18 feet per second.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.480
So once again, this
third statement is true,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240
it just doesn't apply to T of t.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.530
It's not addressing
the question.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.706
Now this fourth choice is
that the hare wins the race.

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.330
Now, winning the
race, they have to get

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.370
to 100 feet in the
shortest amount of time.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.550
This is 100 feet
right over here.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.650
So let's see.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.980
So it looks like only
the tortoise even

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.900
gets to that point.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.760
At 20 seconds, the tortoise
gets to the 100-foot mark.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.280
The hare is still hanging
around taking a nap or something

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.560
at 90 feet.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.705
So this is actually
outright false.

00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:15.230
The tortoise wins the race.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.680
So we will definitely go
with our first choice.
