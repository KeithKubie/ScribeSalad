00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hello
everyone and welcome

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.010
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.810
I am Rob Casper, the head of
the Poetry and Literature Center

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.370
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.110
And I want to welcome you to
the Poetry and Prose Pavilion

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.480
and our 1 PM program on poetry
with Marie Howe and Adrian Matejka.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.370
We want to thank the cochairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.230
and the many National
Book Festival sponsors

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.190
who made this event
possible in 2017.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.260
And those who have
supported it year after year.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.440
I want to make a special shout
out to those folks in the back,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.210
the National Endowment for
The Arts for all their support

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.010
to make this pavilion possible.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.460
[ Applause ]

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.080
You too can support the festival
with a gift of a donation

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.910
by checking the information on the
festival program and on the app.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.290
We welcome your help in making
the festival possible next year

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.700
and every year.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.080
The festival would not be
possible without the support

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.930
of sponsors and book lovers.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320
Two other housekeeping
items I want to bring up.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.910
First -- please turn off your cell
phones and any electronic devices

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
that might interfere with
the recording of this event.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.540
Second -- we will try to fit in
a Q and A after our conversation.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.830
And if you choose to
participate, you give us permission

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.010
to use the recording and
put it in our archives,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.200
which is a great and
wonderful thing.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.860
When I got together with
the great folks at the NEA

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.920
to discuss this year's
Poetry and Prose Pavilion,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.770 position:56%
we thought we would try a new model.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.380
Instead of simply featuring
a single poet or writer,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.490
this year we are trying
a few fun pairings.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.100
And our first pairing
features two poets, Marie Howe

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.560
and Adrian Matejka, who have
never met, but whose work

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.230
and current books have
much to say to one another.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.430
Let me do a quick introduction
and then we will start off

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.900
with a reading and a
moderate conversation.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.200
Marie Howe is the author

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.810
of four collections including the
National Book Series Selection --

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.380
The Good Thief and
Magdalene, published in March

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.570
by W.W. Norton and Company.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.740
The poet laureate of New
York State from 2012 to 2014,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.950
Howe's honors included fellowships
from the Academy of American Poets

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.250
and the Guggenheim Foundation.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.990
In 1992 she received a National
Endowment for the Arts Fellowship.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.080
Howe teaches at Sarah Lawrence
College in Bronxville, New York.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.010 position:56%
Adrian Matejka is the author of four
poetry collections, most recent Map

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.490
to the Stars, also published in
March of this year by Penguin.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.230 position:56%
His second mixology was a National
Book Series Selection and his third,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.950
The Big Smoke, received the
Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.310
Matejka is the recipient of
fellowships from [inaudible],

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.380
the Guggenheim Foundation
and the Lannan Foundation.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.650
He teaches creative writing at
Indian University in Bloomington.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.510 position:56%
So please join me in welcoming first
Marie Howe and then Adrian Matejka.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.760
[ Applause ]

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Hi everybody,
I am so happy to be here.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.360
I just. I am a little.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.260
I got lost [laughter].

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.560
Who else got lost today?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.270
I am so honored to
be here with Adrian.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.300
I am his biggest fan.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.630
I have just read his book,
Map to the Stars, this week.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.330
And I just was shouting
out loud in a room

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.440
by myself when I was reading that.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:01.110
So alive. I am really happy to be
with Rob, master of all ceremonies.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.340
This book Magdalene poems
were written one by one

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.430
and I did not realize that I would
eventually call the collection

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.730
the Magdalene.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.440
It refers to Mary Magdalene,
the archetypical character

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.780
who we remember was very,
was one of Jesus' followers.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.540
I grew up in that tradition

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.880
and those stories are
really important to me.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.440
But even as a young girl,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.250
I knew that the story
about her was not right.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.650
That she, when I was growing
up in the 50's and 60's,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.990
was depicted by the early
church fathers and most

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.930 position:56%
of the painters as a penitent woman.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:58.240
And she struck me as being emblem
of the wound many women fell,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.770
maybe all women feel,
which is we are split.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.460
We have been split by the
patriarchal culture into a body

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.980
or a soul or a sacred or profane
or the virgin or the whore.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.660
Magdalene was the whore.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.340
Mary was the virgin.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.470
Magdalene was repentant.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.960
Mary had nothing to be sorry about.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.460
That did not seem right to me.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.000
So part of the very unconscious
intention of the book was to try

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.660
to approach this wound from the
voice of a contemporary woman

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.250 position:56%
and to try in her own way to kind of
begin to speak to it and to heal it.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.020
Before the beginning,
was I ever virgin?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.890
Did someone touch me
before I could speak?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:07.750 position:56%
Who had me before I knew I was an I?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:15.470
So that I wanted that touch again
and again without knowing who

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.430
or why or from whence it came.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.500
On Men, Their Bodies.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.430
One penis was very large and thick

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.980
so when he put it inside
me, I really did say wow.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.170
One penis was uncircumcised and I
loved to grip the shaft and pull

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.190
down so the head popped
out like a little man.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.340
One penis was curved so I had
to move in a different way.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.720
One penis was so friendly,
I was never afraid of it.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.360
One penis was so slender
I was startled.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.050
One penis was blunt and
short like a little pig.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.940
One penis could not harden until
he stuffed it soft inside me.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.580
One penis came as soon
as I started to move.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.800
I am so sorry, he said.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.830
I have a problem.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.830
But I did not care.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.050
I loved that boy.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.000
One penis pressed against me
hard almost every morning,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.120
but I got out of bed as if I had
not heard a word it had said.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.160
One penis was so dear to me I
kissed it and kissed it even

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.410
after I knew it had
been with someone else.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.070
One penis I never saw, but
my hand came to know it

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.200
from the outside of his jeans.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.920 position:56%
One penis loved the inside of my
mouth so much it sang, it sputtered.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.440
One had a name.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.840
One was a mouse.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.510
One he explained to me
had very, very tiny crabs

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.300
so we could not have
sex for a while.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.590
One was orthodox and
would not touch blood.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.060
One had a mole, a hard little
dot just under the skin.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.720
One penis was extremely patient
without making a big deal about it.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.120
One penis had a great
sense of humor.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.000
One penis had herpes, but I
did not know that word yet.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.100
One was a battering ram.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.650
One was a drunk staggering,
a lout, a bully.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:43.260
One slept inside me,
comfortably at home.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.880
The Affliction.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.450
When I walked across a
room I saw myself walking

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.780
as if I were someone else,
when I picked up a fork,

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.860
when I pulled off a dress,
as if I were in a movie.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.930
It's what I thought you
saw when you looked at me.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:19.170
So when I looked at
you, I did not see you,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:27.080
I saw the me I thought you
saw, as if I were someone else.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.610
I called that outside watching.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.450
Well I did not call it anything
when it happened all the time.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.180
But one morning after
I stopped the pills --

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:47.930
standing in the kitchen for one
second I was inside looking out.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.040
Then I popped back outside.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.840
And saw myself looking.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.960
Would it happen again?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.810
It did, a few days later.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.560
My friend Wendy was
pulling on her winter coat,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:09.290 position:56%
standing by the kitchen door and
suddenly I was inside and I saw her.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.060
I looked out from my own eyes

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:18.040
and I saw her eyes --
blue gray, transparent.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.370
And inside them -- Wendy herself.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.890
Then I was outside again.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.650
And Wendy was saying,
bye-bye, see you soon,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.070
as if nothing had happened.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.220
She had not noticed.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.140
She had not known that I had
been there for maybe 40 seconds.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.440
And that then I was gone.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.560
She had not noticed that I had
not been there for months, years,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.030
the entire time she had known me.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.130
I need not have been embarrassed to
have been there for those seconds.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.310
She had not noticed the difference.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.630
This happened on and off for weeks.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.330
And then I was looking
at my old friend, John.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:13.510
Suddenly I was in and
I saw him and he --

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:20.370
and this was almost
unbearable -- he saw me see him.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.210
And I saw him see me.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.760
He said something like,
you are going to be ok now

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.830
or it has been difficult hasn't it.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.690
But what he said mattered
only a little.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.820
We met in our mutual gaze,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.720
in between a third place
I had not yet been.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.710
One of the pieces of
information we do have

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.540
about the original Magdalene was

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.480
that she was possessed
by seven devils.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.510
Oh that is what everybody
is looking at.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.280
[ Laughter ]

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.640
Because it is so interesting
because I am looking at you,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.020
but some of you are
looking at her [laughter].

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.510
Oh my God.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.090
It is a good thing
I cannot see that.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.370
Woof. You know what.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.460
This is very, this is exactly
what I am talking about.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.570
See there is the split.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.030
There is the body.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:43.520
There is the soul and we are
trying to bring them together.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.530
So you guys are the soul side.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.830
You are the body side.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.130
Let's hear it.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.830
What an extraordinary
feeling this is.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.250
Glad you are with me in it.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.510
Mary called Magdalene from whom
seven devils had been cast out.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.170
That is from Luke Chapter
Eight Verse Two.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.040 position:56%
Anybody in the room have any devils?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.510
I am. Thank you very much.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.780
Beautiful Catherine.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.800
Anybody else want to admit
to devils since Catherine

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.100
and I have admitted to them.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.400
Oh good, more.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.720
We got more and more and more.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.340
Well I got thinking about
these devils because of course

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.990 position:56%
when they are in the scripture they
seem frightening indeed, don't they?

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.580
But of course we are
many of us bedeviled.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.790
So, here is Magdalene talking
about her seven devils.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.820
Maybe you will recognize
the first one.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.510
The first one was that
I was very busy.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:50.330
[ Laughter ]

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.390
The second -- I was
different from you.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.660
Whatever happened to you
could not happen to me.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.210
Not like that.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.320
The third -- I worried.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.350
The fourth -- envy
disguised as compassion.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.950
The fifth was that I refused

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.620
to consider the quality
of life of the aphid.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.140
The aphid disgusted me.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:28.500
But I could not stop thinking about
it and the mosquito too, its face.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.330
And the ant, its bifurcated body.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.700
Okay the first was
that I was so busy.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.510
The second that I might make the
wrong choice because I had decided

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.540
to take that plane that day,
that flight before noon so as

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.250
to arrive early and I
should not have wanted that.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.150
The third was that if I
walked past a certain place

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.830
on the street, the
house might blow up.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:04.880
The fourth I was made of guts
and blood with a thin layer

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.300
of skin lightly thrown
over the whole thing.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:16.450
The fifth was that the dead seemed
more alive to me than the living.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:22.070
The sixth if I touch my right
arm, I had to touch my left arm.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.940
And if I touched the
left arm a little harder

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.140
than I had first touched the right,
then I had to retouch the left

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.240
and then touch the right
again so it would be even.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.270
The seventh I knew I was breathing
the expelled breath of everything

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.310
that was alive and I
could not stand it.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.250
I wanted a sieve, a mask.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.790 position:56%
I hate this word -- a cheesecloth to
breathe through that would trap it.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:59.260
Whatever was inside everyone else
that entered me when I breathed in.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.870
No that was the first one.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.310
The second was that I was so busy.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.610
I had no time.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.140
How had this happened?

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.110
How had our lives gotten like this?

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:16.500
The third was that I could not eat
food if I really saw it distinct

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:22.210
and separate from me in
a bowl or on a plate.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:27.110
Okay. The first was
that I could never get

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.480
to the end of the list [laughter].

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.560
The second was that the
laundry was never finally done.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.900
The third was that no one knew me,
although they thought they did.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.740
And that if people thought
of me as little as I thought

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.850
of them then what was love?

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.770
The fourth was I did
not belong to anyone.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.460
I would not allow myself
to belong to anyone.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.570
The fifth was that I knew none

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.740
of us could ever know
what we did not know.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:06.750
The sixth was that I projected onto
others what I myself was feeling.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.710
The seventh was the
way my mother looked

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.460
when she was dying,
the sound she made.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.350
Her mouth wrenched to
the right and cupped open

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.990
so as to take in as much air.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.120
The gurgling sound, so
loud we had to speak louder

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.610
to hear each other over it.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.950
And that I could not
stop hearing it --

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.180
years later grocery
shopping, crossing the street.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.520
No, not the sound.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:41.540
It was her body's hunger finally
evident what our mother had hidden

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.520
all her life.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.840
For months I dreamt of
knucklebones and roots,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.280
the slabs of sidewalk pushed

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.550
up like crooked teeth
by what grew underneath.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.450
The underneath.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.390
That was the first devil.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.390
It was always with me.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.650
And that I did not think
you -- if I told you --

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.130
would understand any of this.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.930
Thank you.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:29.890
[ Applause ]

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.030
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Peace
D.C. It is good to be here.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.590
So Marie Howe.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:42.570
So you know Rob pointed out that
I had never met her until today,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.710
but I have been reading
her poems for years.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.010
And so this.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.460
To finally get to be here
with her is this great honor.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.750
And it is also one of those
reminders when you see someone

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.550 position:56%
who is able to do all the things you
wish you could do, but you cannot.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.620
So I was listening to these poems
and thinking ah I want to do that.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.360
I wish I could do that.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.960
But I cannot.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.170
So, I am going to read some
poems about Indianapolis.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.400
Has anybody been to Indianapolis?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.360
You know this is a, it is a. Okay
so the four of us know [laughter].

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.460
We are keeping it real
for the Midwest.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.420
Now when I brought
this idea to my editor,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.060
I think he was a little
bit concerned

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.100
that people would not
know what Indianapolis is.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.910
But it is a great city.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.790
And I am from there.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.810
So I am going to read
the title poem from this.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.090
And this entire book takes
place in Indianapolis

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.690
between the years of 1981 and 1988.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.370
So some of us in the room were here
back then and some of us were not.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.090
It is called Map to the Stars.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.310
A Schwinn-ride away
-- Eagledale Plaza.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.480
Busted shopping strip
of old walkways,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.260
crooked parking spaces nicked
like the lines on the sides

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.460
of somebody's mom-barbered head.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.820
Anchored by the Piccadilly disco,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.250
where a shootout was
guaranteed every weekend.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.440
Coughing stars shot from
sideways guns shiny enough

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.840
to light the way willing for
anyone to look up enough to see.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.050
Not me. I bought the Star
Map Shirt for 15 cents

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.290
at the Value Village next to
the Piccadilly in the daytime.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.560
The shirt was polyester
with flyaway collars,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.250
outlined in the forgotten
astronomies of disco.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.380
The shirt's washed-out points
of light, arranged in horse

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.450
and hero shapes and I rocked it

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.000
in places neither horse
nor hero hung out.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.640
Polyester is made from
polyethylene &amp; catches fire easily

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.870
like wings near a thrift store sun.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.040
Polyethylene, used in
shampoo bottles, gun cases

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.840
and those grocery sacks skidding

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.040
like upended stars
across the parking lot.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.250
There are more kinds of
stars in this universe

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.630
than salt granules
on drive-thru fries.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.980
Too many stars, lessening and
swelling with each pedal pump away

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.070
from the Value Village
as the beaming billboard

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:51.300 position:56%
above flashes first one DUI attorney
and then another who speaks Spanish.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.080
So the sky above is
constantly chattering,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.260
like the biggest disco ball ever.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.510 position:56%
So one of the things that I learned.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.970
I mean I think writing books
is always an act of learning.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.060
Like, I learned about
all my neuroses.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.700
You know. All my devils too.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:15.030
You know. And one of my neuroses is
Jean-Michel Basquiat's paintings.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.960
I think they are fabulous
and frightening to me.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.230
And as a black man of mixed
decent, they speak to me

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.540
in a particular kind of way.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.490
The bifurcation of art.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.920
And so this is a poem
called Trumpets Up in Here.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.300 position:56%
And it is after a painting by
Jean-Michel Basquiat called Trumpet.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.590
The sprawl and broken crawl on
the back of Basquiat's paints.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.850
The thin cleft of villainous
pigments wrapping each frame

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.590
like the syntax of somebody else's
relaxed explanation of lateness.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.470
What had happened was
below blackened crowns,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.300
below words crossed out as a
reminder of what is underneath.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.130
Potholes, ashy elbows and
breath that, in the cold,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.680
comes out in red light
and complaint shapes.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.950
Three lines from Mile's mouth in
the habit of tardy remuneration.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.820
All of that three triggered
agitation.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.630
All that angry-fingered fruition

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.740 position:56%
like Indianapolis's three
skyscrapered sky when the smile goes

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.820
down and even the sun and the
colors themselves start talking

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.380
like the same suspicious
idiom as a brass instrument.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.900 position:56%
Thin throat like a fist, flat
declinations of pastors and teachers

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.860
at Christmas at the Inner City.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.770
Shoulders back and
heads up while playing

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.240
in holiday choir of hungry paints.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.740
Chins covered in red
scribbles in all of the songs.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.260
So I had this.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.520
I do not know if this is a thing
that is useful, but when I.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.270
So I grew up very poor and it was
something I was embarrassed of.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.120
And I could not talk
about while I was poor

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.860 position:56%
because I was busy trying not to be.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.160
You know what I mean?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.600
And I can only talk about it now

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.400
because I am comfortable
in a different way.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.610
But I grew up very poor and then
my mother married my step-father,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.220
whose name is Matejka.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.830
That is where I got my last name.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.460
And we moved from the section eight
housing straight out the suburbs.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.760
And it was incredible.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.980
We went from having nothing to
everything in like two days.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.460
It was miraculous, right?

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.780
Opening and closing the
refrigerator to make sure

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.080
that the food was still there.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.380
That kind of thing.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.980
So I want to read a
poem about that move.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.060
It is called Outta Here Blacks.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.490
And we were out man, never
going back there again.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.790
Outta Here Blacks.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.680
As soon as Mom married
Pops, off to the suburbs.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.910 position:56%
A realm of glamorously blue swimming
pools, carpools and a spinning rack

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.490
of comic books out front
at the Village Pantry.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.450
We were out of Carriage
House like kids as soon

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.230
as math sub turns his back.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.050
We were out like juice
boxes after lunch.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.210
We were on the Westside, nowhere
near our old neighborhood,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.010
like a well-organized
poverty protest.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.300
No moving truck because we did
not have anything to move out.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.320
We were so out of there, I
had to dial long distance

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.890
to tell Garrett we had gone.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.050
We were outside our chalk lined
piece of town like a bad pitch.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.350
We were outlying that old spelled

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.090
like perfectly spelled
gentrifications.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.390
We were as out of bounds as
the how and why of black kids

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.130
with two white parents now.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.860
Desegregation out here.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.660
I got me some ice cream out here,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.280
like an Eddie Murphy
impersonation by the watercooler.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.080
We were as uncomfortable as a
black joke in our air conditioned

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.730
and well-festooned new home.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.250
Man, alright.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.260
So I am just going to
read two more poems.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.490
I am going to read them
about the suburbs, right?

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.420
Because it is one thing
to think about not having.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.130
It is another thing to realize
everybody in the suburbs

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.280
in the 80's played
Fleetwood Mac [laughter].

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.260
That is real talk, right?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.740
So I mentioned the album
Rumors in this poem.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.290
And I also mention a thing
called a record changer,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.340
which some of us will
know, but others do not.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.490
It was like an L-shaped device
you put on top of a record player

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.450
and then you could stack records
on top of it and they would drop

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.880
down like a pretend continuos play.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.110
So in this poem, this guy has
his record changer and he had.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.940
Well I will tell you
after I read it.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.240
Record Changer.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.560
To left of the neighbor's barbeque
variations of the same house ringed

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.220
by the same foliage
adolescent bushes there,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.460
green tufts of low lying sky.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.430
Dads red faced and bearded

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.990
in the back someplace turning
pure meat over hot coals.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.570
The record player is inside.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.030
Wood box speaker propped
in the windows.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.460 position:56%
To the right across the still seeded
yard are two storey just as square

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.680
and as impeccable as the rest.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.620
We want Prince, but Rumors
keeps restarting itself.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.960
Now here you go again you say.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.620
One neighbor asked, now
where did you come from

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.010
and we say California
like Fleetwood Mac.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.530
And nobody asked anything else.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.500
And because nobody hunts
for dinner in the suburbs,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.370
we put down our implements
of half step and appetite.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.150
Side step the moon as it
descends into a whole plate full

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.860
of charred thighs and wings.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.990
We collectivize the back in
the days ways as tenaciously

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.990
as chicken legs undress
themselves at a cul-de-sac party.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.610
Then we raise those stripped
bones up for history.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.370
Out here, there is not any history.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.050
So history is whatever
you want it to be.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.000
So here is what I was
about to tell you.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.550
So this guy, this bearded
man who had this barbeque,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.200
which was the first
barbeque I had ever been to.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.820
Do you realize how much
food is at a barbeque?

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.130
If you have never been
to one, it is incredible.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.560
Stacks and stacks.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.420
He had four copies of Fleetwood
Mac's Rumors and he put them A side

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.610
to B side [laughter] like this.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:27.910
And these things keep dropping down

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.200
and it just keeps going
over and over again.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.500
And you know I get it now.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.800
It is a good album [laughter].

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.740
It is not Prince.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.500
Alright. So I am going to
read a poem about the next day

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.240
and then one very small
piece of a poem for Marie.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.650
So this is the next
morning after the barbeque.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.540
Strange Celestial Roads.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.380 position:56%
There is a father sleeping it off in
every master bedroom of every house

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.180 position:56%
in the cul-de-sac the morning after.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.450
So Saturday morning is a snooze.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.770
The moon is still out,
eyeballing the quiet street

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.380
like Sun Ra did his Arkestra.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.700
Somebody had to be a father figure
for all of those musical notes.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.900
No school busses to huff after.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.500
No mothers yelling
their children onward.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.510
The only weekend noise
is us kicking rocks.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.320
So bored we cannot even hear
each other on a celestial swirl

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.170
of asphalt that will be
a playground one day.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.790
We stand, right feet extended
in unison like foos men,

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.300
rock after rock arcing at sorry
angles toward the open bar

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.250
that hopes to dangle four swings.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.890
Some rocks go through, some miss
as we balance on concrete meant

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.230
to backstop hop scotch and
echo knock-knock jokes.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.600
Not somebody's father yelling
you got to be kidding me,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.610
after he opens the
property tax bill.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.410 position:56%
These bars were placed here for
some other future kids to be dragged

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.240
from by big ears or
hair matted necks back

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.820
to the unavoidable arguments.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.730
The fist-to-face noises

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.650
and the sweet bleating
saxophones that come after.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.810
Alright. So this is the last
thing I am going to read.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.270
In the middle of this book is
a very long poem called Sounds

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.790
in Sequential Order.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:07.840
And it is based on the music
or the classifications of music

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.090
on the record, the golden record
inside the Voyager's Space Probe.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.020
And I am just going
to read two of them.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.080
Rob thanks for this, man.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.460
This is really great.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.750
Sounds in Sequential Order -- Edit.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.050
Music of the Spheres.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.640
Frequencies get lean out here,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.150
echoing like abandoned ghosts
rattling the forgotten umbrellas

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.520
and coatless hangers in
the front hall closet.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.080
Everyone just ghosted as
soon as the summonses came

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.760
and the exodus sounded like the
stars Jansky did not mean to record

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.970
when he tried to fix
the telephone lines.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.950
This part of the sphere does
not have working phones,

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.560
so where do we go next?

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.200
To the rooms of vacant
advice and gilded paintings

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.660
where the have-it-all live?

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.690
To their quadraphonic systems
and wood-cheeked speakers?

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:53.680
A golden record in a pulsar map
and binary arithmetic plays at 16

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.180
and two thirds RPM's while the
record changer stacks requests

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.480
for traveling music.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.080
One LP settling on
top of another LP.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.210
A platter of orbits for the rest
of the intergalactic Voyagers.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.630
Volcanoes, Earthquakes and Thunder.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.120 position:56%
The fact is the Earth does not rest.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.710
It spins and breaks like an
LP stepped on too many times.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.520
Polyvinyl chloride
backing up into itself --

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.330
rawboned slopes quaking
in elemental underthings

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.330 position:56%
when nobody is around to pray on it.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.760
All of these migratory people --

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.940
hymnals in hand, who
only know the chorus.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.500
But we want to hear the song
over and over, again and again.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.300
Thank you.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:43.520
[ Applause ]

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.820
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Well these guys.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.890
Oop is this one on?

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.190
Yeah, you can hear me.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.020
Well these guys put
their [inaudible] on,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.630 position:56%
I am sure you feel the same way I do

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:57.050
that this is how two poets
should meet one another

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:01.510
by shaking hands and
reading on stage.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.000 position:56%
And then chatting a little bit in
front of whoever is there with them.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.300
You were tremendous.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.360
What a great argument for
the variety of lyric charge

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.110
that we have in American poetry.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:20.950
You both read so differently
and proved the power of voice.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:27.310
I wanted to talk to begin
about the notion of an I,

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.500
autobiographical speaker
and a speaker

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.650
who is clearly a historic persona.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:42.220
And what these books meant to you
in terms of getting at that voice.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.010
Do you want me to help you with?

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.310
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: It is not on.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.610
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: There you go.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Is it one?

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.210
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.510
There that way.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.810
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: This way, right?

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.110
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yep.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.410
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: I am sorry.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.710
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Do not
worry about it.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.010
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: I do not
know what this [inaudible].

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: You know what?

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.610
Just hold it up.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Like that?

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.210
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah that is good.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.510
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: How is that?

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.810
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Can you hear them?

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Can you hear me?

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.410
[Multiple speakers].

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.710
There was no historical
persona in my book.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.010
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Cultural persona.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.310
&gt;&gt; Marie How: Yeah, but
she is me [laughter].

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.610
She is me and every
other woman I know.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.910
You know, so I do not
mean to say only me.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.970
But I really meant her to
be a contemporary woman.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.830 position:56%
Because women, we still have not
told the whole truth about our life.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.100
And we still are too split.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.510
So yes, yes it is Magdalene.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.100
But Magdalene, as a seeker,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:32.120
as a someone who is owning her own
subjectivity, who is the subjective

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.060
of her life and not the
object of someone else's.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.360
You know.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.660
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Did she
give you any freedoms?

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.650
That sort of imposing that,
that, the history, the culture.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:46.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Well it is always
free to wear a slight mask.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.260
Even if you go to a party and you
just wear the little black mask

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.250
like this and everybody knows it
is you, don't you feel better?

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.550
[Laughter].

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:58.670
So you can say a lot of things
that you would be scared to say

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.490
in another time and place.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.280
So Magdalene is every
woman who ever lived.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.340
She is every woman living now being
gang raped in the Congo right now,

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.850
being you know, trying to work in
congress or in this city, you know,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.590
who is becoming a transgendered
person.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.450
I mean she is, she
to me is the female,

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:26.550
the feminine rising principal,
who is you know trying

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.740
to integrate aspects
of herself together.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:40.060 position:56%
So she was a great person to, that
mask to put on because she has been,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.600
she has been how do I say --

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.920
hijacked you know by
the early church Fathers

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.620
and held there for so long.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:57.110
And every woman knows here that you
know we still do not have enough

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.070
archetypes that can integrate
all aspects of human life

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:05.410
for a woman in our imaginations.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.860
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Well,
Adrian, you had turned

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.290
to a historic figure
in your third book.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.520
And then moved in a deeply

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.080
or clearly autobiographical
direction with this.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.530
Can you talk about the
experience from three to four?

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.830
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.020 position:56%
Well I was thinking about that idea
of mask and what a great gift it was

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.250
to be able to you know
through research

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.240
and work adopt a mask
of Jack Johnson.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.420
And be able to sort of tell these
stories and interrogate the kind

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:42.510 position:56%
of political and social actions
that I cannot really address myself.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.470
Right? I mean he is, his
narrative is one that,

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.510
it goes much beyond anything
that I have ever experienced.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.680
And also he was brash
figure and you know amazing.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.540
And we change clothes
five times a day

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.770
so everybody can see
how resplendent he was.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.530
But he also kicked
everybody's ass in the ring.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.060
And so he is in this position
where he is both capable

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.550
of great celebration
and also great violence.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.850
And I do not feel.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.380
Like I do not have
that in me, right?

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.040
I do not have that
kind of [inaudible],

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.850
like that kind of machismo.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.770
I do not have that
kind of magnetism.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.390
And so to put on the mask and
have that for a little while

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:24.060
or at least vicariously have
it was a great, great gift.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.380 position:56%
And when I got finished, I put all
this man's work you know eight years

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.030
worth of work and research.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.080
I had to come back
and look at myself.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.120
Like, I can do that for somebody
else, why cannot I do it for me?

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.710
And so I went back and tried to
turn myself into a character,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.470
who might be a little
bit more interesting

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:45.560
than I am in my day to day life.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.370
And it started with economics.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.700
I kept thinking about okay I am
position now where I can talk

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.600
about what it means to be so hungry
and to be waiting for the school

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.580
to open up so that
you can the free lunch

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.190
or free breakfast in the morning.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.420
And it is not a conversation
we often hear,

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.770
mainly because people
who are poor are busy.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.850
Like I was saying, like they
are busy trying not to be.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.580
They are busy just
trying to make it.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.330
And so it ends up being a kind
of a redemption tale all the time

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.750
when we hear about poverty.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: But you have got
these figures in this book, Sun Ra.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.280
Am I am saying it correctly?

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.580
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.880
Yeah. Sun Ra.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.180
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Am I
saying it correctly?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.480
And do you know who that is?

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.780
Tell everybody who it is.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.080
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah, Sun Ra is
one of the original afro futurists.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.380
He is a great jazz musician.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.920
He said he was from Saturn and I
do not know doubt it [laughter].

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.430
But he is a brilliant band
leader and also [inaudible].

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.560
Yeah, he used to perform with
this thing called the Arkestra.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.150 position:56%
And you know, find Strange Celestial
Roads, it is a brilliant song.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.430
But one of the things that
also ties Sun Ra to this book

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.970
and also Basquiat and Prince and.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.270
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: And Richard Pryor.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.570
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
And Richard Pryor.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.870
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: God bless him.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.170
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: They
are all black men who grew

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.470
up without fathers, like I did.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.090
And so one of the questions I
was trying to interrogate too was

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.810
like what it means to figure
out how to be a kind of,

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.210
like how to be a man when
there were no men around.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.040
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Well they
might have been lucky.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.340
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.640
Well that was the thing, right?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.940
I mean like as soon as I
got out to the suburbs,

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.210
there was a different
kind of thing happening.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.590
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Because
the other men.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.900
I mean, I adore this book, Adrian.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.630
First of all, I mean you also.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:22.470
You. The black astronauts
and the Voyager one and two.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.770
The wonderful voyagers.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.070
You know it is 40 years.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.650
You know the Voyagers are out
there now going forever and ever.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.370
And it is the music,
the LP's and the.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.670
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: It
is on the heliosphere.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.920
It is past anything
we have ever created.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.220
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: I know.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.520
[Inaudible].

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.820
And they will go forever now
until something hits them.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.120
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
Yeah that is right.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.420
I do not know if you
all know this, right?

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.720
So the Voyager Space Probe is
outside of the heliosphere,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.020
which means it is further out.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.320
It is past the Sun's gravity.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.620
It is past all of that.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.920
Out into the.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.770
So there were recordings of Mozart

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:52.730
and Louis Armstrong
and babies crying.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.030
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Laughter.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.330
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Laughter.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.630
And it is out there.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.930
And somebody.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.230
But they have to figure out
how to play it [laughter].

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.530
So, like we do not even
know how to play LP's now.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.830
So how does somebody like, some
you know some space entity going

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.310
to find this, right.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.390
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: You know what the
greatest difference between us

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.440
and I was thinking, I mean
no kidding I was yelling

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.770
when I was reading this and my
daughter kept saying, what, what?

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.680
I am like he is so good.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.980
He is so good!

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.280
He is so good!

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.330
And what. You are so
good in so many ways.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.760
But you are the master
of metaphor and simile.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.060
I do not use anymore.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.360
I do not use them.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.660
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: So this
is being recorded, right?

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.960
[Laughter].

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.260
So I can go back and look at
this and make myself feel better.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.860
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: You
can be, mom, dad look.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.660
Look what Marie Howe says.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.190
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: No I am serious.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.490
I have got.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.790
This is so dog-eared.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.090
But the whole.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.660
I mean you heard the first poem
you read is such a great example.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.960
Not the first.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.260
The second.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.560
They are all great.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.120 position:56%
But I mean a metaphor where you
just go like this, this, this, this,

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.720
this and the metaphors,
I wanted to say wait read

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.180
that again slower so
everybody can hear.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.590
I am going to show you.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.890
Where did it go?

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.190
The one Westside, the Westside one.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.490
Moving to the suburb one.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.790
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.090
Outta Here Blacks.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.390
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: That was it.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.690
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Outta Here Blacks.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.990
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.290
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: What page.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.590
Here it is.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.890
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: This is like
the best day of life [laughter].

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.190 position:56%
Can we just stay in here for a
little while because this is making.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.490
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: No kidding.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.790
Wait. What is it called?

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.090
Get Outta Here Blacks, right?

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah, Outta Here.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.690
Yeah.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.990
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Okay, so is
Carriage House the neighborhood?

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.290
The settlement or whatever?

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.590
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah
and it is still there.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.960
And it looks exactly the
same as it did in 1981.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.260
It is terrible.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.980
Same maroon paint on the doors.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: So just,
just do this.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.400
Read this real slow.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.700
Everybody listen to this.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.140
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Which part,
which part do you want me to read?

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.440
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Just
take it from the top.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.740
Read it real slow [laughter].

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.740
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: See now
there is all this pressure.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.370
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: No, no
just read the words slow.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.670
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Okay.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.040
If Marie Howe asks you to read
your poem, you read your poem.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.340
That is how this works.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.640
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: I love that he
is giving me this authority.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.940
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah,
yeah, well come on.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.660
You are in the middle.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.790
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: I [inaudible]
stealing from you for years.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:02.320
So. Okay. So as soon as mom
married pops, off to the suburbs.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.970
Realm of glamorously blue swimming
pools, carpools and a spinning rack

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.150
of comic books out front
at the Village Pantry.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.440
We were out of Carriage
House like kids as soon

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.800
as math sub turns his back.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.920
We were out like juice
boxes after lunch.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.950
We were on the Westside, nowhere
near our old neighborhood,

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.910
like a well-organized
poverty protest.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.050
I am going to stop there because.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.260
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Like a
well-organized poverty protest.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.700
Right? It is just gorgeous.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.210
If you want to, just.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.630
I insist. And it goes
on and on and on and on.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.900
But every single one
of them is just.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.570
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: So
this is totally opposite

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.190
of how I thought this
conversation was going to go.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.130
I wanted to talk about Magdalene.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.430
So let's talk about her.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.730
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Let's talk a
little bit about Magdalene.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.290
We only have so much time.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.610
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: And
then we got to go.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.910
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: So maybe.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.340
Adrian you want to
ask about Magdalene?

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.640
[Inaudible].

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.940
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.240
No, no. So one of the things that
I was so enamored with was the way

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.860
that you were able to work
through myth to recreate

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.630
and reclaim these ideas
of what a woman can be

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.060
in all of these various ways.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.640
And I am really interested
in how that speaks back

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.310
to your earlier work and the
interrogations that you have

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.680
and especially the poems.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.980
Like I was.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.940
I posted a poem on
Instagram Questions.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.250
And it is not from this book.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.290
It is from before and everyone
went nuts about the idea

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.270
of having a dialogue with a mother.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.570
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Oh yeah.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:30.870
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: I
do not have my phone.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.170
It is in my bag, otherwise
I would read this poem.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.770
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: So
that you could hear it.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.070
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: I learned
that from Alan Shapiro.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.370
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Really?

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.670
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: You know that
great book, Song and Dance?

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.970
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.270
Yeah.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:42.570
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: It is
the greatest book.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.870
One of the greatest books ever.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.170
And also from Brenda Hillman,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.470
you know who has this other
voice talking with her.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:47.880
Everything any writer does
they learn from somebody else.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.180
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
That is really true.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.480
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Truly.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.780
I mean just like musicians, right?

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.930
Because what we do is instead
of listen, we read and we take

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.570
in other people's poems and
possibilities open up within us.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.690
And well it is also dialogue
between self and soul, right?

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.920
It is so old, it is a Yates.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.220
It is before Yates.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.670
It is you know aspects of yourself
speaking and answering yourself.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.970
It is a great thing to do.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.370
Everyone today just sit
down and have one part

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.830
of yourself ask a question and the
other aspect of yourself answer.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:24.100
It is fascinating to let yourself
ask questions and answer them.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.400
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.420
No it is beautiful and the way
that it operates I think between,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.960
I do not want to say characters.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.420
But between versions of
the self as they appear.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.720
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Yes.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.340
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: In Magdalene
is just so gorgeous too.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Versions
of the self, right?

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.450
That is what your book
deals with too.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:43.160
Because there is the poor,
wonderful, vitally alive kid,

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.280
you know trying to stay alive.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.640
And then he gets in the suburbs and
he is still trying to stay alive.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.230 position:56%
I mean that is what is so great is
that you know he gets to the suburbs

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.400
and you think phew good at least.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.620
But no. because that too
is going to be replaced

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.950
and replaced and it is so American.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:02.250
You know, like.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.430
But they are on a driveway that is
one day going to be a parking lot,

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.010
that is one day going
to be a playground,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.200
that is one day is going be a mall.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.040
I mean there is this wonderful
sense of the constant replacement

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.820
that occurs in this country and
how nothing is rooted you know.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.440
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka: Yeah and have to
think that that operates in terms

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.210
of identity, like self identity.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.510
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Yes.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.810
&gt;&gt; Adrian Matejka:
And gender identity.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.110
How does that work for you,
like that sort of [inaudible].

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.410
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Well it is the same.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.710
I mean especially now.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.010
I do not mean to keep talking
about myself as a woman.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.810
But I am. So I feel as if.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.110
That is what I mean.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.980
Like I do not mean
to keep narrowing.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.280
I mean to broaden it.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.570
That every male has a feminine,

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.280
every woman has a masculine
and this integration.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.930
And of course.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.060
But so the patriarch is
quite different from men.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.670
You know, men are wonderful.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.570
But the patriarchal values, which
have subjugated women and the Earth

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.120
and the whole thing
has forced woman,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.750
like people of color you know.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:02.630
Like to be pushed down in a
way so that the energy actually

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.480
in those beautiful
energies is coming forth now

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.670
and has been for decades
and decades.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.970
And it is healing.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:16.090 position:56%
And so a lot of the, a lot has to be
sort of sung to, to come back alive.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.220
You know women's sexuality
is not at odds

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.720
with women's spirituality, right?

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:27.420 position:56%
Women as a mother is not at odds
with her as a sexual, erotic person.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.350 position:56%
I mean these things have been split.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:30.650
So to bring them back.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.620
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: On that note,

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.900
you should get a copy
of both of these books.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.980
They will be signing down stairs.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.210
Magdalene and Map to the Stars.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.670
Thank you to our wonderful poets.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.650
I am so happy they met
each other in front of you.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.950
[Applause].

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.870
&gt;&gt; Marie Howe: Thank you, Rob.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.500
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
