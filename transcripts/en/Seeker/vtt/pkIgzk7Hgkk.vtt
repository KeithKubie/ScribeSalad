00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.320
No two storms are alike, so when we first
go into a storm,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.000
we don't even know what we're going to expect.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.220
We're out there 8-10 hours.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.630
My stress level in a flight is typically high,
and I can say that's probably a good thing,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.460
'cause it keeps me sharp and on my toes.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.480
But you pretty much hang on and trust your
judgment and trust the judgment of the pilots,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.560
and hope for the best.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.520
This work is important for me because I believe it's a crucial help to the American people

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.260
in warning them on whether the storm is going to impact their lives and property.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.700
I started working for NOAA in 2007, and two years later, in 2009, I started flying into hurricanes.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.920
Hurricane hunters fly in and around the hurricane or tropical storm environment

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.340
to gather critical information that helps predict where the storm is going,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.980
and what the intensity is going to be.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.660
The first storm I flew into was just east
of the East Coast of the U.S.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
Seeing the actual eyewall on the radar and knowing that we were going to go inside the center was…

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.400
it was awesome.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.840
You get to look out the window and see these
thunderstorms right outside your window as

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.240
you're flying close to them and through them.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.060
So this is where I sit as a Flight Director.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020
We have several monitors that we keep an eye on.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.100
Up front, we have the pilots that sit in the
left seat and the right seat,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.620
and we have a flight engineer here that sits in the middle.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.280
We have our lead scientist typically sit in
this seat, where they have a good view

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.220
out the window, and they have some monitors to look at the data.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.920
And if we go a little further back, we have
here to the left is where the navigator sits.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.300
They make the radio calls, they determine
our flight path and call in for our locations.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.840
Back here is the galley.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.310
We have the restroom, the food, the kitchen
- most important part.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.820
We have a cooler back here to put our food,
and a microwave, and coffee,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.320
and that's about it.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.920
We're notified when to fly by the National
Hurricane Center, or by the Hurricane Research Division,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.500
typically 24 hours in advance.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.240
I need to look at several things to do a briefing for the entire crew to keep the airplane safe.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.030
We need to find out whether the storm is predicted
to be a rapid intensifier.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.928
We're looking for any tornadoes, and other critical items

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.700
about the structure of the storm that could pose a threat.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.000
If there's any concerns about our mission,
we may choose another plan.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.000
As a flight director we are in charge of the
mission, and we direct the plane

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.820
in and around the storm to get to the locations where we
need to gather that critical data.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.010
One of the biggest challenges, but also most fun for me, is hunting for the center of the storm,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.870
and that's where the wind speed is
zero.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.620
It's actually kind of more like an art, to
not make too many turns

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.220
but fly over that exact center spot.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.660
Once I find the center of the storm, we mark it.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.150
The navigator marks the latitude and longitude;

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.930
we also collect the highest wind speeds of the storm, which is typically in the eyewall,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.260
on our way in or out of the center.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.200
This station to the left is our dropsonde
operator.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.760
They're listening for me to call when to release a dropsonde or a buoy, and they use these

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.480
two tubes right here, and they flip this switch right here,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.360
and the bottom lever opens up, and the pressure differential

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.560
between the outside air and the inside of
the airplane pretty much sucks the dropsonde

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.130
out of the tube and out into the atmosphere.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.910
Once they're released, a little parachute
is connected to it.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.849
It goes up, out into the air to keep the dropsonde
stable as it falls through the atmosphere,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.640
collecting wind speed and wind direction and
fall rate all the way down, until it hits

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.810
the ocean's surface.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.349
We have a person from the Hurricane Research
Division sitting here and processing those

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.739
dropsondes that fall into the water.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.680
They gather the data, process it, package
it up, and send it off the airplane.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.590
They use that information to make their official
Hurricane Center forecast, which is what all

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.440
the news stations and everyone grabs to find
out what's going on with the storm.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.639
Growing up, I used to always ask the question, “why?" about everything.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.930
And there's always more questions.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.320
We'll never understand fully how these things develop.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.080
The lure of studying hurricanes for me is just being completely fascinated with how these storms develop,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.760
and I wanted to actually take a firsthand look and see for myself.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.219
In this next episode, a wildlife biologist
has the tense job of tracking grizzly bears.

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.979
