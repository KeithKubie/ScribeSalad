00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:23.450
JOCELYN: Hi.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.130
Jocelyn here and today we're
going to go over fall 2009

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.440
exam three problem
number four.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.720
Starting with part A--

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.580
let's read the problem.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.940
In the 1920s, Jack Breitbart of
Revlon laboratories found

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.830
that acne could be treated by
the use of benzoyl peroxide.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.240
The oxygen-oxygen bond in
peroxide is weak and under the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.200
influence of modest heating,
benzoyl peroxide readily

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.870
decompose to form free radicals
according to the

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.650
reaction given.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.150
The rate of decomposition is
measured at 92 degrees C at

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.660
various concentrations
and found to be--

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.220
and you're given two different
concentrations and two

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.870
different rates.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.270
So part A asks, determine the
order of reaction for the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.980
decomposition of benzoyl
peroxide.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.370
The first thing to do is, when
asked for the order of the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.420
decomposition reaction, we
want to think about the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.220
general rate loss, right?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.155
We're given concentrations.

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.390
We're given rates.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.030
We're asked for the order.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.350
Something you might want to
have written down on your

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.290
equation sheet or look up is the
general rate law equation.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.630
Remember that students taking
these exams did have an

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.715
equation sheet so they could
have this ready.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.220
The important part is that
you know when to use this

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130
equation, what each
of the terms mean.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.060
So r is the rate.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.790
k is a rate constant.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.620
It is a function of temperature,
but if you're at

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.520
the same temperature, that rate
constant will not change.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560
It's constant.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.810
c is your concentration.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.660
And n is your reaction order.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.670
So this would be the place to
start for this question.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.690
And now we know that we're
solving for n.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.050
So what is n in this case?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.190
Looking at what we're
given, we can write

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.440
two different equations.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.770
The first line gives us a
specific rate for a specific

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.140
concentration.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.830
The second line gives us another
rate for a second

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.100
concentration.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.490
So now we have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.050
That means we can solve for one
of the unknowns and then

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.170
could solve for the other one
if we wanted to, but here we

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.290
only care about n.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.000
So how I'm going to choose to
solve this and you may choose

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.250
to do it differently--

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.500
I'm going to divide the first
line by the second line and I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:49.390
get rate one over rate two
equals c1 divided by c2 all to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.090
the n power.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.010
So that made the k drop out,
which is one of the unknowns

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.040
that I don't care about because
the problem isn't

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.350
asking for that.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.720
Now all we need to do
is solve for n.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.320
So if we remember algebra, we're
going to take the log of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.570
both sides.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.250
Because of the properties
of the log, we can

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.500
bring the n out front.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.952
So n equals--

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.390
and plugging in the numbers
given in the problem--

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.370
they're given in the same
units so everything will

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.650
cancel out and that's good--

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.300
we get that the n equals one.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.970
So this is a first
order reaction.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.480
Now you could've probably done
that by inspection if you're

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.250
familiar with the rate law and
how to determine that by just

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.855
seeing that as the concentration
went down by a

00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:07.680
fourth, the rate also went
down by a fourth.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.730
However, the question asks for
you to determine the order of

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.910
reaction and so we were
looking for more of a

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.770
derivation of the problem
instead of just an inspection

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.760
because that shows that you have
a familiarity with the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.780
general rate law equation.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.380
So now moving to part B--

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.850
we are asked, on the plot below,
sketch the variation in

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.180
energy with extent of reaction
for the decomposition of

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.770
benzoyl peroxide.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.580
Assume that the ratio of
activation energy to--

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.290
delta e, which is the energy
of the reaction--

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.170
equals -2.5.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.200
Label the energy states and
label the delta e of reaction,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.710
the activation energy for the
forward reaction and the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.200
activation energy for the
backward reaction.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.260
So that's asking
us to do a lot.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.230
So first we're going to write
down, what are we actually

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.480
asked to do?

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.490
So the main thing is that we're
asked for the variation

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:34.240
in energy with the extent
of reaction.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.280
So as the reaction progresses,
what's the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.090
energy of the molecule?

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.560
The energy state that
it's going through?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:54.920
In that plot, we're asked to
label the energy states of the

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:09.330
reactant and product and
we're asked to label

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.210
the delta e of reaction.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.450
So what's the net change in
energy as well as the

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.820
activation, both forward
and backward?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.040
I would always write this to
the side or scrap piece of

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.400
paper or something because this
is a lot of things to put

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.700
on one plot and this will be a
nice reference to help us to

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.630
make sure we answered all the
things the question is asking.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.730
So on the plot given, which I'll
reproduce here, it has

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:53.992
axes of extent of reaction
and energy.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.900
The first thing to do would be
to label the beginning and

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.740
start energy states.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:12.310
So because we know at
92 degrees C, this--

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.610
the benzoyl peroxide--

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.010
decomposes readily, we can
assume that there's

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.640
a decrease in energy.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.620
So we'll have our products
start at a

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.760
higher energy than our--

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.440
sorry-- our reactant
start at a higher

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.430
energy than our products.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.525
And because the question asks us
to label that, we're going

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.593
to put in the actual labels.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.350
And so that's your reactant
and then we

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.250
have the radical product.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.480
Now that we have our beginning
and end energy states, we need

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.230
to think about what's happening
in the middle.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.160
A clue is that he talks about
the activation energy, right?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.370
And we know that most processes
that we talk about

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.850
have a certain activation
energy.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.650
You can't just go straight
from the

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.930
molecule to the radical.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.900
You have to have a little
bit of energy cuffed.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.410
And so we know we're going to
have some type of hill that we

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.650
have to go over.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.160
Furthermore, in the problem he
states that the activation

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.700
energy divided by the
delta e is -2.5.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.520
So we know that because this
is a negative delta e--

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.580
so this is our delta e here
and it's negative--

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.060
our activation energy is two and
a half times as large as

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.110
that net change in energy.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.435
So we want to kind of just
eyeball that in here.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.820
You didn't have to be exact,
but relatively--

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.320
it's going to be larger
than twice the

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.820
distance between here.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.450
And remember that activation
energy is the hill, the energy

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.390
costs that you have to go
through to get to your lower

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.796
energy state in the
product size.

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:53.670
So now that we have all of our
energy states, we want to draw

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.630
a smooth curve to show
the variation of

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.380
energy with the reaction.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:05.300
So connecting all these points,
we get two valleys and

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.940
a hill, right?

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.450
We have two stable energy
states and we have an

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.430
activated complex corresponding
to the

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.940
activation energy there.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.120
So we have our energy diagram,
but we need to go back to what

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.490
the question is asking and see
that we've labeled the energy

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.910
states, we've labeled the delta
e of reaction, but we

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.950
need to label both
the forward and

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.040
backwards activation energy.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.650
And this is one of the things
people had issues with--

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.120
the backward activation.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.900
So forward activation
is pretty self

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.360
explanatory, right?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.170
It's the energy we need to
overcome the activation of

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:53.910
this process and so this is
the Ea of the forward.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.500
Now the activation energy of the
backward reaction is just

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.100
the same concept, but
going backwards.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.820
So if we started down here, what
is the energy we need to

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.360
get over this activation
barrier?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:18.090
And so that's this full energy,
this full amount of

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.330
energy here.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.650
And so we can see that it's
bigger than the activation

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.910
energy for the forward
reaction by the

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.110
delta e of the reaction.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.510
So going back to our checklist
here, we've answered all over

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.500
the questions and so we
can move to part C.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.580
So part C asks us, on the
same plot above--

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.980
which we have over here
to the right--

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.910
sketch the variation in energy
with extent of reaction for

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.370
the decomposition of benzoyl
peroxide under the influence

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.810
of a catalyst.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.420
So with a catalyst--

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.610
first to answer this question,
we need to know what a

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.200
catalyst does.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.970
And in class, we learned that
a catalyst will lower the

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.470
activation barrier, thus
allowing for the reaction to

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.570
proceed faster.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.750
You don't necessarily get more
product because that's

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.890
governed by a different set of
laws, but you do get the

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.510
product faster.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:31.210
And so the way we can change
this is that instead of having

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.005
our activation barrier up there,
we can say it's going

00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:37.956
to be somewhere here.

00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:44.390
It's going to be lowered by the
presence of the catalyst.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.870
So we want to make a smooth
curve again and connect this

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.770
lower activation barrier.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.920
And you'd want to label this--

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.540
I'll label it in white--

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:08.920
this is the catalyzed
curve there.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.380
As long as you've showed that
the activation barrier was

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.480
lowered by the presence of
a catalyst, that's fine.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.610
That was what the question
was asking for.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.720
So we've labeled everything,
answered all the questions and

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.550
we're done with this problem.
