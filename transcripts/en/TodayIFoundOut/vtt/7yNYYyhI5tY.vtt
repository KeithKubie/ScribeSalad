00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.830
According to the World Health Organization,
about 347 million people worldwide have diabetes.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.030
Because diabetes treatments are so common
today, it can be easy to forget that the disease

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
can be fatal.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.100
In fact, it is approximately the seventh leading
cause of death worldwide.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.189
Luckily, many people diagnosed with diabetes
today enjoy healthy, otherwise normal, lives

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.710
thanks to advances in treatment, and most
notably insulin.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.890
However, this development is relatively recent,
and only 100 years ago to receive a diabetes

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.730
diagnosis was to be condemned to a life of
near starvation and early death.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.690
Known to the ancients, diabetes is one of
the first diseases ever classified.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.051
Both the Vedic-period Indians and the Egyptians
knew it, with the former recognizing it by

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:59.780
the fact that the urine of its sufferers was
so sweet it would attract ants.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.740
Early on, a diabetes mellitus diagnosis was
a death sentence.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.950
By the end of the 1st millennium, its symptoms
were well known: excessive, sweet-tasting

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.310
(yes, tasting) urine, excessive thirst, abnormal
appetite and sometimes, even, gangrene.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.150
Early treatments included a mixture of fenungreek,
lupine, trigonnella and zedoary seed, a combination

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.770
that is sometimes still used today to reduce
the excretion of sugar.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.530
By the dawn of the 20th century, leading diabetes
specialists were advocating what some called

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.070
a starvation diet, “not as a cure, but for
relief of symptoms and maximum extension of

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.070
life.”

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.350
Hardly a solution, other researchers began
exploring healthier treatments for patients.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.960
One of these was Frederick Banting, a Canadian
doctor.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.560
In 1920, he had the idea that a product could
be extracted from the pancreas that could

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.650
be used to reverse the effects of diabetes.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.990
Banting didn’t pull this idea out of thin
air.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.070
Thirty years before, in 1889, two Germans,
a physiologist, Oskar Minkowski, and a physician,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.400
Joseph von Mering, had discovered that the
pancreas regulated glucose.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.659
By conducting several experiments that either
removed the pancreas (from a dog) or tied

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.570
off the duct that went from it to the intestine,
they discovered that dogs that had the pancreas

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.420
completely removed died from diabetes, but
those who only had the digestive duct ligated

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.890
did not develop the condition.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.590
Clearly, they surmised, the pancreas produced
something that prevented diabetes.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.500
Building on this idea, Banting believed that
if a healthy pancreas was deprived of nourishment,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.720
it would lose its ability to make digestive
juices, but its remaining cells could be used

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.209
to create an antidiabetic product.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.340
A simple doctor with only a bachelor’s degree,
Banting needed the help of a professional

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.489
researcher, and he ultimately enlisted the
aid of University of Toronto professor John

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.489
Macleod.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.670
Macleod grudgingly allowed Banting to use
a bit of laboratory space and gave him ten

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.350
dogs and an assistant, Charles Best.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.630
In the summer of 1921, Banting and Best first
removed a pancreas from one dog – giving

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.630
it diabetes.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.370
Then they “ligated” the pancreas of another,
stopping its nourishment.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.069
After it degenerated, they removed it, chopped
it up, froze it in a special saltwater, ground

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.110
it up and injected it into the now-diabetic
dog.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.989
The poor dog improved, and Banting and Best
discovered that a few daily injections kept

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.099
the dog healthy.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.540
This finally impressed Macleod who provided
them with more funds and a better lab.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.920
Although Banting and Best initially called
their treatment “isletin,” they deferred

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.980
to Macleod’s suggestion of “insulin.”

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.319
The name derives from the Latin “insula,”
meaning “island.”

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.250
Later in the year, Bertram Collip, a biochemist,
joined the team, and they also switched from

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.870
using small dog pancreas to the larger ones
found in cows.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.650
They eventually learned that shrinking the
pancreas was unnecessary, as whole, adult

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.810
pancreases worked just fine.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.629
Collip had been brought on to help purify
the insulin and determine the proper dose

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.629
for humans.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.671
The first two human guinea pigs were Banting
and Best who injected themselves; although

00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:46.629
they suffered from dizziness and weakness,
it otherwise had no ill effects.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.660
During this time, Collip discovered that glucose
helped alleviate the symptoms of an insulin

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.660
overdose.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.310
The first diabetic human to try insulin was
Leonard Thompson, a 14-year-old from Toronto

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.120
who was near death when they began the trial
in January 1922.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.540
Shortly thereafter, he regained his health.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.550
Another early subject was Elizabeth Hughes,
the daughter of a prominent American, Charles

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.310
Evans Hughes, Sr., who at the time was the
U.S. Secretary of State.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.600
(He later went on to become the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court).

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.790
Prior to insulin, Elizabeth was treated with
a starvation diet with only limited success.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.120
By 1922, she had dropped to 45 pounds (she
was about 5 feet tall), and her mother pleaded

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.720
with Banting until Elizabeth was allowed to
participate in the trial.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.379
Also a success, Elizabeth ultimately went
on to lead a long, full life.

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.259
By 1923, the world realized what Banting,
Best and Collip had discovered with Macleod’s

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.999
help, and the Nobel Committee awarded Banting
and Macleod the Nobel Prize in Physiology

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.999
or Medicine.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.210
Banting was angry that Macleod, and not Best,
was included in the prize.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.979
In later years, the committee has justified
its award to Macleod, rather than Best and

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.940
Collip, by noting that Macleod provided financial
and other support for the project, supervised

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.039
the work and used his connections to get the
discovery known among the larger scientific

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.039
community.

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.550
In the end, Best and Collip received recognition,
at least from Banting and Macleod, who shared

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:27.059
their cash awards with their over-looked colleagues.
