heard of nuclear weapons
 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.050

one of whom thought a great deal about

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.060
one of whom thought a great deal about
 

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.640
one of whom thought a great deal about
nuclear weapons but didn't really know

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:31.650
nuclear weapons but didn't really know
 

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.430
nuclear weapons but didn't really know
what to do about them or couldn't figure

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440
what to do about them or couldn't figure
 

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.190
what to do about them or couldn't figure
out what to do about them and one of

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200
out what to do about them and one of
 

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.400
out what to do about them and one of
whom was actually in a position to do

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.410
whom was actually in a position to do
 

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.730
whom was actually in a position to do
something about them all of them agreed

I think on what the basis of a grand
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.590
I think on what the basis of a grand
strategy for nuclear weapons ought to be

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600
strategy for nuclear weapons ought to be
 

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.510
strategy for nuclear weapons ought to be
but they were so widely separated in

but they were so widely separated in
 

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.650
but they were so widely separated in
time and in one instance also certainly

by temperament that it I think would
have astonished them have you been able

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540
have astonished them have you been able

to get them together in the same room

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.370
to get them together in the same room
 

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.060
to get them together in the same room
and point out how much they agreed with

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.070
and point out how much they agreed with
 

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.560
and point out how much they agreed with
each other the fact that they did or at

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:12.570
each other the fact that they did or at

put forward this afternoon may suggest
 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.580
put forward this afternoon may suggest
that there is a kind of nuclear logic

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:25.590
that there is a kind of nuclear logic
 

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.030
that there is a kind of nuclear logic
that exists that transcends time place

what and perhaps this kind of question
might bring us back to something that is

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:23.120
might bring us back to something that is
 

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.460
might bring us back to something that is
as I said earlier the most extraordinary

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:25.470
as I said earlier the most extraordinary
 

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.220
as I said earlier the most extraordinary
achievement of the Cold War which is

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:28.230
achievement of the Cold War which is
 

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.110
achievement of the Cold War which is
that nuclear weapons were developed but

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:30.120
that nuclear weapons were developed but
 

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.520
that nuclear weapons were developed but
not used it's because so many people so

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:34.530
not used it's because so many people so
 

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:38.420
not used it's because so many people so
many leaders had the good sense or were

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:38.430
many leaders had the good sense or were
 

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.330
many leaders had the good sense or were
frightened into asking the then what

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:41.340
frightened into asking the then what
 

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.960
frightened into asking the then what
question if we use nuclear weapons

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:43.970
question if we use nuclear weapons
 

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:48.920
question if we use nuclear weapons
whether in Korea or in Vietnam or in

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:48.930
whether in Korea or in Vietnam or in
 

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.590
whether in Korea or in Vietnam or in
Afghanistan or against India or against

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:51.600
Afghanistan or against India or against
 

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.110
Afghanistan or against India or against
Pakistan or whatever then what and

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:57.120
Pakistan or whatever then what and
 

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.970
Pakistan or whatever then what and
nobody could answer that question and

00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980
nobody could answer that question and
 

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.780
nobody could answer that question and
that's where nuclear weapons have

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:01.790
that's where nuclear weapons have
 

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.430
that's where nuclear weapons have
deterrent capability that I think is

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440
deterrent capability that I think is
 

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.110
deterrent capability that I think is
often underestimated then because it

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:06.120
often underestimated then because it
 

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.730
often underestimated then because it
leads not to the deterrence of another

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740
leads not to the deterrence of another
 

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.930
leads not to the deterrence of another
nation but it leads to self-determine

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:10.940
nation but it leads to self-determine
 

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.730
nation but it leads to self-determine
now if we could focus more on that if we

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740
now if we could focus more on that if we
 

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:21.320
now if we could focus more on that if we
could publicize that history a lot if we

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:21.330
could publicize that history a lot if we
 

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.210
could publicize that history a lot if we
could perhaps find a way to say this in

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220
could perhaps find a way to say this in
 

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.510
could perhaps find a way to say this in
our own government statements instead of

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520
our own government statements instead of
 

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.600
our own government statements instead of
going around and saying thou shalt not

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:28.610
going around and saying thou shalt not
 

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:31.250
going around and saying thou shalt not
just say well what do you expect what

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260
just say well what do you expect what
 

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.360
just say well what do you expect what
happened next you see then I think we

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:35.370
happened next you see then I think we
 

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:37.750
happened next you see then I think we
might be getting somewhere

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760
might be getting somewhere
 

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.640
might be getting somewhere
admittedly it's gonna be hard to say

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:40.650
admittedly it's gonna be hard to say
 

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:44.900
admittedly it's gonna be hard to say
this to the Israelis but one should and

this to the Israelis but one should and
 

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.300
this to the Israelis but one should and
they probably have answers

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:47.310
they probably have answers
 

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.940
they probably have answers
conventional forces etcetera maybe

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:49.950
conventional forces etcetera maybe
 

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.060
conventional forces etcetera maybe
there's an argument to be made for

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:52.070
there's an argument to be made for
 

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:54.470
there's an argument to be made for
making special provision for countries

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480
making special provision for countries
 

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.080
making special provision for countries
that are in the position of feeling that

that are in the position of feeling that

that are in the position of feeling that
they have no recourse other than to

they have no recourse other than to
 

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.430
they have no recourse other than to
resort to nuclear weapons for their

defense I'm not persuaded Israel is in
 

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.200
defense I'm not persuaded Israel is in
that situation but let's say it were in

that situation but let's say it were in
 

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.800
that situation but let's say it were in
that situation in that case maybe there

for the last 40 years or so it just
 

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.580
for the last 40 years or so it just
hasn't been formal but something like

hasn't been formal but something like

that might be an edge

that might be an edge

that might be an edge

saying here and here's where I will wind

saying here and here's where I will wind
up is that there's much to be learned

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:36.109
up is that there's much to be learned
 

00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:40.930
up is that there's much to be learned
from asking simple questions of complex

cold war why is defense and all of these
 

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.240
cold war why is defense and all of these
are childlike questions but

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:19.250
are childlike questions but
 

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.980
are childlike questions but
extraordinarily important questions and

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:20.990
extraordinarily important questions and
 

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:23.670
extraordinarily important questions and
I just conclude with the suggestion that

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680
I just conclude with the suggestion that
 

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.410
I just conclude with the suggestion that
the ability to ask these kinds of

the ability to ask these kinds of
 

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.530
the ability to ask these kinds of
questions is fundamental to how one

thank you so much I have two questions
 

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.690
thank you so much I have two questions
first of all it's interesting to hear

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700
first of all it's interesting to hear
 

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.160
first of all it's interesting to hear
your characterization of Ronald Reagan

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.170
your characterization of Ronald Reagan
 

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.290
your characterization of Ronald Reagan
which of course many will differ with

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300
which of course many will differ with
 

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.540
which of course many will differ with
quite strongly how do you see Reagan

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:26.550
quite strongly how do you see Reagan
 

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.970
quite strongly how do you see Reagan
dealing as you know when he was elected

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980
dealing as you know when he was elected
 

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.210
dealing as you know when he was elected
there was a tremendous thrust in the

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220
there was a tremendous thrust in the
 

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.160
there was a tremendous thrust in the
political forces of Representatives camp

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:34.170
political forces of Representatives camp
 

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:35.990
political forces of Representatives camp
such as the committee at present danger

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000
such as the committee at present danger
 

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.420
such as the committee at present danger
making rather alarming comments about

nuclear war and one could interpret SDI
 

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:43.970
nuclear war and one could interpret SDI
differently as a measure to as let's say

differently as a measure to as let's say
 

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.040
differently as a measure to as let's say
adopt a counter force strategy which was

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:46.050

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:49.000
adopt a counter force strategy which was
clearly articulated by the Reagan folks

clearly articulated by the Reagan folks
how do you see that in terms of

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960
how do you see that in terms of
 

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.109
how do you see that in terms of
factoring into the picture you painted

00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119
factoring into the picture you painted
 

00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:56.510
factoring into the picture you painted
and secondly why should what are we

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520
and secondly why should what are we
 

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.940
and secondly why should what are we
supposed to do now a simple question if

00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:58.950
supposed to do now a simple question if
 

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:00.680
supposed to do now a simple question if

something similar to Nixon in 1969 let's

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:13.870
something similar to Nixon in 1969 let's
 

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:15.870
something similar to Nixon in 1969 let's
act together to take out the Chinese

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880
act together to take out the Chinese
 

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.990
act together to take out the Chinese
nuclear capability Nixon said the

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000
nuclear capability Nixon said the
 

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.470
nuclear capability Nixon said the
national security of China is vital to

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480
national security of China is vital to
 

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.000
national security of China is vital to
the national security of the United

the national security of the United

that's fascinating to look at we have a

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:33.190
that's fascinating to look at we have a
 

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:36.720
that's fascinating to look at we have a
more recent case which is North Korea we

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:36.730
more recent case which is North Korea we
 

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:38.820
more recent case which is North Korea we
said repeatedly we will not allow Kim

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:38.830
said repeatedly we will not allow Kim
 

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.220

now Kim jong-il got a nuclear weapon a

it used to be but can we say that the

something that will happen and we

we would deal with that situation but I

we would deal with that situation but I

we would deal with that situation but I
come back to the point that I made in

forth but I think what really led him to
 

01:16:29.909 --> 01:16:32.529
forth but I think what really led him to
appreciate Chekhov it's just how

01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:32.539

was my reaction for years this is just

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:42.809
was my reaction for years this is just
 

01:16:42.809 --> 01:16:47.089
was my reaction for years this is just
boring and then only after you really

01:16:47.089 --> 01:16:47.099
boring and then only after you really
 

01:16:47.099 --> 01:16:49.969
boring and then only after you really
get into this do you realize that really

01:16:49.969 --> 01:16:49.979
get into this do you realize that really
 

01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:51.379
get into this do you realize that really
interesting things are happening in a

01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:51.389
interesting things are happening in a
 

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:53.119
interesting things are happening in a
very quiet way behind the scenes it's

01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:53.129
very quiet way behind the scenes it's
 

01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:56.209
very quiet way behind the scenes it's
all contained and I think it was that

01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219
all contained and I think it was that
 

01:16:56.219 --> 01:16:59.270
all contained and I think it was that
that really appealed to George and led

01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280
that really appealed to George and led
 

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.129
that really appealed to George and led
him to think about then how did this

01:17:01.129 --> 01:17:01.139
him to think about then how did this
 

01:17:01.139 --> 01:17:04.189

lot of two questions the first question
 

01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:45.109
lot of two questions the first question
is to what extent do you think do you

the simulation this afternoon there was
 

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:28.220
the simulation this afternoon there was
a moment where I just suddenly unloaded

a moment where I just suddenly unloaded

study of previous asymmetric conflicts
 

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:36.290
study of previous asymmetric conflicts
might inform our understanding of how to

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:36.300
might inform our understanding of how to
 

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:41.209
might inform our understanding of how to
deal with nuclear terrorism and I think

01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219
deal with nuclear terrorism and I think
 

01:18:41.219 --> 01:18:46.609
deal with nuclear terrorism and I think
it's a great question and I think it

01:18:46.609 --> 01:18:46.619
it's a great question and I think it
 

01:18:46.619 --> 01:18:50.540
it's a great question and I think it
could and I'm not gonna do it I have

could and I'm not gonna do it I have
 

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:52.850
could and I'm not gonna do it I have
other things to do but I think somebody

01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860

the art of war so it's always been there
 

01:19:07.579 --> 01:19:10.009
the art of war so it's always been there
so I think there is much to be learned

01:19:10.009 --> 01:19:10.019
so I think there is much to be learned
 

01:19:10.019 --> 01:19:13.430
so I think there is much to be learned
from going back and thinking about this

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440
from going back and thinking about this
 

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.589
from going back and thinking about this
but thinking about it without getting

but thinking about it without getting
 

01:19:15.599 --> 01:19:17.330
but thinking about it without getting
bogged down in the detail and that's

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340
bogged down in the detail and that's
 

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.850
bogged down in the detail and that's
what is is what so often happens in

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860
what is is what so often happens in
 

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.129
what is is what so often happens in
academic courses is that they get bogged

academic courses is that they get bogged
down in detail and they don't look at

his view of asymmetrical warfare relate

those would be to the nuclear issue I

01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739
those would be to the nuclear issue I

those would be to the nuclear issue I
don't know but I think it would

certainly be worth somebody looking into

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:09.750
certainly be worth somebody looking into
 

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.810
certainly be worth somebody looking into
it and giving it some thought because I

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:11.820
it and giving it some thought because I

it and giving it some thought because I
do think that these patterns of strategy

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:14.630
do think that these patterns of strategy

do think that these patterns of strategy
do persist or do exist over large

do persist or do exist over large
 

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:20.000
do persist or do exist over large
periods of time and space and I think

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.010
periods of time and space and I think
 

01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.750
periods of time and space and I think
many of the problems that seem new to us

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760
many of the problems that seem new to us
 

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.640
many of the problems that seem new to us
really aren't if you allow for the

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:25.650
really aren't if you allow for the
 

01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:28.669
really aren't if you allow for the
change in technology so I would

01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679
change in technology so I would
 

01:20:28.679 --> 01:20:30.379
change in technology so I would
certainly endorse what you said I think

01:20:30.379 --> 01:20:30.389
certainly endorse what you said I think
 

01:20:30.389 --> 01:20:33.319
certainly endorse what you said I think
that's a very good way to go I think

01:20:33.319 --> 01:20:33.329
that's a very good way to go I think
 

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.790
that's a very good way to go I think
that could be a whole project for

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800
that could be a whole project for
 

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.790
that could be a whole project for
another of Matt's summer seminars for

sure okay also I read your book

01:20:42.319 --> 01:20:42.329
sure okay also I read your book

sure okay also I read your book
strategies of containment and

01:20:44.029 --> 01:20:44.039
strategies of containment and
 

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:48.229
strategies of containment and
I didn't quite find us maybe so I wanted

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239
I didn't quite find us maybe so I wanted
 

01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.520
I didn't quite find us maybe so I wanted
to ask this question that what do you

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:49.530
to ask this question that what do you
 

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:53.810
to ask this question that what do you
think or did it did the question of you

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820
think or did it did the question of you
 

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.379
think or did it did the question of you
know the number of nuclear testing that

01:20:57.379 --> 01:20:57.389
know the number of nuclear testing that
 

01:20:57.389 --> 01:20:59.270
know the number of nuclear testing that
took place around the world and kind of

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280
took place around the world and kind of
 

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.160
took place around the world and kind of
the proportion to other countries doing

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:01.170
the proportion to other countries doing
 

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:04.790
the proportion to other countries doing
it and with thee and then to that of the

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800
it and with thee and then to that of the
 

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.379
it and with thee and then to that of the
United States do the number of tests

01:21:06.379 --> 01:21:06.389
United States do the number of tests
 

01:21:06.389 --> 01:21:08.000
United States do the number of tests
with the United States like if that was

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.010
with the United States like if that was
 

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:11.569
with the United States like if that was
also kind of factored into the thinking

01:21:11.569 --> 01:21:11.579
also kind of factored into the thinking
 

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:14.230
also kind of factored into the thinking
of

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:14.240
 

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.750
well I don't really talk about that in

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760
well I don't really talk about that in
 

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.300
well I don't really talk about that in
strategies of containment I get a little

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:19.310
strategies of containment I get a little
 

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:22.840
strategies of containment I get a little
more into it in we now know the 1997

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:22.850
more into it in we now know the 1997
 

01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:25.570
more into it in we now know the 1997
book what certainly happened was that

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:25.580
book what certainly happened was that
 

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.690
book what certainly happened was that
nuclear testing was polluting the

01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:28.700
nuclear testing was polluting the
 

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.790
nuclear testing was polluting the
atmosphere and there was concern about a

01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800
atmosphere and there was concern about a
 

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.350
atmosphere and there was concern about a
nuclear winter and there was concern

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360
nuclear winter and there was concern
 

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.970
nuclear winter and there was concern
about ready is this is happening as

01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:33.980
about ready is this is happening as
 

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.180
about ready is this is happening as
early as the 1950s the whole issue of

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:37.190
early as the 1950s the whole issue of
 

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:40.810
early as the 1950s the whole issue of
strontium 90 in the mid 50's was leading

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:40.820
strontium 90 in the mid 50's was leading
 

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.100
strontium 90 in the mid 50's was leading
people to think about the medical

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:42.110
people to think about the medical
 

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:44.620
people to think about the medical
consequences of nuclear testing that's

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:44.630
consequences of nuclear testing that's
 

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:46.060
consequences of nuclear testing that's
why I went underground that's why the

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:46.070
why I went underground that's why the
 

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:49.420
why I went underground that's why the
Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Russians

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:49.430
Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Russians
 

01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:51.510
Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Russians
and the Americans could agree on that

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520
and the Americans could agree on that
 

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.380
and the Americans could agree on that
and so that's that's nuclear testing is

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:56.390
and so that's that's nuclear testing is
 

01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:58.600
and so that's that's nuclear testing is
one of the early factors that certainly

01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:58.610
one of the early factors that certainly
 

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:00.370
one of the early factors that certainly
led to the emergence of this common

01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:00.380
led to the emergence of this common
 

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:04.480
led to the emergence of this common

can the nuclear should be resolved
proliferation it should be resolved

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:15.350
proliferation it should be resolved
 

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:18.750

without pressing your story that's

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760
without pressing your story that's
 

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.540
without pressing your story that's
that's a good question I don't think

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:22.550
that's a good question I don't think
 

01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:24.990
that's a good question I don't think
we're going to resolve

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000
we're going to resolve
 

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.160
we're going to resolve
we can't resolve the nuclear

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:27.170
we can't resolve the nuclear

proliferation question with regard to
 

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.850
proliferation question with regard to
North Korea because the proliferation is

01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:30.860
North Korea because the proliferation is
 

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.020
North Korea because the proliferation is
already taking place they've got the

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:32.030
already taking place they've got the
 

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:36.460
already taking place they've got the
bomb so that's a fait accompli I don't

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:36.470
bomb so that's a fait accompli I don't
 

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.080
bomb so that's a fait accompli I don't
think they're gonna do much with it I

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.090
think they're gonna do much with it I
 

01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:40.000
think they're gonna do much with it I
don't think they have capability to do

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.010
don't think they have capability to do
 

01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:41.920
don't think they have capability to do
much with it I still think that they're

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:41.930
much with it I still think that they're
 

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:44.770
much with it I still think that they're
a sin the whole is the all the artillery

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:44.780
a sin the whole is the all the artillery
 

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.590
a sin the whole is the all the artillery
that's within range of Seoul that's

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600
that's within range of Seoul that's
 

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.480
that's within range of Seoul that's
really the insurance that they're buying

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:49.490
really the insurance that they're buying
 

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.850
really the insurance that they're buying
not that they're gonna you know take out

01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:51.860
not that they're gonna you know take out
 

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.680
not that they're gonna you know take out
Los Angeles or something like them I

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:53.690
Los Angeles or something like them I
 

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:56.560
Los Angeles or something like them I
think it was done for prestige reasons

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:56.570
think it was done for prestige reasons
 

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:59.650
think it was done for prestige reasons
it was done to attract attention Kim

01:23:59.650 --> 01:23:59.660
it was done to attract attention Kim
 

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.960
it was done to attract attention Kim

not like to be out of the news and so he

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:03.950
not like to be out of the news and so he
 

01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:06.700
not like to be out of the news and so he
always finds some way to get into the to

always finds some way to get into the to
get into the news I think it's pretty

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:09.470
get into the news I think it's pretty
 

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:13.840

simple as that I would say the Koreans

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:13.850
simple as that I would say the Koreans
 

01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:15.490
simple as that I would say the Koreans
have got to solve the issue of the

01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:15.500
have got to solve the issue of the
 

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.130
have got to solve the issue of the
future of the peninsula on their own I

01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:18.140
future of the peninsula on their own I
 

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.710

don't think we can solve that for them
 

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.690
don't think we can solve that for them
it's been there for a very long time I

01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:24.700
it's been there for a very long time I
 

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.360
it's been there for a very long time I
don't think it's permanent but I'm

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:28.370
don't think it's permanent but I'm
 

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:30.520
don't think it's permanent but I'm
surprised that it has lasted as long as

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:30.530
surprised that it has lasted as long as
 

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:33.720
surprised that it has lasted as long as
it has since the end of the Cold War

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:33.730
it has since the end of the Cold War
 

01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:36.100
it has since the end of the Cold War
there are some things that I think are

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.110
there are some things that I think are
 

01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.810
there are some things that I think are
permanent actually they're just always

01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:37.820
permanent actually they're just always
 

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:41.760
permanent actually they're just always

vital again you know that guy's going to

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:49.790
vital again you know that guy's going to
 

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:54.340
vital again you know that guy's going to
live 150 years but most of these issues

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:54.350
live 150 years but most of these issues
 

01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:58.240
live 150 years but most of these issues
sooner or later will be soft and on

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:58.250
sooner or later will be soft and on
 

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:01.000
sooner or later will be soft and on
Korea you know this is this is one where

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:01.010
Korea you know this is this is one where
 

01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:05.200
Korea you know this is this is one where
we just try to keep it from blowing up

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.210
we just try to keep it from blowing up
 

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:07.990
we just try to keep it from blowing up
but it's hard to say that time is

01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000
but it's hard to say that time is
 

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.360
but it's hard to say that time is
working in favor of the North Korean

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:10.370
working in favor of the North Korean
 

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:14.650
working in favor of the North Korean
regime I think I would say one of the

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:14.660
regime I think I would say one of the
 

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:19.420
regime I think I would say one of the
thing not to be blackmailed into

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:19.430
thing not to be blackmailed into
 

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:22.900
thing not to be blackmailed into
sustaining that regime and I think that

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:22.910
sustaining that regime and I think that
 

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:24.970
sustaining that regime and I think that
to some extent we have which is every

01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:24.980
to some extent we have which is every
 

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.410
to some extent we have which is every
time Kim tests a weapon or threatens to

01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:29.420
time Kim tests a weapon or threatens to
 

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.120
time Kim tests a weapon or threatens to
test a weapon or whatnot you know we

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:31.130
test a weapon or whatnot you know we
 

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:33.260
test a weapon or whatnot you know we
ship in more food

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:33.270
ship in more food
 

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:36.500
ship in more food
supplies and all of that I think there

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:36.510
supplies and all of that I think there
 

01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:37.700
supplies and all of that I think there
ought to be some hard questions about

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:37.710
ought to be some hard questions about
 

01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:40.310
ought to be some hard questions about
the extent to which we do that but that

01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320
the extent to which we do that but that
 

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.170
the extent to which we do that but that
that's the only real modification I

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:42.180
that's the only real modification I
 

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.990
that's the only real modification I
would make in that strategy yeah I

01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000
would make in that strategy yeah I
 

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.120
would make in that strategy yeah I
wanted to ask you a question about why

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:47.130
wanted to ask you a question about why
 

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.550
wanted to ask you a question about why
the administration's sing about Iran and

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560
the administration's sing about Iran and
 

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.500
the administration's sing about Iran and
North Korea and in the posture of you

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:51.510
North Korea and in the posture of you
 

01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:53.330
North Korea and in the posture of you
recently and what the what their

01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340
recently and what the what their
 

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.729
recently and what the what their
rationale is for doing that and second

01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739
rationale is for doing that and second
 

01:25:55.739 --> 01:26:00.110
rationale is for doing that and second
of all what the effects with that well I

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120
of all what the effects with that well I
 

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.430
of all what the effects with that well I
don't know the answer to the first one

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440
don't know the answer to the first one
 

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.110
don't know the answer to the first one
you would have to ask the administration

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120
you would have to ask the administration
 

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.690
you would have to ask the administration
you know as far as that goes I wondered

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:05.700
you know as far as that goes I wondered
 

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.700
you know as far as that goes I wondered
why the Bush administration singled out

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:07.710
why the Bush administration singled out
 

01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:10.850
why the Bush administration singled out

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860
the three states that it did as the axis

the three states that it did as the axis
of evil it seems to me there were a lot

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:12.870
of evil it seems to me there were a lot
 

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:14.750
of evil it seems to me there were a lot
of other plausible candidates around if

of other plausible candidates around if
 

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.709
of other plausible candidates around if
you wanted to talk about evils so you

01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719
you wanted to talk about evils so you
 

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:19.700
you wanted to talk about evils so you
know I don't know the answer to that

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:19.710
know I don't know the answer to that
 

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:24.140
know I don't know the answer to that
other than that you know there is the

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:24.150
other than that you know there is the
 

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:26.560
other than that you know there is the
obvious concern about these being

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:26.570

jong-il I'm not convinced that they are

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560
jong-il I'm not convinced that they are
 

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.290
jong-il I'm not convinced that they are
irrational I think they're actually

01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300
irrational I think they're actually
 

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.670
irrational I think they're actually
pretty shrewd much of the time and it's

01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:40.680
pretty shrewd much of the time and it's
 

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.120
pretty shrewd much of the time and it's
just that we can't control them and so

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:44.130
just that we can't control them and so
 

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:47.750
just that we can't control them and so
we consider them dangerous in the

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760
we consider them dangerous in the
 

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760
we consider them dangerous in the
Iranian situation I think is much more

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:49.770
Iranian situation I think is much more
 

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.580
Iranian situation I think is much more
dangerous than the North Korean

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:51.590
dangerous than the North Korean
 

01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:54.860
dangerous than the North Korean
situation of course so I think it's in a

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:54.870
situation of course so I think it's in a
 

01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:58.550
situation of course so I think it's in a
different category there but I think

01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560
different category there but I think
 

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.590
different category there but I think
some of the same mentality still may be

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600
some of the same mentality still may be

being the most important problems that
confront us I doubt I think we had I

confront us I doubt I think we had I

have a whole spectrum of problems that
 

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.280
have a whole spectrum of problems that
we are thinking about and I think

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:33.290
we are thinking about and I think
 

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.320
we are thinking about and I think
singling them out is playing into their

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:36.330
singling them out is playing into their
 

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:38.089
singling them out is playing into their
hands to a considerable

extent I think there's some other things

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:40.349
extent I think there's some other things
 

01:27:40.349 --> 01:27:43.819
extent I think there's some other things
that are at least as dangerous what's

01:27:43.819 --> 01:27:43.829
that are at least as dangerous what's
 

01:27:43.829 --> 01:27:49.060
that are at least as dangerous what's
happening in Mexico for example and

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:49.070
happening in Mexico for example and
 

01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:51.260
happening in Mexico for example and
whether you want to single these out and

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:51.270
whether you want to single these out and
 

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:54.169
whether you want to single these out and
talk about them or not is a good

01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179
talk about them or not is a good
 

01:27:54.179 --> 01:27:56.390
talk about them or not is a good
question but just to give the illusion

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400
question but just to give the illusion
 

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.459
question but just to give the illusion
that we just had two problem countries

that we just had two problem countries
or something like that no we have a lot

or something like that no we have a lot
