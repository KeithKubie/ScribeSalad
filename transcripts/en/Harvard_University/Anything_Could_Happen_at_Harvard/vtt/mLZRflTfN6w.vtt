00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.133
[ Emerance Narrating ] You can look
just about anywhere from my house...

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.700
and you would see strictly land,
and that’s about it.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:11.433
I live in Alberta, Canada.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.667
My great-great-grandparents
came over here over a century ago...

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.833
and started a farm, and my dad
still farms the same farm today.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.467
In Canada, there’s only two seasons.
One season is farming season.

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:28.533
The other is hockey season.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.767
I have a brother, Bronson.
My sister is Brittaney.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.700
I have a brother, Brock,
and a younger brother, Kache.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.533
We all play hockey.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
Since I was little, there was just one team.
I played with the guys.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.933
After that, I continued playing guys’ hockey.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.800
I wanted to challenge myself all the time...

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.067
and prove to everyone that I could be
just as good as the guys.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.567
When I was 13 years old,
the team that I was playing on...

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.300
went to Boston for a tournament.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:57.567
My mom and I went together,
and we toured Harvard.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.633
I fell in love with it right away.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.067
I told my mom,
“I’m gonna go here one day.”

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.733
My mom and dad taught us kids
to work really hard...

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.733
and always challenge ourselves.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.267
They told us to have a good work ethic,
and no matter what...

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.933
no matter how hard it was,
to stick with it and you’ll get through it...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.500
and eventually, you’ll have success.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.567
My name is Emerance Maschmeyer...

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:19.133
and I play goalie
for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team.
