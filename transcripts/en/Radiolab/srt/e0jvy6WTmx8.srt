1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,240
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert
Krulwich today on radio lab blame

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,210
in the story we just heard, Lee, we're
wrestling with a very difficult question.

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,880
When somebody has a brain
injury, then commits a crime.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,960
Just how much do we blame them and
how much do we blame the brain?

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,660
Yeah, and as it turns out, this
question, hi. Hi, this is Chad. Hi Chad.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,560
It's Nita.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,220
That question is popping up more and
more in court cases were increasingly,

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,250
you will find defendants
like Kevin Arguing, okay,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,900
you've convicted me of a crime,

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
but you should go easier on me because
I have these neurological problems.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,641
So this is neat.

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:38,390
A fairy honney professor of law and
philosophy and professor of genome

13
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:40,220
scientists and policy at Duke University.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,040
She's been following this whole sort of
emerging field of neuro law for quite a

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,840
while. And back in 2006
it occurred to her, okay,

16
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,810
lots of people are interested in this
field, but nobody has any good data.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,340
So I started counting cases, try to see,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,160
to try to see how many times does
brain science come up in court. Now,

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,180
the only data that she'd get her
hands on were written opinions,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,520
which turns out it
doesn't happen that often.

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,790
Like yours really only happens
in like 1% of court cases, but,

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,820
but in that 1% of cases she saw
a steady increase and you know,

23
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:16,220
relatively dramatic. You,
you have a couple of years,

24
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:21,221
2005 and six that had about a hundred
cases in (200) 078-9200 some cases.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,580
And then 1112 year in the three hundreds
all told between 2005 and 2012 it's

26
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:35,261
about 1600 cases at 1600 cases that
are kind of like the Kevin Case where

27
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:40,130
someone maybe argues, look, it's not
entirely my fault. My brain made me do it

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,610
at least a little bit.
Yeah. And by the way,

29
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,140
that number was just in
the 1% she had access to.

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,200
So the other 99% of cases may
actually have a whole lot more. Yup.

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, wait a second. Is this a new
development? What do you mean? Like,

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,870
you know, in west side story,

33
00:01:55,871 --> 00:02:00,010
there's this character officer crunchy
and he goes and there's these juvenile

34
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,581
delinquents.

35
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:04,120
This is back in the 50s and they're
saying everything is someone else's fault.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,980
So they have bad parents and they have
poverty and they have passion and they

37
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:11,700
have [inaudible]

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,280
youth and they plead all these kinds of
Sargent crop geek yet gotta understand

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,410
it's just our bringing up that gets us
Outta hand. Our mothers solid junkies,

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,430
our fathers all are.

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,140
Have you just added to the list tumor?
That's pretty much the same thing.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,020
Well maybe, no,

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,640
there seems to be something
more compelling for both
judges and juries when you

44
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,950
are able to have actual
brain scans, you know,

45
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:39,670
or EEG or whatever because now you can
say, look to officer Crunchy, look,

46
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,270
I know this might sound like an excuse,
but check out this spot right here.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,180
Here's the proof. I don't
have a normal brain, you know,

48
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,610
and I didn't choose not
to have a normal brain.

49
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,920
So how can it be
completely my fault? Well,

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,330
doesn't that sound a little bit like
a little too easy? Here we go. Maybe.

51
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,300
I mean, I guess it depends on the
specific case, but just in the abstract.

52
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,900
Let me give you the version that
I've ever heard of this argument.

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,920
This is what made me really stop
and take. It comes from the, uh,

54
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,390
from my psychologist Kevin Dutton.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,510
He was interviewed on the scientific
American podcasts and he gave this

56
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,310
hypothetical.

57
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,640
I imagine if you've got
a deaf person, okay,

58
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,670
and you've got a child in a
burning building and you've
got that child screaming

59
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:22,160
out, but the deaf person
can't hear the screams to,

60
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,870
you wouldn't necessarily blame.

61
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:28,340
You wouldn't hold that deaf
person culpable for that
child's death if the child

62
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,340
died you nuclear. So
far. By the same token,

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,080
if you are emotionally death, if
you can physically hear the screams,

64
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:41,081
but emotionally you just don't have that
kind of neural kick up the backside to

65
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,270
go in and save that child.
Isn't that the same thing?

66
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,410
And when you start thinking about that
as a whole kind of moral conundrum that

67
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,400
starts coming out of that,

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,820
because damage to the ear is
damaged with physical structure,

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,310
damage to the brain is also damaged

70
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,970
physical structure. So here's the moral
conundrum I think he's referring to.

71
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,590
If we go along with this idea that we
can use brain abnormalities to defend

72
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:05,430
ourselves in court.

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,630
Well that's going to lead us into
some pretty weird places as a society,

74
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,870
things may get very, very
complicated cause we learned,

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,910
we got into a little tussle.
All right with this guy,

76
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,180
sorry, so you put this on. This
is a little chilly in here.

77
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,900
This is David Eagleman.
I'm a neuroscientist. He's
a regular on our show.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,870
Is that what I supposed to say or
that spirited regularly? Yeah. No.

79
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:30,900
Here's one of the most interesting parts.
Here's his argument. Think about it.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,550
Technologically at the moment,

81
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,760
our best technologies in
neuroscience are very crude.

82
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,790
We can see when someone has a tumor or
damage from traumatic brain injury or

83
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,850
neurodegenerative disease, but it is
quite crude still. The way he puts it.

84
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,851
Looking for those brain abnormalities
now is sort of like being up in space and

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,240
looking down at the earth. You can't
really see what's going on down there,

86
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:58,350
but you can see the big shapes and the
colors and every so often you notice

87
00:04:58,351 --> 00:04:59,920
something that's not supposed
to be there. Like, Whoa,

88
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,560
what does that creator over there?

89
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,670
If you see something that's big
enough to see you take a picture,

90
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,281
you're back in court,

91
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,770
you show it to the judge and
maybe she gives the guy a break,

92
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,220
but then say you're up there and

93
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,280
um, mission control, everything
looks normal up here.

94
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,750
You don't see anything.
Well then back in court,

95
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,320
the judge is going to take a look at
your apparently normal brain and say,

96
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,500
sorry, well that's your fault.
It's not a biological problem.

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,640
So we're just going to say you're
blameworthy. So that's where we are now.

98
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,450
We draw the line of what we can see and
what we can see is only the big stuff.

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,860
But he says, imagine forward,
we'll have new technologies,

100
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,490
we'll have x MRI instead fri and suddenly
it's going to be like Google maps

101
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,530
where instead of being
up in space, you can,

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,520
you can zoom in and now
you can see everything.

103
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,990
We'll have new names for disorders
of the microcircuitry and so on.

104
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,060
We'll certainly never get
all the way to the end,

105
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,690
but one day we may be able to say like
see that little bit of mangled wiring

106
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,460
right over there. That is because
his mom didn't love him enough.

107
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,200
Maybe he got bullied like we will be
able to see all that stuff almost as well

108
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,370
as we can see brain tumors now cause there
is nothing special about brain tumors

109
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,640
except for their visibility. Really what
he's saying when you get down to it,

110
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,641
his core belief is that you
are your biology which is
on some level kind of like

111
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,200
whatever, Duh, but he
takes it much farther.

112
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,050
He says that almost everything
that you go through in your life,

113
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,750
all of your experiences, your culture,
your history, your neighborhood,

114
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,900
all of it is etched into the
tissue of your brain, right?

115
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,130
There's nothing separate. Nothing.

116
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,790
Descartes famously suggested you've got
the body, you know the physical stuff,

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,640
and then you've got this extra bit,
the sole, the ghost in the machine.

118
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:36,920
[inaudible]

119
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,630
but sort of the, you know the inside
word on that neuroscience is that ag? No,

120
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,100
no, no. It's all the same thing.

121
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,240
And now that we're beginning to
see that, he says, actually see it,

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,930
we are on a slippery slope because if you
start letting people off the hook when

123
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:52,764
you see a tumor,

124
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,020
well then you're going to have
to keep letting him off the hook.

125
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:58,890
When you see something smaller
or smaller or smaller, still

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,160
the point is it cannot be a just
legal system that in one decade says,

127
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,760
well you're blame worthy cause for the
moment we can't see anything in your

128
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,630
brain. And then the next decades is,
oh, you have SJ medleys disease. Hey,

129
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,550
we can see it now. And
we didn't realize that.

130
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,460
So now you were lumping you over here
with the people with the brain tumors.

131
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,700
So they want, does that mean like we
have to let everybody off the hook?

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,650
You know, blame worthiness is the wrong
question for a legal system to ask.

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,860
That's the point is that this whole
notion about blame worthiness and saying,

134
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:29,101
okay,

135
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:33,180
if we have a biological mitigator then
we'll bring that up in court and we'll

136
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:33,541
say, well,

137
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,570
it's not exactly his fault and if we
don't have a biological mitigator,

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,740
we'll say it is his fault.

139
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,810
The reason none of this makes sense
nowadays is because saying was it the

140
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:47,580
person's fault or was it something about
his biology doesn't make sense as a

141
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:52,350
question. They are inseparable. Why I
got, I have a version of that question.

142
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:56,700
How about everybody should know that his
brain isn't completely normal in this

143
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,830
regard. And now the
question is proportion,

144
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,010
how much do you want to put on the brain
and how much do you want to put on his

145
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,030
and what else is there behavior which
comes from where ability to choose from

146
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,450
the brain is choosy part of his brain
as the most [inaudible] and choosy part.

147
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,640
Well that's okay. I don't, I
mean you're forcing me. I'm glad.

148
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,570
I'm glad you're phrasing
it this way because that's
exactly the problem with our

149
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,750
intuitions. We have this intuition that
yeah, your brain might look like this.

150
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,501
You have these genes,

151
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,230
you have these experiences that
makes your biology like this. Oh,

152
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:25,891
but in the end,

153
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:30,630
that doesn't matter because you've got
this other thing that's independent of

154
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:35,370
the biology, but we don't. You
aren't your brain, your brain,

155
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:39,210
however nevertheless helps you decide
things. Brains help you choose.

156
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,520
So the question I'm asking
you that they're helping,

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,260
who's the you that you're
helping the bearer of the brain,

158
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:47,490
the owner of the brain, the the, the
brain. And that's separate from the brain.

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,740
Oh, do you own, I need
to keep doing this to me.

160
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,710
I know that if I have a tootsie
roll in front of me in an m and, m,

161
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:54,270
I can choose the M and m.

162
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,990
So I assume my is doing something and
the question I want to ask is like how

163
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,500
much am I choosing and how much
am I really outside of choosing?

164
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,590
Because some something irregular
in my brain is choosing for me.

165
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,350
And that seems to me to
be a way to, so, so this,

166
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:10,230
but this is fascinating because the
way you're phrasing it suggests that

167
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,790
there's, um,

168
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,810
there's you and then there's your brain
and there's things in your brain that

169
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,360
might be telling you what
you don't want to do,

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,460
but it's all one system is the thing.

171
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,050
So when you're faced with the tootsie
roll versus the whatever else, m and m,

172
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,400
every thing in your life leading up to
that moment from your genetic history

173
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,980
written on invisibly small
strands of nucleic acids,

174
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:35,160
all the way up to every experience
you've ever had leads to that choice.

175
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,840
What would it even mean to make a choice?
Completely independent of your brain.

176
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,010
Okay. [inaudible]

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,060
what about like the 10 Commandments? Those
are like the, those were, those were,

178
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,660
okay. I'm just gonna jump in
for a second. At this point,

179
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,490
things kind of slid off the rails.

180
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,200
We ended up talking about
the 10 commandments,

181
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,050
debating the question of freewill
if free will exists at all.

182
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,210
It's a really small part of this system.

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,330
I'm going back and forth about whether
you can overcome your upbringing,

184
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:06,570
which obviously you can. Oh Gosh, no, you
can't share. You can't. No, you can't.

185
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,750
I can go to the library and I, it's only
if you're that type of person. Anyhow,

186
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,980
after an hour, we finally got
back around to David's main point,

187
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:18,900
which is that the legal system would be
a hell of a lot better off. He says, if,

188
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
uh, if we forgot about blame altogether,
forget if it's someone's fault.

189
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,710
That's a dead end. He would
say the better way to do it,

190
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:30,711
he thinks is to focus on this
probability of future recidivism.

191
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,700
You mean like will they do it again?
That's right. That's exactly it. Well,

192
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:40,090
how would you ever know? So
here's how you crunch the numbers.

193
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,150
So this has already happened in the world
of sex offenders where there've been a

194
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,210
longterm studies following out. Here's
the way it already works. He says,

195
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,390
which he thinks is model. When a
sex offender comes up for parole,

196
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,050
someone at the corrections office will
grab their record and ask a bunch of

197
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:57,610
questions. What was the victim choice?

198
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,250
Was it somebody they knew or was it
somebody outside of their family?

199
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:04,720
Was it a a minor, specific to male
or female? Was it somebody their age?

200
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,030
What was the crime type? All
these different questions.

201
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,420
Then the evaluator will take some
of the answers and give them points.

202
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,470
Three zero two that psychologist
Amy Phoenix, she says,

203
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:17,860
researchers developed this point system
based on years of studies of criminal

204
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:21,640
behavior, massive amounts of data and
once you have all these points down,

205
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,840
you can add up a total score and that
score is supposed to tell you is this guy

206
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:29,950
likely to do it again or not? And
here's the bottom line. Amy says,

207
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,600
if you were to ask a parole officer with
decades of experience to just use their

208
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,750
gut, no numbers, we call that
unguided clinical judgment.

209
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,050
If you were to ask them for their
unguided, but expert clinical judgment,

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,920
will Fred here recidivate or not? What's
your prediction? According to studies,

211
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:48,250
those experts are correct
about 50% of the time,

212
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,850
so you may as well flip a
coin. On the other hand,

213
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:55,570
she says if you have just use the
point system, no gut involved,

214
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,390
the predictive accuracy would be about 70%

215
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,110
wow. 70 years and no humans involved.

216
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,250
Yeah. But here's the thing
that sort of gives me pause.

217
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,680
Like in order to get that accurate,

218
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,570
you kind of have to turn people into
data, you know? Yeah. Into types.

219
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,080
I know it seems like, Oh, where's
the humanity in that? But,

220
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,560
but the question we have to
ask is, compared to what?

221
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,360
So the way it currently goes,

222
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,500
ugly people get much longer sentences
than attractive people in courts.

223
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,300
This is a well known bias from juries.

224
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Is that somehow better than having a
scientifically informed legal system?

225
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,550
I have no response to that. Well,

226
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,580
but elaborate Willie [inaudible]

227
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
yes.

228
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,770
It's okay that pretty people get better
sentences than ugly people because I'm,

229
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,830
I don't know, I'm going out on the limb,

230
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,520
see what happens when I
finished this in one go.

231
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,920
But because what we're describing
here is humans judging humans,

232
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:08,320
not tables judging humans, not data
judging humans, but humans judging humans.

233
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:13,321
So you went to do that with certain amount
of humanness and maybe it's not very

234
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:18,310
rational and maybe sometimes
it's wrong-headed or unfair,

235
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,230
but if you take the judgment away from
the humans and you give it to a table,

236
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,730
then you invite a different set of
problems, which is the chance for mercy,

237
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,120
which is a very big part of justice is
off the table because statistics don't

238
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,860
have mercy. They just have statistics.

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,410
Amen. I that was nicely done,

240
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,660
but let me say, let me see,
Campbell, the question that,

241
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,460
that is a beautiful question. So the
notion of we should be merciful and so on.

242
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,890
Of course, that's all true. But
the question is, are we good at it?

243
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:55,130
Are we good at knowing who is the
right person to be merciful with?

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,650
It ends up usually being the
attractive person, right?

245
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:59,360
And the person who's ugly
in his missing teeth,

246
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,880
we're usually not as merciful
for, I wish this morning.

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Let me just throw in one
more objection to this. Uh,

248
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,990
I mean obviously as a point, I guess.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,630
So this whole thing that he's advocating
for and he's not the only one of

250
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,220
throwing out blame, focusing
instead on what someone might do.

251
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,170
Is that a world you would want to
really live in, need a fair honey,

252
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:22,550
that law professor, put it this
way, imagine you do something small.

253
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,460
So if I, you know, forge a check,

254
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,350
minor offense and in the process
of arresting me and convicting me,

255
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,540
maybe the courts do a brain scan or
they do that number crunching thing.

256
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,090
Exactly. And they determine,

257
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:40,091
actually she has a predilection for far
more serious crimes than check forging.

258
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:43,070
I mean, she hasn't done any of those
things yet, but she could rob a bank,

259
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,160
she could commit a violent crime.
That's what the data shows.

260
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,320
If all you're worried
about is what she might do,

261
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,780
then you can keep me in
prison forever. Because, um,

262
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,990
what you've discovered is that I pose
a real and future danger to society.

263
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,930
I mean, you could basically
convict someone of a crime
that hasn't happened yet.

264
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,650
Exactly. And not only that,

265
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,380
if you think about this whole thing
from a slightly higher altitude,

266
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,140
according to Anita, when you
blame somebody for something,

267
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:12,190
there's a power to that act that
goes beyond that one individual.

268
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,220
There is value to society holding people
morally accountable for wrongdoing.

269
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,180
Your you're upholding this code
that is important to all of us.

270
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,020
It's what we've lived by and clung
to for thousands of years. Yeah,

271
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,880
so you could argue that the
act of assigning blame is
sort of like reinforcing

272
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:34,990
the scaffolding of society. It
creates norms for people to follow.

273
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,080
That makes perfect sense to
me. Otherwise we would be,

274
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,480
well, it'd be like, I
don't know what we'd be

275
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,550
[inaudible]

276
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,880
so hey, so you're coming out for the
10 commandments at the end of the day.

277
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,190
Wait, hold on. No shot.

278
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,180
Let's just say he went there
and he can't take it back.

279
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,710
Don't draft me onto that team. By the way,

280
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,350
speaking about us. Not
that we were, but now I am.

281
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,270
We are going to be on stage in 21
cities in the United States and Canada.

282
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,380
We're just about to start our live
tour. The show is called apocalyptical,

283
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,410
which is a lot of syllables,
but it's a, it can be fun.

284
