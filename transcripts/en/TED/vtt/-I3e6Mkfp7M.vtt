00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:17.012
In 2009, I bought a house
in Detroit for 500 dollars.

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:21.652
It had no windows,
no plumbing, no electricity

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:23.117
and it was filled with trash.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:28.297
The first floor held nearly
10,000 pounds of garbage,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.164
and that included the better part
of a Dodge Caravan,

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:33.466
cut into chunks with a reciprocating saw.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.685
(Laughter)

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.879
I lived nearly two years without heat,

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:40.387
woke up out of a dead sleep
multiple times to gunshots,

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.447
was attacked by a pack of wild dogs

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:48.147
and ripped my kitchen cabinets
from an abandoned school

00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.095
as they were actively tearing
that school down.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.683
This, of course, is the Detroit
that your hear about.

00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:57.316
Make no mistake, it's real.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.737
But there's another Detroit, too.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.829
Another Detroit that's more hopeful,

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.144
more innovative,

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:06.319
and may just provide some of the answers

00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:09.292
to cities struggling to reinvent
themselves everywhere.

00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:14.877
These answers, however, do not
necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.304
about good development.

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:21.708
I think Detroit's real strength
boils down to two words:

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:23.850
radical neighborliness.

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:27.287
And I wasn't able to see it myself
until I lived there.

00:01:28.684 --> 00:01:29.835
About a decade ago,

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.382
I moved to Detroit with no friends,
no job and no money,

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:36.597
at a time when it seemed
like everyone else was moving out.

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:39.352
Between 2000 and 2010,

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:42.087
25 percent of the city's population left.

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:45.128
This included about half
of the elementary-aged children.

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:48.342
This was after six decades of decline.

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:53.105
A city built for almost two million
was down to less than 800,000.

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:57.704
What you usually don't hear
is that people didn't go very far.

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:02.125
The population of the Detroit
metro area itself

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.574
has largely remained steady
since the '70s.

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:07.993
Most people who left Detroit
just went to the suburbs,

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:11.648
while the 139 square miles
of the city deteriorated,

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:17.954
leaving some estimates as high
as 40 square miles of abandoned land --

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:19.875
about the size of San Francisco.

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:25.938
Aside from platitudes such as the vague
and agentless "deindustrialization,"

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:28.859
Detroit's exodus can be summed up
with two structures:

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:30.730
freeways and walls.

00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:32.814
The freeways,

00:02:32.838 --> 00:02:35.395
coupled with massive
governmental subsidies

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.037
for the suburbs via
infrastructure and home loans,

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.653
allowed people to leave the city at will,

00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:45.392
taking with it tax base,
jobs and education dollars.

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:49.143
The walls made sure
only certain people could leave.

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.261
In multiple places,

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:54.984
brick and concrete walls
separate city and suburbs,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.515
white and black,

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.936
running directly across municipal streets

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.594
and through neighborhoods.

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:04.635
They're mere physical manifestations
of racist housing practices

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.818
such as redlining,

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.619
[Denying services to people of color]

00:03:07.643 --> 00:03:08.793
restrictive covenants

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:11.318
and outright terror.

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:15.868
In 1971, the Ku Klux Klan
bombed 10 school buses

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.741
rather than have them transport
integrated students.

00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:23.828
All these have made Detroit
the most racially segregated metro area

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:25.229
in the United States.

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:28.677
I grew up in a small town in Michigan,

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:30.812
the son of a relatively
blue-collar family.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.817
And after university,
I wanted to do something --

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:34.992
probably naÃ¯vely --

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:36.166
to help.

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:40.031
I didn't want to be one of the almost
50 percent of college graduates

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:41.986
leaving the state at the time,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.429
and I thought I might use
my fancy college education at home

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.860
for something positive.

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.576
I'd been reading this great
American philosopher named Grace Lee Boggs

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.355
who happened to live in Detroit,

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.110
and she said something I can't forget.

00:03:56.847 --> 00:04:00.728
"The most radical thing
that I ever did was to stay put."

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:06.260
I thought buying a house might
indelibly tie me to the city

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:09.418
while acting as a physical protest
to these walls and freeways.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.656
Because grants and loans
weren't available to everyone,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.990
I decided I was going
to do this without them

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:16.897
and that I would wage my personal fight

00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:20.338
against the city that had loomed
over my childhood with power tools.

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:24.849
I eventually found an abandoned house
in a neighborhood called Poletown.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.834
It looked like the apocalypse
had descended.

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:30.268
The neighborhood was prairie land.

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:33.053
A huge, open expanse of waist-high grass

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:36.848
cluttered only by a handful
of crippled, abandoned structures

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:39.022
and a few brave holdouts
with well-kept homes.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.087
Just a 15-minute bike ride
from the baseball stadium downtown,

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.647
the neighborhood was positively rural.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:52.484
What houses were left looked like
cardboard boxes left in the rain;

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.501
two-story monstrosities
with wide-open shells

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.898
and melted porches.

00:04:57.348 --> 00:05:00.915
One of the most striking things
I remember were the rosebushes,

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.166
forgotten and running wild
over tumbled-down fences,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.119
no longer cared for by anyone.

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:10.499
This was my house on the day
I boarded it up

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:12.887
to protect it from the elements
and further decay.

00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:16.617
I eventually purchased it
from the county in a live auction.

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:18.452
I'd assumed the neighborhood was dead.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.201
That I was some kind of pioneer.

00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:24.110
Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:26.050
I was in no way a pioneer,

00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:28.541
and would come to understand
how offensive that is.

00:05:29.844 --> 00:05:33.582
One of the first things I learned
was to add my voice to the chorus,

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.581
not overwrite what was already happening.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.699
(Voice breaking) Because
the neighborhood hadn't died.

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:41.503
It had just transformed in a way
that was difficult to see

00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:42.845
if you didn't live there.

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:45.820
Poletown was home
to an incredibly resourceful,

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:49.539
incredibly intelligent
and incredibly resilient community.

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:55.200
It was there I first experienced
the power of radical neighborliness.

00:05:55.985 --> 00:05:58.509
During the year I worked
on my house before moving in,

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:01.001
I lived in a microcommunity
inside Poletown,

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:04.741
founded by a wild and virtuous farmer
named Paul Weertz.

00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:08.032
Paul was a teacher
in a Detroit public school

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:09.835
for pregnant and parenting mothers,

00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:12.928
and his idea was to teach
the young women to raise their children

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:14.675
by first raising plants and animals.

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:20.051
While the national average graduation rate
for pregnant teens is about 40 percent,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:23.260
at Catherine Ferguson Academy
it was often above 90,

00:06:23.284 --> 00:06:25.081
in part due to Paul's ingenuity.

00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:28.710
Paul brought much of this innovation
to his block in Poletown,

00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:31.292
which he'd stewarded
for more than 30 years,

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.804
purchasing houses
when they were abandoned,

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:36.925
convincing his friends to move in
and neighbors to stay

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.202
and helping those who wanted
to buy their own and fix them up.

00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:44.783
In a neighborhood where many blocks
now only hold one or two houses,

00:06:44.807 --> 00:06:47.035
all the homes on Paul's block stand.

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.631
It's an incredible testament
to the power of community,

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:50.974
to staying in one place

00:06:50.998 --> 00:06:53.686
and to taking ownership
of one's own surroundings --

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.627
of simply doing it yourself.

00:06:56.244 --> 00:07:00.185
It's the kind of place where black doctors
live next to white hipsters

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.020
next to immigrant mothers from Hungary

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:04.837
or talented writers
from the jungles of Belize,

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:07.096
showing me Detroit
wasn't just black and white,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.842
and diversity could flourish
when it's encouraged.

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:14.762
Each year, neighbors assemble to bale hay
for the farm animals on the block,

00:07:14.786 --> 00:07:17.992
teaching me just how much
a small group of people can get done

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:19.707
when they work together,

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.133
and the magnetism of fantastical
yet practical ideas.

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:29.322
Radical neighborliness is every house
behind Paul's block burning down,

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:32.578
and instead of letting it fill up
with trash and despair,

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.929
Paul and the surrounding community
creating a giant circular garden

00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:39.607
ringed with dozens of fruit trees,
beehives and garden plots

00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:41.433
for anyone that wants one,

00:07:41.457 --> 00:07:44.536
helping me see that our challenges
can often be assets.

00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:49.370
It's where residents are experimenting
with renewable energy and urban farming

00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:52.267
and offering their skills
and discoveries to others,

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:55.149
illustrating we don't necessarily
have to beg the government

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:56.426
to provide solutions.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.806
We can start ourselves.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:07:59.562
It's where, for months,

00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:01.999
one of my neighbors
left her front door unlocked

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.791
in one of the most violent
and dangerous cities in America

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:07.817
so I could have a shower
whenever I needed to go to work,

00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:09.305
as I didn't yet have one.

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.131
It was when it came time to raise
the beam on my own house

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:14.750
that holds the structure aloft --

00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:18.177
a beam that I cut out of an abandoned
recycling factory down the street

00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.459
when not a single wall
was left standing --

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:23.788
a dozen residents of Poletown
showed up to help lift it, Amish style.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.143
Radical neighborliness is a zygote
that grows into a worldview

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:33.396
that ends up in homes and communities
rebuilt in ways that respect humanity

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.772
and the environment.

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:38.143
It's realizing we have the power
to create the world anew together

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.877
and to do it ourselves
when our governments refuse.

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:44.405
This is the Detroit that you
don't hear much about.

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:48.565
The Detroit between
the ruin porn on one hand

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:50.332
and the hipster coffee shops

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.946
and billionaires
saving the city on the other.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.175
There's a third way to rebuild,

00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:58.022
and it declines to make
the same mistakes of the past.

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:00.436
While building my house,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.893
I found something
I didn't know I was looking for --

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.122
what a lot of millennials

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:06.857
and people who are moving
back to cities are looking for.

00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:10.979
Radical neighborliness is just
another word for true community,

00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:13.140
the kind bound by memory and history,

00:09:13.164 --> 00:09:17.512
mutual trust and familiarity
built over years and irreplaceable.

00:09:18.028 --> 00:09:20.254
And now, as you may have heard,

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:22.454
Detroit is having a renaissance

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:25.263
and pulling itself up
from the ashes of despair,

00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:28.905
and the children and grandchildren
of those who fled are returning,

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:30.079
which is true.

00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:34.738
What isn't true is that this renaissance
is reaching most Detroiters,

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:36.782
or even more than a small fraction of them

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:39.193
that don't live in the central
areas of the city.

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:43.155
These are the kind of people
that have been in Detroit for generations

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:44.468
and are mostly black.

00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:46.363
In 2016 alone,

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:47.537
just last year,

00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:51.380
(Voice breaking) one in six
houses in Detroit

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:52.714
had their water shut off.

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:56.207
Excuse me.

00:09:58.622 --> 00:10:02.094
The United Nations has called this
a violation of human rights.

00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:06.542
And since 2005, one in three houses --

00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:08.002
think about this, please --

00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:13.389
one in every three houses
has been foreclosed in the city,

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:16.969
representing a population
about the size of Buffalo, New York.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:18.799
(Sniffles)

00:10:19.513 --> 00:10:24.423
One in three houses foreclosed is not
a crisis of personal responsibility;

00:10:24.447 --> 00:10:25.597
it is systemic.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.340
Many Detroiters, myself included,

00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:33.053
are worried segregation
is now returning to the city itself

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:35.049
on the coattails of this renaissance.

00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:39.340
Ten years ago,

00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:41.651
it was not possible
to go anywhere in Detroit

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:45.281
and be in a crowd
completely made of white people.

00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:48.204
Now, troublingly, that is possible.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:54.766
This is the price that we're paying
for conventional economic resurgence.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.501
We're creating two Detroits,
two classes of citizens,

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.286
cracking the community apart.

00:11:00.725 --> 00:11:02.373
For all the money and subsidies,

00:11:02.397 --> 00:11:04.064
for all the streetlights installed,

00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:06.933
the dollars for new stadiums
and slick advertisements

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.365
and positive buzz,

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:12.852
we're shutting off water
to tens of thousands of people

00:11:12.876 --> 00:11:14.624
living right on the Great Lakes,

00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:16.578
the world's largest source of it.

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.840
Separate has always meant unequal.

00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:23.046
This is a grave mistake for all of us.

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:26.841
When economic development
comes at the cost of community,

00:11:26.865 --> 00:11:29.052
it's not just those
who have lost their homes

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:31.013
or access to water who are harmed,

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:34.709
but it breaks little pieces
of our own humanity as well.

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:40.192
None of us can truly be free,

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.352
none of us can truly be comfortable,

00:11:42.376 --> 00:11:44.108
until our neighbors are, too.

00:11:44.888 --> 00:11:46.714
For those of us coming in,

00:11:46.738 --> 00:11:49.733
it means we must make sure
we aren't inadvertently contributing

00:11:49.757 --> 00:11:51.966
to the destruction of community again,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.141
and to follow the lead

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:56.156
of those who have been working
on these problems for years.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.182
In Detroit, that means average citizens
deputizing themselves

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:03.883
to create water stations and deliveries
for those who have lost access to it.

00:12:04.366 --> 00:12:07.125
Or clergy and teachers
engaging in civil disobedience

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:08.896
to block water shutoff trucks.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.286
It's organizations buying back
foreclosed homes for their inhabitants

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.652
or fighting misinformation
on forced sales through social media

00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:18.504
and volunteer-run hotlines.

00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:21.865
For me, it means helping others
to raise the beams

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:24.107
on their own formerly abandoned houses,

00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.318
or helping to educate
those with privilege,

00:12:26.342 --> 00:12:28.326
now increasingly moving into cities,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.479
how we might come in and support

00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:32.778
rather than stress existing communities.

00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:35.672
It's chipping in when
a small group of neighbors decides

00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:37.493
to buy back a foreclosed home

00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:39.671
and return the deeds to the occupants.

00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:42.957
And for you, for all of us,

00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:46.091
it means finding a role to play
in our own communities.

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:51.308
It means living your life as a reflection
of the world that you want to live in.

00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:54.749
It means trusting those
who know the problems best --

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.301
the people who live them --

00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:57.482
with solutions.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:02.423
I know a third way is possible
because I have lived it.

00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:07.198
I live it right now

00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:08.794
in a neighborhood called Poletown

00:13:08.818 --> 00:13:11.186
in one of the most
maligned cities in the world.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.179
If we can do it in Detroit,

00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:15.111
you can do it wherever you're from, too.

00:13:16.094 --> 00:13:18.006
What I've learned over the last decade,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.933
building my house,

00:13:19.957 --> 00:13:22.944
wasn't so much about wiring
or plumbing or carpentry --

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.622
although I did learn these things --

00:13:25.646 --> 00:13:28.641
is that true change, real change,

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:30.472
starts first with community,

00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:33.705
with a radical sense
of what it means to be a neighbor.

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.633
It turned at least one
abandoned house into a home.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.385
Thank you.

00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:42.753
(Applause)
