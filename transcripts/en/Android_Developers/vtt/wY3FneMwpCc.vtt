MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
My name's Moonlit.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.710
I'm a partner developer
manager at Google Play.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.850
I specialize in games.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.710
I've been with Google
for three years.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.430
Before Google, I was a
revenue PM at a mobile gaming

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.770
company called Scopely.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.840
At the time, and also
for the three years

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.580
I've been working
with Google, one

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.610
of the most common
questions is, how do we

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.730
monetize in the world
of games as a service?

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.160
But before I jump in, I want
to understand you guys better.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.670
Show of hands, how many of
you have premium games only?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.420
Oh, surprising.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.590
How many of you have IP
games and not purchase games?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.710
Great.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.570
Awesome.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.617
So here's the deal.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.950
I'm not going to say that
everything I'll tell you today

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.390
is new.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.620
But my takeaway, my hope for
you to take away from my talk,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.650
is to think about
revenue diversification.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.020
Think about different
ways to monetize.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.970
Think about different ways to
design your game to monetize.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.690
So I'll talk about three
different things in the next 30

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.920
minutes.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
First is about LTV--

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.440
what it is and why
it's important.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.550
Second, I'll share a list of
common in-game monetization

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.700
designs for game as a
service, free-to-play games

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.680
with in-app purchases.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.450
And last, I'll
end with some tips

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.490
about earning in
the global market,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.070
because as you launch your
game with Google Play,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.275
it is by default
a global business.

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:38.760
All right, first, LTV.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.840
LTV, or Life Time Value.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.830
Remember the last time you
walked into a video game store.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.990
Can somebody tell
me what is the LTV

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.000
of a customer in the traditional
world of console PC gaming?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.440
AUDIENCE: Is that with one game?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.180
MOONLIT: One game,
just one game.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.190
What's the LTV of one game?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.720
Any guesses?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.283
What's the lifetime value of
a customer if you buy a game?

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.050
AUDIENCE: The price.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.650
MOONLIT: It's just
a price of the game.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.560
In this old world, simple.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.360
You make a game.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.520
You sell it.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.670
Transaction is done.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.740
You make some money,
and you move on.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.340
But in the world of
games as a service,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.960
it's a little bit more complex.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.350
Your game now, your
revenue now is the sum

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.390
of many micro transactions.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.760
Therefore, your
players' lifetime value

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.940
is now heavily affected by two
things, lifetime value, time

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.410
and value.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.180
What is time?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.140
Time is engagement.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.020
So we're going to look
into both of these very

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.420
important elements of LTV.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.820
I'm not going to dive
into how to calculate it.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.770
It's a whole different science.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.270
But what we're going to talk
about is very high level.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.010
How do you increase LTV by
increasing and understanding

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.370
engagement and the value?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.510
For engagement, the question
is, how do we track engagement?

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.590
What does it mean?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.230
At Google Play, we look
at two buckets of things.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.515
The first one is hard retention.

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:21.800
What are the percentage of
users who come back to your game

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.480
the next day, a month
later, a week later?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.610
And I'll share with you what
are some benchmarks by category.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.780
The second one is
engagement profile.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.590
First is frequency-- session
frequency and session time,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.310
which measures how much time
a player spends in your game

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.270
and how often they play.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.395
The second one we call
the stickiness factor.

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:47.660
It's a pretty common
standardized industry term,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.350
which is DAU divided
by MAU, or how likely

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.580
you are to convert a very
infrequent player into a more

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.390
committed one.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.360
So of the three,
retention is king.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.560
More so, long-term retention
is what we really care about.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.980
So on the right-hand side, you
can see by broad stroke the day

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.240
30 retention number of core,
mid-core, very, very broad

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.519
stroke, high level
different genres.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.310
Most of the games we see fall
in the grassy green area.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.640
You want to aspire to be in
the forest green, on top.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.450
Let's imagine that we care
about long-term retention,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.210
because the more
time a player spend

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.150
in your game, that's more
opportunities for you

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.730
to monetize.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.870
And the more time
they spend in the game

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.670
also signals that
they are committed

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.220
to you and to your game.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.370
So these fans are also
more likely to pay higher,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.150
to pay more.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.740
On the graph on the
right-hand side,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.280
we plotted the top grossing
games on Google Play.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.300
This is retention over time
grouped by top 10 grossing,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.970
top 100, top 1,000.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.490
As you can see, good retention
is strictly correlated

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.530
with revenue potential as well.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.880
So my recommendation for
you is to really think

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.380
about how to design your game to
create a long-term experience.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.950
Think about when people
churn, why do they churn?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.810
How do you prevent churn?

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.170
And remember more
engagement, more time spent,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.310
means more LTV.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.855
Now, let's talk about the
second element of LTV, the value

00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:41.355
element.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.530
We look at churn for
a lot of the players,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.720
and found that the churn between
a person who never spends

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.660
and the person who spends
the very first dollar

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.660
drops off immediately.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.190
And it plateaus after that.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.760
What this shows me is that
the most important dollar

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.990
a player can spend your game
is the very first one, which

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.130
is unfortunately also the most
difficult hurdle to overcome.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.620
But some of the mechanics
I'll show you later

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.250
will address this.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.320
I think David also
mentioned this.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.990
Past spending is also
the best predictor

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.910
of future spending patterns.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.770
Again, it reaffirms
why that first dollar

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.470
is very, very important.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.290
When the person spends
once, but not again,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.210
actually we see a
30% to 40% drop-off--

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.460
I thinks 40 to 50
actually-- drop-off

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.499
between the first purchase
and second and third.

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.790
So if you think about the
spending behavior of somebody

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.600
who buys once but not
again, but continues

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.470
to spend time on
your game, they're

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.090
becoming more like
a non-buyer to you.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.800
So we have special offers for
their first dollar conversion.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.920
Also have something similar for
the special second and third

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.420
conversion later
down in the game.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.040
Are you guys familiar with the
concept of price elasticity?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.160
Anybody know what this is?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.660
Awesome.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.010
It's just a very fancy way of
saying different willingness

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.340
to pay.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.460
So let me give you example.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.453
What's your name?

00:07:14.453 --> 00:07:18.280
Atkin, OK.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.120
If I want to buy your shoes,
how much would you sell it for?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.872
$50.

00:07:25.872 --> 00:07:26.580
What's your name?

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.240
AUDIENCE: Eve.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.700
MOONLIT: Would you
buy that for $50?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.780
Would you buy it for $50?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.280
Would you?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.821
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.570
MOONLIT: Anybody want
to by it for $40?

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.952
$30?

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:39.270
So here's the idea.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.780
For the exact same
item, different people

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.260
have different
willingness to pay.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.000
And that's why
somebody asked earlier,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.490
do we need to test
different prices?

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.990
The answer is yes.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.950
And what do we test for?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.880
So on this graph, you can
see the negative correlation

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.110
between price and quantity.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.170
You want to test
different price points,

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:06.330
such that the area under the
curve, or price times quantity,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.150
is maximized.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.940
And that's your revenue
maximizing point, price point.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.600
But another question is,
when you AB test prices,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.890
when players feel like,
oh, I got this for $5,

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.610
but he gets it for $3--

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.950
so here's a trick.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.210
When you test
different price points,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.120
also have different
in-game items.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.760
So the price per item
is fixed, but you're

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.539
bundling different items
at different price points.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.730
It's a way to gauge where a
user is more likely to take out

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.090
the wallet and spend,
even though they're buying

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.950
fundamentally different things.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.490
Make sense?

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.900
So a lot of these
games have an IAP store

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.930
in the game, where you
service different points,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.740
different prices, different
SKUs for different players.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.900
So think about managing
this as managing

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.770
a real retail store,
like Whole Foods.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.940
You want to keep it
new, keep it refreshed,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.580
keep it fresh, for
users to come back,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.310
build a habit of checking
it, see what's going on.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.900
So this is one of actually my
previous company, Congregate,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.980
game.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.200
So what they did
is that they would

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.720
vary the items in the store
based on different things--

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.360
time-based, they're
different promotions,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.270
based on time of the
year, time of the week.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.510
Progression-based, sometimes
you offer different things

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.090
with people at different parts
of different parts of the game.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.870
And also, they have
temporary promotions

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.330
and more permanent ones.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.040
So really think about managing
it to keep it engaging.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.460
It's almost like
a store in itself.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.010
Now, the most
important question you

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.910
want to ask when you design
anything with a price tag on it

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.730
is, why would my
players buy this?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.000
Are they buying it
out of frustration?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.880
Or buying it because it
gives them more premium

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.910
experience, to give
them more delight?

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.830
And my vote is for the latter.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.410
Anything with a price
tag on it should

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.160
be aimed to enhance the
player's in-game experience.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.110
You also want to show them
why they want to buy it.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.340
So it's not very clear
with the virtual goods

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.910
what's the purpose of that.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.660
A lot of people have
encouraged users

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.610
to try out premium
currency or premium

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.810
item as part of the tutorial,
just to showcase the value--

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.710
again, the value of the
items you're selling.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.210
Another one is, timing
is very important.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.980
Think about why.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.620
If you have item that
offers extended game played,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.460
surface it when the game ends.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.650
So timing the surfacing
with the player's need.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.390
Next, I want to touch on some
quick, high-level lessons

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.760
about live ops.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.570
You guys heard of live
ops, live operations?

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.320
To do it well, oftentimes
you do need a dedicated team,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.970
or even one person, to run it.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.390
But I want to share
some high-level insights

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.360
or learnings that can help
you think about increasing

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.560
engagement and
increasing value, again,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.180
ultimately to increase your LTV.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.440
So live ops has three
interrelated elements--

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.380
content, event, and sales.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.450
And of the three,
content is king.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.670
It powers both events and sales.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.160
For events, there are two
types of things you can run.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.570
The first one is called
the core game loops events,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.770
where you have time-limited
goals and achievements

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.430
to encourage players to replay
part of the existing core

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.420
gameplay.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.950
So for example,
for strategy games

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.760
is to redo the pass rates.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.425
For RPG is to replay something.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:59.520
And for puzzle games is
to increase the life,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.360
so you can try
different levels again.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.790
And if you have the ability
to dynamically introduce

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.690
piece of new content--

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.950
we call this the
dynamic content--

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.200
where you introduce
side missions,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.080
additional new content
for the players to try,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.490
but again with a
time-limited fashion.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.870
The second idea about sales
is that it doesn't always

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.380
have to be about IAP
discounts, which often would

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.560
inflate your in-game economy.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.300
So think about
running sales as a way

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.410
to bundle your existing
IAP options with something

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.460
extra in the item, in the SKU.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.590
So for example,
for strategy games,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.990
sometimes they throw
in a free builder

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.440
for a limited period of time
if you purchase certain IAP.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.440
And for RPG and puzzle,
think about different ways

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.230
you can make the content
more interesting on top

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.250
of IAP discount.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.130
Now, I'll share with
you a collection

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.640
of some of the most
common in-game designs.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.200
Again, most of
these will probably

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.240
be very familiar to you.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.199
But my goal is to give
you some new ideas

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:12.990
and think about different
ways to innovate.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.220
Starter pack-- somebody
mentioned this earlier.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.520
It's by far the
most effective way

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.640
to convert that first dollar.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.430
A lot of games offer a bundle
of items at a huge discount, 40%

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.390
or more.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.820
The goal is to increase
that very first buy.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.610
Timing's very important too.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.580
The first seven
days after install

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.630
is the golden period to
surface starter pack.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.790
And as I mentioned earlier
about the second purchase,

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.370
think about using a second
purchase starter pack

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.100
if a player buys something
but stops buying,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.590
but continues to stay with
your game for a longer

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.360
period of time.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.450
Many developers also
make it time-limited

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.570
to showcase scarcity,
to encourage purchase,

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.520
again within the
first seven days.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.590
Premium content.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.060
David mentioned earlier that
premium content by itself

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.490
does not quite work.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.400
But think about instead
of premium content as in

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.200
to pay to play the game, period,
about any pieces of content

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.830
in your game can have a
premium version of it--

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:32.620
premium clothes, premium
maps, premium powers.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.710
So think about breaking out
different pieces of your game

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.690
and a premium level of that.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.270
Social spending is when we
have higher willingness to pay,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.510
where you're buying an item
as a gift to your friends,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.020
not for yourself.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.210
So this concept also applies
for mobile games as well.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.910
Games with guilds
or social elements

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.420
sometimes let user purchase a
premium item that will actually

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.190
benefit their friends.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.520
Competition is very important.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.660
It's one of the drivers
why people will purchase.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.010
Earlier, David mentioned that
when you have vanity items,

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:18.240
it's most effective in
the more PvP setting.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.980
It's not just so
that you can showcase

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.650
your unique
personality and style,

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.850
but it also works really, really
well if these vanity items also

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.880
signal strength and skills.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.590
So level 1 item will look
very different from level 100.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.890
And for games with
competition as an element,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.520
that signal, that social
proof, is very important

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.100
and can be a driver for
good monetization design.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.270
Power-ups is a pretty
common one, most often seen

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.950
in casual games.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.840
This is when players
are especially

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.360
stuck on a certain level.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.750
Again, your goal is to help them
spend more time in your game

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.250
in a longer period of time.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.750
So when they're stuck, the best
way to help them overcome that,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.180
and power-up is a
way to help them

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.270
progress faster in the more
difficult-- or even earlier

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.640
in game.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.690
Customization, as mentioned
earlier, most effective

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.930
in PvP games.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.180
But even in games that's
not strictly social,

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.660
people do spend money when
they think about this,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.110
have different ways of
representing their styles.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.030
One of the very
popular genre right

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.320
now is interactive story games.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.400
You can argue it's very much
a single player experience.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.640
But when I'm faced the
choice to wear something

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.990
very plain or really customize
a character to showcase who

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:56.000
I am inside, that money becomes
not that big of a deal anymore.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.050
Extended game play is another
way to think about monetizing.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.920
This is very often used in
games that are time-limited

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.260
or it's a skill-based.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.440
So this is also often
seen not just as IAP

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.680
but also as rewarded adds,
since it's a very quick way

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.190
to extend gameplay.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.690
Game players have a little
bit extra to help push them

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.490
over that hurdle.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.310
Some games also have this very
direct way to pay as a way

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.280
to shortcut leveling.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.130
So instead of grinding for
months or weeks and month, day,

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.390
they can pay a
small amount instead

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.150
to speed up at a
very early stage.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.900
I only recommend this if
you have a lot of content

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.730
already out for the game.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.820
So think about strategy
game or some PvP games

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.560
where everybody's up here.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.790
I just joined the game.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.620
I want to catch up to them.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.610
That is one way to do that.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.235
But if you don't have
a lot of content,

00:17:56.235 --> 00:18:00.600
and if you have a premium
option to help player

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.810
fast forward the game, they
might run out of content.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.110
And they might churn.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.130
So really think about balance
the time and the value element

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.820
of your game design.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.210
Now, the next two designs,
monetization designs,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.670
are not strictly
in-app purchases.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.240
But it's a trend that we've seen
picked up by game developers

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.410
from all around the world.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.680
The first one is
designing subscription

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.250
as a way to engage the
high value players.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.580
So think of subscription,
not as a content bundle,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.440
but as a VIP program, like
the airline mileage program.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.850
It's used to really amplify
the player's time and value

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.220
and especially IAP spending.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.130
We call these the
multiplier for IAP.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.070
So this is a game called
Legendary Game of Heroes

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.500
by NETWORK.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.770
They have a VIP program
that's ever-growing.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.320
And everything you
do in game gives you

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.610
VIP points, whether it is
to complete a challenge

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.670
or purchase some IAP items.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.620
And as you accumulate
more points,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.460
you also unlock more benefits.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.140
And you have to be
a VIP subscriber

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.300
to activate these benefits.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.940
They've seen
incredible retention.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.970
So actually this is true
for many other mobile game

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.500
developers who have in-game
subscriptions implemented.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.450
The often reported a higher
retention, also higher LTV.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.500
Again, remember, more time
spent and longer period of time

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.690
leads to higher LTV.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.630
The second one is rewarded ads.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.500
For this one, the
trick here is to think

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.590
about how to optimize it, how to
incorporate in your game design

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.160
so it's more effective.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.710
So the framework I like to use
have four different elements.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.920
The first one is placement.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.600
Where do you place it?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.630
The recommendation
from Congregate

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.660
is that the rewarded ads should
be core to your game play.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.590
The reward itself
should be meaningful,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.090
but not competing
directly with IAP.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.100
The second one is targeting.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.260
Who can see it?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.930
And the answer is that
everybody should have access

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.610
to rewarded ads.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.460
But the recommendation
is that user

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.650
should initiate the experience.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.730
But again, you should test this
out, as David said earlier.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.790
There is no one right
answer for all the games.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.520
The third one is cadence.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.460
How often should the
user watch rewarded ads?

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.640
Congregate tested
many things and found

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.940
that six to eight ads per
viewer per day maximizes return.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.440
And the last one is measurement.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.950
How do you know your rewarded
ad is working as intended?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.020
So they cohort their user base
based on these two metrics,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.690
ad viewership and frequency.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.650
Who's watching it?

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.660
And how often are
they watching it?

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.340
Track your core metrics--

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.840
the retention, engagement,
buyer conversion metrics

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.980
I mentioned earlier--

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.650
by these two cohorts.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.330
And you want to see if
they behave differently

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.940
if they watch too many
ads or no ads at all.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:25.020
Next, I'll share some tips about
going global with Google Play.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.280
We know when you launch your
game with us your game is

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.430
by default available--
if you make so--

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.050
all over the world.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.950
And different players, besides
different price points,

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.010
also have their
preferred way of payment.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.350
Credit cards here, WeChat
in different places, PayPal.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.260
But for Google Play, we
try to find different ways

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.900
to let users pay with
the form of payment

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.899
where they're most comfortable.

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:55.440
So these are some
of the latest stats

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.560
on where things are available
and how many countries they're

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.910
available in.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.680
So we take care of
the billing part,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.360
so you can focus
on making the game.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.030
Now, when you launch
your game, you

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.100
have the store listing page.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.860
It is the very first thing
that players will see

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.170
when they come into your game.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.430
So making sure that your store
listing page is appealing,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.770
is relevant culturally, and it's
relevant in the local language

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.330
is very, very important.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.640
So here are some tips about how
to manage your storefront so

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.560
that when a user
comes in, they're more

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.630
likely to install the game.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.520
I'm not going to go
through each of these.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.970
You can read through it.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.730
But what I do
suggest is that you

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.510
use the store listing
experiments, free and available

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.860
in the Google Play Console, to
really test what kind of icons

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.240
have the highest conversion,
what kind of screenshots,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.040
what kind of short description
and long description.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.920
You might be surprised
by what you find.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.950
Remember this
graph from earlier?

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.310
Price elasticity is also true.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.590
It varies country
by country as well.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.850
So what that means is
for many countries,

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.990
even $1 is a little
too bit too much.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.130
So we have this option
for sub-dollar pricing

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.190
in many, many emerging markets.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.010
The exchange rate here
is a little outdated.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.670
But the point here is that
exchange rates fluctuate.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.310
People's willingness
to pay fluctuates.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.290
So it's a lot of work
for you to pay attention

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.140
to these fluctuations and
think about different ways

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.960
and different price points.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.600
So Google Play Console
has a pricing template

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.560
that you can use.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.510
It will automatically
update these for you.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.410
But when you think about
pricing emerging markets,

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.470
consider the lowest
point of SKU,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.940
such that these players who
can't afford higher price item

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.045
can still take out their
wallet and purchase your items.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.680
Here's a case study from a
Vietnamese developer called

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.260
Divmob.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.410
When they launched sub-dollar
pricing in their game,

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.260
they were able to triple--

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.440
triple their buyers and triple
the number of transactions.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.830
So really think about
meeting your players

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.260
where their
willingness to pay is.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.950
The very last thing is it's not
only about the absolute price

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.500
points, but also how the
price looks matters, too,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.440
when it comes to conversion.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.490
A lot of things in America,
things end in $0.99.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.020
It's not true in Asia, not true
in China, not true in Korea,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.110
not true in Japan.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.530
So when you think about prices,
just doing the pure conversion

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.190
of the exchange rate might
make the end price look really

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.650
weird for the local user.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.710
So not just convert
your prices, but think

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:07.690
about localizing, culturalizing
your prices as well.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.500
One takeaway from my talk--

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.310
running a game as a service--

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.810
the most important
thing is to think

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.450
about how to increase
your player's lifetime

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.820
value and the two factors
that mostly affect

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.370
your total LTV,
time and the value,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.470
which converts to
engagement and value.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.560
For engagement, think
about retention.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.470
Think about session
frequency, session time.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.285
Think about stickiness factor.

00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:37.360
And for value, think about
the first dollar conversion

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.350
and second buyer conversion.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.190
All right.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.114
Thank you so much.
