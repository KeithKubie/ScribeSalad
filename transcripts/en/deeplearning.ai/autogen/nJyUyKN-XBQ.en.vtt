00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.939
in the last video we work through an

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
in the last video we work through an
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.370
in the last video we work through an
example of using a computation graph to

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
example of using a computation graph to
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.740
example of using a computation graph to
compute a function J now let's take a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
compute a function J now let's take a
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.570
compute a function J now let's take a
cleaned up version at their computation

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
cleaned up version at their computation
 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730
cleaned up version at their computation
graph and show how you can use it to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
graph and show how you can use it to
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.730
graph and show how you can use it to
figure out derivative calculations for

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
figure out derivative calculations for
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.310
figure out derivative calculations for
that function J so here's a computation

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
that function J so here's a computation
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.279
that function J so here's a computation
graph let's say you want to compute the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
graph let's say you want to compute the
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.509
graph let's say you want to compute the
derivative of J with respect to B so

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
derivative of J with respect to B so
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.910
derivative of J with respect to B so
what is that well this says if we were

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
what is that well this says if we were
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.220
what is that well this says if we were
to take this value of B and change it a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
to take this value of B and change it a
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009
to take this value of B and change it a
little bit how would the value of J

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
little bit how would the value of J
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.799
little bit how would the value of J
change well J is defined as um V times D

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
change well J is defined as um V times D
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.160
change well J is defined as um V times D
and right now B is equal to 11 so then

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
and right now B is equal to 11 so then
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.220
and right now B is equal to 11 so then
with the bump up B by a little bit to 11

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
with the bump up B by a little bit to 11
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150
with the bump up B by a little bit to 11
point oo 1 then J which is 3 B so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
point oo 1 then J which is 3 B so
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850
point oo 1 then J which is 3 B so
currently 33 will get bumped up to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
currently 33 will get bumped up to
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.200
currently 33 will get bumped up to
thirty three point zero three so here

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
thirty three point zero three so here
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779
thirty three point zero three so here
we've increased V by 0.001 and the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
we've increased V by 0.001 and the
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420
we've increased V by 0.001 and the
result of that is that J goes up three

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
result of that is that J goes up three
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969
result of that is that J goes up three
times as much so the derivative of J of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
times as much so the derivative of J of
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820
times as much so the derivative of J of
respect to B is equal to three because

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
respect to B is equal to three because
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.450
respect to B is equal to three because
the increase in J is three times the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
the increase in J is three times the
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510
the increase in J is three times the
increase in V and in fact this is very

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
increase in V and in fact this is very
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300
increase in V and in fact this is very
analogous to the example we have in the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
analogous to the example we have in the
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.730
analogous to the example we have in the
previous video where we had on F of a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740
previous video where we had on F of a
 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.850
previous video where we had on F of a
equals three a and so we then derive

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
equals three a and so we then derive
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.240
equals three a and so we then derive
that DF da which was slightly simplified

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
that DF da which was slightly simplified
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100
that DF da which was slightly simplified
study sloppy notation you can write as

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
study sloppy notation you can write as
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.679
study sloppy notation you can write as
DF da was equal to three right so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
DF da was equal to three right so
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.609
DF da was equal to three right so
instead here we have J equals BB and so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
instead here we have J equals BB and so
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:50.380
instead here we have J equals BB and so
DJ DB is equal to three with here J

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
DJ DB is equal to three with here J
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.630
DJ DB is equal to three with here J
playing the role of F and V playing the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
playing the role of F and V playing the
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.270
playing the role of F and V playing the
role of a in this previous example that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
role of a in this previous example that
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.120
role of a in this previous example that
we had right from from an earlier video

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130
we had right from from an earlier video
 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.060
we had right from from an earlier video
so indeed terminology of back

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
so indeed terminology of back
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520
so indeed terminology of back
propagation what we're seeing is that if

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
propagation what we're seeing is that if
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.039
propagation what we're seeing is that if
you want to compute the derivative of

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
you want to compute the derivative of
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.770
you want to compute the derivative of
this final output variable which usually

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
this final output variable which usually
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.190
this final output variable which usually
is a variable your camels about what

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
is a variable your camels about what
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.949
is a variable your camels about what
expect to be then we're done you know

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959
expect to be then we're done you know
 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.860
expect to be then we're done you know
sort of one step of back propagation so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
sort of one step of back propagation so
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.930
sort of one step of back propagation so
we've got one step backwards in this

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
we've got one step backwards in this
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.780
we've got one step backwards in this
graph now let's look at another example

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
graph now let's look at another example
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.180
graph now let's look at another example
what is DJ da in other words if we bump

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
what is DJ da in other words if we bump
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.790
what is DJ da in other words if we bump
up the value of a how does that affect

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800
up the value of a how does that affect
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.259
up the value of a how does that affect
the value of J well let's go through the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269
the value of J well let's go through the
 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.960
the value of J well let's go through the
example right now a is equal to five so

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
example right now a is equal to five so
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.320
example right now a is equal to five so
let's bump it up to five point zero one

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
let's bump it up to five point zero one
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.589
let's bump it up to five point zero one
the net impact of that is at D which was

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599
the net impact of that is at D which was
 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.559
the net impact of that is at D which was
a plus u so that was previous eleven

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
a plus u so that was previous eleven
 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.839
a plus u so that was previous eleven
this we can increase the eleven point

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849
this we can increase the eleven point
 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.930
this we can increase the eleven point
over one and then we've already seen as

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
over one and then we've already seen as
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.300
over one and then we've already seen as
above that J now gets run pups to thirty

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
above that J now gets run pups to thirty
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.030
above that J now gets run pups to thirty
three point zero zero three so what

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
three point zero zero three so what
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.589
three point zero zero three so what
we've seen is that if you increase a by

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599
we've seen is that if you increase a by
 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.930
we've seen is that if you increase a by
0.001 J increases by 0.03 and by entry

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
0.001 J increases by 0.03 and by entry
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610
0.001 J increases by 0.03 and by entry
is a I mean if you were to take this

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
is a I mean if you were to take this
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.740
is a I mean if you were to take this
value five and just plug in a new value

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
value five and just plug in a new value
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.350
value five and just plug in a new value
right then the change to a will

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
right then the change to a will
 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.729
right then the change to a will
propagate to the rights of the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
propagate to the rights of the
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.400
propagate to the rights of the
computation graph so the J ends up being

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
computation graph so the J ends up being
 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.080
computation graph so the J ends up being
thirty three point zero three and so the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
thirty three point zero three and so the
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.569
thirty three point zero three and so the
increase the J is three times the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579
increase the J is three times the
 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.699
increase the J is three times the
increase to a so that means this

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
increase to a so that means this
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.420
increase to a so that means this
derivative is equal to three and one way

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
derivative is equal to three and one way
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.000
derivative is equal to three and one way
to break this down is to say that if you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
to break this down is to say that if you
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.180
to break this down is to say that if you
have if you change a then that would

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190
have if you change a then that would
 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.750
have if you change a then that would
change B and through changing B that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
change B and through changing B that
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.240
change B and through changing B that
would change a and so the net change to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
would change a and so the net change to
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.340
would change a and so the net change to
the value of J when you bump up the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
the value of J when you bump up the
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.259
the value of J when you bump up the
value and when you nudge the value of a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269
value and when you nudge the value of a
 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:59.569
value and when you nudge the value of a
up a little bit is that um first by

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579
up a little bit is that um first by
 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.680
up a little bit is that um first by
changing a you end up increasing B well

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690
changing a you end up increasing B well
 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020
changing a you end up increasing B well
how much does do entries right it is

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
how much does do entries right it is
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.220
how much does do entries right it is
increased by an amount determined by DVD

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
increased by an amount determined by DVD
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.259
increased by an amount determined by DVD
a and then the change in V will cause

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269
a and then the change in V will cause
 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.210
a and then the change in V will cause
the value of J to also increase so

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
the value of J to also increase so
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.160
the value of J to also increase so
calculus is actually called the chain

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170
calculus is actually called the chain
 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.880
calculus is actually called the chain
rule that is a affects V of X J then the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890
rule that is a affects V of X J then the
 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.820
rule that is a affects V of X J then the
amount that J changes when you nudge a

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
amount that J changes when you nudge a
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.870
amount that J changes when you nudge a
is the product of how much B changes

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
is the product of how much B changes
 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.710
is the product of how much B changes
when you nudge a times how much J

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720
when you nudge a times how much J
 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.770
when you nudge a times how much J
changes when you nudge B so in calculus

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780
changes when you nudge B so in calculus
 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.110
changes when you nudge B so in calculus
um again this is called the chain rule

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
um again this is called the chain rule
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.610
um again this is called the chain rule
and what we saw from this calculation is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
and what we saw from this calculation is
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.490
and what we saw from this calculation is
that if you increase a by point zero one

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500
that if you increase a by point zero one
 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.800
that if you increase a by point zero one
D changes by the same amount so DV da is

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
D changes by the same amount so DV da is
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.560
D changes by the same amount so DV da is
equal to one so in fact if you plug in

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570
equal to one so in fact if you plug in
 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.670

what we have worked our previously on

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680
what we have worked our previously on
 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.520
what we have worked our previously on
DVD J is equal to three and DVD a is

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
DVD J is equal to three and DVD a is
 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.950
DVD J is equal to three and DVD a is
equal to 1 so the product of these three

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960
equal to 1 so the product of these three
 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.020
equal to 1 so the product of these three
times one then I should say to the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030
times one then I should say to the
 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.020
times one then I should say to the
correct value that DJ da is equal to 3

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030

quantities of computing in your code so

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200
quantities of computing in your code so
 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.530

this thing here in your code you know

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540
this thing here in your code you know
 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.520
this thing here in your code you know
you use them DV to denote this value so

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530
you use them DV to denote this value so
 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.310
you use them DV to denote this value so
DV would be equal to 3 and your code you

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320
DV would be equal to 3 and your code you
 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.860
DV would be equal to 3 and your code you
represent this as a DA right which is

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870
represent this as a DA right which is
 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.159
represent this as a DA right which is
how we also figured out to be equal to 3

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.169
how we also figured out to be equal to 3
 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:53.850
how we also figured out to be equal to 3
okay so um with some back propagation

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
okay so um with some back propagation
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.360
okay so um with some back propagation

example on the next slide so let's go to

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:02.710
example on the next slide so let's go to
 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.790
example on the next slide so let's go to
a cleaned up copy of the computation

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800
a cleaned up copy of the computation
 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.880
a cleaned up copy of the computation
graph and just to recap what we've done

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.890
graph and just to recap what we've done
 

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.909
graph and just to recap what we've done
so far is go backward here and figured

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919
so far is go backward here and figured
 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:15.390
so far is go backward here and figured
out that DV is equal to 3 and again the

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400
out that DV is equal to 3 and again the
 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.190
out that DV is equal to 3 and again the
definition of DV that's just the

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.200
definition of DV that's just the
 

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.320
definition of DV that's just the
variable name of the code is really DJ

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.330
variable name of the code is really DJ
 

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.760
variable name of the code is really DJ
DV I will figure out that D a is equal

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:23.770
DV I will figure out that D a is equal
 

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.520
DV I will figure out that D a is equal
to 3 and again da is the variable name

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:26.530
to 3 and again da is the variable name
 

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.500
to 3 and again da is the variable name
in your code and that's really the value

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:28.510
in your code and that's really the value
 

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:34.529
in your code and that's really the value
of DG da and what sort of hand-wave how

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:34.539
of DG da and what sort of hand-wave how
 

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.350
of DG da and what sort of hand-wave how
you never gone backwards on these two

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360
you never gone backwards on these two
 

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.589
you never gone backwards on these two
edges like so now let's keep computing

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599
edges like so now let's keep computing
 

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.560
edges like so now let's keep computing
derivatives or let's look at the value

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.570
derivatives or let's look at the value
 

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.740
derivatives or let's look at the value
you so what is DJ

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:46.750
you so what is DJ
 

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.590
you so what is DJ
you well through a similar calculation

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600
you well through a similar calculation
 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.200
you well through a similar calculation
is what we did before and we start off

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.210
is what we did before and we start off
 

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.710
is what we did before and we start off
with you equals six if you bump up you

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720
with you equals six if you bump up you
 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.800
with you equals six if you bump up you
to six point zero one then B which is

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:58.810
to six point zero one then B which is
 

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.590
to six point zero one then B which is
previous eleven goes up to eleven point

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600
previous eleven goes up to eleven point
 

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.060
previous eleven goes up to eleven point
over one and so J goes from 33 - 33

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.070
over one and so J goes from 33 - 33
 

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.210
over one and so J goes from 33 - 33
point of or three and so the increase in

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.220
point of or three and so the increase in
 

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.600
point of or three and so the increase in
J is 3 X so this is equal and the

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:12.610
J is 3 X so this is equal and the
 

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.730
J is 3 X so this is equal and the
analysis but U is very similar to the

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:14.740
analysis but U is very similar to the
 

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.550
analysis but U is very similar to the
analysis we did for a this is actually

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560
analysis we did for a this is actually
 

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:26.030
analysis we did for a this is actually
computed as um DJ D V times DV e you

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040

where this we have already figured out

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
where this we have already figured out
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.430
where this we have already figured out
was three and this turns out to be equal

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440
was three and this turns out to be equal
 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.490
was three and this turns out to be equal
to one so we've kind of one more step

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.500
to one so we've kind of one more step
 

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.770

background collation we end up computing

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:37.780
background collation we end up computing
 

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.710
background collation we end up computing
that vu is also equal to three and D U

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720
that vu is also equal to three and D U
 

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.580
that vu is also equal to three and D U
is of course just this d JD u now we'll

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.590
is of course just this d JD u now we'll
 

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.100
is of course just this d JD u now we'll
just step through one last example in

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.110
just step through one last example in
 

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.450
just step through one last example in
detail so what is DJ D P right so you're

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:54.460
detail so what is DJ D P right so you're
 

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.460
detail so what is DJ D P right so you're
imagine if you are allowed to change the

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.470
imagine if you are allowed to change the
 

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.980
imagine if you are allowed to change the
value of B and you want to treat be a

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:58.990
value of B and you want to treat be a
 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.160
value of B and you want to treat be a
little bit in order to minimize or

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.170
little bit in order to minimize or
 

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.500
little bit in order to minimize or
maximize the value of K right so what is

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.510
maximize the value of K right so what is
 

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.720
maximize the value of K right so what is
the derivative what's the slope of this

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:06.730
the derivative what's the slope of this
 

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.930
the derivative what's the slope of this
function J when you change the value of

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:09.940
function J when you change the value of
 

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.410
function J when you change the value of
B a little bit it turns out that using

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:13.420
B a little bit it turns out that using
 

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.380
B a little bit it turns out that using
the chain rule for calculus this can be

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.390
the chain rule for calculus this can be
 

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.720
the chain rule for calculus this can be
written as the product of two things is

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:18.730
written as the product of two things is
 

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.740
written as the product of two things is
d GJ be u times V u DB and the reasoning

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.750
d GJ be u times V u DB and the reasoning
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.820
d GJ be u times V u DB and the reasoning
is if you change be a little bit so B

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.830
is if you change be a little bit so B
 

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.440
is if you change be a little bit so B
goes from 3 to say the point 0 1 um the

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.450
goes from 3 to say the point 0 1 um the
 

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.360
goes from 3 to say the point 0 1 um the
way of no effect J is it will first

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.370
way of no effect J is it will first
 

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.240
way of no effect J is it will first
affect you so how much does it affect

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.250
affect you so how much does it affect
 

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.890
affect you so how much does it affect
you well U is defined as B times C right

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:43.900
you well U is defined as B times C right
 

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.050
you well U is defined as B times C right
so this will go from 6 when B is equal

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.060
so this will go from 6 when B is equal
 

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:55.230
so this will go from 6 when B is equal
to 3/2 now our 6.00 to right because C

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240
to 3/2 now our 6.00 to right because C
 

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.930
to 3/2 now our 6.00 to right because C
is equal to 2

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:57.940
is equal to 2
 

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.780
is equal to 2
in our example here and so this tells us

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:00.790
in our example here and so this tells us
 

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.850
in our example here and so this tells us
that D u DB is equal to 2 because when

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:05.860
that D u DB is equal to 2 because when
 

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.940
that D u DB is equal to 2 because when
you bump up B by PI no 1 u increases

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:08.950
you bump up B by PI no 1 u increases
 

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.900
you bump up B by PI no 1 u increases
twice as much so d UD be this is equal

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:12.910
twice as much so d UD be this is equal
 

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:18.270
twice as much so d UD be this is equal
to 2 and now we know that U has gone up

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.280
to 2 and now we know that U has gone up
 

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.200
to 2 and now we know that U has gone up
twice as much as B has gone up well once

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.210
twice as much as B has gone up well once
 

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.380
twice as much as B has gone up well once
DJ vu we've already figured out that

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:25.390
DJ vu we've already figured out that
 

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.590
DJ vu we've already figured out that
this is equal to 3 and so by multiplying

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600
this is equal to 3 and so by multiplying
 

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.620
this is equal to 3 and so by multiplying
these two out we find that DJ DB is

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.630
these two out we find that DJ DB is
 

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.140
these two out we find that DJ DB is
equal to 6 and again here's the

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.150
equal to 6 and again here's the
 

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.760
equal to 6 and again here's the
reasoning for the second part of the

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:35.770
reasoning for the second part of the
 

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.040
reasoning for the second part of the
argument which is we want to know when

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.050
argument which is we want to know when
 

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.330
argument which is we want to know when
you goes up by point 0 2 how does that

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:41.340
you goes up by point 0 2 how does that
 

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.930
you goes up by point 0 2 how does that
affect J the fact that DJ D u is equal

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:45.940
affect J the fact that DJ D u is equal
 

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.320
affect J the fact that DJ D u is equal
to 3 that tells us that when you goes up

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.330
to 3 that tells us that when you goes up
 

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.030
to 3 that tells us that when you goes up
by point 0 2 J goes up 3 times as much

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040
by point 0 2 J goes up 3 times as much
 

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.490
by point 0 2 J goes up 3 times as much
so J should go up by 0.06 right so so

00:11:59.490 --> 00:11:59.500
so J should go up by 0.06 right so so
 

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.460
so J should go up by 0.06 right so so
bill that comes from in fact that each

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.470
bill that comes from in fact that each
 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.390
bill that comes from in fact that each
ad U is equal to 3 and if you check the

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:06.400
ad U is equal to 3 and if you check the
 

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.840
ad U is equal to 3 and if you check the
map in detail you will find that if B

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:09.850
map in detail you will find that if B
 

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.080
map in detail you will find that if B
becomes 3 point 0 1 then you become six

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.090
becomes 3 point 0 1 then you become six
 

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:20.430
becomes 3 point 0 1 then you become six
point zero 2 V becomes 11.0 - alright so

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440
point zero 2 V becomes 11.0 - alright so
 

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.580
point zero 2 V becomes 11.0 - alright so
that's a plus u so this 5 Plus u and

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:23.590
that's a plus u so this 5 Plus u and
 

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.600
that's a plus u so this 5 Plus u and
then J which is equal to 3 times B then

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.610
then J which is equal to 3 times B then
 

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.440
then J which is equal to 3 times B then
ends up being equal to 33 point zero

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.450
ends up being equal to 33 point zero
 

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.260
ends up being equal to 33 point zero
zero six right and so that's how you get

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.270
zero six right and so that's how you get
 

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.590
zero six right and so that's how you get
that

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600
that
 

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.970
that

this is if we go backwards so this is DB

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:42.370
this is if we go backwards so this is DB
 

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.200
this is if we go backwards so this is DB
