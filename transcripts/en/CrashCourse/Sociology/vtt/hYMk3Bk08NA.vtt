00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
We’ve all complained about having to go
to school at some point, right?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.980
I mean, who decided that teenagers need to
get to school at the ungodly hour of 7 am?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.740
That right there seems like a big drawback
that we didn’t consider when we talked about
the positive functions of schools.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.640
Last week, we discussed all the good
things about schooling –

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.900
how it helps people learn about the world,
how it helps kids meet other kids their own age,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.480
and how there are countless other ways
it helps society function better.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.960
But there are many not-so-good components
of our educational system – and I’m not just
talking about having to get up at dawn.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.200
Social-conflict theory can help us
understand how the US educational system
can disadvantage some people,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.860
while giving advantages to others, so that schools
ultimately play a role in reinforcing inequalities.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:51.020
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.060
Education is supposed to be the great
equalizer, right?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.900
We’re all told that if you work hard and
do well in school, you can be whatever you
want to be when you grow up.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.200
In this understanding of school, society creates
a meritocracy, or a system in which hard work and
talent is recognized and rewarded.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.140
In a pure meritocracy, two kids who work
equally hard and have the same raw talent should
do equally well –

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
no matter what neighborhood they grew up in,
no matter their race or gender, and no matter
their class standing.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.980
On the surface, it might seem like the US
has a meritocratic school system.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.280
But educational measures of merit, like
grades or SAT scores, don’t always measure
everyone’s talents consistently.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.000
Grades don’t just measure an individual
student’s effort or ability –

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.060
they’re also influenced by many factors outside of
the student’s control, like the quality of their school
or their access to resources like books or computers.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.640
This is where social-conflict theory comes
into the story.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.240
Social-conflict theory helps explain how
our educational system can both cause and
perpetuate class differences.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.600
In the United States, there are large class
gaps in educational attainment.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.380
While 83% of students from high income
families enroll in college after high school,
only 63% of low income students do.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.800
So, why the disparity?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.800
One reason is that wealthier kids tend to
live in higher income neighborhoods, which in
turn fund better quality schools.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.760
This makes it easier to get into college.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.480
In the US, school funding is determined
at the local level – and when I say local,
I mean very local.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.420
The city or town that a person lives in determines
the funding of their school system.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.360
While federal and state governments provide
some support to school districts, most of the
money comes from local property taxes –

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.900
meaning that schools in towns with more
expensive houses and higher earning residents
have more resources.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.740
For example, Fairfax County, Virginia, one
of the richest counties in the US, spent $13,700
per student in 2016.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.400
Compare that to what some of the poorest
counties in the country spend –

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.980
for example, Scott County in Mississippi
spends a little more than half that amount,
at $7,900 per student.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.300
Unsurprisingly, schools in more affluent
communities on average provide a better education
than schools in poorer communities.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:57.400
Having more funding for a school allows schools
to hire better teachers, buy more and better supplies,
offer a wider variety of classes, and provide
extracurricular activities.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.920
And these differences in school quality translate
to differences in outcomes for students.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.040
We know this because of research like a
recent study done by American economists

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.200
Kirabo Jackson, Rucker Johnson, and Claudia
Persico which used a natural experiment – court
mandated school finance reform – to show this.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.660
They found that increasing school funding
levels by 10% was associated with students 
earning 7% higher incomes as adults.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.440
And this is only one of many studies that
show that access to better quality, better funded
schools makes kids more likely to go to college.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.400
So is money the answer?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.500
If we just give schools more money, will
that be enough to fix the class differences
in educational attainment?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.100
Well, yes and no.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.000
School funding – or the lack of it – is
part of the social inequality we see in the
US education system.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.320
But there are plenty of school districts that are
already spending a lot of money per student and
still struggle to improve their student’s outcomes.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.820
So why is that?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.680
You might remember French sociologist
Pierre Bourdieu’s work on cultural capital from
our episode a few months ago on socialization.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.180
Cultural capital is valuable cultural knowledge
and experience that can be translated to forms
of economic and social capital.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.200
Even if school funding was the same
everywhere, students whose parents have
the time, money, and knowledge

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.280
to support education in the home will have
a step up on students whose parents don’t have
the time or resources to pass on cultural capital.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.840
For example, higher income parents are more likely
to read to their kids and spend more time interacting
with their children, even at very young ages –

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.220
which leads to kids entering school with a
more robust vocabulary and better literacy skills
than their less affluent peers.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.100
By the age of three, children of professionals
have vocabularies that are 50% larger than those
of children from working-class families.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.640
Children from different class backgrounds
are also exposed to different expectations
about the path that their lives will take.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.060
If you grow up in an upper middle class
neighborhood where your parents and all your
friends’ parents have college degrees,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.000
you’re much more likely to expect that you’ll go
to college, too – and you’ll prepare accordingly.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.680
Recall the self-fulfilling prophecy from last
episode?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.180
This is one way that works.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.180
But for people whose parents didn’t go to
college, expectations for attending college
may be lower.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.420
It may also be much harder to navigate applications
for college, understand how the financial aid system
works,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.960
or register for courses, all distinct barriers
to attending college.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.840
This specialized knowledge is a form of cultural
capital.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.650
So, schools and families unfortunately often
work together to reproduce social inequality

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.000
– kids with parents who have more time or money
to devote to education in the home are also the kids
most likely to be in well funded, high quality schools.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.280
And the US education system doesn’t just
contribute to class gaps in educational achievement.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.620
We also see persistent achievement gaps by race
in the US, and they’re made worse by elements of our
education system that advantage white students.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.120
We’ve talked before about the role that historical
patterns of segregation have played in shaping the
neighborhoods that minority kids grow up in.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.480
For example, Black children are more likely
to be living in lower income neighborhoods,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.620
which tend to have worse schools because of
how schools are supported by local tax dollars.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.720
That’s a real structural disadvantage.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.860
But social-conflict theorists point out other,
lesser known ways that our education system
privileges White students over minority students,
particularly Black and Hispanic students.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.960
First, most teachers and school
administrators are white –

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.060
which has important implications both for the
curriculum that students are taught in schools
and how students are evaluated.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.620
A recent study of a nationally representative
sample of American students

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:27.860
found that black students with the same
standardized test scores as their white classmates
were less likely to be nominated for gifted programs
if they had a non-black teacher.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.200
But this bias didn’t exist for students
who had a Black teacher.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.900
This is an example of tracking, in which
schools assign students to different types
of educational programs.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.780
While tracking is supposed to help teachers
meet different students’ needs, it often ends
up enhancing existing inequalities.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.460
White and Asian students are more likely to
chosen to be in honors or AP classes than
Black and Hispanic students –

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.520
which then contributes to racial gaps
in college attendance.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.720
Who gets chosen for college prep classes
and who’s put in vocational classes

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.900
often has to do with not just academic ability,
but teacher’s perception of a student’s behavior.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.780
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to talk about
how classroom discipline has especially negative
implications for minority students.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.020
In the classroom, certain behaviors are expected
of students.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.980
Sit at your desk.
Raise your hand.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.980
Finish your assignments quickly and quietly.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:22.120
While these may seem simple once you’re an
adult, these tasks are often difficult for young kids,
but breaking these rules can have huge consequences.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.980
Minority students, particularly Black and
Latino boys, are much more likely to be disciplined
for minor classroom infractions like these,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.940
often resulting in suspension of expulsion
from school.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.960
Black students are suspended at rates three
times higher than their white classmates.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.620
And if you’re suspended or expelled, you’re
not in the classroom learning.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:46.960
Higher risk of suspension and expulsion also puts
minority students at a higher risk of doing poorly in
school and contributes to higher dropout rates.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.260
This ultimately affects their job prospects,
and therefore their class standing.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.480
But being in school also keeps kids off the
street.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.500
Kids who are suspended or expelled are more
likely to engage in risky behaviors like drug
use or other criminal behavior.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.720
This contributes to what’s known as the
school to prison pipeline.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.740
This is an informal ‘tracking’ for students
that criminalizes deviant behavior in schools,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.160
even minor disciplinary issues, like talking
back to teachers.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.440
For minority students, schools are more
likely to escalate disciplinary issues to the
juvenile justice system,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.060
putting students in contact with the
criminal justice system at an early age.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.200
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.360
Another way that minority students end up
being sorted into lower academic tracks are
through standardized test scores.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.940
Standardized tests are a topic of great contention,
due to concerns about teachers ‘teaching to the
test’ and not teaching a full, broad curriculum.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.840
And most standardized tests are made and tested on
the dominant group in society – the white middle class.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.500
Critics of standardized testing often cite
cultural bias as part of the reason that we see gaps
in test scores across race and class lines.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.040
The federal school funding requirements put
in place by the No Child Left Behind act in 2001

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.920
also can create some perverse incentives for
how schools classify their students.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.720
To keep getting federal funding, schools have
to have a certain percentage of their students
pass the national assessments.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.180
But students can be made exempt from these
tests if they’re classified as disabled

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.880
– which can lead to schools labeling marginal
students as learning disabled to maintain the pass
rate that they need to get funding.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:20.300
This is important, because, as we discussed
last week, the labels that schools give students
often turn into self-fulfilling prophecies.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:29.420
A marginal student who’s kept in the regular
testing pool may be more likely to have teacher time
and resources devoted to their improvement than
one who’s labelled as learning disabled.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:35.200
And, this type of tracking is more common
for minority students, which can contribute
to racial gaps in educational achievement.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:42.580
More broadly, tracking can have long term
consequences for what kinds of opportunities
are available to students or the choices that
they make later in life.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.280
For example, boys are more likely to be tracked
in higher level math classes than girls are.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.060
This contributes to fewer women pursuing math-heavy
careers, like economics or engineering –

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.420
which happen to be some of the more highly paid
careers, meaning that tracking is one contributor
to the gender pay gap.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.620
Ultimately, educational systems are grounded in
the biases of the society that they’re built within –

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:08.180
and while our schooling system does a lot
of good, social conflict theorists point out that
its structural features –

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.940
everything from taxes, to cultural capital,
to standardized testing –

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.260
can disadvantage minorities in ways that
can perpetuate patterns of social inequality.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.980
Today, we discussed a few of those social
inequalities in the US education system,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.620
using social conflict theory to explore how our
system deviates from a meritocracy.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.220
We discussed how school funding and school
quality varies by income.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.220
Then, we looked at how cultural capital
and the family you grow up in impacts your
educational experiences.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:40.520
Finally, we used racial conflict theory to
understand how the American school system
disadvantages minority students

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.660
through practices such as tracking,
disciplinary biases, and standardized testing.
