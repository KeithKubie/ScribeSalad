00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.430
- [Instructor] Let's evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.370
from negative three to five

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.290
of four dx.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.030
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.700
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.603
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.810
All right, so in order to evaluate this,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.670
we need to remember the
fundamental theorem of calculus,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.470
which connects the notion

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
of a definite integral and antiderivative.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490
So the fundamental theorem
of calculus tells us

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.540
that our definite integral
from a to b of f of x dx

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.840
is going to be equal to the antiderivative

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.700
of our function f, which we
denote with the capital F,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.240
evaluated at the upper bound,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.520
minus

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.450
our antiderivative,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.130
evaluated at the lower bound.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.570
So we just have to do
that right over here.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.190
So this is going to be equal to,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.400
well, what is the antiderivative of four?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.880
Well, you might immediately say,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.380
well, that's just going to be four x.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.370
You could even think of it in
terms of reverse power rule.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.350
Four is the same thing
as four x to the zero.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.390
So you increase zero by one.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060
So it's going to be four x to the first,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.980
and then you divide by that new exponent.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Four x to the first divided by one,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.870
well, that's just going to be four x.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.610
So the antiderivative is four x.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.400
This is, you could say,
our capital F of x,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.110
and we're going to evaluate that

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.370
at five and at negative three.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.500
We're gonna find the
difference between these two.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.860
So what we have right over here,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.160
evaluating the antiderivative
at our upper bound,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.740
that is going to be four times five.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700
And then from that,
we're going to subtract,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.850
evaluating our antiderivative
at the lower bound.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.000
So that's four times negative three.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.810
Four times negative three.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.290
And what is that going to be equal to?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.240
So this is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.730
20 and then minus negative 12.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.930
So this is going to be plus 12,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.630
which is going to be equal to 32.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.760
Let's do another example

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.660
where we're going to do
the reverse power rule.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.980
So let's say

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.090
that we want to find

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.350
the indefinite or we want to
find the definite integral

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.030
going from negative one

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.740
to three

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.210
of seven

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.100
x squared

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.933
dx.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.890
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.430
Well, what we want to do is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.360
evaluate what is the
antiderivative of this?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.790
Or you could say what is,
if this is lowercase f of x,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.420
what is capital F of x?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.780
Well, the reverse power rule,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.450
we increase this exponent by one.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.660
So we're going to have
seven times x to the third,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.050
and then we divide by
that increased exponent.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.200
So seven x to the third divided by three,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.300
and we want to evaluate
that at our upper bound

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.482
and then subtract from that

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:57.610
and it evaluate it at our lower bound.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.090
So this is going to be equal to,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.390
so evaluating it at our upper bound,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.390
it's going to be seven
times three to the third.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.710
I'll just write that three
to the third over three.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.410
And then from that, we
are going to subtract

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.080
this capital F of x,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.160
the antiderivative evaluated
at the lower bound.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.480
So that is going to be

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.960
seven times negative one to the third,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.940
all of that over three.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.950
And so this first expression, let's see,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.080
this is going to be seven

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.940
times three to the third over three.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.510
This is 27

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.670
over three.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.330
This is going to be the same
thing as seven times nine.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.730
So this is going to be 63.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.950
And this over here,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.240
negative one to the third
power is negative one.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.880
But then we were subtracting a negative,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.038
so this is just gonna be adding.

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:53.200
And so this is just going
to be plus seven over three.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.540
Plus seven

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.373
over three,

00:03:56.373 --> 00:03:59.050
if we wanted to express
this as a mixed number,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.833
seven over three is the
same thing as 2 1/3.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.290
So when we add everything together,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.290
we are going to get 65 1/3.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.223
And we are done.
