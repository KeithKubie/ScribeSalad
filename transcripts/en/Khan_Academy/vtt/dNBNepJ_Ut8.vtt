00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:03.267
- [Voiceover] Gus plans
to install a handrail

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.101
around a skating rink.

00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.424
The rink forms a 40 meter
by 20 meter rectangle.

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:13.004
How many meters of handrail does Gus need?

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.510
So here's what we know
about the skating rink.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.677
It's a 40 meter by 20 meter rectangle.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.724
So let's draw the skating rink.

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:25.391
That might help us to visualize,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.690
and we know that one
side length is 40 meters

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:37.505
and another side length is 20 meters.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.232
So Gus definitely needs to put
some handrails 40 meters here

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:45.104
and 20 meters here,
but that is not enough.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:46.831
As somebody who doesn't know how to skate,

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.067
I very much hope Gus puts
handrail on this length

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.874
and this length also.

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:55.473
He needs to put the handrails
all the way around the outside

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.473
where what we could call
the perimeter of the shape,

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.908
the entire distance around the outside.

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:04.471
Because the skating rink is a rectangle,

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.685
we know that opposite sides are equal.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.818
So if this length is 40 meters up here,

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:14.201
then this length down here
must also be 40 meters.

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.549
And we can do the same thing with 20.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.718
If we have 20 over here,
then the length across

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:21.635
must also be 20 meters.

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:24.813
So now we can figure out the entire amount

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:28.526
of handrail Gus needs, the
amount of meters he needs to buy

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:30.334
to put around the skating rink.

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:34.417
For this first side here,
he needs 40 meters plus

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.593
to go down this side,

00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:41.187
he'll need another 20 meters of handrail.

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:42.855
Going across the bottom of the rink,

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:45.994
he'll need another 40 meters of handrail,

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:47.418
and then, going up the side,

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:50.835
he'll need another 20 meters of handrail.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.948
So we can add these to find
the total amount he needs.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.365
40 plus 20 is 60.

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.779
Then 60 plus 40 plus 40 is 100,

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.979
and 100 plus 20 more is 120 meters.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:16.117
So to go the entire
distance around the outside

00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:19.941
of the skating rink, or the
perimeter of the skating rink

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:24.108
with handrail, Gus will
need 120 meters of handrail.
