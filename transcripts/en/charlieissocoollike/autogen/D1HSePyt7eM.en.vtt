uses YouTube regularly I have a bit of a
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510

love-hate relationship with the website

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
love-hate relationship with the website
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.190
love-hate relationship with the website
and more than anything I'd really like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
and more than anything I'd really like

them to have some proper competition in
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.910
them to have some proper competition in
the hopes that it might encourage them

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
the hopes that it might encourage them
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.289
the hopes that it might encourage them
to up their game a bit but obviously you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
to up their game a bit but obviously you
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149
to up their game a bit but obviously you
can't make just another video streaming

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
can't make just another video streaming
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649
can't make just another video streaming
website and hope it does as well as

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
website and hope it does as well as
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.700

YouTube there has to be something

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
YouTube there has to be something
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410
YouTube there has to be something
different enough about it to justify it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
different enough about it to justify it
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.539
different enough about it to justify it
existing and so I asked myself what is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
existing and so I asked myself what is
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310
existing and so I asked myself what is
the one thing that I would change about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
the one thing that I would change about
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.800
the one thing that I would change about
YouTube if I could and I decided that I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
YouTube if I could and I decided that I
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929
YouTube if I could and I decided that I
would want to get rid of you counts

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
would want to get rid of you counts
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999
would want to get rid of you counts
instead the videos on my hypothetical

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
instead the videos on my hypothetical
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219
instead the videos on my hypothetical
website would be ranked based on overall

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
website would be ranked based on overall
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350
website would be ranked based on overall
engagement so you would actually be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
engagement so you would actually be
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.670
engagement so you would actually be
worth the least because although you are

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
worth the least because although you are
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590
worth the least because although you are
engaging with the content it's only in a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
engaging with the content it's only in a
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270
engaging with the content it's only in a
very passive way and the longer you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
very passive way and the longer you
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800
very passive way and the longer you
watch something the more that view would

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
watch something the more that view would
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.090
watch something the more that view would
be worth because the more engaged you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
be worth because the more engaged you
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469
be worth because the more engaged you
are if you click like on a video that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
are if you click like on a video that
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240
are if you click like on a video that
would be worth more engagement than a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
would be worth more engagement than a
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.469
would be worth more engagement than a
view because the video is actually

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
view because the video is actually
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210
view because the video is actually
encouraging you to take some kind of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
encouraging you to take some kind of
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889
encouraging you to take some kind of
action if you share a video that's worth

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
action if you share a video that's worth
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.450
action if you share a video that's worth
more engagement if you leave a comment

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
more engagement if you leave a comment
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219
more engagement if you leave a comment
the longer and better written your

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
the longer and better written your
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.899
the longer and better written your
comment is the more engagement it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
comment is the more engagement it's
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.789
comment is the more engagement it's
worth and if you decide to leave a video

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
worth and if you decide to leave a video
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830
worth and if you decide to leave a video
response that's the most engaged you can

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
response that's the most engaged you can
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.240
response that's the most engaged you can
be because you've actually been

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
be because you've actually been
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980
be because you've actually been
encouraged to create something new based

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
encouraged to create something new based
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.059
encouraged to create something new based
on what you've seen and so all of that

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
on what you've seen and so all of that
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.380
on what you've seen and so all of that
data would be put through an algorithm

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
data would be put through an algorithm
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850
data would be put through an algorithm
that would come up with an engagement

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
that would come up with an engagement
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.640
that would come up with an engagement
rating for a video and that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650
rating for a video and that
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.289
rating for a video and that
number would be the big one that would

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299
number would be the big one that would
 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.270
number would be the big one that would
appear underneath the video as opposed

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
appear underneath the video as opposed
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.679
appear underneath the video as opposed
to a few count I think that to start

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689
to a few count I think that to start
 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.479
to a few count I think that to start
with it would probably have to just rank

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489
with it would probably have to just rank
 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.309
with it would probably have to just rank
existing online videos as opposed to

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
existing online videos as opposed to
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.229
existing online videos as opposed to
hosting all of its own stuff but yeah

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239
hosting all of its own stuff but yeah
 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.780
hosting all of its own stuff but yeah
that's my website now the video game so

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
that's my website now the video game so
 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.089
that's my website now the video game so
you play as a ghost who died hundreds of

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099
you play as a ghost who died hundreds of
 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.559
you play as a ghost who died hundreds of
years ago in this big old warehouse

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569
years ago in this big old warehouse
 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.300
years ago in this big old warehouse
building and it's been so long now since

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
building and it's been so long now since
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.710
building and it's been so long now since
you died that two things have happened

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720
you died that two things have happened
 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.660
you died that two things have happened
you've completely forgotten about your

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670
you've completely forgotten about your
 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.220
you've completely forgotten about your
past so you can't remember what your

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230
past so you can't remember what your
 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170
past so you can't remember what your
unfinished business is and the warehouse

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180
unfinished business is and the warehouse
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.610
unfinished business is and the warehouse
in which you've died has since been

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
in which you've died has since been
 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380
in which you've died has since been
converted into a block of trendy

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
converted into a block of trendy
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.970
converted into a block of trendy
apartments and so the gameplay would be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
apartments and so the gameplay would be
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.530
apartments and so the gameplay would be
that you'd be able to wander freely

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
that you'd be able to wander freely
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.059
that you'd be able to wander freely
around all of these people's apartments

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
around all of these people's apartments
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.430
around all of these people's apartments
observe their lives and then decide
