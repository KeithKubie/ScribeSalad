00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.730
We're told to solve and graph
the solution for the system of

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.050
equations right here.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.180
And the first thing that jumps
out at me, is that we might be

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.930
able to eliminate one
of the variables.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.510
And if we just focus on the x,
we have a 4x here and we have

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.530
a 2x right here.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.330
If we were to just add them
right now, we would get a 6x.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.740
So that wouldn't eliminate it.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.780
But if we can multiply this 2x
by negative 2, it'll become a

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.400
negative 4x, and then when you
add it, they would cancel out.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.050
So let's multiply this
equation, this second

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.510
equation, by negative 2.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.830
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation by

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.710
negative 2.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.350
And the whole motivation is
so that this 2x becomes a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.280
negative 4x.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.790
And, of course, I can't just
multiply only the 2x.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.010
Anything I do to the left-hand
side of the equation I have to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740
do to every term, and
I have to do to both

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.100
sides of the equation.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
So the second equation becomes
negative 4x-- that's negative

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.520
2 times 2x-- plus-- we have
negative 2 times negative y--

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.430
which is plus 2y is equal to 2.5
times negative 2, is equal

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.630
to negative 5.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.880
I just rewrote the second
equation, multiplying both

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.500
sides by negative 2.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160
Now, this top equation-- I'll
write it on the bottom now--

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.260
we have 4x minus 2y is
equal to positive 5.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.450
And now we can eliminate it.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.530
We can say, hey, look, the
negative 4x and the positive

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.900
4x should cancel out, or
they will cancel out.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.780
So let's add these
two equations.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.940
Let's add the left side to the
left side, the right side to

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.160
the right side, and we can
do that because these

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.100
two things are equal.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.060
We're doing the same thing to
both sides of the equation.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.450
So what do we get?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.340
If we take our negative 4x
plus our 4x, well, those

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.550
cancel out.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.810
So you're left with nothing.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.770
Maybe I could write a 0 there.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.410
0x if you want.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.160
And then you have your plus
2y and your negative 2y.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.370
Those also cancel out.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.530
So you're also left with 0y.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.460
And then that equals negative
5 plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.360
So this just simplifies to 0
equals 0, which is true, but

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.570
it's kind of bizarre.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.940
We had all these x's and y's.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.690
Everything canceled out.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.180
So let's explore this
a little bit more.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.950
Let's graph it and see what this
0 equals 0 is telling us

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.710
when we try to solve this
system of equations.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.150
So let me graph this top guy.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.920
I'll do it in blue.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.870
So right now it's in
standard form.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.280
Let's put it in slope-intercept
form.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.130
So we have 4x minus
2y is equal to 5.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's subtract 4x
from both sides.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.790
I want the x terms on
the right-hand side.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.950
So then I'm left with negative
2y is equal to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.990
negative 4x plus 5.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.140
Now we can divide both
sides by negative 2.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.170
And we are left with y is equal
to positive 2x, right,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.350
that's positive 2x, minus 2.5.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.950
So let's graph that.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.540
The y-intercept is
negative 2.5.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.330
So negative 2.5 right there, and
then it has a slope of 2.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.380
So if we move up 1, if we move
up in the x-direction, if we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.080
move to the right 1 in the
positive x-direction, we

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.300
will move up 2.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.340
So 1, 2.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.370
Right there.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.920
And if we were to do it again,
we move up 1, 2.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.630
Just like that.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.590
So the line's going to look
something like this.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.920
I'll try my best to draw
a straight line.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.170
This is the hardest part
about a lot of these

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.720
problems. There you go.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.900
So that's the top equation.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.370
Now, let me draw the
bottom equation.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.680
Let me draw and I'll do it
in this green color.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.980
So this bottom equation was 2x
minus y is equal to 2.5.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.240
And we can subtract 2x
from both sides.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.110
The left-hand side becomes
negative y is equal to 2x

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.270
plus-- or is equal to negative
2x plus 2.5.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.460
Now let's multiply or divide
both sides by negative 1.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.090
And you get y is equal to
positive 2x minus 2.5.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.080
And let's try to graph this, and
you already might notice

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.380
something interesting about
these two equations.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.480
You try to graph this, the
y-intercept is at negative

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.120
2.5, right there.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.550
The slope is 2.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.400
So it's going to be this
exact same line.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.320
And you saw that
algebraically.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.670
I didn't have to graph it.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.370
These two lines have the exact
same equation when you put

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.460
them in slope-intercept form.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.160
That's the first equation.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.850
That's the second equation.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.460
So what this 0 equals 0 is
telling us is actually that

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.815
these are the same line.

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:38.680
That these actually have an
infinite number of solutions.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.310
Any point on this line, which
is both of those lines, will

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.550
satisfy both of these
equations.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.290
You give me an arbitrary y,
solve for x in the top

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.930
equation, that x
and y will also

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.720
satisfy the bottom equation.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.970
So this actually has an infinite
number of solutions.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.490
These are the same line.
