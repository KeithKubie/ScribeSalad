00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.570
You should have clicked on 5,
negative 5, negative 1, and 1.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.420
Remember that adding a positive
moves us to the right and

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.230
adding a negative moves us to the left.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.720
So when you add a positive number
to another positive number,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.510
like in this example.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.880
You move to the right.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.750
So we start at 3 and
move to the right 2 to end at 5.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.680
Here we start with negative 3 and

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.170
since we're adding a negative we move
to the left 2 to end at negative 5.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.160
Here we also started with negative 3 but
we're adding a positive so

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.260
we move to the right 2.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.740
To end at negative 1.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.780
And here we start at positive 3 and
move to the left 2,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.779
since we're adding negative 2,
and we end at 1.
