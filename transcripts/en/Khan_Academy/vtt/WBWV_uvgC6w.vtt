00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.590
We're on problem 148.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.260
What is the lowest integer
that is the sum of three

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.570
different primes, each
greater than 20?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.480
So it's the lowest integer, so
we essentially just have to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.260
find the three primes
above 20.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.740
So let's see, 21 isn't
a prime, 22 isn't a

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.230
prime, 23 is a prime.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.080
24, no, 25, no, 26,
no, 27, 28, nope.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.640
29, that's prime.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.980
30 isn't, 31 is.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.670
31 plus 29 is 60 plus 23 is
83, and that is choice E.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.650
I hope I haven't missed any
primes, no, I don't think I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.570
have. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
I think I got all

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.650
the primes in there.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.210
What is the lowest integer of
the sum of three different

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.670
primes, each greater than 20?

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.780
Yep, that's the answer, E.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.480
Problem 149.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.720
The average of 6, 8, and 10
equals-- so the average of 6,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.010
8, and 10, so first of all,
what's the average

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.250
of 6, 8, and 10?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.070
Well, let's just do it.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.890
6 plus 8 plus 10.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.300
You could immediately see the
average is going to be 8,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.980
because you have 8 in the
middle, and both of these

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.590
numbers are 2 away from it.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.440
But that divided by 3 is
equal to 24 divided by

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.720
3 is equal to 8.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.510
And that's equal to the average
of 7 plus 9 plus x

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.420
over 3, so that tells us to
multiply both sides of this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.250
equation by 3, that says
that 24 is equal to--

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.480
what's 7 plus 9?

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
That's 16 plus x.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.590
Subtract 16 from both sides,
you get x is equal to 8.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.570
Choice C.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.510
And you could have said, OK, 7
and 9 or both half-- 8 is in

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.280
the middle, and they have to
average 8, so you might have

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.600
just been able to eyeball it and
say 8, but it didn't take

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.670
that much math, it's not that
much of a shortcut.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.260
Problem 150.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:05.290
If x is equal to minus 1, then x
to the fourth minus x to the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.240
third plus x squared, all
of that over x minus

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.290
1 is equal to what?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.670
x to the fourth is 1.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.930
x to the third is minus 1, but
then we're going to minus

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.050
that, so this whole thing is
going to be plus 1, and x

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.820
squared is plus 1.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.640
Negative 1 squared is 1.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.200
And you have minus 1 minus 1.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.300
So in the numerator you have
1, 2, 3, in the denominator

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.800
you have minus 2.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.680
Let's put the minus out
front, minus 3/2.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.930
That's choice A.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.080
Problem 151.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.240
A toy store regularly
sells all stock at a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.940
discount of 20% to 40%.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.680
If an additional 25% were
deducted from the discount

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.600
price during a special sale,
what would be the lowest

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.490
possible price of a toy costing

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.920
$16 before any discount?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.710
So we want to discount the
$16 as much as possible.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.430
So they say they're normally
discounting 20% to 40%, so if

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.140
you want to discount this as
much as possible, you want to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.420
discount this by 40%.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.280
So if you discount this by 40%,
that's the same thing as

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.410
saying it's going to be equal to
60% of its original price.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.440
So this would be the price after
being discounted by 40%,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.090
and then we would discount
by another 25%.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.160
Actually, I think it's easier
to go the other way.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.860
Well, let's just
do it this way.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.520
So we discount it by
another 25%, so we

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.710
multiply it by 3/4 again.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.320
If you discount by 25%, the
price is going to be 3/4 of

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.550
its original price.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.810
Actually, let's do
it as fractions.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.500
Fractions are always easier.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.220
60% percent of your
price is 3/5.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.070
If you discount by 2/5, or 40%,
that's the same thing as

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.290
multiplying by 3/5, and
then we're going

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.540
to multiply by 3/4.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.890
Set 25%.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.579
If you're discounting by 25%,
that's the same thing as being

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.360
worth 75% of your
original price.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.530
So what does that get us?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.130
16 divided by 4, 4, you get a 1,
and then you have 4 times 3

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:39.820
times 3, 4 times 9 is 36, over
5, which is equal to-- 5 goes

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.410
into 36 7 and 1/5.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.860
So $7.20.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.120
And that's choice B.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.090
Problem 152.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.250
The shaded portion of the
rectangular lot shown above

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.380
represents a flowerbed.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.450
OK, so let me draw this
rectangular lot.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.180
They drew this shaded portion
something like that, and I can

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.430
even color it in.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.150
So they say the shaded portion
of the rectangular lot shown

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.820
above represents a flowerbed.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.690
If the area of the bed is 24
square yards, and x is equal

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.060
to y plus 2, so they tell us
this side right here is x,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.370
which now they're telling
us is equal to y plus 2.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.555
And this right here is going
to be equal to y.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.870
Then z equals what? z is
this side right there.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.670
So if this area is 24, that
tells us that x times y

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.520
times 1/2 is 24.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.790
That's the area of that.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.360
So 1/2xy is equal to 24.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.820
Or you can even say that
xy is equal to 48.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.380
We know what xy is.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.380
We can just substitute for
x, so we get y plus

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.490
2, that's x, right?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.150
X is equal to y plus 2 times
y is equal to 48.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:28.210
And so we get y squared plus
2y is equal to 48.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.230
Or y squared plus 2y minus
48 is equal to 0.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.480
We could factor this
quadratic.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.800
What two numbers when you
multiply by minus 48, and you

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.180
add you get plus 6?

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:54.110
So y plus 8 times y minus 6 is
equal to 0, 8 times minus 6 is

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.410
minus 48, and then 8 minus 6 is
plus 2, so y could be equal

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.790
to minus 8 or plus 6, right?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.510
Whatever numbers make either
of these equal to zero.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.130
Well, we can't have a negative
distance, so y is not equal to

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.350
minus 8, so y is equal to 6.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.840
y is equal to 6, x
is equal to 8.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.530
Now, we can just confirm, 6
times 8 is 48 times 1/2 is

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.990
equal to 24.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.380
And now we can use the
Pythagorean theorem

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.400
to figure out z.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.670
So we'll get z squared
is equal to 36.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.920
That's y squared plus 64,
which is x squared, so z

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.520
squared is equal to 100.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.700
z is equal to 10.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.950
Choice E.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:46.520
Problem 153.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.810
Jack is now 14 years older than
Bill, so Jack is equal to

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.710
Bill plus 14.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:02.920
If in 10 years Jack will be
twice as old as Bill, so 2

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.980
times Bill's age, how old
will Jack be in 5 years?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.410
So they want to know j plus 5.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.470
That's how old Jack will
be in 5 years.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.220
So let's just try to
solve for Jack.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.560
This top equation tells us that
Bill is equal to Jack

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.900
minus 14, and then
we can substitute

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.560
this in for Bill here.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.409
So then this equation will
become Jack plus 10 is equal

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.840
to 2 times Jack minus 14.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:44.630
So Jack plus 10 is equal to
2 times Jack minus 28.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.120
If we subtract Jack from both
sides, you get 10 is equal to

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.690
Jack minus 28.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.030
We can add 28 to both
sides, and you get

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.890
38 is equal to Jack.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.190
So that's how old Jack is now.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.550
He's 38 years old.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.640
So how old is Jack going
to be in 5 years?

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.280
38 plus 5 is equal
to 43 years old.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.530
And I've clearly made a mistake,
because that's not

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.220
one of the options.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.080
So let's see where I'm
made an error.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.850
So Jack is now 14 years
older than Bill.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.990
Fair enough.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.570
So in 10 years, Jack will be
twice-- oh, I see my mistake.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.200
He's going to be twice
as old as Bill is

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.100
going to be in 10 years.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.760
That was a bone-headed
mistake.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.780
So let me clear all of this.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.015
That was a bad mistake.

00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:34.580
I shouldn't have made it.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.070
I'm lucky that they didn't have
what I put down as one of

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.230
the choices, and I would've
gotten it wrong.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.060
All right.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.350
So we know that in 10 years,
Jack is going to be 2 times

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.900
what Bill is going to
be in 10 years.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.290
That was my mistake.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.900
So now let's see
what we can do.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.400
We'll use that same information
up there, so Bill

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.330
is equal to Jack minus 14.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.220
Substitute that information
here, so we get Jack plus 10

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:09.350
is equal to 2 times Jack minus
14, instead of Bill, plus 10.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.655
So you get Jack plus 10 is
equal to 2 times Jack.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:18.450
Let's see, minus 14 plus 10,
that's minus 4, so Jack plus

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.490
10 is equal to 2 times
Jack minus 8.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.470
Let's subtract Jack
from both sides.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.830
10 is equal to Jack minus 8.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.300
Let's add 8 to both sides.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.816
You get 18 is equal to Jack.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:35.030
So that's how old Jack is
right now, he's 18.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.060
So in five years, Jack is going
to be 18 plus 5, which

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.250
is 23 years old, choice D.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.190
And I'm out of time.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.010
See you in the next video.
