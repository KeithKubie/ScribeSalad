MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.310
Welcome to Root Access, the show
on Google Developers Live

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830
about startups.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.990
My name is Martin Omander, and
I'm joined here today by Don

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.030
Dodge, Googler, long-time
investor, and startup

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.400
evangelist.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.390
We're going to have a series of
discussions about new hot

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.590
technologies.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.940
And today we're going to talk
about indoor location.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.930
Don, you've invested in indoor
location startups.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.470
There have been some recent
acquisitions.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.960
What's this indoor location
all about?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.830
What are the use cases?

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.910
DON DODGE: Yeah, so indoor
location has gotten a lot of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.300
attention recently, because
there have been three

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.900
high-profile acquisitions
in this space.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.620
Apple acquired WiFiSLAM.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.990
Ruckus networks acquired one,
and there was a third one that

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.910
was acquired.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.240
So it's getting a lot of
attention from investors and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.570
technologists about, hey,
what's going on here?

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.640
What's going on is, because of
the emergence of smartphones,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.290
everyone has a computer in their
pocket that's capable of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.050
displaying a map, and it has a
built-in GPS, and a built-in

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.780
Wi-Fi, and a built-in
Bluetooth.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.870
Those technologies can be used
to locate you indoors.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.100
So GPS and Maps work
great outdoors.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.300
But we spend 90% of
our time indoors.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.910
So inside an office building,
inside a shopping mall, inside

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.170
a college dorm or wherever,
GPS doesn't work, so Maps

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.440
don't help.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.520
And these indoor location
technologies do work indoors

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.830
and open up all sorts
of opportunities.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.635
So that's why it's a hot
trend right now.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:01:59.946
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right.

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.540
So that's why we're seeing it
now and not five years ago?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.520
Because we all have
smartphones?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.820
DON DODGE: Right.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.020
The technology has been
around for a while.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.940
But the ability to use it
really depends on the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.560
smartphone and the built-in
sensors in the smartphone, the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.440
Wi-Fi radios and Bluetooth
and GPS.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.960
All of those things together
make it possible to be able to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.910
do indoor location with
technologies that have been

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.150
around for a while.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.520
MARTIN OMANDER: So I know
what building I'm in.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.810
I entered by the front
door here today.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.770
How can knowing exactly where
in the building I am help me

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.700
or others around me?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.050
DON DODGE: Well, first,
how would it work?

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.120
So there would be a little
sensor on the front

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.700
door when you enter.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.590
So that's what's known
as a truth point.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.100
From that truth point, you can
use a variety of technologies

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.820
to determine where you
are in the building.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.420
So it could use the
accelerometer, or the gyro, or

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.540
the compass, or other sensors
that are built into your phone

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.560
to count the steps and direction
from that known

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.740
truth point.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.500
Or when you enter the building,
it has Wi-Fi, so

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.260
your smartphone picks up the
Wi-Fi signals and can

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.090
triangulate from those signals
where you are in the building.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.230
Or it could use Bluetooth,
low-energy type beacons that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.540
are on the wall or in
the ceiling to help

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.370
navigate where you are.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.320
Another approach is something
called ByteLight.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.610
It uses LED lights that pulse.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.390
And the pulses in those lights
are so fast the human eye

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.110
can't see them, but when you're
holding your smartphone

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.510
in your hand, there's a
front-facing camera.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.680
That camera picks up the pulses
and can identify which

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.510
light is emitting that pulse
and, therefore, triangulate

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.810
where you are.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.100
So that's a quick overview of
some of the technologies that

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.730
are used and how they work.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.070
But now that you know
how they work, how

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.300
would a user use them?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.620
Or what applications of this
technology are there?

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.430
Well, the obvious ones are
things like retailers and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.779
supermarkets and that
sort of thing.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.200
Let's say you have a shopping
list for the grocery store,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.090
and it has 30 items on it.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.050
If you're like me, you've gone
through the store, and you get

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.680
27 of the 30 items, and then you
have to backtrack to find

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.470
the last three, like
where are they?

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.700
You somehow missed them.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.890
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, yes.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.710
Been there, done that, yes.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.800
DON DODGE: So you could use this
to put your shopping list

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.510
in your phone, and then the
phone would create a map for

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.890
you and tell you exactly
where each of those

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.160
products are on the shelf.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.300
Or if you're in a retail
location like Walmart or

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.370
Lowe's or Walgreens where they
have thousands of SKUs, you

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.950
could do a search for "tell me
where the Gucci bags are," or

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.790
"tell me where the spaghetti
is," and it will take you

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.260
right to that point.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.250
So you could use them
in those ways.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.210
Social applications.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.970
You want to know where
your friends are.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.170
You're at a concert
or you're at a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.640
conference with 5,000 people.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.530
And you know you have
10 friends there,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.540
but where are they?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.670
You can't find them.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.580
Well, with indoor location, you
can type in the name of

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.680
that friend.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.360
They accept that they want you
to be able to know where they

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.100
are, and then, boom, on
the map it shows you

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.320
exactly where they are.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.690
Or if you take your family to
the shopping mall, and your

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.460
kids are running off in other
directions, and you go this

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.080
way, and the spouse goes the
other way, on a map you can

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.880
actually see where you are.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.150
So there are all kinds of
different applications of the

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.590
technology and many more that
we haven't thought of that

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.540
will come up in the future.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.975
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:55.720
Because it's still early
days, it sounds like.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.520
DON DODGE: Very early days.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.750
This is why it's a hot topic and
a hot trend, because it's

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.060
a technology that's enabling
all kinds of applications.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.950
And just like GPS or Maps, I
remember when they were first

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.220
introduced 15 years ago.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.880
No one really understood
how they would be used.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.600
And now, they're ubiquitous.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.310
They're in all kinds
of applications.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.860
MARTIN OMANDER: And we can't
live without them.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.550
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.220
The same is going to happen
with indoor location.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.840
There are a few businesses and
use cases that we can clearly

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040
understand, but there will be
hundreds more that will evolve

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.986
that we just haven't
thought of.

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:31.940
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.750
So you mentioned there were
a number of different

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.800
technologies here at play.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.710
Will one of them become the
standard in a couple of years?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.250
DON DODGE: Perhaps, but I don't
think so, because there

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.160
are a variety of different ways
to approach the problem.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.750
So Wi-Fi is one place,
Bluetooth, lights in the

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.300
ceiling, sound sensors,
beacons.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.770
There are all these different
technical approaches.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.140
They each have their advantages
and disadvantages,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:11.370
and they sort of depend on cost
of infrastructure versus

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.160
low cost or accuracy.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.390
So if you want to be accurate
to within one foot or one

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.160
meter, those technologies are
going to cost a little less

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.690
than technologies that
can do it within 3

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.250
meters or 10 meters.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.210
So there's a cost versus
accuracy thing.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.520
There's also an open and
ubiquitous versus private and

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.050
proprietary.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.430
So some applications don't
care about being open and

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.000
ubiquitous.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.680
They're very specific
applications for a retail

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.970
store or for a venue
or whatever.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.340
And there are others that care
more about being open.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.230
So it depends.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.640
The short answer is no, I don't
think that there will be

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.240
one or two leaders.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.655
I think there will be probably
20 different companies who

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:56.940
will be successful
in this area.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.360
MARTIN OMANDER: Wow.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.530
It will be interesting to see
how that shakes out over the

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.890
next couple of years.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.280
DON DODGE: That's why it's a hot
trend and a topic we need

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.990
to talk about.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.660
MARTIN OMANDER: Hot trend and a
topic we need to talk about.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.040
Good.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.140
Thanks, Don.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.690
That's all for today.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.670
Thank you for joining us.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.930
