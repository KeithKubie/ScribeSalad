00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.430
We're on problem 67.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.690
They ask us how many terms of
the binomial expansion of x

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.000
squared plus 2y to
the third to the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.500
twentieth power contain?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.890
And so right when you see, oh
my god, to the twentieth

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.760
power, that will take me forever
to do, and then I'll

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.930
have to count the terms. But
remember, they're just asking

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.650
you how many terms.
They're not asking

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.890
you to find the expansion.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.370
So you just have to say, oh boy,
let me just think about

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.390
this a little bit.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.560
And think of it this way: x plus
y to the first power has

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.240
how many terms?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.030
It has-- well it's
just x plus y.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.910
And so it has 2 terms.
x plus y, squared.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.510
That is equal to x squared
plus 2xy plus y squared.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.910
So that has 3 terms. If I were
to do x plus e The third

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.850
power, I could do a binomial
expansion, I could do it with

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.900
Pascal's Triangle.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.970
Let me do it with Pascal's
Triangle.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.980
I have the 1 and the 1.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.240
That's to the first power.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.709
The second power, those
are the coefficients.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.030
The third power, the
coefficients become 1, 3--

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.220
because 1 plus 2 is 3-- 3, 1.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.070
And actually I don't even
have to expand it out.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590
Ill do it just for a
little practice.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:24.880
It x to the third plus 3x
squared y plus 3xy squared

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.920
plus y to the third.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.040
I just used these.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.750
But when you take any binomial
and you take it to the third

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.100
power, you end up with 4 terms.
And depending on how

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.520
you think of it, if you think of
it with Pascal's Triangle,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.450
every time we go down we're
just going to be adding

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.150
another term.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.910
When we take the fourth power
it's going to have 5 terms. Or

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.450
when you think about, when we
use the binomial expansion,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.620
and you might want to watch
some videos on that.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.090
There you also have, if you're
taking it to the nth power,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.400
you end up with n
plus 1 terms.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.380
So in this example, we have a
binomial-- a binomial just

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.130
means a two-term polynomial.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.090
And we're taking it to
the twentieth power.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.900
If we were taking it to third
power, we'd have four terms.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.320
If we were taking it to the
fourth power, we'd have 5

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.570
terms. So if we're taking it to
the twentieth power, we're

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.390
going to have 21 terms.
And that's choice B.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.640
Next problem.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.890
All right, they want us to keep
doing these and we'll do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.200
it because they want us to.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.540
All right, what are the first
four terms of the expansion of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
1 plus 2x to the sixth power?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.750
And here we'll just use the
binomial expansion because I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.350
think that's what they
want us to do.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350
And that's probably the
fastest way to do it.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.210
So let's just think of the
coefficients first. So this is

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.580
going to be-- well
let's just do it.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.920
This is going to be equal
to 6 choose 0.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.070
We're just going to do the first
four terms. Times 1 to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.320
the 6 times 2x to the 0-- so I
don't have to write that--

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.965
plus 6 choose 1.

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:05.880
And actually, we'll probably
just have to figure out the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.330
third term because that's
the only time where

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.380
they start to change.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:21.200
6 choose 1 times 1 to the fifth
power times 2x to the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.210
first power, times 2x.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.390
Plus 6 choose 2 times-- I mean
these 1s, it doesn't matter

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.200
what power it is-- 1 to the
fourth times 2x squared plus--

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.330
let's see, they want the first
so let's do the last one-- 6

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.400
choose 3 times 1 to the third--
you have to decrement

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.470
the 1 every time-- times
2x to the third.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.180
All right, and if we look
at the choices,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.740
just to save time.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.560
If we look at a choices, OK, we
agree that the first term

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.470
is going to be 1.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.220
So that, we can definitely say
is going to be 1 because all

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.910
the choices are 1.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.640
The second term is definitely
going to be 12x.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.050
And then we start getting
some disagreement

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.075
on the third term.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.180
So let's see what
the third term.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.460
6 choose to that's equal to 6
back toward ill over to affect

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.700
or you over fix minus is too
fact or you scroll down a

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.380
little bit so that is equal to
6 factorial, which is 6 times

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.770
5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.730
But the 1 doesn't
change anything.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.350
Divided by 2 factorial, which
is 2 times 1, or just 2.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.510
Divided by 6 minus 2 factorial,
that's 4 factorial.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.530
Royal So times 4 times
3 times 2 times 1.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.420
That cancels out with that.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.300
The 2 and the 6 cancel out.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.030
You get 3.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.830
So you end up with 3 times 5.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.200
So the 6 choose 2 becomes 15,
3 times 5, that's 15.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.300
Times 1 to the fourth, which
is 1, times 2x squared.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.780
So times 4x squared.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.020
And so that's 15 times 4,
that's 60x squared.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.720
So the third term is going
to be 60x squared.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.700
And we're done.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.760
Choice D is the only one
that has 60x squared

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.580
as the third term.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.930
So we're done.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.120
We didn't even have to go
to the fourth term.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.770
So, by carefully looking at the
choices we actually only

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.120
have to evaluate one
of the terms.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.370
Next problem.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.230
Let's see.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.780
All right.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.830
Problem 69.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:46.750
They say-- let me copy and paste
it-- what is the sum of

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.310
the infinite geometric series,
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 all the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.940
way up there.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.990
I'll be frank.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.940
I do now remember the formula.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.030
But a lot of times in life you
might forget the formula.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.050
And there's a trick
is to re-proving

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.280
the formula for yourself.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.800
Just in case you forget
it when you're 32

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.390
years old like me.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.700
So let's say that I'm trying to
find the infinite sum of a

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.690
geometric series.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.380
So let's say that the sum-- and
I'm going to re-prove it

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.800
right here in the midst of this
test. And I've done this

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.730
in midst of tests and
it's saved me.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.830
So it's nice to know
the proof.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.425
And it actually impresses
people, if you know people who

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:21.930
are impressed by proofs.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.530
So let's say the sum is equal to
a to the 0-- well actually

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.930
let's say-- well, see
this is interesting.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.370
Because they're starting
at 1/2.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.910
Actually let's just do
the concrete numbers.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.150
Because we want to figure
out this exact sum.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.820
So let's say that the sum is
equal to 1/2 to the 1 1/2

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.170
squared plus 1/2 to the third--
it's the whole 1/2 to

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.360
the third-- plus-- and
you just keep going.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.570
Fair enough.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.460
Now let's take 1/2
times the sum.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.310
So 1/2 times this.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.810
What is this equal to?

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.500
Well if I took 1/2 times this
whole thing, now 1/2, I would

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.800
have to distribute it over each
of these terms. So 1/2

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.350
times this term, times this
first term, 1/2 times 1/2 to

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.510
the first, well that's now
going to be 1/2 squared.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.570
1/2 squared.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.291
All I did is I'm distributing
this 1/2 times each of the

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.590
terms. 1/2 times 1/2 to the
first. That's 1/2 squared.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.820
Now 1/2 times 1/2 squared, well
that's going to be 1/2 to

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.450
the third power.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.830
And it just keeps going.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.420
It's an infinite series.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.710
So let me ask you something.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.840
If I subtracted this from
that, what do I get?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.900
Let's see what I get.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.770
So I get S minus 1/2 S-- I'm
subtracting that from that--

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.420
is equal to this minus this.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.490
Well if I'm subtracting the
green stuff from the yellow

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.810
stuff, this is going to cancel
out with that, that's going to

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.820
cancel out with that.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.980
And all I'm going to be
left with is this

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.210
first thing right here.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.900
That's the trick.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.850
And you could prove it generally
for any base.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.980
And I thought it was interesting
because a lot of

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.710
times they start with
the 0th power.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.140
And this problem was interesting
because they start

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.775
with 1/2 to the first power.

00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:10.160
So anyway let's figure it out.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.970
S minus 1/2 S, well
that's just 1/2 S.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.810
1/2 S is equal to 1/2.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.380
And then you have S is-- divided
both sides by 1/2 or

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.520
multiply both sides by 2 and
you get-- S is equal to 1.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.540
Now, a lot of you may know
there is a formula.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.309
Let me tell you what
the formula says.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.890
The formula that you may or may
not have memorized, is if

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:43.840
you start at n is equal to 0 and
if you go to infinity of a

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.950
to the n-- in this case a is
1/2-- this is going to be

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.210
equal to 1 over 1 minus a.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.950
So your natural reaction would
have been, oh OK, well that

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.640
sum that we saw, that's equal to
the sum of n is equal to 0

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.860
to infinity of 1/2 to the n,
which would be equal to 1 over

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.180
1 minus 1/2.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.670
What's that?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.130
1 minus 1, that's 1 over 1/2,
which would be equal to 2.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.200
And you'd be like, my God, what
did I do wrong there?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.580
And I'll show you what
you did wrong.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.110
This sum that you took the sum
of-- remember n is starting at

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:27.600
0-- so this sum that sums up to
2 is 1/2 to 0 is 1 plus 1/2

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:35.030
to the 1, 1/2, plus 1/2 squared,
1/4, plus 1/8, so on

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.080
and so forth.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.380
That is equal to 2.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.780
This problem-- and that's why it
was a little tricky-- this

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.330
problem, they didn't want this
sum, they wanted this sum.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:52.020
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus,
so forth and so on.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.000
So they wanted everything
but this 1.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.230
So if you subtracted this 1 from
both sides then you would

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.040
say, oh this sum must be equal
to 1, which is the answer we

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.400
got that way.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.140
So that's why sometimes,
memorizing formulas, this

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.350
formula's a nice formula to
memorize, it's very simple.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.430
But it sometimes becomes really
confusing when you're

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.630
like, oh boy, but this is when
n starts 0 but what happens

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.810
when n starts at 1.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.900
And to some degree I really like
this problem because it's

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.940
testing you to see if you really
understand what the

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.450
formula's all about.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.480
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
