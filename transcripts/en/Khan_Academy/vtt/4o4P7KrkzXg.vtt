00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.590
We've now laid the groundwork
so we can express this surface

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.390
integral, which is
the right-hand side

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.430
of the way we've
written Stokes' theorem.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.020
We can now express this
as a double integral

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.442
over the domain of the
parameters that we care about.

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:17.150
And we're going to do
that in this video.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.270
And then in the next
series of videos,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.310
we'll do the same thing
for this expression.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.560
We're actually going to do
that using Green's theorem.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.730
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.938
to see we're going to get
the same expressions, which

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:28.910
will show us that
Stokes' theorem is true,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.487
at least for this
special class of surfaces

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:32.820
that we are studying right here.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.510
But they're pretty general.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.894
Now let's now try to do that.

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:38.310
So our surface
integral-- I'm just

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.560
going to rewrite it down here.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.800
It's the surface integral,
so over our surface

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.920
of the curl of f.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.970
Actually, let me go
a little bit lower.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:57.420
So we have our surface integral
of the curl of F dot ds.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.390
Well, we've already figured
out what our curl of F

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.060
is here two videos ago.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.250
And we've almost
figured out what ds is.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.660
ds is the cross product of
these two vectors times dA.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.290
The cross product
of these two vectors

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.780
is this right over here.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.330
So we could just
write that ds is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.570
going to be equal to
this thing times dA.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.470
This is the cross
product of the partial

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.490
of r with respect to x and the
partial of r with respect to y.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.780
And then we have to multiply
that times dA right over there.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.995
So this expression is
just going to be the dot

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:36.140
product of the curl of F, which
is this stuff up here dotted

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.720
with this stuff down here.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.530
And essentially, we're
going to take the dot

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.620
product of this
vector and that vector

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.840
and then multiply it times
this-- we can actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840
consider this to
be a scalar value.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.870
So let's do that.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.940
So this is going to
be equal to-- and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.090
when we do this, all
of these we are now

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.490
going to start operating in
the domain of our parameters.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850
So it's going to turn
from a surface integral

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.280
into a double integral
over that domain,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.560
over that region
that we care about.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.760
This is the domain of our
parameters, this region R.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.163
And this is how we've
manipulated any of the surface

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:10.830
integrals that we've
come across so far.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.430
We've turned them
into double integrals

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.440
over the domain
of the parameters.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.240
So this is going to turn into a
double integral over the domain

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.720
of our parameters, which is
the region R. It's the region

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.120
R in the xy plane right up here.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.610
And now we can take the dot
product of the curl of F

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.062
with dotted ds, which is all of
this business right over here.

00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:32.770
And let me see if I
can show both of them

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.330
on the screen at the same time.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.260
There you go.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.790
So first let's think
about the x components.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.260
So you have that
right over there.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.830
And then you have
this right over here.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.925
You multiply the two.

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:47.091
The negative we can swap
the order right over there.

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.225
You have the partial of z
with respect to x times--

00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:53.350
and we're going to swap
this order right over here.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.350
The partial of Q with respect
to z minus the partial of R

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.150
with respect to y.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.780
Now let's think about
the j component.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.750
You have negative z sub y
times all of this up here,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.330
at least the stuff that's
multiplied times the j

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.430
component.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.350
This negative can cancel out
with that negative, so you have

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.800
plus z sub y, the partial
of z with respect to y,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.790
times the partial
of R with respect

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.800
to x minus the partial
of P with respect to z.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.360
Let me make that clear, that
is an R right over here.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.265
And then we have
the k component.

00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.890
And the k component is actually
the easiest because it's just 1

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.490
here.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.380
So it's just going
to be 1 times--

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.720
and I'll just do it in
that same color-- 1 times

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.390
the partial of Q with respect
to x minus the partial of P

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.540
with respect to y.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.170
And then finally, we just
have this dA over here.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.690
And this dA is
multiplied by everything.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.840
So we'll put some parentheses,
and we'll write dA.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.790
So we're done.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.430
We've expressed our surface
integral as a double integral

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.929
over the domain
of our parameters.

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.970
And what we're going to
do in the next few videos

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.178
is do the same thing with
this using Green's theorem.

00:04:07.178 --> 00:04:10.760
And we're going to see that
we get the exact same value.
