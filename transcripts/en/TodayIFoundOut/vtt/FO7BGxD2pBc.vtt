00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:17.380
Did the Makers of Barbie Really Used to Sell
a Doll Whose Breasts Grew When Her Arm Rotated?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.250
It was 1975 and the doll was called “Growing
Up Skipper”.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.949
When you rotated her arm, she grew an inch
taller and her small breasts grew out of her

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.070
plastic chest.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.749
She could return to her pre-pubescent self
simply by rotating the arm back the way it

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.749
was.

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:37.930
Mattel created the original Skipper doll in
1964, in response to requests of Barbie fans

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.370
wanting Barbie to have children of her own.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.080
Given how Skipper eventually turned out, one
would think the next logical step after the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.480
request for mother-Barbie would have been
the creation of a Barbie doll where she grew

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.400
bigger breasts and a pregnant belly when her
arm was rotated, but that would ruin Barbie’s

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.830
figure now wouldn’t it?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.910
Apparently not wanting to create “Knocked
Up Barbie”, Mattel created Skipper Roberts,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.350
Barbie’s younger sister.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.000
The idea was that Barbie would babysit Skipper,
who in turn, would bring out all the maternal

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.310
qualities Barbie could muster, without ruining
the blonde beauty’s flawless figure.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.310
Vintage Skipper
Vintage Skipper

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.860
The original Skipper actually did not come
with the magic rotating arm that lead her

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.140
through the gateways of puberty in less than
one second flat.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.140
She was supposed to be young enough that Barbie
had to babysit her and, when she was first

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.020
released, her appearance matched her imaginary
age.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.280
Barbie stood 11.5 inches tall, Skipper was
only 9.25 inches tall and flat chested.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.580
Although there were many different versions
of Skipper between 1964 and 1975, including

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.820
“Skipper on Wheels” in 1965 and “The
Sun Set Mailbu Skipper” in 1972, she remained

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.450
Barbie’s younger sister and avoided the
oversexualization that plagued her older sibling.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.640
The 1975 “Growing Up Skipper” doll was
the beginning of the end for Skipper and her

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.960
reason for being.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.270
And it did not take long.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620
By 1979 Skipper was pretty much unrecognizable.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.310
Now called “Super Teen Skipper” children
no longer had to rotate her arm to make Skipper’s

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.310
breasts appear.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.239
Skipper now came with small, permanent breasts
and her face had changed to make her appear

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.239
older.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.560
In keeping with the oversexualization theme
of Barbie dolls, in 1985 Mattel released “Hot

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560
Stuff Skipper”.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.489
Keep in mind that this doll is designed to
be only in her early teen years, which makes

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.409
the whole “hot stuff” thing even slightly
more creepy than the “growing breasts”

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.409
version.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.709
1988 brought us “Teen Fun Skipper”.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.370
By now Skipper appeared to be between 13 and
15 years of age.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.579
Her breasts were larger, her waist more flexible
and her body taller.

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.329
But she was not done growing.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.930
In 1997 “Teen Skipper” was born.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.790
She was taller and her breasts had grown even
larger.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.590
She was now almost as tall as Barbie and pretty
much the same age.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.260
Between 1975 and present, Skipper’s looks
have changed dramatically and presently she

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.439
is just as tall, just as developed and just
as oversexualized as her older sister.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.680
In fact, they are now both teenagers of about
the same age.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.980
What?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.189
Barbie hasn’t aged one bit and Skipper has
gone from a pre-pubescent little sister that

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.939
Barbie had to babysit to pretty much Barbie’s
fraternal twin sister?

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:20.230
Oh Mattel, you must have forgotten why you
created Skipper in the first place.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.299
The most common criticism of Barbie is that
she promotes an unrealistic body image for

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.700
young girls and women.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.099
Barbie’s non-plastic dimensions would be
36 inch chest, 18 inch waist and 33 inch hips.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.330
She would be 5’9″ tall but would weigh
only 110 pounds and would lack the 17 – 22

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.689
percent body weight required for women to
menstruate (perhaps why “Knocked Up Barbie”

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.069
hasn’t happened yet, or maybe the lack of
genitalia… on herself or Ken).

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.280
So yes, unrealistic, but, ironically given
Marilyn Monroe is often touted as a realistic

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.319
body image for women to aspire to, Barbie
is not that far off Marilyn Monroe’s 35,

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:05.889
22, 35 dimensions and 5 ft. 5.5 inches or
Elizabeth Hurley’s 34, 24, 34 at 5 ft. 10

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:06.889
in.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:13.370
So Barbie’s figure is essentially a slightly
Photoshopped Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Hurley.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.919
Barbie was invented by the co-founder of Mattel,
Ruth Handler in 1959.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.000
She got the idea for Barbie after watching
her daughter play with paper dolls and seeing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.360
that she enjoyed giving them adult roles.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.330
At this time, most dolls were made in an infants’
likeness.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.449
She suggested the idea of an adult-bodied
doll to her husband and Mattel co-founder,

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.599
Elliot, who was not at all enthused about
the idea.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.510
Nor were Mattel’s directors.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.830
On a trip to Germany in 1956 Ruth saw an adult-bodied
doll named Bild Lilli.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.150
Being that this was exactly what Ruth had
in mind for her doll design, she bought three

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.150
of them.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.389
She gave one to her daughter to play with
and brought the other two to Mattel.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:05:08.379
Needless to say, the execs were eventually
sold on the idea.
