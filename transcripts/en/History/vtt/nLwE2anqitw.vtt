00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.750
You look at that side,
and I'll look at this side.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.380
OK, sounds good.
What was that?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.040
alligator.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.830
Oh, it's a big
son-of-a-bitch, ain't it?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.420
This is not good.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.540
This is where
we're going to start.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.500
We need specialty stuff
for this order, man.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.330
But you don't find it
laying on the shore.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.540
It's a stump.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.420
NARRATOR: The Swampman's
looking for specialty

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.750
wood, ornamental pieces
for the bar tops.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.540
You ready?

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.580
Oh, yeah, I'm ready.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.290
Let's do it.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.380
NARRATOR: But in the swamp,
ain't nothing come easy.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.830
So to get 'em, they'll
have to get a little wet.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.620
We've got to get in the
water, swim with the gators.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.540
Here we go!

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.330
NARRATOR: Now, an
old swamp trick

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.040
is to use your feet to find
the logs on the river bottom.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.000
Here's one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.210
And Shelby's a master at it.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.290
Come here, come here.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.170
Put your foot on this.
Right here.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.420
Jump on it.
See it bob?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.250
- I see that.
- Jump on it.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.670
See it?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.620
So it's got to at least
be eight foot long.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.460
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.080
They got a noise them alligators
make that sound like this--

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.210
[imitating alligator] When
I hear that damn sound,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.750
it's time to get [bleep] out
of the water, for damn sure.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.210
[bleep]
Come here.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.290
Let me show you something.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.420
See where the alligator's been
laying up there on the bank?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.620
I've never seen
an alligator trail.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.460
See how it's all split tracks?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.380
That's where an
alligator's been laying.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.790
All right, let's go.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.620
Let's see if we can find
anything in that log,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.500
and see if we can pick it up.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.790
NARRATOR: Now when you come
a'knockin' on a gator's front

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.080
door, you best hope he ain't
home, because they don't take

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.580
kindly to trespassers.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.080
That's the end of it?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.790
Yep.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.250
Pretty long.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460
Let me get it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.420
All right.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.380
Ah!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.290
There's a hook on this one--

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.790
[nervous laugh]

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.500
Where are you at?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.330
Shelby?

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.880
[bleep] You scared
the hell out of me!

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.460
It might be too
much in the mud.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.380
Well, that's not good.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.330
I went down to get
that log, and Angela

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.000
thought an alligator got me.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Spooked the hell out of her.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.500
The Alligator Alley
does that to folks.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.670
NARRATOR: Now, there's an
old expression in the swamp--

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.250
You hear that?

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.330
Yeah.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.210
NARRATOR: If at first
you don't succeed,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.170
pray them gators stay
away a little longer.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.250
It's quiet out there, man.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.000
It's too quiet.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.210
One thing you don't want to hear
in Alligator Alley is nothing.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.790
[screaming]

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.750
A limb got betwixt my toenails
and pulled it backwards.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.120
I've been using my feet
for years to find logs.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.670
[bleep] tear your
damned toenails off.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.120
Is that meat or a worm?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.710
It's part of your dead
skin from when your toe got--

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.670
[bleep]

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.000
Oh my god!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.790
Oh man!

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.580
- Found one.
- Did you?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.080
Found something.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.120
Pick it up and see.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.380
I can't.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.420
It's too big.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.750
It's right here, right
where I'm standing.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880
Oh, god!

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.080
[laughing]

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.040
Son of a bitch, you scared
the [bleep] out of me.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.500
That's really neat.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.290
Yeah, that girl's
good, junior.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.420
Man, she's already finding
logs with her feet.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.420
Is it pretty?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.580
Yes, it's pretty.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.670
NARRATOR: Now the
Alley may have gators,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.670
but once you work
your way past them,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.960
it's also got plenty of
prime logs for the picking.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.670
- Oh man.
- Nice!

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.920
That's it, junior.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.290
Got a damn load now.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.710
Go back to land now.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.120
Get in.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.620
Man, we found a bunch
of them down here.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.620
We got all the
special wood we need.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.040
I'm close on this order, man.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.080
Let's go, Shelby.
