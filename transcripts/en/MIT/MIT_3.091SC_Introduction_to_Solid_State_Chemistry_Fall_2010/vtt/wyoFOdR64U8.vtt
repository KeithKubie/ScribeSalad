00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.700
PROFESSOR: Settle down.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.160
Settle down.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.780
Settle down.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.890
All right, first announcement
is the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.960
celebration of learning.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.460
Reminding you that the
celebration of learning is a

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.710
week from today.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.340
Go to your assigned rooms. A
through Ha will write in here.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.530
This group will go
into 26-100.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.060
And the last group
over to 4-270.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.810
And you will take with you your
periodic table, table of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.720
constants, aid sheet, something
to write with.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.430
And we'll give you paper.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.760
You'll write on the
exam paper itself.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.840
And I'll say more about test
taking strategies on Monday.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.330
Coverage will be right
up through Monday.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.810
With emphasis obviously on the
material that you've had some

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.790
time to digest. And there will
be no weekly quiz next week.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.510
So let's get right
into the lesson.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.440
Last day we looked at Louis,
who gave us the notion of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.210
achieving octet stability
by electron sharing.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.790
And that led to the concept
of covalent bonds.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.860
And then Pauling helped us
understand the energetics of

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.680
covalent bonding by putting
forth the idea in a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.640
heteronuclear molecule
there's unequal

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.330
sharing of the electrons.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.180
And out of that emerged the
concept of polar covalency and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.930
the definition of
electronegativity.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.180
And on the slide you see how
electronegativity varies

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.840
across the periodic table.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.470
Electronegativity being a
measure of the pull an atom

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.840
has for electrons within
a covalent bond.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.000
And as you would expect, the
non metals which are good

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.960
electronic receptors are also
the ones that have the highest

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
electronegativity.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.300
And the metals, over here, which
are good electron donors

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.280
are those that have the
the lowest value of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.430
electronegativity.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.860
And Pauling was quantitative in
his formulation and gave us

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.280
this equation that tells us how
to measure the energy of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.490
the x-y covalent bond.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.580
If x is not equal to y, then
axiomatically this is going to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.100
be a polar covalent bond.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.760
And you take the geometric
mean of the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.980
homonuclear bond energies.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.110
This is x-x bond energy
in x two.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.460
This is the y-y bond
energy in y two.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.840
You take the product square
root of which.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.610
And then the partial ionic
character, this is the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.840
contribution to unequal sharing
of the electrons.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080
You take the square of
the difference in the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.100
electonegativities of
the two elements.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.350
And the 96.3 is a factor that
allows you to get the overall

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.700
quantity in kilojoules
per mole.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.480
So you need these numbers
in kilojoules per mole.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.750
And we further had a formula
for the percent ionic

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.370
character, which you can get by
looking at the difference

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.030
in electronegativity.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.690
And then through this formula,
you end up with a scale that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.180
runs from 0 to 100%.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.090
And just by way of example,
we had a look at H-F.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.670
We spent a fair bit
of time on that.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.240
Obviously, it's a heteronuclear
molecule.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.770
We calculated its bond
energy and so on.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.640
And then to indicate
polar covalency, we

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.470
use the dipole notation.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.160
The dipole shown here.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.150
It's just an oval.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.400
It's net neutral.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.020
But the charge is not uniformly
distributed.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.220
You see one end is a little
more negative.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.920
The other end is a little
more positive.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.890
Sometimes people write lowercase
Greek delta,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.530
indicating little bit negative
here, a little bit positive

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.940
here, net neutral.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.200
There's the arrow indicating
the dipole.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.880
And furthermore, we argue that
this is a polar bond.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.620
And since this is just a
molecule with the two atoms,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.370
then this is also a
polar molecule.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.805
Which means it has a
net dipole moment.

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:37.260
And I made some observations
about dipole moments and the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.790
ability to store energy
capacitively.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.940
And how you'd go about finding
a really good capacitor.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.870
And so that all came out of the
desire to find something

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.540
that has a net dipole moment.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.600
And I want to continue
that conversation.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.570
And so I want to look at
some other elements.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.130
And what I want to look
at in particular is

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.150
the compound methane.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.760
Let's look at methane from this
new found appreciation of

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.780
polar covalency.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.870
So first thing I want to do is
to put it's structure up.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.770
We've gone through the Louis
notation and the structure.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.980
It forms sp3 hybrids.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.950
And you end up with a structure

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.930
that looks like this.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.700
These are all at a 109 degrees,
symmetrically

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.520
disposed in space.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.790
And we know since we have a
heteronuclear system here,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.290
we're going to have some
polar covalency.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.360
You can look up that the
electronegativity of carbon is

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.945
2.55 electronegativity of
hydrogen is less than that

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:44.810
from its position in
the periodic table.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.140
But to be quantitative
it's 2.2.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.000
So that means if I look at the
carbon hydrogen bond, carbon

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.930
has the higher
electronegativity.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.490
So it's going to pull
the electrons.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.180
So that means that the carbon
end is going to be a little

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.140
bit negative.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.540
And the hydrogen end is going
to be a little bit positive.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.500
So that means I've got
a dipole moment here.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.510
Polar bond.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.110
Everything is the same
as above here.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.200
Polar bond.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.900
But, I want to address
the question, is

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.680
the molecule polar?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.130
So the way I interpret the
question, is it a polar

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.060
molecule, I ask is there a
net charge displacement?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.970
Well, we're off to a
good start here.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.860
We see that we have charge
displacement on the bonds.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.580
But, is there a net dipole
for the molecule.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.090
So the way I think about that is
to say, where is the center

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.010
of positive charge
for the molecule?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.500
Where's the center of
negative charge?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.430
So I know all the hydrogens
are a little bit positive.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.480
And they're all the same
distance from the nucleus.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.140
And I can draw a circle
that will

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.860
capture all four hydrogens.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.750
Or more appropriately,
it's a sphere, right?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.300
These three on the bottom
don't lie in the plane.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.880
So the corners of the
tetrahedron lie on a sphere.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.920
So where is the center
of positive charge?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.870
The center positive charge is
right here at the center of

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.130
the molecule.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.900
And where's the center of
local negative charge?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.630
It's on the carbon because the
carbon is the negative end of

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.420
all the bonds.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.290
So the centers of positive and
negative charge for the entire

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.560
molecule are colocated at the
center of the molecule.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.750
So this means no net
dipole moments.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.625
No net dipole moment
for the molecule.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.740
So this is a non
polar molecule.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.950
It's a non polar molecule
consisting of polar bonds.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.670
Non polar molecule.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.770
So there's two ways that I can
get a non polar molecule.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.340
One way is to have a homonuclear
molecule, right?

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.890
So, homonuclear molecule.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.100
Homonuclear molecules

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.250
axiomatically must be non polar.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.500
Because they have
equal sharing.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.580
So if I give you anything that's
homonuclear trivially,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.830
it's non polar.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:24.240
So you can look at things
like H2, P4, S8.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.570
These things are
all non polar.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.730
I don't care what
their structures

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.090
are, it doesn't matter.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.640
This one here is definitely
polar.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.330
And then the last one here that
we're looking at, the the

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.800
methane, is non polar because
we have spatially symmetric

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.360
disposition of identical
polar bonds.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:53.210
So spatially symmetric, that
means there's three

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.260
dimensional symmetry.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.670
Spatially symmetric disposition
of identical polar

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:14.450
bonds leads to non
polar molecule.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.340
Because the centers of positive
and negative charge

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.290
are colocated.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.990
So, now it's time to move on.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.900
Now I want to look at covalent
bonding from an energetic

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.430
standpoint.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.120
I want to go back to energy
level diagrams. We've looked

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.240
at energy level diagrams in
the past for atoms, single

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.500
atoms. But now, what I want to
do is build energy level

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.150
diagrams for molecules.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.590
So, for that we're going
to go back to

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.610
the Schrodinger equation.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:53.370
I want energy level diagrams
for molecules.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:04.660
And for that I'm going to call
upon the Schrodinger equation.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.640
And we're not going to go
through the quantum mechanics

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.360
in mathematical detail.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.490
We're going to do quantum
mechanics pictorally.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.160
We've got a long way.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.620
And in particular, what I want
to do with regard to the

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.890
Schrodinger equation is to
recognize that we can move

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.560
from atomic orbitals to
molecular orbitals by

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.550
exploiting the fact that the
Schrodinger equation is a

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.980
linear equation.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:42.160
Using the linearity property
of Schrodinger equation.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.390
All right, what do I
mean by linearity?

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:51.170
Well, I'm going to do just
a little bit of math.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.480
Just enough to make you sit up
in your math classes and find

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.660
out that there's some
utility there.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.280
Here's what I mean.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.670
Let me talk about what the
linearity principal is.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.860
So if I have some equation,
f of x, y, and z.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.790
It's a three variable
equation.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.730
And the equation is f
of x, y, z is k1.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.670
k1 could be a constant, it could
be a function, it could

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.630
be anything.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.040
And let's say that it
has as its solution,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.360
the solution is s1.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.160
And then I've got a second
variant of this x, y, z.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.140
And it equals k2.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.450
So it's the same function
but it equals k2 here.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.350
It could be a constant, it
could be something else.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.910
And it has as its
solution, s2.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.230
If this f of x, y, z is a linear
equation, then if I'd

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:53.050
give you f of x, y, z equals k1
plus k2, you don't have to

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.320
go and solve the equation
with impunity.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.920
You can write that
the solution is

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.330
equal to s1 plus s2.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.730
And that doesn't hold if it's
a non linear equation.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.150
Just put y equals x squared.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.300
And if I tell you y equals one,
y equals two, and then I

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.180
give you y equals 1 plus 2, it
doesn't equal the sum of the

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.185
solution to that.

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:17.560
You can prove it to yourself.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.560
So this is the fact that
superposition holds.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.860
You can superpose solutions
and build a library.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.470
So superposition holds when you
have a linear equation.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.320
And that's all we're going to
use in order to make equations

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.810
for the molecular orbital.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.490
So that way I can write that
the wave function of a

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.600
molecular orbital then is a
linear combination of the

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.450
atomic orbitals.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.630
That's all this is doing.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.670
This is setting the stage for,
if you take quantum mechanics

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.440
later, you'll go through
this in gory detail.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.290
But I'm saying that you know
enough now to appreciate that

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.350
we can do what we're
about to do so.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.220
That means I'm just going to sum
the wave functions of the

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.440
atomic orbitals.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.250
In this case, i goes from 1 to
2 because there's only two

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.930
orbitals in a bond.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.350
And there will be some pre
factor here, a sub i times ci.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.000
And this whole business is
called linear combination of

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.990
atomic orbitals into
molecular orbitals.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.010
So it's an SLI, it's a six
letter initialization.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.960
You know like FBI is a TLI,
it's a three letter

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.350
initialization.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.400
This is an SLI, in
3L91 we go big.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.360
This is an SLI, six letter
initialization.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.770
So we're going to do
some examples here.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.590
And all you need to do in order
to run the examples is

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.310
use two ideas in LCAO-MO.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.130
First of all, conservation
of states.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.805
Conservation of orbital
states.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.040
And the second one is, we're
going to fill the newly

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.940
created molecular orbitals
according

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.730
to the Aufbau principle.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.620
Fill MOs by Aufbau.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.230
If we do that, we're
in good shape.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.020
So let's take a look.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.920
So first think I want
to do is just

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.840
rationalize this one here.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.330
H plus H goes to H2.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.050
I want to demonstrate
that there's a

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.280
rational basis for this.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.620
So what I'm going to do is make
energy level diagrams. So

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.100
there's an energy
coordinate here.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.900
Energy goes up in the
vertical direction.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.770
And out here is zero.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.460
And what I'm going to draw for
you is energy level diagrams

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.120
for two atomic hydrogen
gas atoms.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.330
So if this is the zero,
we know that somewhere

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.300
down here is the 1s.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.820
And I'm going to be complete
in my label.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.430
This is the 1s atomic
orbital of hydrogen.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.570
And over here there's
a 1s atomic

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.890
orbital of atomic hydrogen.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:08.570
And furthermore, I've got an
electron sitting in 1s.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.850
Now these are at infinite
separation.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.560
These are far apart.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.840
Far, you know what that means.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.910
Far with quotation marks means
that they're separate quantum

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.050
systems. So I'm not violating
the poly exclusion principal

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.840
by having both of these
electrons sitting in the

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.530
ground state.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.540
So they both have the same
set of quantum numbers.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.830
1, 0, 0, 1/2.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.680
Both of them.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.720
Same thing.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.290
Let's put it over here,
1, 0, 0, 1/2.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.120
So they're very,
very far apart.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.290
Now if I bring them close enough
together to make the

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.160
molecule H2, what happens is I'm
going to violate the poly

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.410
exclusion principal if I have
both of these atomic orbitals

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.250
at the same level.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.590
Because I start filling them
according to Aufbau principal

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.300
I'm going to end up with
more electrons than

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.510
two at the same state.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.960
So what happens is
this splits.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.630
One orbitals ends up at a lower
energy and one orbital

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.170
ends up at a higher energy than
the ground state energy

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.990
in the atom itself.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.730
And so now this is called the
sigma 1s molecular orbital.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.300
And the one above it is
called sigma star

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.040
1s molecular orbital.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.110
And sigma is at a
lower energy.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.820
So if electrons populate this
orbital, the system's energy

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.370
will decrease and a
bond will form.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.690
So this is called a
bonding orbital.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.390
If electrons populate the upper
orbital, they will raise

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.910
the energy of the system,
destabilizing it.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.000
And so this orbital denoted
with the star is called

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.500
antibonding.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.670
It's an antibonding orbital.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.000
So now I've got the energy
level diagram

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.460
for molecular hydrogen.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.500
So now let's go and
populate according

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.520
to the Aufbau principal.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.280
I've got two electrons and they
go in spin up spin down.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.260
And now you can see that this
occupancy put the electrons at

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.060
lower energy than they were by
being in the energy state of

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.490
the atoms.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.460
And so I can argue that by
this diagram, I haven't

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.050
predicted anything, but I
can use this diagram to

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.980
rationalize that for this
reaction delta E is negative.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.330
And we know how negative
it is.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.260
It's minus 435 kilojoules
per mole.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.620
It's hugely negative.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.970
Minus 435 kilojoules per mole.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.150
All right.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.590
So, that's good.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.930
In fact I think I've
got some pictures.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.940
You can go through the whole
quantum mechanics.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:53.950
And just as is the case for a
single atoms, you can use the

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.920
product of the wave function and
it's complex conjugate and

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.050
so on and make plots.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.940
Oh by the way, this was just
making the point that you can

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.100
pull out the electronegativity
off of the periodic table.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.210
It's given here.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.540
And the periodic table
is pretty good.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.480
But obviously somebody got a
little bit ahead of himself.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.490
They called this the first
ionization potential, which is

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.970
the potential you'd put
across the plates in a

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.610
gas discharge tube.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.390
But the unit is not
the electronvolt.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.900
If it's a potential,
it's a volt.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.470
Somebody here that put this
together seemed to think the

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.320
electronvolt is a unit
of potential.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.880
And I want to make sure
that nobody in this

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.020
class believes that.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.260
You got to get a little bit of
nail polish or something and

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.790
cover up the little e there.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.660
Or take the nail polish, paint
over potential and write first

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.990
ionization energy.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.980
One or the other,
but not this.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.230
This was a plot if percent
ionic characters.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.830
You can see that the strongly
covalent compounds down here

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.200
have very very low
electronegativity differences

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.270
and therefore very low
ionic character.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.470
And way up here are
the ionics.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.970
And in between is HF.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.860
It's almost at the cusp.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.980
But, can you see that
there must be a

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.160
mistake on this diagram?

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.690
Because this thing has got a
greater electronegativity

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.350
difference than lithium iodide
and yet lithium iodide has a

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.450
higher percent ionic
character.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.110
How can this function
zigzag like that?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.870
Something's wrong.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.470
So when you look at something,
you go wait a minute, that

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.080
doesn't make sense.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.930
So I go back and I say, do
I trust anything here?

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.250
Trust, but verify.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.950
Read critically.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:32.700
It's a good book.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.500
But, it's a big book
and there's

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.710
going to be some mistakes.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.130
All right, so here's some
pictoral stuff of what we were

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.060
just doing over here.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.730
So here are the two spherical 1s
orbitals and now they come

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.210
closer and closer together
and they overlap.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.970
And this is what the shape
of the sigma 1s

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.765
orbital looks like.

00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:54.670
It's like an oval with the
two nuclei inside.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.690
Here's taken from a different
text book.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.560
The overlap of atomic 1s atomic
and now here's the

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.240
molecular orbital.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.660
Now you can also look at what
the shape of the antibonding

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.350
orbital would be.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.030
This is what the shape of the
antibonding orbital would be.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.580
It would have two lobes with
a nodal plane in between.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.510
I think this is taken from
yet another book.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.960
Oh this is our book.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.340
There we go.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.850
1s, 1s, as there we go.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.380
Hydrogen molecular orbitals.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.160
Now look, suppose we do the
same thing for helium.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.310
If we do the same thing for
helium, helium starts with two

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.620
electrons in 1s.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.610
And now it's going to
have four electrons.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.240
Two will go in the bonding
and two will go in the

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.560
antibonding.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.740
And the two that go in the
antibonding raise the energy

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.430
of the system more than the
two that go into bonding

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.980
decrease the energy
of the system.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.470
There's a net increase
in energy.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.190
And this is the way you could
rationalize that helium exists

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.130
as the atom in the gas phase.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.860
You don't see He2
gas molecules.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.230
So using this energy level
diagram you can go through an

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.940
rationalize.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.820
I would never ask
you to predict.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:11.100
I would say, fact, helium is
found as the atomic species in

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.160
the gas phase.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.710
With the use of energy level
diagrams, rationalize.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.450
And that's what I would
expect you to do.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.930
Take this and show
that the two are

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.950
of different stability.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:32.160
One other point to to make,
the level of 1s.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.270
If I wanted to put helium
on this board here.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.560
Not the scale, but
just roughly.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.330
Where would helium 1s be
relative the hydrogen 1s.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.760
We got three choices.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:51.480
Same level, closer to zero
energy, or more negative.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.880
How do you think about
the problem?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.280
What determines what
this energy is?

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.820
It's the electrostatic
force of attraction.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.640
Is the electrostatic force of
attraction on the 1s electron

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:07.490
in helium greater than or less
than it is in hydrogen?

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.230
It's greater.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.570
So that means that the energy is
going to be more negative.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.170
And so if I were to put over
here helium, I'd put down here

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.510
this would be 1s atomic orbital
for helium and then we

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.090
go through the analysis.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.410
And why does that
come into play?

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.450
Well you might want to do a
heteronuclear molecule.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.030
Suppose you wanted to do
the bonding diagram

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.530
for hydrogen fluoride.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.390
So we'd have hydrogen here
and the fluorine

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.820
and would be here.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.410
And all the fluorine orbitals
would be much lower and then

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.760
they'd combine to make the
molecular orbitals.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.710
And I think there's something
opportunities to practice that

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.980
in the homework.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.410
OK let's do one more.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.280
Let's do one more.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.940
How about lithium.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.800
Let's do lithium.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.985
I want to ask, is dilithium
stable?

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:58.780
Li2.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.040
And this is all gas phase.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.210
Is dilithium stable?

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.982
So I'll start off with
here's the zeroes.

00:23:05.982 --> 00:23:10.360
The zero of energy for
infinite separation.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.330
So this'll be a lithium
gas atom.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.610
And this is the putative
dilithium gas atom.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.280
We're going to figure out
if it's stable or not.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.870
So it's going to have bonding
and antibonding orbitals.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:29.690
And then this is the 1s, 2s.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:37.130
And this will be sigma 1s,
sigma star 1s, and so on.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:44.660
And then we'll have 2s atomic
orbital splitting into sigma

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.030
and sigma star of 2s.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.000
And now lithium is 1s2, 2s1.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.640
So there's one, two, three.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.270
And one, two, three.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.260
And so now let's use
the Hund rule.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.900
So I've got four electrons in
the n equals one shell, and

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.000
they populate in this manner.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.600
And then I've got two electrons
that go only into

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.620
the bonding orbital.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.700
And according to this it appears
that lithium 2 is

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.020
favored over atomic lithium.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.930
And that in fact is the case.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.960
That in fact is the case and so
that applies to all of the

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.080
all of the alkalide metals.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.010
Because they all have the
ns1 configuration.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.780
So when you're driving down the
highway and you see those

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.390
orangey yellow low pressure
sodium vapor lamps.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.070
What you're looking at is
emission not from atomic

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.560
sodium but from Na2 vapor.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.210
And you've got the energy level
diagram to convince

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.720
yourself of that.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.680
So next time you see those,
just smile, knowing that

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.850
you're looking at disodium,
not sodium.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.290
OK, well so far we've only
looked at single bonds.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.820
Now I want to look at
multiple bonds.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820
Double and triple bonds.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.210
So let's look at nitrogen now.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:03.730
N2.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.440
Remember that gave us
the the triple bond?

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.340
We had nitrogen, one, two,
three, four, five.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.890
Second nitrogen, one, two,
three, four, five.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.880
So in order to get octet
stability, we had three pairs

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.990
of electronic sharing.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.430
Which then give us a
triple bond here.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.680
And so what's that going
to look like?

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.670
what's that going to look
like pictorally?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.600
And the way to think about that
is first of all these are

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.940
all p orbitals.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:40.520
If we look at, this
is 2s2, 2p3.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.420
So 2s and these are
the 2d orbitals.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.740
So I've got s is filled first
and then I've got the lone

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.930
electrons in each of
the p orbitals.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.050
And these things are shaped
like figure eights.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.630
And the p orbital, this is
the p atomic orbital.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.830
It has two lobes.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.020
Each of these zones are
just called lobes.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.070
Same word is earlobe.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:14.460
And this zone in the middle,
this one point in the middle,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.710
is called a node.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.990
And that's a sight of zero
electron density.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.980
Zero electronic density.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.290
And remember the electron,
even if it only has one

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.100
electron here, the electron
can be in either a lobe.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.990
It can move from lobe to lobe
even though it can never be at

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.660
the nucleus.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.850
And how does it get from one
lobe to the other while never

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.110
crossing the nucleus because
it's never supposed to be in

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.380
the nucleus?

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.630
By behaving as a wave. The same
way that you can have a

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:47.420
jump rope and you can have a
fixed point of zero motion,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.530
yet you can transmit energy down
the rope passed the node.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.730
So, let's draw these things.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.570
A word about how you draw,
you have to use

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.140
the right hand rule.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.320
Have to use the right
hand rule.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.830
So when I put the coordinate
system up, it's going to have

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.630
to conform so that the thumb
is x and they go y and z.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.000
And if you don't use the right
hand rule later on if you get

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.740
into electromagnetics, you start
looking at forces and

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.920
vectors, you're going to end up
with things moving in the

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.650
wrong direction.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.540
So we conform to the
right hand rule.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.690
And the other thing,
and it's kind of

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.260
nice, it's not mandatory.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.150
But chemists generally
like to have atoms

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.110
bond along the z-axis.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.425
So that means we start with the
z-axis here, if I'm going

00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:36.650
to put my second nitrogen, have
them bond on the z-axis.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:40.580
And so that means if z is in
the plane of the board

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.340
pointing to the right, then
pointing up must be y, and

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.830
then pointing into the
board must be x.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.930
So I'll have, here's my px
orbital, then the py orbital,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.710
and the pz orbital.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.740
And the three of these are all
symmetrically disposed around

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.990
the nucleus.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.540
And next to it at the same kind
of floral arrangement.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:09.070
I'll start with px,
py, and pz.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.450
And now these are going
to come close

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.360
together and overlap.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.590
So I want to figure out what
those orbitals are

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.670
going to look like.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.970
So let's start along
the z-axis.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.910
The z-axis is the easy one.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.130
So I've got two of these things
lying on their sides

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.740
like infinity signs.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.970
We're going to do quantum
mechanics pictorally.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.700
Why?

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.420
Because it's a linear
equation.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.300
So I can add pictural.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.140
So this is 2pz of one of them.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.340
And a 2pz of the other.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.410
And this is the nitrogen
atomic orbital.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.780
And I'm going to smear these
things and what are they going

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.930
to look like?

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.510
The nucleus is here, the
nucleus is where I'm

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.790
indicating the dot.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.580
These two combine, very
simply, it's going

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.830
to look like this.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.360
So there's one nitrogen.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.010
Here's the other nitrogen.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.780
And what's this thing?

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.570
This is electronic density.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:11.550
And so this is our sigma bond.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.820
Looks a little bit different
from the case of of hydrogen,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.330
because hydrogen was the
blending of two s orbitals and

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.280
s orbitals are spherically
symmetric.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.620
In this case, we've
got two lobes.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.500
But what's characteristic about
this one and hydrogen,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.930
hydrogen looked like
this, remember?

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.020
This was hydrogen.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.570
This was H2.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.080
And this was a sigma bond.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.780
The characteristic of a sigma
bond is that when you start

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.020
from one nucleus and you go to
the other nucleus, you move

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.240
through unbroken electron
density.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.420
So there are no nodes, no
holidays, between the nitrogen

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.940
nucleus on the left and the
nitrogen nucleus on the right.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.460
There is a node here, but
that's different.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.240
I can go from one nitrogen to
the other with unbroken

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.170
electron density.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.680
That's what makes this
a sigma bond.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.760
So that's good.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.390
So this thing here is going
to be called stigma

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.710
2p molecular orbital.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:21.370
Sigma 2p molecular orbital And
I think I've got the slide

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.230
that shows this.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.780
There's some art work.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.710
People really get excited
about this.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.960
OK there's dilithium.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.060
Or dipotasium, disodium.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:31.920
OK so here we are.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.790
This is the smearing of two pz
atomic orbitals to make the

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.080
sigma 2p bonding orbital.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.020
And there just for grins and
chuckles is what the

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.200
antibonding would look like.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.640
But we don't care, because
it doesn't form.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.980
Well this is the book.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.980
And you know what I'm
going to say.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.350
I've got my little
hobby horse here.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.810
I don't know why they change
color on the lobes.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.680
Because when I look at that, it
starts conjuring up to me

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.900
the image that one electron
stays in the blue lobe and one

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.730
electron stays in
the yellow lobe.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.190
Besides, I've seen them and
they're not different colors.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.440
They're the same color.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.800
So now let's look at what
happens when we blend off of

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.420
the z-axis.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.300
So let's blend the
two py orbitals.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.660
See what that goes like.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.460
OK so let's do that one.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.450
And that one is going
to look like this.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.650
We're to start with, again
figure eights.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.140
But now they're their side
by side, they're lateral.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.300
So this is 2py atomic orbital.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.190
2py atomic orbital.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:45.350
And then we're going to blend
them along the z-axis to give

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.680
us, and I'm going to do
this stylized, OK?

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.590
So there's the the two
nitrogen nuclei.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.340
So I put the nuclei up.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.880
And I'm going to smear
the upper lobes.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.850
So these two lobes are
going to smear.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.690
And I'm going to get
really stylized.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.990
I feel like it's France and
it's the late 1800s.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.430
So there it is.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.720
And I'm going to smear
the two bottom ones.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.120
And it's going to
look like this.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.820
So what do I have here?

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:20.660
Now I have two lobes
as before.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.340
But if I look at the second
nucleus from the first

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.480
nucleus, not only do I fail
to have unbroken electron

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.990
density, I have zero
electron density.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.880
See, this was a nodal
point in the atom.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.170
With the two atoms together,
the plane orthogonal to the

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.740
board is a nodal plane.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.370
There's no electron density
in the plane

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.800
orthogonal to the board.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.500
Nodal plane.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.630
So this is definitely not a
sigma bond, this is a pi bond.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.860
This is a pi bond.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.160
And it's characterized by
smearing of atomic orbitals,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.740
just as the sigma bond is.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.290
But it has a nodal plane that
separates the two lobes.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.590
I think I've got some cartoon
illustrations from other books

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.440
Here OK this is from one book.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.030
This is good.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.460
They call the px,
I call it py.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.270
There it is.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.200
And I'd go further and I'd say
that if I were to slice this

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.610
and look at it from angle, if
we were to cut this and look

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.470
from here, I'd venture that
you'd see something that's

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.720
sort of figure eightish.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:40.870
Oh here's our book, bless
them with two colors.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.370
But anyway, there's what
it looks like.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.620
That's the pie.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.040
And then the same thing
happens with the x.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.426
So this is this is going
to be pi 2py.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.830
This is pi 2py.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.480
And it's a molecular orbital.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.000
And there's going
to be a pi 2px.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.120
And it's going to blend
front and back.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.320
So we can make a catalog.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.710
So we're going to do quantum
mechanics in pictures here.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:15.510
So I know that s plus s must
always make a sigma bond.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.370
There's no other way.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.570
Because I've got electron
density all around.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:20.820
Let's do it pictorally.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.020
That's easy.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.610
And this is sigma.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.650
We know this has to be sigma.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:37.290
What about something like HF
where the H is an s and the F

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.660
is going to have the
one last electron

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.040
missing in the p orbital.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.270
S plus p must give
sigma always.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.720
Because that's this cartoon.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.080
See there's no way that when
this smears with this, there's

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.360
going to be zero electron
holidays from the hydrogen

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.060
nucleus to the fluorine
nucleus.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.060
So you're going to end
up with something

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.290
that looks like this.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.860
It starts around and gives you
something that's going to be a

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.070
little bit asymmetric.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.810
So this will also be a sigma.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.970
So I'll just put HF here as sort
of prototypical of that.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:22.350
And then if I take p plus p
axially, on axis, that also

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.600
gives us a sigma.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.790
Because that's this one,
the infinity signs.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.630
Two infinity signs
give us this.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:41.335
And then finally, if we get
p plus p longitudinally.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.710
So that will give us a pi
bond and that's the 88.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.730
8 plus 8 gives me,
and this is pi.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.730
So that's quantum mechanics.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.790
The math will follow.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.600
So now what I want to do is go
back to this energy level

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.530
diagram and show how
these energy level

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.290
diagrams can work.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.810
So here's the energy level
diagram for nitrogen, N2.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.760
There's two f's, two p, and the
scaffolding is in place.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.120
There's the energy levels.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.110
Now here's the molecular
orbitals and here are the

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.830
atomic orbitals.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.390
And now here they
are occupied.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.560
So nitrogen has one, two, three,
four, five according to

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.590
the Hund rule.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.100
And here is the set up
for the N2 molecules.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.200
So the 2s's and the 2s's
go bonding antibonding.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.420
Now I've got three plus
three is six.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.650
Two, two, two.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.230
Everything's paired.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.480
So we get the triple bond,
946 kilojoules per mole.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.730
Enormous energy in nitrogen.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.120
Enormous energy in nitrogen.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.890
Now, let's keep going.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.270
Now let's look at oxygen.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.820
This is the scaffolding for
oxygen and fluorine.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.700
And there's a little
change here.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.780
A little change, I'm going to
draw your attention to it.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.050
And you can't predict this.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.030
We would give you this.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.220
I would tell you what the energy
sequence is of the

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.050
energy levels.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:16.260
But look here carefully, you see
in the case all nitrogen,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.540
the pi's lie below the sigma.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.580
In the case of oxygen and
fluorine the sigma

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.730
lies below the pi's.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.850
These are tiny, tiny
differences.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.220
But, they are measurable.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.270
That's the little difference.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.520
Now let's see what happens.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.690
Actually here's from out text
book and it shows the stigma

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:39.380
2pix slowly meandering down,
down, down, down, down.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.540
And somewhere between nitrogen
and oxygen it crisscrosses.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.600
All right, so now let's
fill oxygen.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.460
So oxygen is two,
four, five, six.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.730
So two plus two is four.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.540
There's the two, two, two.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.790
And then these last ones go
up into the antibonding.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.220
But look at the antibonding.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.510
We have, according to the Hund
rule, not two electrons in the

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.330
first orbital, but
one and one.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.070
So we end up with unpaired
electrons in

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.790
the antibonding orbital.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.570
So these offset the three pairs
here, and so we end up

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:18.910
with a double bond.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.210
And its energy us 498
kilojoules per mole.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.460
Substantially less
then nitrogen.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.190
And this energy level diagram
rationalizes that.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.440
And then here's for fluorine.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.960
If you go to fluorine it's the
same scaffolding only there's

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.890
two more electrons.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.070
These are paired and you
have a single bond.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.960
160 kilojoules per mole.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.470
Now there's a property that we
get from the fact that we have

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.700
these unpaired electrons.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.490
We're going back oxygen now.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.950
We have unpaired electrons in
the antibonding orbitals.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.770
We saw unpaired electrons.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.350
What did they do in the
Stern-Gerlach experiment?

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.960
Changed the magnetics
substantially, right?

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.370
We ended up with the splitting
of the silver bean.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.610
So this will also
have an impact.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.190
An impact known as
a paramagnetism.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.320
What's paramagnetism?

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.110
It's shown in this
little cartoon.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:13.950
If you have a substance here
that's balanced and it is

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:18.380
paramagnetic, if you engage
the magnetic field, the

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.480
magnetic field will pull on a
substance that's paramagnetic.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.920
And oxygen is paramagnetic.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.410
Not only in a gas state, but
paramagnetic as liquid.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.520
And here's an illustration
from your text book.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.870
You may have seen this and said,
yeah a guy is pouring

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.170
liquid oxygen, wow.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.720
Look carefully now.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.410
The boiling point of oxygen
at one atmosphere

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.550
pressure is 90 Kelvin.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:45.030
So room temperature is
substantially higher.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:49.930
This is the equivalent of taking
water and putting it in

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.750
an oven at about 300 degrees
celsius and watching it pour.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.770
It would still be liquid,
but it would be

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.020
liquid trying to boil.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.910
Why doesn't it all
turned to gas?

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.220
Because there's a time
to heat everything.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:06.180
So this is sitting at 90 Kelvin,
he pouring it down, or

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.220
she's pouring it down, and
these are the jaw of a

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.870
permanent magnet.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.920
And it's in a gravity
field, it doesn't

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.940
keep falling, it stops.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.400
And it continues to boil away
and as fast as you can pour

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.310
it, it sits between the
jaws of the magnet.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.660
Because it's paramagnetic.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.300
You can think of this
as the liquid

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.090
equivalent of iron filings.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.020
If I told you that were these
were iron filings you'd say,

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.400
yeah the iron filings go and
they stick to the magnet,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.670
that's what magnets do
to iron filings.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.250
They do the same thing
to liquid oxygen.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.290
And why?

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.700
Because of this.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.640
This explains this.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:50.870
So we can do a lot with these
primitive little diagrams.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:51.950
Let's do one more.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.436
I want to do one more
of these things.

00:40:54.436 --> 00:40:58.010
I want to go to hybridized
systems. I want to go to a

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.010
hybridized system.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:03.560
And I want to look
at ethylene.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.740
C2H4 is ethylene.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.250
OK, so if I told you give me
the Louis structure of

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.500
ethylene, you just start going
according to the rule.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:22.090
So I'm going to have carbon,
carbon, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:27.680
And carbon has one, two,
three, four electrons.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.610
The hydrogen has one electron.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.890
I'll put the one electron
from hydrogen.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.870
And then the other carbon
over here, I'm

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.630
going to give it dots.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.470
One, two, three, four.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.000
And then these hydrogen
each have one.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.770
And now let's see what
I have here.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.230
These hydrogens are all
isoelectronic with helium, so

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.210
they're happy.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:52.340
And the carbon now has two,
let's see, what does he got?

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.410
Yeah, carbon is happy.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.190
Two, four, six, OK good.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.070
So now carbon is.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.350
Happy as well.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.580
So what do we have here?

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.906
This is the equivalent to a
carbon carbon double bond.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.510
So what have I learned with
the nitrogen example?

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.900
What I learned with the nitrogen
example was, that if

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.650
I want to make more than one
bond, I have to have a

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:20.210
combination of a stigma
and a pi.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.210
You can only make one sigma bond
because there's no room.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.050
Once you've got zero electron
density between the two nuclei

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.430
you're going to violate the
Pauli exclusion principle if

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.140
you have another
orbital cutting

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.800
through that same domain.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:39.200
So this means that multiple
bonds require a mix

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.080
of sigma and pi.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:53.770
Multiple bonds require a
mix of sigma and pi.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:58.390
If you have a single bond, all
you need is the sigma.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:04.050
So let's go back to how we got
the original hybridization.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.020
Remember, we started with
carbon, with the box notation

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.330
looking like this.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:15.190
Here's the 2s and the 2p's and
we started with just native

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.240
carbon off the periodic table.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.470
And we have this.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.590
Just if we go according
to the 2s2, 2p2.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.640
And then in order to get
hybridization to rationalize

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.070
methane, where we've got
four equivalent bonds.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:35.810
In that case, we hybridize
the s and all of the p's.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.500
We took the s and all three
of the p's to make

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.000
the sp3 hybrid orbitals.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.800
And then we were able to take
these electrons and put them

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.820
in one at a time.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.620
And then bring in the four
hydrogens and we end up with

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.480
something that is

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.250
symmetrically disposed in space.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:57.700
The carbon, hydrogen and so.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.290
So now I give to you ethylene
I say, well

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:02.500
how do I make ethylene.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:08.010
Well, if I started with this sp3
thing maybe I could bring

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.620
another carbon over here.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.820
And I'd have three hydrogen
sticking out.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.250
So there's my sigma bond.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.670
So I'm off to the races.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.180
This is good.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.390
But now I need to build
a second bond.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.760
I'm going to throw away
a couple of hydrogen.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.490
So i'll throw this hydrogen away
and this hydrogen away.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.290
So I'm going to have now C2H4.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.590
I'm almost there.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.890
The only problem is, this
orbital is sticking out this

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.810
way, this orbital is sticking
out this way.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.240
And I don't have the license
to bend these orbitals.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.920
And build a double bond.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.460
Because they're 109 degrees
apart and they're inflexible

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.010
and they won't bend.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:50.460
So this hybridization technique
will not work as

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:56.210
such to give me what I need
to build ethylene.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.180
What do I need?

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.380
If I'm going to build a sigma
and a pi bond, I'm going to

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.440
need to preserve one of the p
orbitals so that it can still

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.850
be available for lateral
smearing

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.900
Because how do I make
a pi orbital?

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.900
I make a pi orbital
middle with an 88.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.820
So I need to preserve a p
orbital so that in both of the

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.590
carbons I still have this
pi bonding capability.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.680
So what I'm going do is instead
of taking the s and

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.610
all three of the p's I'm going
to take the s and only two of

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.410
the p' s and reserve one of the
p' s to be sitting there

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.580
for lateral smearing.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:39.300
So instead what I'm going
to do is this.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.720
So this is going to be an
unmixed p and this is going to

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.430
take the s and not three
p' s but only two p 's.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.680
And this would be called sp2.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.090
And now what do I have?

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.280
I've one, two, three.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.630
And how do I put three
of these in space?

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:03.330
They lie symmetrically in
a plane at 120 degrees.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.830
And then this thing is normal
to the plane of the board.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.540
It's sticking out.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.780
Actually, I should've
maybe drawn it in

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.400
perspective like this.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.990
And so now I've got
the ability to put

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.290
two of these together.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.500
This'll giving me my sigma.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.100
And then these two things lying
on their side will smear

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.600
with the lobes to
give me the pi.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.020
Now that's what gives
me the double bond.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.680
And here are the cartoons
that show this.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.040
Oh here, I took this from an old
text book, it's text book

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.920
I had when I was your age.

00:46:40.455 --> 00:46:41.590
The wrote great books.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.710
And then I flipped
this around see.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:44.820
I did all this just for you.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.980
So I took this one, I flipped
the image around.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.850
So there are the sp2's these
are the unmixed p's.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.510
And you bring them close
together and bingo.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.870
There's the sigma.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.550
That's this one, p plus p
axially, that gives me the

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:56.570
sigma bond.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.540
And then I smear those two
and that gives me the pi.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.190
And there's ethylene.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.710
You put the hydrogens here,
one, two, three, four.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.040
Two carbons.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.440
Tada.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.640
Isn't that cool?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.740
Here's from another book.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.580
It's looks like a Boston traffic
map, doesn't it?

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.410
Just crazy.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.850
This is from our book.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:25.050
So they're showing you there's
the sigmas and the pi's.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:26.300
There we go.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.610
More pictures.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.860
OK, I'm going to take three
minutes at the end here and

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.960
show you an example of

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.000
electronegativity at the extreme.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.990
So if you take a look at the
periodic table and look at a

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:47.050
compound like sodium iodide.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.240
If I just told you sodium
iodide, covalent or ionic?

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.150
You'd say, ionic.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.850
Because you got something from
the the most metallic of the

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.870
metals and something
from the most non

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:58.500
metallic of the non metals.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.180
And you're right.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.520
And the delta chi is 1.73.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.560
And the covalent character
is high.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.280
And you end up with something
that's very polar and so on.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.640
Now here's a very interesting
one, if you compare cesium and

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.870
gold, you get 1.75.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:18.670
Which is greater than what it
was for sodium and iodine.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.700
Now no one would argue that
sodium and iodine is covalent,

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.950
you'd argue that's ionic.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:26.340
Well by the same metrics, cesium
and gold is as ionic.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.970
The plot thickens.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.090
Cesium, if you melt it it's
a metal, liquid metal.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.720
If you melt gold, it's
a liquid metal.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.020
But if you mix them
in equal number.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:47.200
So you make a alloy of 50 mole
percent cesium and 50 mole

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.700
percent gold and you've got
a delta chi 1.75, you've

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.360
essentially made a cocktail with
equal numbers of really

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.340
good electron donors and really

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.690
good electron acceptors.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.660
And guess what happens,
electron transfer.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.990
And the melt is not metallic,
it turns clear and colorless

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.620
just as molten sodium
iodide would be.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.810
It turns into a molten salt.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.960
So cesium gives its
electron to gold.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.730
And gold becomes the
negative gold ion.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.310
And what color is every ion?

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.550
It's got stable octet
configurations.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.860
It's got be the same color as
neon, argon, and helium.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.110
They are clear and colorless.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.190
Big drop in electrical
conductivity and a shift from

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.910
electronic to ionic
conduction.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.710
Metals have electronic
conductivity, ions, what do

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.800
ionic liquids have?

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.110
They have like ionic
conductivity.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.940
Here's some data from
the literature.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.890
This is the log on the
connductivity as a function of

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:45.700
concentration.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.950
So here's pure cesium
over here, here's

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:48.900
pure gold over here.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.230
This is 600 degrees C.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.460
So the line stops here because
gold melts at about 1060.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.760
So gold is a solid beyond this
alloy concentration.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.040
But you can see this is roughly
what you'd get.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.320
So electronic conductivity up
here at about 10 to the 4

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.870
siemens per, this is reciprocal
ohms, but siemens

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:09.790
per centimeter.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.000
And down here, this is very low
value ionic conductivity.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.200
So this is a liquid metal.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.680
And this is a molten solid.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.170
And it all happens just
when you get very

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.260
very close to 50/50.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.230
So you end up with something
called cesium oride.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.540
And it's sorcery.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.700
You have one vial
of liquid metal.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.320
You have a second vial
of liquid metal.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.500
You pour then and it turns
clear and colorless.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.010
And the conductivity drops three
orders of magnitude all

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:41.240
because of electron transfer due
to this electronegativity

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.860
difference.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.870
That's so cool.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.090
That is so cool.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:48.680
OK, with that I'll let you go.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.000
We'll see you on Friday.
