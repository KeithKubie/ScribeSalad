00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
We know that if we were to multiply two times three,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.270
that would give us positive six.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.380
And so we are going to think about negative numbers in this video.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.090
One way to think about it,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.680
is that I have a positive number times another positive number,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.280
and that gives me a positive number.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.680
So if I have a positive times a positive,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.200
that would give me a positive number.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280
Now it's mixed up a little bit.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.930
Introduce some negative numbers.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.690
So what happens if I had negative two times three?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.420
Negative two times three.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.920
Well, one way to think about it--

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.840
Now we are talking about intuition in this video

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.970
and in the future videos.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.880
You could view this as negative two repeatedly added three times.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.950
So this could be negative two plus negative two plus negative two--

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.990
Not negative six. Plus negative two.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.660
which would be equal to--

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.230
well, negative two plus negative two is negative four,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560
plus another negative two is negative six.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.110
This would be equal to negative six.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.510
Or another way to think about it is,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.900
if I had two times three, I would get six.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060
But because one of these two numbers is negative,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020
then my product is going to be negative.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.740
So if I multiply, a negative times a positive,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.650
I'm going to get a negative.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.740
Now what if we swap the order which we multiply?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.890
So if we were to multiply three times negative two,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.510
it shouldn't matter.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.070
The order which we multiply things don't change,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.510
or shouldn't change the product.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.630
When we multiply two times three, we get six.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.430
When we multiply three times two, we will get six.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.740
So we should have the same property here.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.760
Three times negative two should give us the same result.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.290
It's going to be equal to negative six.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.000
And once again we say, three times two would be six.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.800
One of these two numbers is negative,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.490
and so our product is going to be negative.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.790
So we could draw a positive times a negative

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.400
is also going to be a negative.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.760
And both of these are just the same thing with the order

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.080
which we are multiplying switched around.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.100
But this is one of the two numbers are negative. Exactly one.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.190
So one negative, one positive number is being multiplied.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.320
Then you'll get a negative product.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.080
Now we'll think about the third circumstance,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.170
where both of the numbers are negative.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.840
So if I were to multiply--I'll just switch colors for fun here--

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.250
If I were to multiply negative two times negative three--

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.750
this might be the least intuitive for you of all,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.390
and here I'm going to introduce you the rule,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.650
in the future I will explore why this is,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.030
and why this makes mathematics more--all fit together.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.200
But this is going to be, you see, two times three would be six.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.670
And I have a negative times a negative,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.960
one way you can think about it is that negatives cancel out!

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.820
So you'll actually end up with a positive six.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.430
Actually I don't have to draw a positive here.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.000
But I write it here just to reemphasize.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.490
This right over here is a positive six.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.880
So we have another rule of thumb here.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.270
If I have a negative times a negative,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.560
the negatives are going to cancel out.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.160
And that's going to give me a positive number.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.640
Now with these out of the way, let's just do a bunch of examples.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.260
I'm encouraging you to try them out before I do them.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.230
Pause the video, try them out, and see if you get the same answer.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.520
So let's try negative one times negative one.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.540
Well, one times one would be one.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.100
And we have a negative times a negative. They cancel out.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.890
Negative times a negative give me a positive.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.270
So this is going to be positive one.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.230
I can just write one,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.060
or I can literally write a plus sign there to emphasize.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.420
This is a positive one.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.370
What happened if I did negative one times zero?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.620
Now this might seem, this doesn't fit into any of these circumstances,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.540
zero is neither positive nor negative.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.260
And here you just have to remember anything times zero

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.490
is going to be zero.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.140
So negative one times zero is going to be zero.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.650
Or I could've said zero times negative seven hundred and eighty-three,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.540
that is also going to be zero.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.770
Now what about two--let me do some interesting ones.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.050
What about--I'm looking a new color.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.850
Twelve times negative four.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.920
Well, once again, twelve times positive four would be fourty-eight.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.850
And we are in the circumstance where one of these two numbers,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.940
right over here, is negative. This one right here.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.850
If exactly one of the two numbers is negative,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.680
then the product is going to be negative.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.270
We are in this circumstance, right over here.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.780
We have one negative, so the product is negative.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.400
You could imagine this as repeatedly adding negative four twelve times

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.010
And so you will get to negative fourty-eight.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.050
Let's do another one.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.090
What is seven times three?

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.020
Well, this is a bit of a trick. There are no negative numbers here.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.760
This is just going to be seven times three.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.960
Positive seven times positive three. The first circumstance,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.830
which you already knew how to do before this video.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.250
This would just be equal to twenty-one.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.960
Let's do one more.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.030
So if I were to say negative five times negative ten--

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.520
well, once again, negative times a negative.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.620
The negatives cancel out.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.800
You are just left with a positive product.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.340
So it's going to be five times ten. It's going to be fifty.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.250
The negative and the negative cancel out.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.060
Your product is going to be positive.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.270
That's this situation right over there.
