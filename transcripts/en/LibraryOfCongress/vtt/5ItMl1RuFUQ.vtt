00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.960
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Well,
good afternoon everyone.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.570
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm John Cole.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.780
I'm the director of the Center
for the Book at the library,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.950
which is the reading and
literacy promotion arm.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.770
We're very pleased to have you
here for one of our noontime talks.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.470
The Center for the Book itself
was created long time ago

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.860
by Daniel Boorstin when he
was Librarian of Congress.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.860
And the general idea was
to reach out to the public

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.490
to promote books and reading.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.500
We were actually created in 1977

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.390
when people really weren't
talking much about literacy.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.400
But the big fear was television
and the technology of television,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.000
and we very quickly moved into the
business of using new technologies

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.780
to promote books and reading
with our first project,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.350 position:56%
a something called "read more about
it" that people my age will remember

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.920
on CBS television when for
a year, more than a year,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.510
the star of the program
came out and said,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.390
"if you enjoyed the program
the library suggests,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020
the Library of Congress
suggests these books."

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.180
"Go to your local library or
bookstore, they'll be happy

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.520
to help you read more about it."

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.610
Implied message, don't go to the
Library of Congress [laughter].

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.490
But the positive message, we're
promoting bookstores and libraries.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.640
We also are involved with
some national events went

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.940
through the Center for the book,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.550
the major one being the
National Book Festival,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.160
which celebrated its
15th year, this year.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.920 position:56%
We are also, the administer, the new
Library of Congress literacy awards.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.590
And finally, our other claim
to national fame is a network

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.780
of state centers for the book that
promote books, reading, literacy,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.320
and libraries in all
of their states.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.380
This Books and Beyond series
started in, could it be 1996?

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.290
Yes, no, 2006.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.160
Gosh, the decade's just
roll by [laughter].

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.800
Whatever it takes to get up to the
number of more than 350 of them.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.410
They are filmed, they're
videotaped here for showing later

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.350
on the Library of Congress website,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.390
so I ask you to please turn
off all things electronic.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.450
The schedule will be,
well, first of all,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.860 position:56%
I want to say that the other Helena,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.550
Helena Zinkham is not
able to join us today.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.810
She was to introduce Helena
Wright, but she is not here.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.590
I'm going to actually use the
introduction that Helena penned

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.000
for me a few minutes ago about her
background, but I want to come back

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.090
to the purpose of Books and Beyond.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.820
This is the book that will be
discussed and presented today.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.180
And the purpose of Books and Beyond
really is to show off new books

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.190
that are based on extensive
research, either in the Library

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.540
of Congress or in other
institutions.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.730
And also, to highlight writers
that are of special interest

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.790
to the Library of Congress, often
through involvement in projects

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.110
or through collections that
they've donated to the library.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.790
So we're proud of the connection
between the Library of Congress

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.890
and its collections and
the production of books.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.270
And I think it's good for us
to, every once in a while,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.120
to have that sharp edge
to show what the product

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.050
of all of this research is.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.300
And today's speaker has done a
prodigious amount of research

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.090
on this wonderful book, and Helena
is using the short title, I see,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.710
for, on her screen, the Marsh
Collection, the Smithsonian,

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.620
and the Library of Congress.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.500
The bibliographer in me wants
to read the entire title

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.820
so you know what this
is really about.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.280
It's "The First Smithsonian
Collection: The European Engravings

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.000
of George Perkins Marsh
and the Role of Prints

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.550
in the US National Museum."

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.240
Wide range, and really
covers a number of topics.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.920
And in addition to being a head
of the center for the book,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.280
I'm very interested in
Library of Congress history.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.920
So there's a great deal of LC
history which Helena will mention,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.510
as in passing at least, as
we move through her talk.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.330
It really reflects a lot of
Washington DC history too,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.750
so I was really delighted to have
this and I took some careful notes

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.050
about people like George
Perkins Marsh,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.700
who was on the Library
Committee in the 19th century

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.620 position:56%
to advise the Librarian of Congress,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.220
and really helped the library a
good deal through the 19th century.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.990
But he was a man of many talents,
you'll learn about him in the talk.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.330
But interestingly enough, he was
one of those members of Congress

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.980
in mid-19th century that
thought that maybe the Library

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.030
of Congress couldn't handle being
a national library and favored it

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.350
at the Smithsonian
Institution shortly

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.520
after the Smithsonian
was, was created.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.210
That's only a small part
of the story however.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.580
That obviously didn't happen,
but Mr. Marsh is really quite a,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.650
a scholar for being
a member of Congress,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.700
and we'll learn more about him.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.060
Helena herself has served as
a curator of, as the curator

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.920
of graphic arts at the
Smithsonian's Museum

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.420
of American History since 1983.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.510
She's organized many exhibitions.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.890
I'm not going to talk about
her several publications.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.850
One of the exhibitions was on
Audubon and the Smithsonian

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.670
for the Smithsonian libraries.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.790
She also has done research and work
on Kallitype printing, papermaking,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.600 position:56%
and the history of print collecting,
which led to the research

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.540
that you're about to learn about,
and to the research about all

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.110
of the writing of this
wonderful book.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.630
It's my pleasure to
present Helena Wright.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.430
Helena.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:07:01.300
[ Applause ]

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Thank you John.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.810
I appreciate having the
opportunity to speak here today,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.130
and I also appreciate John's
assistance during my research.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.320
He introduced me to Carl
Ostrowski's excellent history

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.440
of the antebellum Library of
Congress, and he also introduced me

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.090
to Cheryl Fox in the
manuscript division, excuse me,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.320
who was a helpful guide
to resources there.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.840 position:56%
And Helena Zinkham, Katherine Blood,
and Barbara Natanson in the prints

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.930
and photographs division
provided wonderful

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.610
and generous collegial
support and encouragement

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.240
as I spent many sessions there
looking for the Marsh prints

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.480
that remain at the library.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.780
And perhaps I should alert Mark
Dimunation and Eric Frazier

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.930
that Marsh's books
represent the next frontier

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.490
in this continuing project.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.870
To begin, I will present
an overview of my book,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.650
and John has already
read you the full title

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.500 position:56%
so I don't need to do that, I guess.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.930
It brings together Marsh's
passion as a collector,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.070
his role in the formation
of the Smithsonian

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.350
and the somewhat checkered
history of the collection.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.600 position:56%
Then I will discuss the specific
points where Marsh, the Smithsonian,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.990
and the Library of Congress
intersected over the years.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.850
You will see examples of his
prints throughout my talk.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.150
Marsh, a Vermont congressman and
a member of the Smithsonian Board

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.100
of Regents, sold his
collection of European engravings

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.760
to the Smithsonian in 1849, only
three years after its founding.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.410
The Smithsonian demonstrated
remarkable prescience

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.450 position:56%
in acquiring the collection, but
displayed a good deal of uncertainty

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.740
about what to do with it.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.190
To be fair, not only was
it the first collection

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.120
of any kind acquired
by the new institution,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.660
six years before the
castle was completed,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.950
it was also the first public
print collection in the nation

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.890
and there were no models to
reference what it should be

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.160
or how it would function.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.460 position:56%
So by 1874, most of the prints had
been sent to the Library of Congress

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.020
and to the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.550
Efforts to reclaim them,
however, began early in the 1880s.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.480
In telling this story, I
wanted to dispel the myth

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.930
that the collection had
been destroyed in the fire,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.620
the 1865 fire that gutted
portions of the castle.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.700
And I wanted to recover Marsh's
reputation as a print connoisseur

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.370
in the antebellum period,
when that avocation was rare.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.970
I also wanted to provide some
context for the wider reception

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.270
of prints that developed

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.510
in the United States
during the 19th century.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.280
Marsh acquired important engravings
and illustrated volumes at a time

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.360
when such collections were
uncommon, and their presence

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.060
in two national institutions led me
to investigate their acquisition,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.550 position:56%
dispersal, and continuing influence.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.120
The narrative builds in
somewhat spiral fashion,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.520
from a basic introduction to
the man and the institutions,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.420
through a detailed
account of the collection

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.460
and the National Museum
in the 19th century.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.840
For the most part, I present this
history in chronological order,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.870
based on documents
and correspondence,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.660
in the words of the
participants wherever possible.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.560
Three appendices reproduce
the most critical documents,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.410
Marsh's 1849 sales agreement,
and here are two examples

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.760
of different versions that I
found, but not the original

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.920
which we presume was in
fact lost in the fire.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.240
The 1850 Smithsonian annual report,
which describes the collection

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.790
in detail and served as the
basis for many later accounts.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.790
And in 1874 a list of the prints
that were sent to the Corcoran,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.130
which were returned in 1896.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.330
Chapter One provides a brief
history of the Smithsonian,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.890
including James Smithson's
unexpected and undefined bequest

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.170
that founded the institution.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.010
Marsha's active role in
founding in its formation,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.270
through his appointment to the
congressional committee charged

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.620
with deciding the best use
for the Smithson bequest,

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.540
and a preliminary description
of the collection

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.890
and the somewhat secretive
circumstances surrounding

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.970
the purchase.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.600
Chapter Two presents a biography
of Marsh, offering an account

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.000
of his many interests
and accomplishments.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.520
Today he's best known as the
guiding spirit, the sort of guru

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.240
of the environmental movement,
for his influential book "Man

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.570
and Nature" which was
first published in 1864.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.490
But my study emphasizes his
earlier artistic interests

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.000
and his long-term connection
to the Smithsonian.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.760
Chapter Three places Marsh in
the context of the art market

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.540
of the 1840s and explores
the cultural background

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.580
at the time the Smithsonian
acquired the collection.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.330 position:56%
It introduces other antebellum
collectors, three men in particular,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.490
who had connections to Marsh
and to each other, Ithiel Town,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.630
Robert Gilmore Junior,
and Francis Calley Gray.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.630
Marsh's dealers and his specific
acquisitions are discussed

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.550
to provide a view of the book trade

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.910
and to demonstrate his
developing connoisseurship.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.720
Rather remarkably for the time, he
acquired the collection entirely

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.160
in the United States before his
diplomatic assignments took him

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.570
abroad, unlike these
three gentlemen,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.230
who began to form their collections
when traveling in Europe.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.230
Chapter Four relates the history of
the collection at the Smithsonian

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.070
up to the crisis of the 1865 fire
and its subsequent dispersal.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.610
It provides an overview of
the first quarter century

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.780
of the Smithsonian's activities
with a new focus on the library,

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.700
the role of the library, and
the non-scientific collections.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.290
Contrary to the generally accepted
image of the early Smithsonian

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.890
as exclusively scientific,
Marsh's prints were in place more

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.410
than a year before
Spencer Baird and his boxes

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.250
of natural history
specimens arrived,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.140
and nearly a decade
before exhibition cases

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.960
of those objects filled the
lower main hall of the castle.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.150
Other histories of the
Smithsonian have concentrated

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.980
on the scientific programs,
which dominated the institution

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.260
for most of the 19th century.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.150
To better understand the
Smithsonian's evolving organization

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.410
and changing priorities,
I traced what happened

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.890
to the Marsh collection over time.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.280
Ultimately surrounded by thousands
of birds, fishes, mammals,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.420
and minerals, the collection
may seem small by comparison,

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.840
but every mention of it has allowed
me to construct a fuller picture

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.380
of the Smithsonian's history

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.030
and the collection's role
within the institution.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.940
Chapter Five treats the growth of
the art market after the Civil War,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.580
with particular emphasis on
the reception and exhibition

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.490
of prints nationwide, including
the etching revival and the role

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.500
of new photo-mechanical
reproduction processes.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.860
It introduces significant
collectors like James Cleghorn,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.500
whose activities impacted
the Smithsonian,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.610
and it addresses the
growing body of literature

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.220
that informed new audiences
about prints.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.850
These developments influenced
the Smithsonian's efforts

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.530
to expand the National Museum
after 1880 with the construction

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.590
of what's now the Arts
and Industries building.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.010
Chapter Six recounts the formation
of the Division of Graphic Arts

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.210
at the Smithsonian in 1886, and
related developments at the Library

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.570
of Congress in the late 1890s.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.040
It describes the Smithsonian
deposit that includes portions

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.430
of the Marsh collection along

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.710
with 40,000 books sent
to LC after the fire.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.120
LC's use of the collection and
its subsequent print acquisitions

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.120
and exhibitions are discussed
in the context of the role

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.770
and reception of prints
in the period.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.190
It was at this time that the
Smithsonian began its efforts

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.370
to reclaim the Marsh
collection from the library,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.020
and from the Corcoran Gallery
of Art, with only mixed success.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.690
I will say everything came
back from the Corcoran,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.230
but a considerable number of prints

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.490
and books remain here
at the library.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.760
Chapter Seven includes an account
of Secretary Langley's construction

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.220
of the art room in the castle,
where many of the prints

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.610
and books resided, and it covers
the Smithsonian's acquisition

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.690
of art collections in the 20th
century, primarily painting

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.100
and sculpture, and its designation

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.920
as the first National
Gallery of Art.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.400 position:56%
Prints remained outside the scope of
that department for the most part,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.700
and in the later history

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.040
of the Marsh collection,
I address that paradox.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.690
Chapter Seven also treats
the eventual confusion

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.740
about the collection's origins, its
rumored destruction in the fire,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.980
and its current location.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.110
Chapter Eight concludes
the book with a discussion

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.090
of the Smithsonian's role in the
formation of national identity

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.740
through the lens of visual
culture, informed by museum studies

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.120
and broader historical references.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.300
I summarize the issues surrounding
the reception of print collections

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.480 position:56%
as they moved from private ownership
into museums and libraries,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.670
reflecting on the legacy of Marsh's
experience as part of this process.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.590
As many of you know, the Library

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.610
of Congress initially was intended
solely for the use of Congress.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.320
Only later, and somewhat
grudgingly, were privileges added

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.550
for Cabinet officers and
members of the Judiciary branch.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.370
Due to the limited scope of the
Congressional Library in the 1840s,

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.130
when it occupied a single
room in the capital,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.540
several legislators wanted
to use the Smithson bequest

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.930
to develop a more expansive
national library.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.660
They looked to the
nascent Smithsonian

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.040
as a possible alternative.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.120
Both the House and Senate had
separate library committees

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.780
that together functioned as the
Joint Committee on the Library

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.970 position:56%
to provide oversight on the
purchase of books and the regulation

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.050
of the Congressional Library.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.450
During his first term in
Congress, Marsh was appointed

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.410
to the House Library Committee.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.430 position:56%
He voted to increase the library's
budget, and he participated actively

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.670
in the congressional debates
over the Smithson bequest.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:01.150
In 1845, Marsh was appointed to
the seven-member select committee

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.150
of the Congress charged with
ending the years of wrangling

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.960
and recommending a course of
action to determine how best

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.680
to implement the Smithson bequest.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.800
In this capacity, he was
an important advocate

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.550
for developing the
intellectual direction

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.340
of the Smithsonian
during the debates

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.360
that framed the new institution.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.620
In the House, Marsh worked closely
with his fellow New England Whig,

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.910
John Quincy Adams, to present
the case for the Smithsonian

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.690
to become the National Library.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.460
They advocated on behalf
of the library plan,

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.520
and though in the minority,
they succeeded

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.010
in keeping a library as
part of the proposal.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.730
In April 1846, Marsh developed,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.580
delivered an eloquent speech before
the House detailing the arguments

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.390
for a National Library.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.060
In his remarks, he stressed

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.640
that despite James
Smithson's personal involvement

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.450
in the sciences, the benefactor
made no special provision

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.040
for his eponymous institution
to promote science.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.540
Marsh did not oppose the
scientific orientation

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.550
of other interests bearing on
the formation of the Smithsonian,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.410
but he felt that a library would do
more to affirm Smithson's language

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.830
in the bequest, the
now famous increase

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.850
and diffusion of knowledge clause.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:19.040
Among several means to accomplish
this end, he felt the simplest

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.790
and most efficient would be
the provision for a library,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.430
a museum, and a gallery of art.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.470
The tenor of his speech conveys
the sense of intellectual values

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.610
that Marsh, who was, in my
opinion, the consummate humanist,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.180
had found in studying
his own books and prints.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.350
As signed into law by President
James K. Polk on August 10th 1846,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.870
the Smithsonian's enabling
legislation provided

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.130
for the establishment of a Board of
Regents to govern the institution,

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.050
a building with rooms suitable
for the reception and arrangement

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.370
of objects of natural history, a
chemical laboratory, a library,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.480 position:56%
a gallery of art, and lecture rooms.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.210
It also provided for the transfer
to the institution of all objects

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.230
of art and foreign and curious
research, natural history plants,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.000
geological and mineralogical
specimens, namely the gatherings

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.730
of the U.S. exploring
expedition and other collections

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.510
that were then housed
at the patent office.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.790
And, the deposit in the Smithsonian
of one copy of all publications,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.030
books, prints, maps and charts,
copyrighted under act of Congress.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.900
Yes, for several years, the LC

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.910
and the SI shared the
fruits of copyright deposit.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.610
The new institution was
to be supported entirely

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.600
with private funds generated
by Smithson's bequest.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.480
Its government appropriation
and the official establishment

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.720
of the U.S. National Museum
would come a decade later.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.900
The Smithsonian's Board of Regents
included six members of Congress,

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.560
several of whom were active
in LC oversight as well.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.820 position:56%
Maryland Senator James Alfred Pierce
chaired the Executive Committee

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.870
of the Regents, and in that
capacity, he approved the purchase

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.470
of Marsh's collection
for the Smithsonian.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.420
He also chaired the Joint
Congressional Committee

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.060
on the Library, and as Ostrowski
argues in a fine article

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.160
about Pierce, his domineering
leadership limited the LC's

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.480
acquisitions, scope, and access
in the years before the Civil War.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.010
Joseph Henry, a distinguished
scientist

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.080 position:56%
and the first Smithsonian secretary,

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.930
wanted to concentrate the
institution's financial resources

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.520
on scientific research
and publication.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.130
And yet, rather surprisingly,
Henry not only approved,

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.510
but personally advanced funds for
the acquisition of Marsh's prints.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.640
No doubt he considered the purchase
to be politically expedient.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.840
Even so, it seems odd that the SI's
first major acquisition was some

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.720
1300 European engravings
and 300 art books.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.020
Hailed as translations of the best
creations of genius in painting

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.200
and sculpture, the collection
was viewed as a comprehensive way

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.560
for the new institution to cover
every department of the fine arts

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.950
and satisfy the congressional
mandate for a gallery.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.750
But the purchase occurred before
the Smithsonian had completed its

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.270
building, or found its direction,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.100 position:56%
and the organization didn't know
quite what to do with this treasure.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.900
Marsh had to sell portions
of his library

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.490
to cover serious financial losses.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.320
In May 1849, he formally offered
to sell the Smithsonian his prints

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.520
and books for $3000 as he
prepared to take up his new post

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.910
as U.S. minister to Turkey.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.390
Acquisition of the Marsh
collection was decidedly premature.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.740
The new institution was still
under construction in every sense.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.610 position:56%
Funds were tight with most
expenditures going toward completing

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.740
the castle, and the Marsh
purchase was kept very quiet

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.280
until a publication of
the 1850 annual report.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.610
Neither Henry nor the
librarian, Charles Coffin Jewett,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.860 position:56%
mentioned Marsh by name, as he had
requested strict anonymity in regard

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.730
to the purchase, probably to
keep his creditors at bay.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.820 position:56%
Jewett considered a print collection
the best opportunity to the,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.080
available to the institution
because he was not very optimistic

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.930
about the prospect
for acquiring painting

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.340
and sculpture of a similar caliber.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.170
The purchase represented
a remarkable,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.910 position:56%
if somewhat a rudimentary,
understanding within the Smithsonian

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.970
of the potential role for
public art collection.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.340
As Jewett observed, engraving
seems to be the only branch

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.770
of the fine arts which we can,
for the present, cultivate.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.940
One good picture or
statue would cost more

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.100
than a large collection of prints.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.450
It can hardly be doubted that in
no way could this institution do

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.610
so much for every department
of the fine arts

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.790
as by procuring a collection
of engravings, so full

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.090
and so well-chosen, as that
which now adorns its library.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:44.960
He went on to describe the
collection as containing some

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.460
of the best works of nearly
every engraver of much celebrity,

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.710
one portfolio of Dürer, another
of the etchings of Rembrandt,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.390
superb portraits by [inaudible],
Villa, [inaudible] and others,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.950
a portfolio of prints from the
old Italian masters and another

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.620
from the old German masters.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.590
Given the uncertainty of
the Smithsonian's mission

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.890
in the early years, it's open

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.830
to question whether the collection
was purchased for its aesthetic

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.360
and educational value,
its political expediency,

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.030
or to help Regent Marsh during
his financial difficulty.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.210
Henry suggested the prints would
form part of the Gallery of Art,

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.470
but they never were displayed
there and remained in the library.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.580
Reviewing the stages of the
castle's completion and occupation,

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.650 position:56%
together with a few archival sources

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.820
that mention the collection's
movements,

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.710 position:56%
help to clarify its historical role.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.470
We know it was received during
the spring and summer of 1849.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.700
At that point, only the east wing
and range, shown here in purple,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.930
were finished and occupied.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.090 position:56%
The books and prints were put in
order in a small room by themselves,

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.010
near Jewett's office on the
second floor of the east range.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:57.300
Then early in 1850, Jewett began to
move them across to larger spaces

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.110
in the newly completed west
wing and range, circled in red,

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.270
designated for the library.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.650
The move was complicated
by a partial collapse

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.970
of the interior flooring of
the unfinished main hall,

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.070
the large portion, central
portion of this plan.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.730
As a result of this accident
and subsequent reconstruction,

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.640
the main hall was essentially
empty until 1855

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.040
when the local mechanics fair
occupied the space temporarily.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.650
Legislation in 1857 established
a government appropriation

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.670
for the National Museum.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.090
In the summer of 1858, Curator
Spencer Baird began to bring

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.330
over the collections
from the patent office,

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:41.280
an effort that continued
until, through 1862.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.180
So the museum function of the
Smithsonian began to take shape,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.780
filling the castle's main hall
with scientific specimens.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.340
The Marsh collection
was not displayed there.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.160
It remained, as it had
during the previous decade,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.430
in the library in the west wing.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:01.090
Marsh's portfolios of prints and
art volumes rested in bookcases

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.500
in the gothic style library.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.720
Until completion of
the upper main hall,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.010
the apps at the North End served
as a gallery for the paintings

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.550
of Indian life loaned by
the artist John Mix Stanley.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.140
This illustration published
in 1853 is one

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.150 position:56%
of the earliest interior views, and
one of the few contemporary sources,

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.610
that indicate visually how the
Smithsonian spaces were used

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.200
by the public.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.600
The genteel figures conveys the
tenor of Jewett's, Jewett's comment

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.310
about those who enjoyed
Marsh's collection.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.520
It had attracted much interest,
not from undiscriminating idlers,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.370
but from men of taste and
particularly from artists.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.300
Henry recognized the institution's
investment in the prints

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.710
and his references to the
collection during the 1850s

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.690
and 60s suggested it
served as a marker

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.420
of the cultural authority he
hoped the works would bring

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.110
to the institution.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.350
Invariably, in annual
reports, he referred to it

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.830
as "this valuable collection
of engravings."

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.780
While no catalog was ever issued,
some of the prints were framed

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.240
and hung in different
parts of the building.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.410
The only Marsh print specifically
identified as being exhibited

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.330
in this way was Rembrandt's
etching, Christ healing the sick,

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:17.010
which an 1861 guidebook located in
the west range near the library.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.360
Selling his collection

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.870
to the Smithsonian reinforced the
library plan promoted by Marsh

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.850
and his allies for the
direction of the institution.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.210
Such a prestigious gathering

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.220
of European cultural sources
formed an important nucleus

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.850
for the Smithsonian library
and should have argued

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.920
for its continued support, although
the situation changed dramatically

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.560
in less than a decade.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.070
Henry dismissed the
librarian Jewett in 1854,

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.440
and then after the 1865 fire,
he dispersed the library,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.420
sending it with most
of the Marsh collection

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.550
to the Library of Congress.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.770
Many people have assumed
the collection was destroyed

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.800
at that time, but the west wing
of the castle was undamaged.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.530
What did burn was the Gallery
of Art that had moved in 1854

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.760
to the second floor
of the main hall,

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.520
which as you can see is
roofless in this photo.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.760
That resulted in the loss of the
paintings of Native Americans

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.250
by Stanley and Charles Bird
King that Henry had regarded

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:16.460
as an ethnological
gallery of much interest.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.100
While not damaged by the fire,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.940
the Marsh collection did
effectively disappear

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.950
into the somewhat amorphous
Smithsonian deposit at LC.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.510
Several dozen engravings that
remained behind were sent

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.070
to the new Corcoran Gallery of Art
where Henry served on the board

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.130
when that opened in 1874.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.430
The institutional memory

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.380
of the Marsh collection did not
fade completely with its dispersal.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.050
Following Henry's death in 1878,
Marsh's protégé, Spencer Baird,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.880
became secretary, and within a
few years he initiated efforts

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.160
to retrieve the collection.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.340
When the new U.S. National Museum
building opened next to the castle

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.170
in 1881, the graphic
arts became part

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.650
of Baird's classification scheme
for the arts and industries,

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.680
taking as its scope the development
of engraving, engraving processes

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.270
over time, which had
been Marsh's focus

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.640
for his collection
forty years before.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.930
Graphic arts exhibits were
developed during the 1880s,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.970
and Sylvester Koehler was
hired as curator in 1886.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.230
Baird invoked the Marsh collection
early in his correspondence

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.750
with Koehler, telling him
that they expected to draw

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.650
on Marsh's collection to illustrate
the early history of engraving.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.410
In Baird's mind, the
prints could be recalled,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.540
but unfortunately not every
item could be located.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.740
The engraving sent to the
Corcoran had been listed.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.470
They were identified
and returned in 1896.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.400
But retrieving the larger portion
of the collection from the Library

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.350
of Congress resulted
in only mixed success.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.870 position:56%
Some items were returned in 1888 for
the expanding graphic arts exhibits

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.080
in the National Museum,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.250
but the reclamation efforts were
severely hampered by the deaths

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.670 position:56%
of those men who were most involved.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.930
Baird died in 1887, Assistant
Secretary George Brown Goode died

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.100
in 1896, and Koehler died in 1900.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.610
Even more critical for the
Marsh collection and the role

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.160
of graphic art within the
SI, no curator was appointed

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.250
to follow Koehler for twenty years.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:24.610
Samuel Pierpont Langley became
secretary on Baird's death

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.720
and he continued the attempts
to recover the prints.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.680
Competition for old
master-prints was keen at the time,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.940
with the formation of art museums
in several American cities,

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.110
an active group of
wealthy collectors,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.860 position:56%
and rising prices in the art market.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.080
Langley wanted to report to the
regents on the present condition,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.480
artistic and pecuniary value
of the Marsh collection.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.000
So in 1893, he inquired at LC about
the accessibility of the prints

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.120
and facilities for
their examination.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.880
But the library also
realized their value

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.470
and had become rather
attached to them [laughter].

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.120
Moreover, they were busy
constructing a new building

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.660
and they kept putting the
Smithsonian off with the excuse

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.480
that they would look
for the collection

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.790
when they moved things
out of the Capital.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.160
In the late 1890s, Langley,
as I said, created an art room

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.920
in the castle where most of
the returned items were kept,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.380
those that were not on exhibition.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.180
In an ironic coincidence,
Marsh's collection returned

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.980
to the second floor of the
East Range near the spot

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.080
where it had first entered the
Smithsonian fifty years before.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.480
The 1865 fire at the Smithsonian
followed a serious fire here,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.600
not here in this building, but
here at the library in 1851,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.420
and the construction in
1852 of fireproof rooms

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.880
in the library's quarters
at the Capital.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.630 position:56%
This created a circumstance which
offered Joseph Henry the opportunity

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.910
to find a new home for the
Smithsonian's books and prints.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.020 position:56%
With Ainsworth Rand Spofford's
appointment as Librarian of Congress

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.050
in 1864, a more expansive and
truly national role became possible

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.870
for the library.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.360
Eventually it developed
into the kind of institution

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.170
that the proponents of the
library plan, including Marsh

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.620
and John Quincy Adams, had
argued for the Smithsonian to be.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.510
Henry and Spofford worked together
to secure a passage of a law signed

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.400
on 5th of April, 1866, which
defined the arrangement

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.860
between the two institutions.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.150
Like all relationships, this
one required some attention,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.450
but its official basis

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.100
in law encouraged the
resolution of most problems.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.010
The Smithsonian did not surrender
ownership of its library,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.570
which became known officially
as the Smithsonian deposit.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.010
There were benefits
to both institutions

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.960 position:56%
in that the Smithsonian gained space

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.120
and saved resources formally
expended on managing a library.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.610
Henry had ended the Smithsonian's
role as a copyright depository

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.980
in 1858, they were being
absolutely inundated with material

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.750
that was way out of
scope for the SI.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.880
And the library received
nearly 40,000 volumes

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.650
that represented an
invaluable scientific department

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.240
without material cost.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.540
The largest portion of the deposit
resulted from the exchange program

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.890
of the transactions of learned
societies and other scientific

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:18.100 position:56%
and technical journals received from
many organizations around the world.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.780 position:56%
These works continued to be received

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.110
at the Smithsonian
on a regular basis.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.580
So staff members at both
institutions were assigned

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:30.360
to handle the flow of additions
to the deposit at the library.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.790 position:56%
Through the success of the exchange
program and the sole proprietorship,

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.800
as it were, of copyright deposit,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.830
the Library of Congress collections
grew exponentially during

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.490
Spofford's tenure.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.290
Their growth soon prompted a
need for physical expansion

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.850
and improved intellectual
control, two issues that often came

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.510
up in the library's annual reports.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:57.050 position:56%
Overcrowding became a serious
problem in the Capital, and by 1886,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.130
plans for a separate
building had been approved.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.240 position:56%
At the time of the first Smithsonian
inquiries about the Marsh prints,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.060
Spofford had to deal with
more pressing concerns related

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.470 position:56%
to the building and the collections.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.510
Without documentation regarding
the contents of the deposit,

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.910
he had some excuse for delay.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.170
But as will be shown, there
was also an ulterior motive

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.290
in his muted response.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.650
The Smithsonian's attempts

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.730 position:56%
to restore the Marsh collection were
driven by the exhibition program

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.620
at the new National Museum,
and an ambitious agenda

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.930
of participating in
national expositions.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.500
To complete the historical series

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.140
for the permanent Washington
installation,

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.910
and a large temporary exhibit
held in Cincinnati in 1888,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.090
Koehler needed to acquire
old master-prints

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.720
and specific reproductive
engravings.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.220
He worked with Assistant Secretary
Goode to investigate the status

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.170 position:56%
and location of the Marsh collection
in the hope of including items

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.550
from it in his planned exhibitions.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.780
The Smithsonian did
retrieve some items

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.320
from the library early in 1888.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.290
These included Marsh's German
album, the two large folio volumes

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.300
of Houghton Gallery, and
three Dürer woodcuts.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.570
Koehler entered the three Dürer
prints and six other items removed

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.380
from these volumes into his
print accession book in 1889.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.160 position:56%
As he stated that year in his annual
report, "I would further suggest

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.160
that what is left of the Marsh
collection, bought in 1849,

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.300
be definitely turned over to
the section of graphic arts."

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.130
Unfortunately, the largest and most
desirable parts of this collection,

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.500
including all the fine
Dürer and Rembrandts,

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.610
etc. which the original
inventory enumerates,

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.070
have unaccountably disappeared.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.910
But there still remain several
volumes of single prints

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:45.560
and presumably the various
gallery works belonging to it,

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.520
which if added to the present
collections of the section,

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.440
would considerately
increase their interest.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.260
Koehler also argued for the return
of books from Marsh's library.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.080
He believed they offered a nucleus
of great value for the section

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.120
of graphic arts, which
needed technical

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.900
and historical works of reference.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.080 position:56%
He probably retrieved Marsh's copy
of [inaudible] dictionary of artists

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.620
and Longhi's treatise on
engraving at this time.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.920
Other volumes returned

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.930
in 1888 included a few French
works on art and design.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:19.890
It's not clear exactly
how many books

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.380
or portfolios actually
were returned,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.200
a point which arose
in later discussions.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.910
Copies of the original sales
agreement identified the books

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.840
by title, but did not itemize
the prints within the portfolios.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.930
The collection was not accessioned
or registered when it first arrived

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.480
at the Smithsonian nor when
it was sent to the library.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.760
But there was some system that
employed red and blue checkmarks,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.990
perhaps related to a lost list.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.670
It seems that by the late
1880s, the portfolios

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.530
that Marsh had designated,
containing works by Dürer

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.720
and Rembrandt, either could not
be located or had been broken up.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.420
It's possible they
had been picked over,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.220
or some of their contents lost,
either during their early years

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.380
in the Smithsonian or in the
somewhat disorderly atmosphere

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.570
of the library's rooms
in the Capital.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:11.930
These losses could have
occurred at either institution.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:16.070
The initial Smithsonian request to
the library regarding the return

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.310
of the collection was made
during the preparation

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.860
of the temporary exhibit for
the Cincinnati fair of 1888.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.070 position:56%
Five years later, as the institution
assembled another display

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.380
for the world's Columbian
exposition to be held in Chicago,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.360
further inquiries were made but
they received little response.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.550
Secretary Langley corresponded
with Spofford in May 1893.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.540
Revising, revisiting the question
of the Marsh prints that remained

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.300
at the library, Langley wrote,
"the institution now finds itself

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.230
in a position to resume their care

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.520
and is considering the
advisability of doing so."

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.450
But he did not ask for
their outright return.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.920
He recognized the difficulty of
determining the specific contents

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.590
of the collection beyond what
had been returned in 1888.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.670
The lack of registration for the
collection sent to the library,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.720
together with inconsistent formats
of single prints, portfolios,

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.200
and bound volumes of engravings,
must have confused the process.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.040
He enclosed a list of the works
delivered to your keeping in 1886,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.960
which is complete so far as is
known, but which I have reason

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.290
to suppose did not include
many things actually sent.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.480
While the list specifies the number
and general character of engravings

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.300
in each portfolio, it
does not, I regret to say,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.720
appear to correctly specify
the number of portfolios

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.150
or specify each separate engraving.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:40.320
This list, which I have not
located, apparently was based

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.290
on Marsh's original sales agreement
with additional details supplied

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.500
from Jewett's 1850 report.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.670
But it must have merely reflected
these earlier compilations

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.390
and still did not accurately
identify what actually had

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.870
been sent.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.140
Langley asked Spofford to
investigate the preparation

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:01.020
of requisite facilities for
examination by a suitable person,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.170
presumably that would be
Koehler, within the next month.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.170
But there is no indication
of any response

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.880
or any subsequent examination
by Smithsonian personnel.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:18.000
So the Marsh collection has
become a contested treasure.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.750
In his 1896 report to the Board of
Regents, Langley discussed the role

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.300
of art and the value of
the Marsh collection.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.240
He stated that the original act
creating the Smithsonian had

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.550
mentioned art objects before
those of natural history,

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:31.850
yet the scientific side

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.450
of the institution had outpaced
its aesthetic activities.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.270
He felt the original intent by
Congress was for the Smithsonian

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.030
to be a curator of the national art

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.500
and that this function
has never been forgotten,

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.730
although often in abeyance.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.350
He asked the Regents to take formal
action to reclaim the engravings,

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.420
etchings, and other works of
art dispersed to the Corcoran

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.190
and to the Library of Congress.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.910
As he stated, the transfer was
made with the express understanding

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.710
that they were there for
deposit only and to be reclaimed

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.820
by the regents at any time.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.130
Beyond the immediate
need for exhibition use,

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:10.040
other factors prompted
this renewed interest.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.530
Langley understood the important
role of prints in the culture,

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.650
both in terms of their function
as surrogates or reproductions

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.950
for those still assumed to be
unobtainable works of painting

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.960
and sculpture, and as markers

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.700
of cultural authority
for the institution.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.280
There was also the question
of their monetary value,

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.220
and he stressed the
increase in their worth

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.580
since the initial purchase.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.090
Almost all of the engravings sent

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.550
to the Corcoran were
located and returned.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.040 position:56%
Even upon Langley's official request
however, it still proved difficult

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.640
for the Library of Congress
to identify Marsh's prints.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.110
In theory, the Smithsonian deposit
had its own separate dedicated

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.750 position:56%
section within the library, but over
the years those arrangements had

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.220
become rather lax as the
library's acquisitions outgrew

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.250
available storage.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.280
While working to retrieve
the Marsh collection,

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.290
Langley implicitly reaffirmed
the Smithsonian's ownership

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.360
of all the deposit material,
which remained a critical resource

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.050
for the institution's
research staff.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.590
For the better part of
a decade, correspondence

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.590
between Smithsonian secretaries
and the Librarian of Congress fell

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.000
into a pattern of repeated requests
by the Smithsonian and a litany

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.640
of excuses pleading for
more time from the library.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.090
Spofford was deeply
engaged in planning

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.720
and constructing the
library's new building,

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.820
and he seems to have
pacified the Smithsonian

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.540
by saying they would look for the
missing volumes and engravings

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.540
when the collections were
moved from the capital.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.620
However, when the splendid
edifice now known

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.320
as the Library's Jefferson
building opened in 1897,

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.910
there was a large gallery on
the second floor dedicated

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.040
to the display of prints.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.600
Several exhibition cases

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.000
in this grand space contained
prints identified as selections

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.100
from the Marsh collection.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.210
Far from being unable to identify
which prints had come from Marsh,

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.780
it seems the library had
other plans for them.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.450
With the new building
came a new agenda

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.170
and a new department
devoted to prints.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.020
Marsh's collection was an important
component of this new endeavor

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.340
for the library, which reflected
the considerable interest in prints

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.300
in American society at that time.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.750
Neither Spofford nor his
successors were inclined

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.780
to return the Marsh collection.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.640
In their view, the collection
was better suited to the Library

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.900
of Congress than to
the National Museum.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.240
As the newly appointed Librarian
Herbert Putnam wrote to Langley

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.750
in 1899, in a conversation at your
office some weeks ago you mentioned

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.700
to me the Marsh collection
of engravings

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.300
as having disappeared from view.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.680
I have had an examination made
here and am inclined to believe

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.170
that the Marsh collection came to
the library, and that it forms now,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.560
part of the collection of prints.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.190
Some of the engravings
now on exhibit

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.940
in the print department
are examples from it.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.700
We do not however, find any record
that is precise as to the contents

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.850
of the collection when
transferred to us.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:08.160
It would be a satisfaction to you,
as to us, to have such a record.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.740
And later in the course of the
classification and arrangement

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.320
of the print department
in competent hands,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.500
such a statement could
doubtless be compiled.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.950
So Putnam admits to the library's
possession of the Marsh prints,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.860
but at this point, they
were on public display

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.330
and obviously considered part
of the library's collection.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.410
He seemed to be willing to make a
record of them, but said nothing

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:32.160
about restitution to
the Smithsonian.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.050 position:56%
Most tellingly, Putnam used the word
transfer instead of the word deposit

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:41.040 position:56%
in reference to the prints, although
other Smithsonian items mentioned

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.920
in this same letter were
identified as deposits.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.150
Putnam left no doubt about
the library's position.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.460 position:56%
And to reinforce it, he sent on loan
a volume with thirty-three pieces

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.510
of flags captured by
American ships in 1812

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:00.950 position:56%
as material deemed more
appropriate for the National Museum.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.060
Putnam's position favored
leaving the prints in the library,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.130
perhaps because he
considered them to be more

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.840
like books than museum objects.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.120
Prints were held in many library
collections as well as in museums.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.560
Individual collectors, like Marsh
and others, acquired both books

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.150
and prints without much concern
for separation by medium or format.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.160
The practice of extra illustration
was at its height at this time,

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.340
and many collectors eagerly
acquired prints which they used

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.600
to embellish bound volumes.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.510
Distinctions between prints and
books were not clearly defined,

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.310
or consistently observed, as
reflected in their close affinities

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.240
over centuries of collecting.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.380
Another factor that
contributed to the dispute

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.100
over the collection was the
cultural importance of prints.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.630
What one curator has called
the great bull market imprints,

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.040 position:56%
extended from about 1870 all the way

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.700
to the Great Depression,
ending about 1930.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.200 position:56%
Engravings and etchings continued to
be sought after in the art market,

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.860
and their acquisition represented
significant achievements

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.290
for institutions as well
as individual collectors.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.160 position:56%
George W Vanderbilt, in his palatial
North Carolina home, Biltmore,

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.590
completed in 1895, displayed
many prints including Dürer's

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.670
multi-sheet woodcut, the triumphal
arch, now in the music room.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.030
Institutions vied with each other
to capture the largest collection

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.230
from the most important collectors.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.450 position:56%
They exhibited their prints proudly,
featuring these works almost

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.340
like the trophy heads, shot and
mounted by big game hunters.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.690
In this environment, it's no wonder
that these two institutions vied

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.840
for this, for this collection.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.770
Soon after the opening
of the Jefferson building

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.630
and its print gallery,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.340 position:56%
library employee Jessie Porter Woode
reported on the division of prints

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.870
in the American art annual.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.430
Although not designated a curator,

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.050
Woode obviously knew
the collection well.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.930
She was hired in 1897 as an
assistant in the reading room.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:01.520 position:56%
As an artist, she may have proved
herself useful to this new division.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.810
The Library of Congress
first began to hire women

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.990
with the opening of
the new building.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.790
These appointments were considered
an experiment, and in the opinion

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.020
of Librarian John Russell Young,
"open to debate" [laughter].

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.600
He felt that manual labor
involved in handling

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.500
and organizing library materials,
especially as part of the move

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.260 position:56%
from the capital, was too
difficult for women, for whom gentle

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.060
and more useful offices
were more suitable.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.170
Perhaps this gender bias actually
operated to Woode's benefit

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.740
by placing her in the
print department

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.530
where she seems to
have had an affinity.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.930
The Marsh collection received
prominent mention in her entry

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:42.890
for the art annual, and this
is the page illustrating it.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.920
While acknowledging that
the collection belonged

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.790 position:56%
to the Smithsonian, the article
nonetheless included an illustration

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.940
that identified it as
a prominent component

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.140
of the library's print exhibit.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.070
Woode mistakenly assumed that
Marsh had assembled the collection

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.590
in Europe while serving
as U.S. minister to Italy,

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.970
but he wasn't appointed
to that post until 1861.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.260
She also commented, incorrectly,

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.220
that many of the most
valuable prints were retained

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.090
by the Smithsonian.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.370 position:56%
She described the collection using
language that, half a century later,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.080
still borrowed from
Jewett's annual report.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.480
But she did offer some new
information about the division

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.520
of individual portfolios between
the library and the Smithsonian.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.800
In enumerating the Dürers, she
tallied 100 prints that remained

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.690
at the library, including the
engravings Marcantonio copied

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.670
after Dürer's woodcut
life of the Virgin,

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.080
which the 1850 report had
described as the "famous seventeen"

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.380
in reference to the lawsuit

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.610
that Dürer supposedly
instigated over this plagiarism.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.670
The Rembrandt portfolio, she
said, was largely picked over

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.220
and the better part
kept at the Smithsonian.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.150
Also, the third portfolio
containing 200 engravings

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:55.190
by Claude Lorraine,
Hollar, and Vega.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:58.140
That assessment does not tally
with the current locations

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.020
for these prints, and she did not
mention Marsh's early 16th century

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.750
chiaroscuro woodcuts by
Hugo di Carpi and Coriolano

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.060
that remain at the library.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.450
Woode's article provides
some specific clues

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:14.680
about which prints were located
in each institution around 1900.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.500
But her notion of their division
and distribution made it sound

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.700 position:56%
like the two institutions had agreed
to some equitable disposition,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.850
even though such a
process is not reflected

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.070
in the surviving correspondents.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.720
Her description continued.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.250
The contents of a fourth
portfolio were divided

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.440
and the library received a
collection of engraved portraits

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.420
by [inaudible], among them, a first
impression of Louis XIV in armor,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.230
8 by [inaudible], and a number

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.460
by [inaudible] [foreign
language], and others.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:48.790
There's also a scrapbook in which
is arranged a beautiful collection

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.230
of portraits of the French
school in the 17th century.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.270
The fifth portfolio,
reported to contain examples

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.190
of old Italian engravings,
was probably culled

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.250
over at the Smithsonian
and the better part kept.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.390
For the library has only a few,
among them, two by Marcantonio

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:10.200 position:56%
and some representative prints from
the hand of Karachi, Salvatore Rosa,

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.810
[inaudible], Volpato
and Rafael Morgan.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.360
Added to this is a small
collection of Dutch, Flemish,

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.430
and English prints of the
16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:24.400
Woode concluded that the Marsh
collection illustrated the growth

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.580
of engraving, and that it
was splendidly supplemented

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.590
by the recent acquisition
of the Hubbard collection.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.450 position:56%
The Gardner Green Hubbard collection
was another bone of contention

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.760
between the library
and the Smithsonian.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.860
Hubbard, a founder of the
Bell telephone company,

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.500
was a wealthy philanthropist
who also served as president

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.110
of the National Geographic Society.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.970
Langley named Hubbard to the
Smithsonian's Board of Regents

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.990
in 1895, presumably in
the hope of wooing him

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.530
and his renowned collection
of prints.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.770
Assistant Secretary Goode knew
Hubbard well and advised him

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.570
about Japanese prints, rare books,

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.270
and their shared interest
in genealogy.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.810 position:56%
After Hubbard died in December 1897,

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.170
his widow Gertrude gave the
collection to the Library

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.760
of Congress, although she seems

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.550
to have negotiated
with both institutions.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.230
She corresponded with Koehler
about some of the prints

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.030
and she set certain conditions

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:18.800
that the Smithsonian was either
able or unwilling to meet.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.120
She wanted a named gallery
for a perpetual exhibition

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.810
of the collection, complete
with her husband's bust,

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.580
and this stipulation
was incompatible

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.540
with the National Museum's
exhibition policy.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.560
In accepting the gift for the
library however, the Senate failed

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.360
to approve naming the
gallery for an individual.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.580
The practice was considered
unsuitable

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.350
and undesirable in
a public building.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.360
Perhaps the Smithsonian
should've tried harder

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.100
to acquire Hubbard's collection

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.290
if that was the main objection
to the term of the gift.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:53.460
It's very possible too that Goode's
untimely death in 1896 was a factor

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.330
in the Hubbard's decision
to donate to the library,

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.260
as his loss certainly
figured in the failure

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.670
to restore the Marsh
collection to the Smithsonian.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.490
John Russell Young, who served
as Librarian of Congress

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.330
for a brief interlude
between Spofford and Putnam,

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.950
wrote eloquently about
Hubbard's prints.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:15.170
The collection was described as, in
many respects, the most instructive

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.960
and valuable in the country,

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.490
words that resemble
Jewett's justification

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.060
for the Marsh purchase.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.720
Tastes hadn't changed, and
many of the same artists

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.940
and prints were represented.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.210
Young's 1898 report on the
library included an appendix

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.140
on the Smithsonian that
concerned relations

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.980
between the two institutions.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.070
Langley was invited to participate,

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:38.560
and his remarks corresponded
somewhat with spot, a contribution

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.700
that Spofford made to the 1896
history of the Smithsonian.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.240
So despite the impasse
over the Marsh collection,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.680
the two institutions remained

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.110
in reasonably cordial
professional relation.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.480
In the early years
of the 20th century,

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.120
several initiatives propelled the
Smithsonian into the realm of art.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.690
Gifts of painting and sculpture
prompted its designation

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.880 position:56%
as the National Gallery, and Charles
Lang Freer's significant donation

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.200
of Asian and American works led to
the creation of the Freer Gallery

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.900
of Art as a separate museum
within the institution.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.720
The Smithsonian's official
recognition as the National Gallery

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.020
of Art, the name that
was in use until 1937,

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.240
when the melon gift created
another National Gallery of Art

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.200 position:56%
at the east end of them all,
resulted from the terms of a bequest

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.600 position:56%
by Harriet Lane Johnston, a niece of
President Buchanan, who stipulated

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.900
that her collection of painting

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.710
and sculpture be placed
in a National Gallery.

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:36.800
In 1906, the Supreme Court of
the District of Columbia ruled

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.350
that the Smithsonian could be
considered within the definition

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.110
of a National Gallery based
on the original language

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.620
of the enabling legislation.

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.930
So Johnston's collection
came to the institution,

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:51.510
soon followed by the William
Evans gift and several others.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:53.880
Washington newspapers
covered the story as if

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.680
to say the Smithsonian was always
intended as a National Gallery,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.640
designed to cherish
art, one headline read,

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.920
a prime duty of the
Smithsonian since its founding.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.900
Well, not exactly, as we've seen.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.650
Articles focused on
the new collections,

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.910
but also mentioned Marsh
as a historical example.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:15.740
The early Marsh purchase was
cited as a lucky speculation,

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.720
and its location

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.350
at the Congressional Library
only a temporary deposit.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.380
Another article, while giving most
attention to the Johnson, Evans,

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.800
and Freer gifts, also mentioned
Marsh's valuable etchings

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.070
and engravings, noting that they
resided at the Library of Congress,

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.710
but expressing the idea that they
would probably soon be transferred

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.440
to the new National Gallery.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.470 position:56%
This information may have been given
to the press by the Smithsonian

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.710
in the hope of finally
retrieving the collection

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.620
from the library, but
it was not to be.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:50.400 position:56%
Langley died in 1906 and subsequent
secretaries made no sustained effort

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.280
to reclaim the prints.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.020
In the end, administrative
decisions made

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:59.920
in later decades favored leaving
the entire Smithsonian deposit,

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.520
including Marsh's collection,
at the Library of Congress.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.100
What began in the 1840s as an
individual scholar's gathering

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.090
for his personal enjoyment
and to share

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:13.090
with his friends became a
public collection available

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:16.540
to national audiences for more
than a century and a half.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.240
As accessible objects with
shared social meaning,

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.770
these prints contributed
to the growth

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.350
of the Smithsonian in
its formative years.

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:26.210
The story of building this private
collection informed the public

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.700
process of institution building.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.480
The Marsh collection
was a critical element

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.100
in the Smithsonian's
development of cultural authority

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.830
as the United States took its place

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.710
as a new nation facing
the old world.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:40.240
Traditional European works
were considered necessary

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.180
for international credibility,

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.720
and Marsh's prints came
ready-made to suit that purpose.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.800
The same impulses obtained at the
Library of Congress as it expanded

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.630
in a period when prints were highly
valued, leading to their efforts

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.600
to retain the collection.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.280
In both institutions, the presence

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.890
of the Marsh collection enriched
the nation's cultural heritage.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:04.230
I'd like to thank my
colleagues here at LC once again,

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.140
for their valued cooperation.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.780
I know they are just as pleased
as I am to uncover the [inaudible]

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.710
of Marsh's prints and
books that remain here,

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.350
which we are still identifying.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:17.060
Digital imaging options
now allow for collections

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.120
to reach a wide audience online.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.920
You can see the entries
that we're posting

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:27.770
on the American history website at
marshcollection.si.edu and other,

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.080
other images here at loc.gov.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.060
Their physical locations
become less important as long

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.910
as they are well documented.

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:40.110
Together, we're making up for
the decades of lost information.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.410
Thank you.

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:47.190
[applause]

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:48.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We have time for a few questions.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:50.110
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Okay, sure.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.410
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.360
&gt;&gt; We have a new batch of
scans on the works, don't we?

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.050
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: We do.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:55:02.990
&gt;&gt; So we have about twenty
more beautiful scans on the,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:08.020
in our [inaudible] shortly
based on your research.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:13.140
I mean, you're really helping us
to reconstruct the collection.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.440
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright:
Well, it's been a pleasure

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.740
to work with you, I must say.

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:19.570
And if you do want to find
them, the best way is to type

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:26.370
"marsh collection" in quotes in the
prints and photographs search page.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.670
&gt;&gt; Other questions?

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:28.970
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Linda, hi.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:30.270
&gt;&gt; Hi Helena.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.720
Thank you so very much,
it was fascinating.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.280
So his focus, Marsh's focus,
was on the copper plate.

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:42.680
So how is it that some
woodcuts, do you have any idea,

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.770
was there any indication of why
he did acquire some woodcuts?

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.710
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Well he
was interested in early prints.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.900
He uses, they use the
term engravings

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.030
as a rather encyclopedic
description.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.170
He's not restricting
it by medium really.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.470
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:59.770
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright:
He's including woodcut.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:03.920
He had quite a number of
woodcuts in the collection.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Not just the
wonderful chiaroscuros that you know

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.920
so much about, but the Dürer
woodcuts and others, so.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.160
&gt;&gt; So he considered -

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.460
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: It was a,

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.620
it was a kind of a
generic term at the time.

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.190
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.520
Okay. Thank you.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.720
&gt;&gt; Do you know if he
continued collecting

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.020
after he went to Turkey and -

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.730
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Well I, that
was one of my early questions,

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:31.980
and using the Marsh papers
at the University of Vermont,

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.020
it's pretty clear that he did not.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.780
Much of my information about the
formation of the collection comes

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.960 position:56%
from the invoices which remain there
so we can track what he acquired,

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.160
when he got it, the fact that
he was using mostly booksellers

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.890
in the United States, some
of whom wrote abroad for him

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:53.310
or he would use European
catalogs and mark the things off

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.280
and tell them what he wanted.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.680
But it was a lot of
shipment and buying a lot

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.120
of unseen things that
were sight unseen.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.960
He was going on the basis
of reference material, so.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:10.250
But no, he didn't, he did not
seem to acquire, primarily I think

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:12.750
because his financial
situation was always, I mean,

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.650
he was never a very, very flush.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:19.680
He took these two diplomatic
assignments as a way of,

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.990
he thought it was at
a cheaper way to live.

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:26.650
He got a pretty good stipend and
could live more economically abroad

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:30.140
but his situation here
was not very good.

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:34.210
He lost a lot of money in the panic
of 1837 that didn't really catch

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:38.470
up with him until the 40s,
like several other people.

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:41.330
Actually the other two collectors
I mentioned, Robert Gilmore

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:45.010
and Francis Collay Gray also
lost quite a bit of money

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:48.370
in the 1840s and were pretty shaky.

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:53.380
Gilmore had to sell his collection
and Gray was rescued by a nephew

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.860
who helped him with investment
so he was able to retain it

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.800
and his collection is now at
Harvard and there's a complete,

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.370
a pretty complete collection
of that.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:04.180
So it's interesting to compare
what these individuals acquired

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.890
at roughly the same time
and a rather odd coincidence

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:12.570
that they had essentially
bankruptcy problems

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:13.950
at essentially the same time.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.250
Yes.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.250
&gt;&gt; Where is the Marsh
collection contained

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:23.420
in the Smithsonian
in your department?

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: It's in the, in
the graphic arts department division

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:30.640
of the National Museum
of American History.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.030
As you may know, we were the
Museum of History and Technology

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:39.820
for many years and we were the
descendant of the early division

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:45.050
of graphic arts that was formed
in the ANI building in the 1880s.

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:50.140
So, we have the oldest print
collection in the Smithsonian as a,

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.000
it's a legacy collection of that,
and it is not necessarily related

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.600
to American history, although
Marsh is an American congressman

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.980
and the story of what he
acquired is of interest

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.120 position:56%
to American history even though what
he acquired was not American, so.

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.990
And he was a member of
the American Art Union.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.490
He did have some American
prints, but they didn't come to,

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.130
with the rest of the collection.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.460
I don't know what happened to them.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:15.750
&gt;&gt; And his books are also in
the graphic art department

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.050
or they're in the library?

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:19.110
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: A few of
his, well, the books that he sold

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:23.080
to the Smithsonian, some
of them were retrieved

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.060
with that early batch in the 1880s.

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:29.030 position:56%
So his, some of his reference books,
and some of the large illustrated,

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:31.220
books that are illustrated
with engravings,

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:35.390
probably three dozen or so.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.430
There are, I'm assuming that the
rest of the books he sold are

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:42.490
in the library's collection,
some probably in rare books,

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:45.060
some in the general
collection perhaps.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.030
But his, he did, he did
continue to collect books.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.980
He couldn't stop himself
from collecting books

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.280
and they were, they were cheaper.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.070
The art market was rising rapidly

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:57.450 position:56%
so that was another reason he
didn't replace the print collection.

00:59:57.450 --> 01:00:02.070
But he did continue to acquire
books and those were purchased

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:08.010
from his widow and are in
the library at the University

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.220
of Vermont where his papers are.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:15.310 position:56%
But they are not on, necessarily on
art subjects, there are a few things

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:20.350
that published later, later in the
19th century on art topics but.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.480
Yes.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:28.100
&gt;&gt; And he, you say that when the
Smithsonian originally acquired the

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.250
Marsh, or purchased the Marsh
collection, it was in portfolios

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.750
and albums and a single sheet.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:38.070
So were the, were the albums
things that he assembled

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:43.920
or did he acquire albums
as a, as an item?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.220
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright:
Well, the only one

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:49.860
that remains intact is this early
German album and that has his hand,

01:00:49.860 --> 01:01:00.240
I can show you the image of that,
perhaps if I can get back to it.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.470
This is something that our paper
conservator went over with me.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:14.060
He, okay, he ruled around
each of these prints.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.040
He wrote their batch numbers
just to the bottom left.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.580
I'm not sure if you
can see that in the.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.180
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Or I should,
I should, I should make that.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.730
&gt;&gt; Well there's something
at the bottom right.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:26.590
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Yeah.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:31.550
I should make that the slideshow.

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.500
Oops. Well, I'm sorry, I was
trying to hit the current slide.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.840
Anyway, It's manila
paper that he ruled

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.550
and wrote the batch numbers on.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.570
So he assembled those.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:44.790
But as far as the rest
of them, who knows.

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.360
Some of them have little
numbers, little pencil numbers

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.700
in his handwriting indicating an
order, some of the larger prints.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.980
So that might've been their
order within the portfolio,

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.380
but I don't know what the
portfolio itself looked like.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.720
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.450
&gt;&gt; We can take two more questions

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:00.950
and then we're going
to have a book signing.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.040
Does anybody else want to?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.340
Yes sir.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.880
&gt;&gt; Has there been an effort
past the world's fair and now

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.770
that we've made these between
the librarian and the Smithsonian

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:20.590
to maybe gather some of the
select pieces for an exhibition?

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:21.890
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: We
haven't discussed that,

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.190
but it's a great idea.

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:33.210
I was going to do an exhibition
around the publication of the book,

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:38.070
but we're doing a lot of
construction and renovation

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.830
in the building, in my building
at the American History building,

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:44.520
so there wasn't a space for it.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.720
And I was going to do one that
would go to the University

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.120
of Vermont Gallery and
one at Dartmouth where,

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.980
where Marsh graduated and
where his portrait is,

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.470
and then close at American history.

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.700
But the construction schedule
kept getting pushed farther

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.000
and farther back and it just,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.310
it just didn't make any
sense in terms of timing, so.

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.360
But that's an interesting thought
to put some things together

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.910
from both of our collections and.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:15.780
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We can call that
a future collaborative effort

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.910
that could grow out of this book.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.280
Again, I was so impressed when
I read the book with the amount

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.260
of research and while so
many subjects are covered,

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.820
you really did a wonderful job
in pulling out the highlights

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:35.060
and showing, I know the emphasis
between LC and the Smithsonian,

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.610
but that's also an
area for future work.

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.480
And we're going to have a
book signing, but Helena,

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.050
you did a wonderful job on the
book and in the presentation,

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:46.550
and let's show our
appreciation [applause].

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:52.850
The books are on sale in the back
and she will be signing them.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:55.870
And I thank you again for pulling
this together and coming here.

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.780
&gt;&gt; Helena E. Wright: Do I need
to, I should probably close this.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.440
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
