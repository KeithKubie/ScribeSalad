<i> Anson Wong is a
 wildlife trafficker.</i>

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.972 line:0%
He's also a guy who was
trafficking at the time

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.140 line:0%
all the things we care about

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.342 line:0%
when we think about
precious wildlife.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.344
<i> He was offering
 snow leopard pelts</i>

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.447
<i> rhino horn,
he was moving live elephants.</i>

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.317
<i>He had a tiger farm in Vietnam
 where they raised tigers</i>

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.920
<i>killed them, mounted them
 as taxidermy specimens</i>

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.790
<i>sold them as trophies for people
to put in their living rooms.</i>

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.459
<i>He had this Spix's Macaw.</i>

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.328
<i>It's a bird that's supposed
to be extinct in the wild.</i>

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.432
Anson was offering three
for $100,000 apiece.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:36.268
The US Fish and Wildlife service
considered him in the 90s

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.037
the biggest international
wildlife trafficker

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.439
in the world.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.576
They launched an investigation
called "Operation Chameleon".

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.644
And it was successful.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.914
When he got out of jail,
he went immediately back

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.648
to the reptile business.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.518
<i> I also know from talking
 to reptile traders</i>

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.119
<i> he was never out
 of business.</i>

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.588
<i> While he was in jail,
his wife was trading for him.</i>

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.457
<i> So, we came up with
 another operation</i>

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.960
<i> we called it
 "Operation Big Ego".</i>

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.529
So, I learned his techniques
and then I went to Indonesia

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:07.533
where his major customers
and competitors are

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.103
and I lived on a
reptile breeding farm

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:15.975
and met as many of his
competitors and...

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:18.945
clients, as possible.
Then I flew to Malaysia.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.613
And I didn't know what
Anson looked like.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.916
I said-- I walked into the
shop, 22-B, Jones Road

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.452
and I-- there are two Chinese
guys standing in the doorway

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.487
I said, they said...

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.588
"Can we help you?"

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.524
I said, "Yeah, I'm
looking for Anson Wong."

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.127
And then the same guy
said, "I'm Anson Wong."

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:36.662
I said,
"Oh, I'm Bryan Christy."

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.531
He said,
"I've heard of you.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.866
I hear you're writing
about Strictly Reptiles.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.336
What you should really be
doing is writing about me.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.272
I'm much bigger."

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.507
And that...

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:51.811
is when Operation Big Ego
really took off.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.278
( audience laughter )

00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:56.649
And he, and he said not
only that but "look"

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.418
and he slid

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.821
a stack of blueprints
across the desk to me.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.290
I said, "What's this?"
He said, "A tiger farm.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.294
I'm building a tiger park
here on Penang Island.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.230
And the government
is funding me."

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.665
So, this is the world's
leading wildlife trafficker

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.868
arrested in the United States.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.606
He returns, his own government
funds him to build a tiger park

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:23.076
this is a guy who is
trafficking in tigers.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.113
I said, "I have a story."

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.647
The story was called
"The Kingpin".

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:30.649
This story ran in Malaysia.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.919
Within weeks law
enforcement officials

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.721
raided Anson--
Anson's facilities

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.124
they stripped him off
his business license

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.528
his license to move
endangered species.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:44.163
Members of parliament took
that literal magazine

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.867
and held it on the floor of
parliament and demanded change.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.135
Malaysian parliament passed

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:54.106
the first new reform legislation
for wildlife in 40 years.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.278
That summer,
Anson was arrested.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.045
<i> And he was tried
 and convicted</i>

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.815
<i> sentenced to
 six months in prison.</i>

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:07.820
<i> The public outcry over a
six month prison was so great</i>

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.756
that the government effectively
appealed its own victory

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.758
retried him

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.928
and he was sentenced to
five years in prison.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:19.866
A massive penalty...
in any country in the world.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.402
The prosecutor and the
judge held up this story

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.004
and said,
"This is what we're doing."
