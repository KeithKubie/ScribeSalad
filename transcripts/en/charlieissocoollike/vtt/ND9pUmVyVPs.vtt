00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.040
I am proud to be British, don't get me wrong.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm just not necessarily proud to admit that
I'm proud to be British. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.650
I do definitely like to embrace my Britishness. 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.320
I know I fit a lot of the characteristics
of the British stereotype. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.180
I sound a little bit posh, gray, rainy weather
makes me feel very at home, 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.470
I will genuinely say "whoopsy daisy"
when I've made a mistake, 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.290
I have an ever so slight disregard
for dental hygiene, 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.950
and maybe most importantly, I love tea. 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.250
It's kind of scary, actually, because I love tea so much
that it's become a defining characteristic of my personality. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.130
Like I drink it everyday, it's the reason I earned
my first viral video when I was sixteen, 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.390
and now it's in the name of my
production company, 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.600
and yet the reason I love it so much is because
this is the island on which I happened to be born. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.700
When my friend Michael came to visit
me from America, 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.130
I remember offering him a cup of tea because 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.150
that's what you do when you have a guest and
you're British, and he didn't really get it. 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.670
He said it tasted kind of hot, milky, leafy water. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910
He thought it was a bit yucky, basically. 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.860
And, honestly, I'm inclined to agree with him. 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.110
No baby in the history of Britain has ever popped
out of the womb gagging for a cup of tea, 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.930
but what we do is we see our
parents drinking it, 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.840
we hear that it's the British thing to do
and so we're slowly weaned onto it,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.760
usually with lots and lots of sugar at the
start until we learn to love it. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.710
And thanks to that process, tea is now a
part of who I am. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.660
I need it to work, I need it to
procrastinate from working, 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.510
and thanks to my slowly formed caffeine
dependency, if I don't drink it, I get stroppy. 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.450
Like I drink tea because I don't
know what else to do, 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.920
but, for some reason, I still feel proud to be
a tea drinking British person.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.060
Now whenever I see a patriotic American person,
you know, flying the stars and stripes

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.050
outside their home, singing the national anthem,
proclaiming about how much they love their country 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.340
and how it's the best country in the world,
it never fails to make me cringe.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.910
And I think this is for a couple of reasons. 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.790
Firstly: I don't know if I particularly like the
idea of naming any country as being 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.310
the best country in the world unless
it can be completely objective. 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.990
And secondly: if we are going to name any
country as being the best country in the world, 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.330
I'd like to think we'd pick one with the humility
to not  go on and on about how great is. 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.050
But thirdly: big American patriotism makes
me feel weird because I am British. 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.790
Because the most patriotic thing you'll ever hear
a British person say isn't "God Save the Queen." 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.890
It's "Would you like a cup of tea?" or "Aren't we
having awful weather at the moment?" 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.420
I never chose to live here and yet,
for some reason, 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.540
I can't imagine myself ever wanting
to live anywhere else. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.460
I never chose to have an accent that
sounds silly to the rest of the world 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.640
and yet, for some reason, that's not going
to stop me from using words like 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.730
"cheerio" and "poppycock" because I know those
sound silly to you and that makes me happy. 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.730
I guess what I have seen in a lifetime of
living here is that being patriotic 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.680
about Britain means not being particularly
patriotic about Britain. 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.650
Loving this country means admitting to yourself
and reminding the people around you that it can

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.710
be a bit rubbish here, and being proud
to be British means

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.960
being slightly ashamed of that fact. 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.860
And that is what I've been thinking
about this week. 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.380
Do let me know what you think,
and hopefully I'll see you next time. 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.560
God Save the Queen! 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.940
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.730
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.380
Thank you, as always, for watching.
You're very sweet. 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.850
Last week, I made three whole new videos. 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.910
It was a part collab week, all of which you
can see here in case you missed 'em. 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.440
My personal favorite is the one I wrote
with Tom where we wrote a song. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.230
I know you're not really meant to pick favorites,
but I have now, so what am I gonna do?

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.210
It is my favorite. 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.310
That's just the way it is. 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.430
Enjoy whichever one you pick, though. Goodbye! 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.228
