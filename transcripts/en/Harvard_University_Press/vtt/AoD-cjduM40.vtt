00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.200
Well, of course GDP has been used for many years as a measure of quality of life, but

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.540
what we want, if we're measuring quality of
life, is we want to know how people are really

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.340
doing. And for several reasons, GDP really
doesn't get at that. First of all, it doesn't

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.460
take account of distribution. So it can give
very--it's an average--so it can give very

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.539
high marks to nations that have huge and alarming inequalities. Where the people at the top

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.149
may be doing very well so the average is high, but then a lot of people at the bottom are

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.839
living very miserable lives. Second, because it funnels all parts of human life together

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.699
in a single number, it doesn't really tell
you how people are doing in separate areas

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.699
of life that you really want to care about,
such as health, education, political liberty,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.960
race relations. So they're so many things
that bear on the quality of a human life.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.060
And you might argue that GDP is good proxy for all of them and that if you just simply

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
push for economic growth it'll trickle down
and improve these other things. But actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.700
that's not true. Empirical research by now
has show that health and education are not

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.939
very robustly correlated with increased GDP. In the different Indian states, health and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.960
education are subjects that are left for the
states to manage, so you can use them as experimental

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.560
laboratories. And it's really quite interesting
to see that some that have shot for increased

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.880
GDP and have achieved that have very poor achievements in health and education, while

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.800
Kerala, which is a relatively poor state whose economy has not grown well actually has 99%

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.979
adolescent literacy in both males and females, and health achievements that are comparable

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.560
to inner city New York. Which is, I think,
shameful for New York but it's actually quite

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.429
fine for a poor Indian state. But then if
you think about political liberty, gender relations,

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.560
race relations, it's even more
obvious that that's not highly correlated

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.569
with GDP. I mean, everyone admires China for the stunning economic growth but we know very

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.629
well that there are lots of things that are
lacking there.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
Well, the first time that the United Nations published a Human Development report using

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.440
this approach, the great Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq said

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.400
the real wealth of the nation is its people, and the purpose of development

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.320
is to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy, and creative lives.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.620
So, that's the purpose of the approach, and so essentially it asks the very basic question:

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.680
what are people actually able to do and to
be, in a wide range of areas which are thought

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.180
to be of central importance for the quality
of a human life. Now, I've actually made a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.849
list of ten because I'm interested in constitutional law and so I'm interested in the way that

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.549
you could actually write this down and put
it into constitutional documents.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.739
But, other people don't make a list, but they pick out certain things to compare. And then you have

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.290
to figure out how to measure each of them.
So, what would be a good proxy for education?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.769
And so, of course, data have to be reshaped to the new approach. And I think right now

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.459
the Human Development reports use mean years of schooling as a proxy for education, and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.079
that's because they can get data on that.
It's much harder to get inside the school

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.329
and figure out exactly what people are able
to do. So I think we always need to be pushing

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.439
for better measures. It is, again, very hard
to know what you should be looking at when

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.269
you measure health. Health opportunities is what you really want to look at, not health

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.749
achievements, because we do think that people should have choices about how to live their

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:54.180
lives. And so what's important is that they
should have opportunities to have good health,

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.280
and then some may choose to live an unhealthy life. But there's a huge difference between

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.140
"fasting" and "starving," you know, and if
people are fasting for reasons of their own

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.860
choice, that's one thing. But if they're malnourished and they're starving, that's another. So it's

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.690
very hard to know how to measure that, and, of course, one of the things you just do is

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.989
look at the incidence of different kinds of
diseases, nutritional diseases. Then you

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.329
look at longevity, which, of course, is a
very good proxy for health opportunities.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.780
Those books are about how political arrangements can address problems of human vulnerability,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.900
and prior to that we have to ask "what forms of vulnerability should be addressed?"

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.960
Some forms of vulnerability, such as being open to love, or caring about your children,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.259
we don't want to remove from human life. But we do want to support them and make them fruitful,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.500
rather than sources of just constant, daily,
agonizing uncertainty. You know, so if you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.350
think about my work on the emotions, it's
all really about love, and it's about

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.360
attachments that people have, and I'm certainly trying to send the mess  age that people should

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.440
not shrink from attachments. But then, you
know, it's just not the case that we want

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.020
people to be as vulnerable as possible when they have children and they love them.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.759
No, you know, how would a decent society support that relationship of love and attachment and

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:32.380
make it not the case that you have to worry
from day to day, are my children going to

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.100
get their food or not? And so, yeah, thinking about how vulnerability plays out and how

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.880
good governments can leave room for the good kinds of vulnerability where you're open to

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.139
loving somebody, but get rid of the bad sorts where you're afraid that you're going to be

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.739
beaten up if you walk outside of your house, or you're afraid that your children might starve.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.539
I guess the first thing to say is it's a persuasive document.

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.539
It's not meant to be imposed by force of arms or even by economic threats.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.720
And actually I think those things are almost
never justified. I do think that when you're

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.389
thinking about what you want to fund, if you're a nation in the developed world, it might

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.069
make sense to give priority to things like
health and education. But most of the time,

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.690
I mean, I'm really a big supporter of national sovereignty, I think you should do it by giving

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.830
it to the nation and let them decide what
to do with it. So it's a template for nations

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.259
to consult when they think what they might
want to protect. And I have some arguments,

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.139
which I think are good arguments, that these are things that they should pay attention to,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.940
so we hope that people will be persuaded. But it's certainly, I think it's not imperialism if

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.900
you try to persuade people of something. So that's the first thing to say.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.820
Second thing is that it's, unless you defend certain things, you don't have meaningful pluralism.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.540
For example, the freedom of speech, the freedom of association, the freedom of religion.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:10.360
Unless you give those a very strong place in your nation, in your constitution, or whatever you have as your

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.940
founding document, then it's very hard for
meaningful pluralism to even exist.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.240
So the relationship between universalism and pluralism is complicated, and you have to say "this,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.199
we defend for everyone," if you're going to
have the difference and the plurality that

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:35.199
really I think we all want to see. Third thing
is that this is a list of capabilities and

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:40.949
it's not a list of functionings. It's not meant to dragoon people into pursuing one

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:47.569
of these. It's a set of opportunities. So,
you might hate religion and still think it's

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:52.750
a fine thing to protect the freedom of religion so that the people who do care about religion can use

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.300
it when they want to use it. Similarly, you
know, many of us love to work, we work a lot,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.639
but we still think that there should be maximum hours protections and that people shouldn't

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:08.440
have to work all the time. They shouldn't,
lives should not be swallowed up by that,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.970
so that if they want leisure time they should
be able to have it. You know, again, some

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:19.460
people may want to engage in fasting for religious reasons or personal reasons, but what's important

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.009
is they should have the opportunity to be
well-nourished. So I think that's a very permissive

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:29.369
approach, it's an approach that really is all
about opportunity and choice.

00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:37.229
So, then the last thing I'll say is that because I'm thinking so much about constitutional law,

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:43.480
I think that what I put on my list is something extremely abstract and general, with the idea that each

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.480
nation will do it somewhat differently. And
that they'll take some abstract thing, like

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.480
"the freedom of speech," and then they'll
think what version of that they want to endorse.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.950
As we know, different nations around the world have very different doctrines of free speech.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:05.950
The doctrine of free speech in the U.S. is
extremely speech-protective, for example defending

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:13.420
anti-semitic protesting and marching in Skokie. Whereas in Germany, anti-semitic speech is illegal.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.720
Well, I actually think both are right,
given their different histories and traditions.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.940
So the whole point of the list is to say "well,
here's a kind of general idea, now you think

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.180
what you want to do with that in keeping with your history and traditions."
