This episode of Crash Course Physics is sponsored by Audible.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:08.869
I think fluids are fascinating and awesome.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.799
Because they happen to be my area of expertise
as an engineer, in fluid dynamics.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.169
But it’s not just me who’s intrigued by
how things flow.

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.489
Legend has it that a man once ran naked through
the streets because he was so excited about

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.620
discovering an important property of fluids.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.400
Now, I’ve never quite gone that 
far...

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.910
But still, an understanding of fluids is incredibly
useful.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.840
Because anything that flows -- liquid or gas
-- is a fluid.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.400
So, water counts, but so does air, and so
does corn syrup.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.540
Using their knowledge of fluids, physicists and engineers can design things like

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.000
pressure sensors, hydraulic pumps, and even airplanes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.420
But first, let’s start with the basics:
the physics of fluids, at rest.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:57.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.920
Until now, we’ve often described the physics
of objects based on their mass.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.340
But when it comes to fluids, we mostly use
a different quality:

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.680
density, represented in equations
by the greek letter rho.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.420
You’re probably familiar with density:

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.180
it’s mass, divided by volume, and measured in kilograms per meters cubed.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.380
If an object -- or a fluid -- is made of heavier
atoms or molecules, or those particles are

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.709
packed more closely together, then it’s
going to have a higher density.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:27.860
And there’s another important quality of fluids, one that scuba divers and mountain climbers think about a lot: pressure.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.799
In our last episode, we defined pressure as
applied force, divided by area.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.479
It’s measured in units of Newtons per meters
squared, known as Pascals.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.819
And fluids apply pressure in EVERY direction.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.409
So, right now, there’s air putting pressure
on you -- and me -- from every side.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.349
In fact, the average air pressure at sea level
is 101 THOUSAND 325 Pascals.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.589
And if you jumped in a pool, the water would
also exert pressure on you.

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:55.660
But if you’ve ever tried diving to the bottom
of a pool, you'll know that there’s more pressure

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:59.389
at the bottom than at the surface -- which
is why, at the bottom, your ears hurt

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.609
and your head feels like it’s about to implode.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.360
That’s because the deeper you go, the more fluid there is above you, with its weight pressing down.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.540
There’s an easy way to calculate the
pressure of a fluid at a given depth:

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.920
it’s just (the fluid’s density); (times small g); (times the distance to the surface), represented by the letter h -- for height.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.380
And the change in pressure based on depth
is equal to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.700
(the fluid’s density), (times small g),
(times the change in distance to the surface).

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.800
So, let’s say you’re swimming in a pool
that’s three meters deep, and you want to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.920
know how much more pressure you’ll experience
at the bottom of the pool, versus how deep

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.240
you are now, which is, let’s assume...a
quarter of a meter.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.980
The density of water is 1000 kilograms per meters cubed, and the change in distance to the surface is 2.75 meters.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.720
Which means that the pressure at the bottom of the pool is 27,000 Pascals more than the pressure, a quarter of a meter down.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.080
The water in the pool could be one example
of a confined fluid, because if you had a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.980
piston the size of the pool’s surface and used it to push down on the water, the water would have nowhere to go.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.280
And back in the mid-1600s, French physicist Blaise Pascal realized something about the way pressure worked in confined fluids:

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.760
If you apply pressure to a confined fluid, the pressure in every part of the fluid increases by that amount.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.120
If you have water in a cup, and you use a piston to apply 10,000 Pascals of pressure to the surface of the water,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.920
then the pressure everywhere in the water increases by 10,000 Pascals.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.260
Today, that concept is known as Pascal’s
Principle, and it’s the reason hydraulics are so useful.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.340
Say you have some water in a tube, with pistons
on either side.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.820
Pascal’s principle tells you that if you use the piston on the left side to apply pressure to the water,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.060
the water will exert the same pressure on the piston on the right side of the tube.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.280
And pressure is equal to (force) divided by
(area).

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.800
So, say you have another tube that’s more
of a cone shape, with a piston on the left side

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.440
that has an area of one meter squared, and
one on the right that has an area of 2 meters squared

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.150
Again, you apply 10,000 Pascals of pressure
to the piston on the left side --

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.320
meaning, 10,000 Newtons of force.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.900
But the piston on the right side has double
the area.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.040
So, for the pressures to be equal, the water
has to apply double the force to the piston

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.760
as you applied to the water, and so you end up with 20,000 Newtons of force on the right-side piston.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.240
This is a huge deal! You’re doubling the input force, but you didn’t have to put in any extra effort!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.220
And the bigger the difference in area, the
more extra force you get!

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.420
To put it in math terms: the ratio of the
output force to the input force is equal to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.449
the ratio of the output area to the input
area.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.180
Systems like hydraulic lifts take advantage of this, by having big differences in area on either side of a fluid.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.020
So if you want to apply a lot of force -- to lift something heavy, for example -- hydraulics are the way to go.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.680
Now, if you’re going to be using pressure to do stuff, you’re probably going to want to be able to measure that pressure.

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.860
Which is where manometers and barometers come
in.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.550
A manometer is just a U-shaped tube with a
fluid inside.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.849
Say you wanted to use one to measure the pressure
of a bike tire.

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.380
You’d stick one side of the tube in the tire, and leaving the other side open to the atmosphere.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.369
If there’s a difference in the pressure
on each side of the manometer,

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:55.200
whichever side has the higher pressure will push the fluid away from it --

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:58.540
creating a difference in the height of the fluid on either side of the U.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.719
In this case, the inside of the bike tire
has a much higher pressure than the atmosphere,

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.300
so the level of the fluid on the side of the
U that’s closer to the tire will be lower.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.600
If you measured the difference in fluid height directly, you’d get what’s known as gauge pressure --

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.020
the difference between atmospheric
pressure and the pressure inside the tire.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.400
But the actual pressure of the tire -- the absolute pressure -- is the atmospheric pressure, plus the gauge pressure.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.960
So, the pressure inside the tire will be equal
to (the atmospheric pressure),

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.779
plus (the density of the fluid inside the manometer) (times small g) (times the difference in the heights of the fluid).

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.779
Barometers, on the other hand, use a long,
vertical tube that’s closed on one end,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.140
usually filled with mercury and then stuck
upside-down in a bowl that’s also full of mercury,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.229
with the closed end of the tube at
the top.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.449
The pressure of the atmosphere pushes down
on the mercury in the bowl,

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.200
which keeps a certain amount of mercury in the tube.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.379
At standard atmospheric pressure, the mercury
in the tube will be exactly 76 centimeters high.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.240
If the air pressure goes up, so does the level
of the mercury, and vice versa.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.260
So we have one more property to talk
about when it comes to fluids at rest --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.640
and it's the one that supposedly made that guy run naked through the streets, yelling “Eureka!”

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.720
That guy was Archimedes, and he lived in Greece
in the third century BCE.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.820
Legend has it that he was asked to find a way to figure out if the king’s crown was pure gold.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.329
And the best way to do that was to calculate
its density.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:18.000
Archimedes could measure the crown’s mass easily enough, but he didn’t know how to find its density.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.660
He was taking a bath one day when he realized that the volume of the water displaced by an object

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.760
is equal to that object’s volume.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.720
And since he already knew the crown’s mass,
that meant he’d be able to find its volume,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.200
and therefore its density, just by putting
it in water.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.800
That’s when he did the whole running-through-the-streets-naked thing.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.140
So Archimedes discovered that when you
put something in a fluid,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.580
the fluid’s volume increases by the amount of the object's volume.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.599
This tells us a lot about what makes objects
float or sink.

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:49.039
For example, say you have a tub of water and
two balls of the same size, but of different densities.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.300
Say, one is an American-style billiard ball,
and the other’s a racquetball.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.240
We’re going to gently place the balls in the middle of the tub, let go, and explain what happens to them.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.139
But first, let’s talk about the forces acting on the water that’s occupying the space where we’re going to put them.

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.519
Picture a sphere of water within the volume
of water that’s in the tub.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.960
What are the forces acting on that watery sphere?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.189
Well, the force of gravity is pulling it down.

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.889
And, since the sphere is in static equilibrium,
there must be some force pushing up on it,

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.800
counteracting the force of gravity.

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:20.770
We call that force the buoyant force, and
it comes from the fact that the water pressure

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.699
at the bottom of the sphere is greater than
the pressure at the top.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.669
Now, let’s put the billiard ball where the
sphere of water used to be.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:28.610
What are the forces acting on that?

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.729
The force from gravity that’s pulling down
on the billiard ball is stronger than the

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.960
force that was pulling down on the sphere
of water.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.960
That’s because the billiard ball is denser
than water -- so even though the ball and

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.020
the sphere of water have the same size, the
ball is much heavier.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.529
But the buoyant force on the billiard ball
is exactly the same as it was on the sphere

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:47.830
of water, since they’re the same shape and
size.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.620
That’s Archimedes’ principle: there’s a buoyant force pushing upward on objects in water,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.200
and it’s equal to the weight of
the water that the object displaced.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.170
The billiard ball weighs more than the
sphere of water that it’s replacing,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.960
so there’s a net downward force on the ball, and it sinks to the bottom of the tub.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.900
But if you were to fill in that sphere of water with a racquetball, the opposite would happen.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.860
In that case, the force from gravity pulling
it downward is weaker than the force pulling

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:15.159
down the sphere of water, but the buoyant
force pushing upward is still the same.

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:19.599
So there’s a net force upward on the racquetball,
which is why it floats to the top of the tub.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.220
Some of the racquetball will pop out of the
water, but some of it will stay underwater

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.660
-- in fact, once it stops moving, the racquetball will displace a volume of water that weighs exactly as much as the ball.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.580
Because at that point, the buoyant force pushing
the racquetball upward and the force of gravity

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.040
pulling the racquetball downward have the
same magnitude, so they cancel each other out!

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.010
Thanks to Archimedes, we know why objects
float and sink.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.970
Today, you learned about the properties of
fluids at rest, including density, and pressure.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.710
We also talked about Pascal’s Principle,
and how it’s used in hydraulics.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.830
Then, we covered how manometers and
barometers measure pressure.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.080
Finally, we explained Archimedes’ Principle and the buoyant force.
