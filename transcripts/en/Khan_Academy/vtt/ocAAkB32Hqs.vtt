00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.263
- [Voiceover] So we already know that

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:06.100
chromosomes are made up of
really long strands of DNA

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.903
all wound up into themselves,

00:00:08.903 --> 00:00:11.792
so something like, well
I'm just kind of drawing it

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:14.392
as a random long strand of
DNA all wound up in itself.

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:16.249
And on that strand,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.882
you have sequences which we call genes,

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.358
so that might be one
gene right over there,

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:25.246
this might be another gene,

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.927
that might be a gene right over there.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:32.627
And each of those genes can
code for specific polypeptides

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:34.770
or specific proteins.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.244
And the key question is,
is how do you go from

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:39.682
the information encoded in these genes,

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:41.301
encoded as sequences of DNA,

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:43.331
how do you go from that?

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.664
How do you go from the gene,

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:48.972
which is encoded in DNA,

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:54.184
how do you go from that to protein?

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:56.858
Which is made up of polypeptides,

00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.907
which are made up of amino acids.

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:03.125
And this is often called the
central dogma of biology,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.279
but we already saw in the
video of transcription,

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.705
that the first step is to go from the gene

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:09.122
to messenger RNA,

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:12.956
that the RNA, the messenger RNA,

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:14.814
you can use as a transcript,

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:18.072
we have rewritten the
information now as RNA.

00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:20.585
And then the next step
which we're gonna dive into

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:24.054
in this video is going from
that message RNA to protein,

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:26.816
and this process is called translation,

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:29.202
because we're literally
translating that information

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:31.535
into a polypeptide sequence.

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:34.972
And you can see a little
bit visually here,

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:37.034
this is all review, we
covered a lot of this

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:38.565
in the video on transcription

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.450
and the overview video on
transcription and translation,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.188
is if you look at a eukaryotic cell

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:47.327
and the bacteria in a prokaryotic cell,

00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:49.796
it's analogous, you just don't
have the nuclear membrane,

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:51.778
and you're not gonna
do the processing step

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.509
that I'm gonna talk about in a little bit

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.487
and we went in detail on
the video on transcription.

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:57.173
But you start with the DNA,

00:01:57.173 --> 00:02:00.681
you have your RNA
polymerase as the main actor

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:05.062
that's able to transcribe
the RNA from that.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:06.954
If we're talking about a eukaryotic cell,

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:09.804
what you end up with we wouldn't call mRNA

00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:11.721
we would call pre-mRNA,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.473
pre-mRNA,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.498
which then needs to be processed,

00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:21.643
the introns need to be taken out,

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:24.031
we add a cap and a tail here,

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.092
and if we're talking
about a eukaryotic cell,

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:28.022
we then formally call that mRNA,

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.571
and then it can travel,
and this is where we get

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.013
into the translation step.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:33.832
It can travel to a ribosome,

00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:35.934
which is where it will be translated

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:38.906
into a polypeptide sequence.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:41.015
And you see the analogous
thing happening here

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.955
in this bacterial,

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.968
or this prokaryotic cell right over here,

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:47.908
except you don't see the nuclear membrane,

00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:49.233
because it's prokaryotic,

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.366
and you don't see that processing step,

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.305
so you could just consider this straight,

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:55.805
this is mRNA right over there.

00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:59.815
So the questions are well
how does this thing happen?

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:01.881
And what even is a ribosome?

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:06.874
So let's zoom in a little bit
on a ribosome right over here,

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.563
and there's a couple
of interesting actors.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:12.623
One, as you can imagine,
is the ribosome itself,

00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:15.123
and it is made up of proteins,

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.655
proteins plus ribosomal RNA.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.975
So in the video on transcription,

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:27.023
we're already familiar with messenger RNA

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:29.703
and we often view RNA like DNA

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.301
as primarily encoding information,

00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:34.572
it's acting as a transcript for a gene,

00:03:34.572 --> 00:03:37.501
but it doesn't have to
only encode information.

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:40.262
It can also, so it's proteins plus,

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:42.158
it's not a 'T' there, this is a plus.

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:44.770
It can also provide a
functional structural role,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.787
which it does in ribosomal RNA.

00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:50.108
And this big, you know, this looks like a

00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:52.874
an oversized hamburger bun
or something right over here,

00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:54.529
this is super oversimplification

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:55.852
of what a ribosome looks like

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.627
and I encourage you to do a web search

00:03:57.627 --> 00:03:59.978
for image searches for ribosomes,

00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:02.008
and then you can get
more appreciation of how

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.742
how beautiful these structures are,

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.641
and how intricate they actually are.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.083
So this is the site,

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.185
and you can broadly think of the ribosome

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:11.706
as having this, you know,
this is the top bun,

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:13.238
and the bottom bun.

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:16.488
And it's going to travel along the mRNA

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:17.837
from the five prime end,

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:20.439
to the three prime end, reading it,

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.133
and taking that information,

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:25.676
and turning it into a
sequence of amino acids.

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:27.995
So how does that actually happen?

00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:31.049
Well, each, each of these three,

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:33.447
every three nucleotides,

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.673
every three nucleotides there,

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:38.441
we call that a codon, so that's a codon,

00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.039
this is, let me do this in a color

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.971
that is visible on both white and black.

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.060
So these next three
nucleotides is a codon,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.839
this is a codon, this is a codon,

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.691
and what's actually the
information is actually encoded

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.872
in the nitrogenous bases.

00:04:54.872 --> 00:04:57.105
So this first codon right over here,

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.790
we see it's AUG, so the
nitrogenous bases are

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.123
adenine, uracil and guanine.

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:07.181
And this has, this codon,
it codes for the amino acid

00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:11.563
methianine, but this is also,
this is a good one to know,

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:14.701
AUG, let me write it over here.

00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.284
AUG is know as the start codon.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.479
Start codon.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.408
This is where the ribosome
will initially attach

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:28.236
to start translating that messenger RNA,

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:30.424
and so we, the way this drawing is,

00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:33.649
that we are just starting to translate

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.301
this messenger RNA.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.035
So how does that actually happen?

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:38.519
How do we get from these
three letter sequences

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.463
to specific amino acids?

00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:42.407
Well let's think about it, how many,

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:45.007
how many possible three
letter sequences are there?

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:46.340
Well, there are,

00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:51.197
there are four possible
nitrogenous bases there,

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:54.639
so there's four possible, so
if you, if you have a codon,

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.639
and it has three places,

00:05:57.652 --> 00:05:59.260
there's four possible things

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.994
that could be in the first place.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.882
There's four possible things

00:06:02.882 --> 00:06:04.417
that could be in the second place,

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.346
and there's four possible
things that could be

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:07.547
in the third place.

00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:10.714
So there are 64 possible permutations.

00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:14.018
4 times 4 times 4.

00:06:14.018 --> 00:06:17.442
Permutations, so you can
think of it, there's 64

00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:20.541
different codons,
different ways of arranging

00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.936
the A, the U and the G.

00:06:22.936 --> 00:06:25.749
And that's good, because
there are many amino acids,

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:27.362
and this is actually overkill,

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:30.464
because there's actually
22 standard amino acids,

00:06:30.464 --> 00:06:31.464
22 standard,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.613
amino, amino acids,

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:43.366
and 21 that are typically
found in eukaryotic cells.

00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:47.735
So we have more than enough,
more than enough permutations

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.886
to cover the different amino acids.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:53.717
And it's not hard to find tables
that will actually show us

00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:58.050
what the different sequences,
what they actually code for.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.098
So you can see here, you
can take the first letter,

00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:03.114
the second letter and the third letter,

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:05.073
figure, look at the different sequences,

00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:06.532
and you can say, okay, look at that.

00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:09.854
AUG, adenine, uracil, guanine.

00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:12.104
That codes for methanine.

00:07:12.104 --> 00:07:13.437
Right over here.

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:16.251
You could do that with any of them,

00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.363
you could say cytosine, uracil, uracil,

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:19.893
that codes for leucine.

00:07:19.893 --> 00:07:22.981
And you can see that it's
not just one amino acid

00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:26.246
per codon, but here you have four codons

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:29.875
all code for, all code for leucine.

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:33.177
And so it turns out that 61 of the codons,

00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:34.836
let me write this down.

00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:38.169
So 61 of the codons, of the possible 64,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.219
code for amino acids,

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:42.219
amino acids,

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:49.088
and three play a role
that essentially tells the

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:54.290
the ribosome to stop, three codons,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.360
three codons are stop codons,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.053
and you can see them right over here.

00:07:58.053 --> 00:08:01.692
UAA, UAG, UGA, that's
how the ribosome knows

00:08:01.692 --> 00:08:04.047
to stop translating.

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:06.191
So AUG, that's a start codon,

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:08.548
and it codes for methianine.

00:08:08.548 --> 00:08:11.226
So that lets you know that
these polypeptide chains

00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:12.919
are going to start with methianine,

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.267
and then these characters
tell it where to stop.

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:17.901
But how do, how does the amino acid

00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.952
actually get, how do they
all get tied up together

00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:22.560
to form this polypeptide?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.922
And how do they get matched up,

00:08:23.922 --> 00:08:25.537
how do they actually get matched up

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:27.485
with the appropriate codon?

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:30.423
And that's where we have
another RNA based actor,

00:08:30.423 --> 00:08:31.840
and this is tRNA.

00:08:33.194 --> 00:08:36.111
So tRNA, the t stands for transfer,

00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:40.411
transfer RNA.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:43.527
There's a bunch of different tRNAs

00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:46.826
that each combined to
specific amino acids,

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.888
and on parts of those tRNA,

00:08:48.888 --> 00:08:51.483
they have what are called anti-codons.

00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:54.168
That pair with the appropriate codon.

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:57.262
So this tRNA, and that's
not what it looks like,

00:08:57.262 --> 00:08:59.400
I'll show you in a second
what it looks like.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.817
That's a tRNA molecule, tRNA,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.613
at one end of the molecule,

00:09:04.613 --> 00:09:07.000
it's binding to the
appropriate amino acid,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.061
methianine, right over here.

00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.133
And then at the other end of the molecule,

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.362
though that's in the middle
of the tRNA actual chain,

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:16.593
you have your anticodon.

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:20.845
And your anticodon matches
up to the appropriate codon.

00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:23.561
And so this is how they bump
into each other the right way

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:25.873
and the ribosomes going to facilitate it,

00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:29.785
that the AUG is going to be
associated with the methianine.

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:32.520
And if we look at what
tRNA actually looks like,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.675
and this is still just a visualization.

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.008
So this is a strand of tRNA,

00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:41.105
you get a sense of, okay,
it's a sequence of RNA

00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:42.306
right over here,

00:09:42.306 --> 00:09:44.338
this it's, I guess you could
say, you could think of it,

00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:46.023
it's two dimensional structure.

00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:47.961
But then it wraps around itself to form

00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:49.844
this fairly complex molecule.

00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:53.003
And the anticodon, which is right here,

00:09:53.003 --> 00:09:55.183
it's kind of in the
middle of the sequence,

00:09:55.183 --> 00:09:58.196
it forms the basis for
this end of the molecule,

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.795
that's the part that's
gonna pair with the codon

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:02.241
on the mRNA,

00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:04.960
and then at the other end of the molecule,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.220
at the other end of the molecule
is where you actually bind

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.955
to the appropriate amino acid.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.142
So I know what you're thinking, alright,

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:15.111
I see that the ribosome,
it knows where to start,

00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:16.928
it starts at the start codon.

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:19.204
I see how the appropriate tRNA can bring

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:20.943
the appropriate amino acid,

00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:22.794
but how does the chain actually form?

00:10:22.794 --> 00:10:24.678
And you can view this in three steps,

00:10:24.678 --> 00:10:27.083
and associated with those
three steps are three sites

00:10:27.083 --> 00:10:28.362
on the ribosome.

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:32.112
And the three sites, we
call this the A-site,

00:10:33.676 --> 00:10:35.699
you're not gonna be able to
see it if I write it in black.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:37.532
A, or yellow, alright,

00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:39.856
let me write it in blue.

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.689
So that is the A-site.

00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:44.900
This is the P-site,

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:48.123
and this is the E-site.

00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:54.315
And I'll talk in a second
why we call them A, P and E.

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:58.025
So the A-site is where
the appropriate tRNA

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:02.810
initially bounds, the tRNA
that's bound to an amino acid.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.213
And so you can see, we're
starting the translation process,

00:11:05.213 --> 00:11:06.958
the next thing that's going to happen

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.894
is another tRNA, the one
that is, that matches,

00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:13.118
that has an anticodon
that matches the UAU,

00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:15.754
that's going to bond
over here on the A-site,

00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:18.479
and it's bringing the
appropriate amino acid with it,

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:20.868
it's bringing the tyrosine with it.

00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:23.338
So why is that called the A-site?

00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.598
Well A stands for aminoacyl.

00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:27.164
An easy way to remember it

00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:30.125
it's the tRNA, it's the
place where the tRNA

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:32.474
that's bound to the amino
acid, just one amino acid

00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:35.330
is going to bind on the ribosome.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.857
And so once that happens,

00:11:36.857 --> 00:11:38.714
once this character comes here,

00:11:38.714 --> 00:11:40.741
let me draw that.

00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:44.241
Once this character comes right over here,

00:11:45.284 --> 00:11:46.784
it's gonna be AUA,

00:11:48.037 --> 00:11:51.129
and it's bound to the tyrosine.

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:54.360
Well then you could
have a peptide bond form

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.288
between the two amino
acids, and the ribosome,

00:11:57.288 --> 00:12:01.410
and the ribosome itself
can move to the right.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.910
So this, this tRNA

00:12:05.573 --> 00:12:07.591
will then be in the E-site.

00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:10.349
This tRNA will then be in the P-site,

00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:13.445
and then the A-site will be
open for another amino acid

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:14.612
carrying tRNA.

00:12:15.588 --> 00:12:19.758
So what this, what do the
P and E sites stand for?

00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:23.045
Well you can see a little bit
more clearly right over here.

00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:25.493
So the P-site is where you
have the polypeptide chain

00:12:25.493 --> 00:12:29.326
actually forming, and,
so the P-site is often,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.714
well, one way to remember
it is is that's where

00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:35.699
you have the polypeptide
chain, and now you have a new,

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:38.097
you have a new A-site where you can

00:12:38.097 --> 00:12:39.785
bring in a new amino acid.

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:41.763
And then the ribosome is going to shift,

00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:44.687
once this is bound, the ribosome,

00:12:44.687 --> 00:12:49.426
the peptide bond forms,
and then the ribosome can

00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:53.053
shift to the right, when the
ribosome shifts to the right,

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:54.733
we're gonna be in this position,

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:58.900
where the thing that was
here, that was in the A-site,

00:12:59.782 --> 00:13:01.969
now the polypeptide is attached to it,

00:13:01.969 --> 00:13:04.969
it is now going to be in the P-site,

00:13:05.925 --> 00:13:08.224
and the thing that was in the P-site

00:13:08.224 --> 00:13:10.547
is now going to be in the E-site.

00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:12.034
It is now ready to exit,

00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:13.761
and that's why it's called the E-site.

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:15.734
Because that's the site
from which you exit.

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.554
And so this is going to keep happening

00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:21.111
until we get to one of the stop codons.

00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:23.136
And when you get to
one of the stop codons,

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:26.434
then the appropriate polypeptide
is going to be released,

00:13:26.434 --> 00:13:28.332
and we will have created this thing

00:13:28.332 --> 00:13:29.943
that could either be a protein,

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:33.294
or part of a protein, so
this is very exciting,

00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:36.020
because this is happening
in your cells as we speak.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.199
This is, and in fact if
you think about things

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:40.712
like antibiotics, the
way that they work are,

00:13:40.712 --> 00:13:43.349
is that, or the way that antibiotics work

00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:46.783
is that ribosomes and prokaryotes

00:13:46.783 --> 00:13:49.510
are different enough than
ribosomes in plants and animals

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.224
or in eukaryotes, that
we can find molecules

00:13:52.224 --> 00:13:55.893
that hurt the function of
ribosomes in prokaryotes,

00:13:55.893 --> 00:13:57.954
but don't do it to eukaryots.

00:13:57.954 --> 00:14:00.557
And so if you have bacteria
in your blood stream,

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:02.285
and if you take the
appropriate antibiotic,

00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:04.423
it could disrupt this translation process

00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:06.782
in the bacteria, but not in your cells

00:14:06.782 --> 00:14:08.615
that you want to keep.
