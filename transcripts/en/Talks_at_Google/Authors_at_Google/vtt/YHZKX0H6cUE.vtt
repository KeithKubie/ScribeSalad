00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.050
EUGENIA CHENG:
Thank you very much.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.140
Well, first of all, thank you
to Google for inviting me here

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.100
to speak to you.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.080
And thank you for
coming in what I suppose

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.890
is your lunchtime to listen
to maths during a lunch

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.700
break, which is pretty amazing.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.050
So I am going to talk
about logic and about how

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.820
to make sense in a
world that doesn't,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.620
because a lot of the world does
not make sense at the moment.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.800
In particular, many people
don't seem to make sense

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.220
in the world at the moment.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.610
And I have previously
written books

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.290
to show how maths is fun,
and delicious, and amazing.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.280
And this is less about how it's
fun and more about how it's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.010
important, because the previous
books were about how it's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.640
important, but recent events
in the last couple of years

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.620
have driven me to
feeling the need

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.420
to say slightly more urgent
and more, dare I say it,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.640
political things about
how maths can help us.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.990
And this might be surprising,
because usually pure maths

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.240
is thought of as
being pure and remote.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.480
I am a pure mathematician,
I am a category theorist,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.740
that is my research.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.620
And category theory is sometimes
thought of as the most abstract

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.000
type of mathematics.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.610
Well, I say that pure
maths is a framework

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.440
for agreeing on things.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.540
But in general,
pure maths is often

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.320
thought of as really only being
relevant to applied maths.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.890
And applied maths is then
helpful to science, possibly,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.590
and science is helpful to
engineering and medicine.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.170
And engineering and medicine
are helpful to the world.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.380
And maths is helpful to
kind of the numerical part

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.380
of the world.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650
And we might think of
differential equations,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.590
or solving equations, and
calculating things in finance,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.460
and science, and business.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.800
And those are the ways
in which maths is useful.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.400
But that enables people
to say, well, that's fine,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.930
I'm glad somebody does that,
but it doesn't have to be me,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.070
it's not relevant to me,
someone else can do it.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.040
And I'm sure many
of you do do it.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730
And there are many people
in the world who just ignore

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.170
it and hope for the best.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.200
Well, I say that, actually,
because pure maths

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.480
is a framework for
agreeing on things,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
it's a framework for
how to think well.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
And because it's
about how to think,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.410
it's actually about the entire
human world, or at least

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.550
the parts of the human
world that thinks,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.594
which might not be all
of it at the moment.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:17.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.820
But wouldn't it be
great if everyone

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.230
were able to think better?

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.370
That's what I say.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.790
And I truly believe
that pure mathematics

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.010
is a discipline
for thinking better

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.580
and for how to have better
arguments, because I'm not

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.890
claiming to tell
everyone what to think,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.870
but I wish we could
have better arguments.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.860
Because at the moment, we
seem to be mired in conflict,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.270
divisive arguments, fake news,
yelling, bigotry, prejudice,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.640
hate, exploitation, victimhood.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.520
And it can sometimes seem like
there is not a productive way

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.649
to have a discussion.

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.190
But I think there
is a productive way

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.280
to have discussion, it just
might not be on social media,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.240
necessarily.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.720
But we can try.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.600
And so this is what
my book is about,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.290
it's about how can we have more
productive conversations using

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.840
lessons from
abstract mathematics?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.510
So I'm going to talk
about analogies and how

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.220
pure maths uses analogies.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.814
I'm going to talk about the
interconnectedness of things

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.480
and how we should
always think about how

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.820
things are interconnected.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.440
I'm going to talk about
relationships of various kinds.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.020
I'm going to talk about pivoting
between different contexts

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.020
so that we can help ourselves
understand other people

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.517
from their point of view.

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:31.100
And finally, I'm going to talk
about what I think intelligence

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.960
really actually is.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.940
So first of all, analogies--

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.920
I say that pure
maths is a framework

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.240
for agreeing on things.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.360
It's also a theory of analogies.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.167
Because fundamentally,
what it says is,

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.750
there are lots of
different situations

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.850
that have something
in common if we just

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.550
forget some of the pesky
details about them.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.070
And then, that takes us from
the real world of things

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.760
into the abstract world of
ideas where more things become

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.860
the same by analogy.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.530
But what pure maths does
that we don't necessarily

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.780
do in normal life
is, we make very

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.250
precise what the analogy is.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.920
We don't just say this
thing is analogous to that.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.800
We say, what is the analogy
that we're thinking about here?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.310
And that removes a
lot of ambiguity.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.560
And having a framework
for agreeing on things

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.500
is partly about removing
possible ambiguities.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.940
So here is an
example of how this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.589
works at a very basic level.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.057
If you think about two
apples and two bananas,

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:25.640
then you can go, oh,
these things have

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.530
something in common,
they're both two things.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620
And that's how we
get the number two.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.874
It's an analogy between a lot
of different sets of two things.

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.040
And when we first teach
small children how to count,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.620
we have to wait for them
to make the abstract leap

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.942
from the objects in front
of them to the concept.

00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:44.900
And you can't really do
that for them, you just

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.540
have to sort of wait, show them
over and over again, and wait

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.670
until they make that leap.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.900
It's a leap of abstraction.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.560
Now, there are other ways
we could have done this.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.720
We could instead
have said that they

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.150
are both two fruits,
which is still true,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.910
it just encompasses less stuff.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.120
So if we had instead made
the analogy via two fruits,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.180
then we would not be able to
encompass two chairs in this

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.810
because that is not two fruits.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.960
This doesn't mean
it's a wrong analogy,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.420
it just means it's an analogy
at a different level that

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.950
encompasses fewer things.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.560
Whereas now if we go all
the way up to two things,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.290
then we get to encompass
the two chairs as well.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.406
And a lot of pure maths is
about finding the right level

00:05:26.406 --> 00:05:27.780
for the situation
that you're in.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.740
It's not that there is one
absolutely right level,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.900
maths, as it turns out, is not
about getting the right answer.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.730
It's about different
points of view

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.410
that illuminates situations
in different ways.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.320
And I think arguments
in life are often not

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.060
really about one
person being right

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.760
and one person being wrong,
but a sense in which something

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.420
is right.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.850
So here is the sense in
which two chairs are not

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.240
analogous to two bananas along
with a sense in which they are.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.990
And then once we've made precise
those two different levels,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.060
we can then have a
discussion about which

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.600
one is a better level to use
for the current discussion.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.550
And this happens at
a more profound level

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.820
in maths when we think
about, say, 1 plus 2

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.860
and we compare that to 2 plus 3.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.780
And this is where
that thing happens

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.250
that makes some
people very scared,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.590
where their numbers
turn into letters.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.980
And these are both
examples of a plus b.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.930
But the point of doing that
is not to terrify everyone,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.080
although that can sometimes
be what seems like the point.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.530
The point is to encompass
more examples, that's always

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.050
the idea of abstraction, to
study a lot of different things

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.600
at the same time to
save your brain power

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.830
and be more efficient.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.081
And this is a good thing to
do if you are lazy like me

00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:36.580
and you don't want to do the
same thing over and over again.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.590
And I'd say a lot of pure
maths comes from that.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.950
You do the same
thing a few times,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.340
and you go, oh, I don't want
to do that any more, I'm

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.710
going to make a theory
that will do it for me.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.419
So you're kind of
front load your effort,

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.668
and then you never have to
make the effort ever again,

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:48.930
like getting a dishwasher.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.150
So this is very similar
to 1 times 2 and 2 times

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.840
3, which can be
abstracted to a times b.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.790
But now, we can say that
whole left-hand part

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.530
is analogous to you the
entire right-hand part.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.480
And these are both an
example of a something b.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.330
They're a way of combining
some a and some b.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.790
And so we can go even
one level more abstract,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.170
and say this is a
bleh b, and it's

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.790
a way of combining two things.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.890
This is called a binary
operation in mathematics.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.400
And it's one level more abstract
that you probably only see

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.290
if you do an undergraduate
degree in maths

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.940
and you do something
like group theory

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.290
where you look at things
with binary operations.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.270
Now, sometimes the top level
is a really good place to look,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.240
and sometimes the middle level
is a better place to look.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.110
It just depends what
you're trying to do.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.770
So if you're thinking
about something like 1

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.560
plus 2 equals 2 plus 1,
which you might remember

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.670
is the commutativity
of addition.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.980
There's also commutativity
of multiplication,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.730
which says that 1 times
2 equals 2 times 1,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.130
and a times b equals b times a.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.140
And if we go up
to the top level,

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.620
we can study both of those
phenomena at the same time.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.474
However, if we want to look
at undoing the process,

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:04.140
we can't go up to the
top level, because

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.140
at that level, addition and
multiplication aren't the same,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.060
because you can't always undo
the process of multiplication,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.620
because if you
multiply by 0, you

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.534
can't undo that, you're done.

00:08:15.534 --> 00:08:17.200
Whereas whatever you
add, you can always

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.790
subtract it to
get it back again.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.700
You can divide by any
number apart from 0.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.670
And so, at that level,
addition and multiplication

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.020
are not analogous.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.910
So we have to pick carefully.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.460
And the main point
of talking about this

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.510
is to show that making precise
which level we're talking about

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.890
helps us to be clear about
what's going to be useful now.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.480
And what isn't, isn't
true in that context.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.160
So a more real-life
example, and my book

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.242
is full of actual life
examples of things

00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:51.450
that people argue about on
the internet all the time,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.690
is when a straight marriage
and gay marriage are analogous.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.880
So some people say
that they do not

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.800
believe that gay people
should be allowed

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.470
to marry each other because
they think that marriage should

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.910
be between a man and a woman.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.290
Now, that is not exactly
an illogical argument.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.600
But it's also not a
very profound argument,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.760
because all they've really done
is said the same thing twice.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.030
So if I say, I like orange juice
because I like orange juice,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.650
that's not illogical.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.330
It just hasn't got
anywhere at all,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.680
you haven't achieved anything.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.500
And so just being
logical versus illogical

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.530
is not the be all and end all
of what an intelligent person

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.490
should try and do.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.727
What we should try and do is
actually make progress and gain

00:09:32.727 --> 00:09:35.310
understanding, not just say the
same thing over and over again

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.570
with slightly different words.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.340
So the sense in which these
two things are not analogous

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.300
is if you do think
that marriage is

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.710
about an unrelated
man and woman,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.320
and then it is true that
same-sex marriage does not

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.500
come under that.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.670
However, if you think that it
is about two unrelated adults,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.890
then same-sex marriage
does come under that.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.920
And the question shouldn't
be whether those things are

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.600
the same or not, the
question should be,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.050
which level is a good
level for us to consider?

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.800
Now, the next thing
that happens if you go

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.019
as far as this is that
somebody will get really upset

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:06.810
and say, oh, well, the
next thing you know,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.680
we'll be allowing incest.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.410
And so what they've done is,
they've gone up a further level

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.224
and gone up to the
level of two adults.

00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:15.640
And then, the next
thing you know,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.484
you could go up to the
level of just two humans.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:19.900
And then, the next
thing you know,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.830
you could go up to the level
of two living creatures.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.250
And then, you could just go up
to the level of two creatures.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.880
This is the slide that could
have been redacted had there

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.550
been any minors in the room.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.750
Now, all of these levels
are logically valid.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.930
I would argue that some of them
are not very morally valid.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.520
But that's a different question.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.950
And what is certainly
not logically valid

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.070
is to claim that just
because somebody has accepted

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.550
this level, some people
claim that means that you've

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.870
accepted all the other levels.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.790
And that is not logically valid.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.640
So once we've made precise
what all these levels are,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.700
we can now have a discussion
about which level anyone thinks

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.840
that we should go up to.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.600
But we should not conflate
all the different levels.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.330
And the trouble with not making
those levels precise is that

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.720
somebody can hallucinate,
willfully or otherwise,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.510
that somebody else has shot all
the way up to the top when they

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.800
haven't.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.210
So this is one of the
advantages, I think,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.980
of the precision of
abstract mathematics.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.620
I'd like to move on to talking
about the interconnectedness

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.510
of things, because
everything is interconnected.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.550
Unfortunately, many
people often like

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.640
to blame exactly one thing,
or exactly one person,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.170
or one group of people.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.820
And that is a way to
simplify situations,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.490
but I don't think
it's a very good way.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.440
And yes, we are
all trying to make

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.790
sense of a complicated world.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.280
And that requires somehow
simplifying the world.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.334
But just ignoring
huge quantities of it

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.000
is not a great way
of doing it, I think.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.130
I think that a better
way of doing it

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.980
is to become more intelligent,
because then the world becomes

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.740
simpler relative to
your intelligence.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.890
And then, you
simplify the world.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.290
So here is one of my favorite
diagrams of interconnectedness.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.730
We all know this picture.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.520
It's not a geographically
accurate picture.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440
It doesn't show
geographical location.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.990
What it shows is the
interconnectedness of stations

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.430
by different tube lines.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.220
And this is all we need to know
if we're trying to get from one

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.580
tube station to another.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.400
Once we're in the
train, we don't really

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.760
need to know exactly where
the tunnel goes, necessarily.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.590
We just need to know where
it's going to pop out at.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.330
And this does mean that
hapless tourists sometimes

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.400
find themselves taking a
tube ridiculous distance

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.650
because they didn't realize
that actually if they just

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.350
went above ground, it was
two minutes' walk that way.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.710
This is an abstract
picture because it's just

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.570
showing the
interconnectedness of things.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.300
This is the geographical
tube map picture.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.580
It is much harder to
understand if you're

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.260
trying to use it
to get from A to B,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.882
but that doesn't
mean it's worthless.

00:12:51.882 --> 00:12:54.340
It's quite interesting to see
where the tube lines actually

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.100
go and to see where the tube
stations really are in London,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.100
I think.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.100
So it's not that one of these is
right and one of them is wrong,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.580
it's just that it depends
what you're trying to achieve

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.320
and that depending on what
you're trying to achieve,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.370
you should look
at the things that

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.994
are relevant to the
thing you're trying

00:13:07.994 --> 00:13:10.750
to achieve or understand,
and then be able to switch

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.210
between thinking about relevant
these things in this situation

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.882
and those things
in that situation.

00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:18.340
And that's one of the things
that abstract mathematics does

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.320
a lot, is that it
doesn't say, this

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.690
is actually the full
explanation of this situation.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.040
It says, here is an explanation
of an aspect of this situation.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.720
And then on another
day when we're

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.800
worrying about
something else, we

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.091
can think about another aspect.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.650
Relationship
breakdown is something

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.690
that involves a lot
of interconnectedness

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.640
and also a lot of blame.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.640
And often when
relationships break down,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.512
everyone blames one person, and
then the other people all blame

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.220
the other person.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.667
So often people take sides.

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.750
And often the people in
the relationship breakdown

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.620
take sides.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.080
Now, there are situations
where it might really

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.710
be one person's fault in cases
of extreme domestic abuse.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.329
But usually, it's about
a breakdown of things

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:01.370
going in both directions.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.210
And here's an example of how
I think about it sometimes.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.640
Supposing Alex is
someone who doesn't

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.770
like feeling disrespected.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.620
And if Alex feels
disrespected, then Alex

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.540
is unable to show love.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.810
And then, maybe Alex's
partner Sam is someone

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.970
who really likes to feel loved.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.730
And if Sam feels
unloved, then Sam

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.460
is unable to show
respect, in which case

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.020
Alex feels disrespected.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.379
And we get in this cycle.

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.170
And it can get worse,
and worse, and worse.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.030
Now, I can classify these
arrows in different ways.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.210
So these arrows are
arrows about action

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.250
that people take in
response to something,

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.410
and these arrows are
about feelings that people

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.960
have in response to something.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.240
And they can get into a
very bad vicious cycle.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.130
Once we've seen it's
this vicious cycle

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.210
by the interconnectedness
of these arrows,

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.420
we can think about how
to break the cycle.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.100
We can think about
which of these arrows

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.350
is the weakest one
that we could break.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.200
We can think about whether
it's more difficult to change

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.797
your feelings or your actions.

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:59.380
I think it's harder
to change feelings

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.629
because feelings just are,
you just respond to things,

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:03.612
but you don't have to
act on those feelings.

00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:06.070
But some other people think
that they can't stop themselves

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.210
acting on those
feelings, so they

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.650
have to change their feelings.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.620
But at least we can then have a
clearer discussion about what's

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.420
going on in this situation.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.870
Now, there's an
analogous situation,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.200
that is to say it makes the
same picture, that's possibly

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.260
more urgent, which
is about police

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.820
violence against black people.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.282
This is a particular
issue in America,

00:15:27.282 --> 00:15:28.990
where we have another
vicious circle that

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.620
looks like this that involves,
maybe, police who feel

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.420
threatened by black people.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.330
And that means that they
aggressively defend themselves

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.530
against black people.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.390
But in turn, that
means that black people

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.371
feel very threatened
by the police, which

00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:44.620
means that black people
aggressively defend themselves

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.078
against the police, which means
that police feel threatened

00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:48.280
by black people.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.950
And again, this separates
out into feeling

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.960
responses and action responses.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.430
And once we've
observed that there

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.530
is this interconnectedness
of causes,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.110
then we can have, I think,
a more productive argument.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.984
Instead of half the people
on the internet yelling,

00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:04.150
well, they should just do
what the police tell them,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.470
and then they won't
get shot, and then

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.928
other half saying,
well, the police

00:16:06.928 --> 00:16:08.740
shouldn't shoot
them, that's unfair.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.900
I think that we can look at this
interconnectedness in saying,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.250
there are many things going on.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.160
Now, whose responsibility
is it to change something?

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.190
I think in this situation and
in a relationship breakdown,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.590
whoever has more power
in the situation should

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.970
take the responsibility
for changing it.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.760
But maybe some people
disagree with me.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.530
At least then we can
talk about really

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.230
what we disagree with rather
than having futile shouting

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.630
matches across the internet.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.790
I use the
interconnectedness of things

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.460
to help me understand
difficult situations that

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.290
have arisen when
people are yelling

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.070
about exactly who is to blame.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.730
So one case where I
drew a diagram, that

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.280
looks like a category
theory diagram to me,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.860
was in the egregious
United incident,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.200
or rather after the
egregious United incident,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.650
when the flight was overbooked,
and they picked someone

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.700
to kick off the plane,
and he didn't want to go.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.360
And so they called security,
they hauled him off extremely

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.490
violently, and he sustained
quite serious injuries

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.520
on the way out.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.950
At which point,
half the internet

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.200
went, well, he should have
just left when he was told,

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.220
and then wouldn't get injured.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.636
And the other half
of the internet

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:10.972
said, well, you shouldn't
just beat people up

00:17:10.972 --> 00:17:12.680
because they don't
want to leave a plane.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.496
And some people said it was
just one person's fault,

00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:17.329
some people said it was
just something else.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:18.980
But it was really
a lot of things.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.990
And there was even an editorial
by a British journalist

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.849
whom I probably shouldn't
name, since this

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.560
is going on the
internet, but who

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.040
wrote an editorial saying
it's all of your faults,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.240
yours, because you're
sometimes late for flights.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.330
And that means that they
overbook flights in case people

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.050
are late.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.820
And it's because of that
overbooking that they had

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.028
to get someone off the plane.

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:45.680
So it's actually your fault
for being late for a flight.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.620
I thought, well, that's
pushing it a bit far.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.080
Maybe there is some
kind of a point.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.460
So what kind of
a point is there?

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.090
Well, the end result was
that some injury was caused.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.340
Why was the injury caused?

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.230
Well, the guy refused
to leave the plane,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.982
and also the
security used force.

00:18:01.982 --> 00:18:03.440
But the security
wouldn't even have

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.450
been there unless the
airline had called

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.790
security in the first place.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.140
Now, he refused to leave because
he needed to get to work.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.385
But why did the airline even
choose him in the first place?

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.260
You could say, he was
a doctor at a hospital,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.280
he had a very valid reason
to want to get to work.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.196
Why did they pick him?

00:18:20.196 --> 00:18:21.950
There are questions
about whether there

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.600
was racial profiling,
why did they

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.100
pick those particular people?

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.089
Then, there was, why did they
even need to kick people off

00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:28.880
in the first place?

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.780
Whose fault was that?

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.720
Well, nobody volunteered.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.990
Why did nobody volunteer?

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.940
The airline offered
them too little money.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.680
Were they being
stingy, or why did

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.050
they really want to get home?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.139
Why did they even
decide to remove people

00:18:41.139 --> 00:18:41.930
in the first place?

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.250
That was because the
flight was too full,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.140
the flight was too
full and they needed

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.984
to get some crew to Lewisville.

00:18:46.984 --> 00:18:49.400
Why did they need to get some
crew to Lewisville so badly,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.350
was it some scheduling issue?

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.766
And why was the flight too full?

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.140
Partly because it
was overbooked,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.347
and partly because there
was not enough no-shows.

00:18:56.347 --> 00:18:58.430
Now whose fault is that,
is it the airline's fault

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.263
for overbooking, or is
it the people's fault

00:19:00.263 --> 00:19:01.590
for not showing up?

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.720
It's both of those things.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.511
And then finally,
there's that people often

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:07.160
miss flights, which is a
very tenuous contribution

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.300
to this situation.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.257
But I think that changing
any one of those factors

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:14.840
would have changed
the outcome, but it

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.360
doesn't mean that any one of
those factors by themselves

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.644
is individually to blame.

00:19:18.644 --> 00:19:20.060
It's really the
interconnectedness

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.190
of the whole system.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.280
So another situation
where people often go,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280
oh, it's really simple--

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.071
whenever people say
that, it really usually

00:19:28.071 --> 00:19:28.905
isn't that simple.

00:19:28.905 --> 00:19:29.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:29.405 --> 00:19:30.870
It might be simple
in a different way,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.244
but it's rarely simple in the
way that people are saying.

00:19:33.244 --> 00:19:36.240
And one is when they
talk about losing weight.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.400
So I used to be quite
fat, and I lost 50 pounds,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.270
and I would like to
leave it that way.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.460
And so I think quite
a lot about this

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.450
because it's quite an effort.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.075
And then, periodically
someone will go,

00:19:46.075 --> 00:19:47.750
oh, well, it's not
rocket science,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.530
you just have to eat
less and exercise more.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.240
And I say, well, even rocket
science is just applied maths.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.670
So why do I put on weight?

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.190
Well, I put on weight
because I take in more energy

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.600
than I burn.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.190
And that's because
I eat too much

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.140
and because I
exercise too little.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.000
But it's also because
of my metabolism.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.430
And what affects my metabolism?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.410
Well, my metabolism slows
down if I eat too little

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.130
and I exercise too much.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.220
So already, we have the
fact that I gain weight

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.080
because I eat too
much and too little,

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.840
and I exercise too
much and too little.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.540
So yes, it's a very
simple situation, together

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.670
with the fact that why is
my metabolism like that,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.100
it's also some genetics,
the amount of sleep

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.750
I do and don't get.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.220
And why do I eat too much?

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.380
I really like food--

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.210
but also because emotions,
I emotionally eat.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.490
And why do I eat too much?

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.620
Well, why do I eat too
much because of emotions?

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.370
Some people don't.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.930
It's partly to do
with my genetics

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.460
and partly to do
with my upbringing

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.751
where we definitely had an
emotional connection to food

00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:48.750
when I was growing up.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.792
And there's also social
pressure to eat too much.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.291
And some people say, you can't
blame everyone else all time.

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:54.787
But let's look at
all the factors.

00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:57.120
There is social pressure to
eat too much, because people

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.090
get bored with you if you don't
join in stuffing your face when

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.662
they are.

00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:04.890
The social norms
also cause emotions

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.275
that cause me to eat too much.

00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:08.400
Then there's also time
pressure-- if I'm very busy,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.040
I get stressed and
I also sleep less.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.560
And there's also life
that causes emotions.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.660
And then, there's also
the entire food industry.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.510
So there's a multibillion
pound food industry

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.210
that is trying to get us to
eat too much because that's

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.220
how they make money.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.260
And they're also trying to
get us to want to lose weight,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.272
and to try and lose
weight and fail,

00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:32.730
so that they can carry on with
a diet industry that doesn't

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.940
really achieve anything.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.430
And so advertising and so on
causes us to eat too much,

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.440
and then they make
money out of us.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.180
So it's kind of money,
maybe it's money

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.130
that's at the root
of everything.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.560
Then, there's the fact
that if I do gain weight,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.700
then I try to eat less,
and exercise too much,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.230
and I get stressed about it.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.920
And so I get all of
these vicious cycles,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.400
and interconnectedness, and
a conglomeration of factors.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.816
So now try and tell me that
it really is that simple.

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:01.440
I don't think it
really is that simple,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.180
but it really is this simple.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.620
And the point is,
if you get used

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.710
to understanding interconnected
networks of factors,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.810
then this actually is
simple, the whole thing.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.200
You don't have to forget
huge parts of the diagram

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.460
in order to make it simple.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.064
Your brain can comprehend
this as a single unit.

00:22:17.064 --> 00:22:18.480
And that's what I
mean by becoming

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.240
more intelligent in order
to make things simpler.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.730
I did draw a diagram
for the 2016 US election

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.920
because it's a
classic case of people

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.060
yelling at each other
about whose fault it is.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.327
Here's my diagram.

00:22:32.327 --> 00:22:33.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:35.280
I'm not going to leave
it up for very long,

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.980
but I did find it
very helpful for me

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.930
to put all of these
different factors

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.732
in and understand why
people are yelling at--

00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:44.190
there are some
people who just say,

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.100
it's the entire fault of
the third party voters.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.830
But what they don't realize
is that the people voting

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.410
third party wouldn't have made
a difference if the voting

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.580
system were different.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.950
So it's people voting
third party and the fact

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.800
that the voting system is
the way it is, and so on.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.780
So this to me, is the
logic inside the situation.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.730
Working out why
each of these things

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.520
was there in the first
place is more the politics

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.750
or the sociology of it.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.570
But understanding the logic of
the interconnectedness right

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.987
at the outset can help us
start to think about all

00:23:16.987 --> 00:23:17.820
of the other issues.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.580
It's definitely not
the full understanding,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.770
but it makes it so
much clearer to me,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.210
and it means that
I can see what's

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.210
going on with other
people's arguments about it.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.800
I'd now like to talk about
relationships between things.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.362
I mentioned relationships
between people just now.

00:23:34.362 --> 00:23:35.820
But a lot of what
I've been talking

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.194
about in the
previous section was

00:23:37.194 --> 00:23:39.000
about how things
are interconnected

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.680
by different relationships.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.210
And actually, my
field of research,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.250
which is category
theory, is all about

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.500
studying relationships
between things

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.900
instead of their
intrinsic characteristics.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.670
And so I've learned
a lot from this.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.950
And my brain is very
geared towards thinking

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.980
about relationships
between things a lot.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.840
And I realize that it can
apply to many important things

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.570
in the world around us, but
starting from something quite

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.720
banal like the factors of 30.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.270
So this is obviously
mathematical,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.640
maybe we can remember what
the factors of 30 are--

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:21.990
they are 1, and 2, 3,
5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.770
Very good.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.110
It's not very
interesting, it's a bunch

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.700
of numbers in a straight line.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.740
And we live in a
three-dimensional world,

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.300
so we write on
two-dimensional pieces

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.640
of paper in one-dimensional
straight lines, which

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.200
means that we stuff
all our thoughts

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.284
into a one-dimensional
straight line all the time.

00:24:36.284 --> 00:24:37.741
And sometimes they
don't want to be

00:24:37.741 --> 00:24:39.210
in a one-dimensional
straight line,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.520
they have natural geometry
in higher dimensions.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.110
And I like to say
this is why I don't

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.820
tidy the papers on
my desk, because they

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.420
have natural geometry
in higher dimensions.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:49.361
They don't want to be stuffed
into a one-dimensional pile.

00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:52.140
So I'm going to exhibit
the natural geometry

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.170
of this situation or find some
by looking at which numbers

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.110
are also factors of each other.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.880
And I'm going to draw something
a bit like the family tree

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.560
to show those relationships.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.390
So like in a family
tree, I don't

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.150
need to show relationships
across two generations

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.500
because we can deduce those.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.770
So we have 30 at the top like
a kind of great-grandparent.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.800
And then, we have 6, 10,
and 15 that go into 30.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.320
We have 5 goes into 10 and 15.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.310
2 goes into 6 and 10.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.490
3 goes into 6 and 15.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.190
And 1 goes into 2, 3, and 5.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.650
So now, we see that it's
the corners of a cube.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.190
We can also see a
hierarchy going on here,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.410
because you might notice
that one is at the bottom

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.772
because it's the smallest,
and then 2, 3, and 5

00:25:33.772 --> 00:25:35.730
are directly above it
because nothing else goes

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.330
into them apart from 1, which
is that they are prime numbers.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.740
And then at the
level above that,

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.840
we have products of
two prime numbers.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.000
And then at the top, we have a
product of three prime numbers.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.930
So we have a hierarchy according
to the number of prime factors

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.190
that each number has.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.550
And if I draw out a picture
of the prime factors,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.859
instead I get this.

00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:56.400
So at the bottom,
it's the empty set,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.720
there are no prime factors.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.960
And then, one prime factor,
pairs of prime factors,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.090
and then three.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.140
And we can get back to
the left-hand diagram

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.630
by just multiplying together
all the numbers at each corner.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.290
But now, maybe we can
see it didn't really

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.060
matter what those numbers were.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.556
In fact, it didn't really
matter what they were at all.

00:26:14.556 --> 00:26:15.930
They could have
been a, b, and c.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.380
So we've turned our
numbers into letters, ooh.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.380
And now we have arrows
that show forgetting

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.470
one thing from each
set, so this is also

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.840
called subset interaction.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.330
But this is now,
it's very powerful

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.440
because we can try it
with something else.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.800
So we could switch to
doing the factors of 42.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.380
And we can draw a
diagram similarly

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.800
where we start with 1 and then
prime factors 2, 3, and 7,

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.620
then the products of
two prime factors,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.580
and the product of
[INAUDIBLE] prime factors.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.830
We can redraw the
other diagrams,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.090
and you can see that the
right-hand one is just a, b,

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:49.590
and c.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.670
It's the same.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.050
The middle one
looks very similar,

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.920
except that 7 has been
put in place of every 5.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.440
So once we get as far abstract
as the right-hand side,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.390
it's become the same picture.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.210
It looks less and less
the same towards the left,

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.740
and this is the
point of abstraction

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.125
that many things
become the same.

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.500
And there is a
particular feature

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.030
about the left-hand diagram
that I want to point out,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.860
which is that 6 is less than 7.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.690
Now that might not
sound very profound,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.440
but notice that 6 is higher
than 7 in the diagram,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.410
but 6 is less than 7
in the normal hierarchy

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.700
of size of numbers.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.240
So there is a difference,
there is a tension

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.700
between the hierarchy
in this diagram

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.150
and the just sheer
size of numbers.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.080
And that is something
that's going

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.890
to be crucial in the next
couple of minutes as we move on,

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.790
because now I'm going to
show that this has become

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.310
very powerful at the
abstract level, because a, b,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.230
and c can be anything.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.460
They don't have to be
numbers, they can be anything.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.240
So for example, they can be
three types of privilege--

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.437
rich, white, and male.

00:27:53.437 --> 00:27:55.020
And then at the next
level down, we'll

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.270
have people with two types
of privilege, rich and white,

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.470
rich and male, and white male,
and then at the next level

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.290
down, just rich, white,
or male, and then

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.790
at the bottom, people with none
of those types of privilege.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.340
And if I put back in the
other words for emphasis,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.770
we have rich, white, non-men,
we have rich non-white men,

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.870
we have poor white men.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.810
I should have said non-rich,
but it doesn't fit sideways,

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.755
so I said poor.

00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:21.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.530
We have rich non-white
non-men, poor white non-men,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.140
and poor non-white men.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.420
And at the bottom,
poor non-white non-men.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.020
So we have gone from a
diagram of factors of 30

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.026
to a diagram of interaction of
different types of privilege.

00:28:37.026 --> 00:28:38.400
And there are many
things I think

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.450
we can learn from this diagram.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.860
The first is that each arrow
represents a direct loss

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.870
of one type of privilege.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.040
And it doesn't mean that
all the people who are white

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.770
are better off than all the
people who are not white,

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.060
because you can see
along the second level

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.830
that there are some people
with no arrows in between them.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.620
So there is no direct loss of
privilege along that level.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.456
Now, this is
something that people

00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:04.830
make a mistake
about when they're

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.960
getting angry about the
theory of privilege.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.350
Because people sometimes
point at the super rich black

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.690
sportstar, and say, look at
that really rich black person.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.190
See, white privilege
doesn't exist.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.070
But that's not what
white privilege means.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.153
White privilege, in the
theory of white privilege,

00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:21.330
means that if that super
rich black sportstar

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.810
had all the same features
but was also white,

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.770
then we would expect them
to be better off in society.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:32.010
And so it's not trying to say
that every white person is

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.560
better off than every
non-white person,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.840
it's about losing
one type of privilege

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.030
along one of these
arrows and how that

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.472
affects people's experiences.

00:29:40.472 --> 00:29:42.930
Now, there's something else I
think we can learn from this.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.300
If we just look
along the second row

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.540
of people who are level, having
two types of privilege each.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.850
Because I don't think
that they are really

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.700
level in terms of absolute
privilege in society.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.481
If we think about
rich white women,

00:29:56.481 --> 00:29:58.230
I think we can probably
agree that they're

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.290
better off in society than,
say, rich black men, who

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.720
are in turn better off
than poor white men.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.520
Because it turns
out that money can

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.530
mitigate for an awful
lot of other problems.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.340
So actually, it's
more skewed like this.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.435
And the same is true
on the bottom level.

00:30:13.435 --> 00:30:15.810
Although actually, I think
it's skewed further than that,

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.630
because if we look at the
interaction between the two

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.670
levels in the middle,
I think we might

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.570
be able to agree that rich
non-white non-men are probably

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.120
better off in society
than poor white men.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.332
Because again, riches
mitigate for many things.

00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:32.040
And if we think about
some extreme cases,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.009
like Michelle Obama
or Oprah Winfrey,

00:30:35.009 --> 00:30:37.050
I'm sure we'll all agree
that they're much better

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.449
off than poor, white,
unemployed, homeless men

00:30:39.449 --> 00:30:41.490
in the middle of nowhere
in America, for example.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.780
So actually, it's
skewed more like this.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.590
And it's just like the
fact that 6 is less than 7.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.370
So 6 was at a higher level
in terms of the cube,

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.260
but it was lower in
absolute terms than 7.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.080
And poor white men have
two types of privilege,

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.530
so they're quite high up
in terms of privilege.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.450
But when it comes to
absolute privilege,

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.610
they're lower down than
people who are considered

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.330
less privileged than them.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.120
And this has helped
me understand

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.470
why some poor white men are so
angry in society at the moment,

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.640
because they are considered
to be privileged,

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.080
but they don't feel any actual
manifestations or benefits

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.067
of that privilege.

00:31:17.067 --> 00:31:18.900
And I think that it's
more productive for us

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.240
to understand this
root of that anger

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.580
rather than simply to be
angry with them in return.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.310
Seeing these
abstract structures,

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.806
I think, helps us pivot,
or can help us pivot,

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.180
between different
situations that

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.270
are analogous in which we play
different roles so that we can

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.420
understand what it's like to
be in different situations

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.220
in those abstract structures.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.590
And we can look at analogous
people in different structures.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:50.390
So for example, we've seen that
in these three cubes, 30, 42,

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.000
and rich white men all
occupy an analogous position.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.750
And if we look at just one
type of power relationship

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.120
over another one, we can see
some more analogous things,

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.450
such as that male people
over female people

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.630
are analogous in a way to
white people's relationships

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.360
to black people, which is
analogous to rich people's

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.850
power over poor people,
because each of these

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.160
involves a power
difference in society.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.740
We can then have a
discussion about how exactly

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.900
that power difference
manifests itself,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.940
but there is an analogous
power difference

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.440
in the sense of this diagram.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.620
However, there is not an
analogous power difference

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.460
between these two situations.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.930
So the interaction of male
people to female people

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.780
is not analogous to the
interaction of female people

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.150
to male people because
of that power difference.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.950
And that is why that gives
us a sense in which men

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.020
are being sexist
against women is not

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.900
exactly the same as women
being sexist against men.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.920
And it gives us a sense in
which white people being racist

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.230
against black people is
different from black people

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.700
being racist against
white people,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.940
and a sense in which straight
people being prejudiced

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.350
against gay people is not
the same as gay people

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.350
being prejudiced against
straight people because

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.539
of power differences.

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:04.080
And I think that's
an important thing

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.720
that these abstract structures
can help us remember together

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.460
with the fact that
something could

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.680
be not at the top
in one context,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.990
but at the top in a
different context.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.530
So in our original
diagram of privilege,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.460
rich, white men are at the top.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.300
But if we restrict our
attention to non-men,

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.590
then we get these people.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:28.300
And we find that rich, white,
non-men are now at the top.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.970
And if, in fact, we restrict our
entire context to, say, women,

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.970
and we think of three types
of privilege among women,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.060
then we can think about
rich, white, and cisgendered

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.580
as being our three types
of privilege, for example.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.730
And now, we'll see that
rich, white, cis women

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.540
occupy the analogous position
that rich, white men do

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.370
in broader society.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.770
And this has helped
me to understand

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.020
why there is so much
anger against white women,

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.230
especially in some parts
of the feminist movement

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.680
at the moment, because they can
be prone to seeing themselves

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.680
as under-privileged
relative to white men,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.260
because we women do all feel
everyday sexism every day.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.179
And that is a very
big part of our lives.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.730
But then as a result,
they can maybe

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.179
forget how privileged they are
relative to non-white women who

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.830
have it even worse than them.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:20.650
And understanding those
underprivileged and

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.239
over-privileged aspects
of the same person

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.250
can help us to
remember what it's

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.739
like to be somewhere
else in the cube.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:29.540
We're all
over-privileged relative

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.850
to someone and underprivileged
relative to somebody else.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.806
And so we could all pivot
between a situation in which we

00:34:35.806 --> 00:34:37.639
are one thing and a
situation in which we're

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.639
other to understand it from
someone else's point of view.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.469
And in that way, these
abstract structures

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.020
can help us empathize
with other people.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.739
And here are some pivots that
I do or that we could do.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.350
So one is that as
an Asian person,

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.690
I've realized that I
understand something

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.520
of what it's like
to be non-white,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.780
because I'm not white.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.410
But also, I am probably
among the most privileged

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.220
of non-white people, because
Asians occupy, in many ways,

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.310
a much better position than
other non-white people in most

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.980
of the world.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.607
And so I can pivot between
understanding things

00:35:10.607 --> 00:35:13.190
from the underprivileged and the
over-privileged point of view

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.020
from a racial perspective.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.090
In terms of wealth,
I can also pivot,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.820
because I don't tend to think
of myself as extremely rich.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.320
I'm not so rich that I don't
have to work ever again,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.720
I'm not that kind of rich.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.720
But I'm doing perfectly fine,
and that is a much better

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.970
situation to be than people
who are really struggling,

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.460
who are maybe unemployed
or working at minimum wage.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.400
And so I think most people,
especially in this country,

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.860
we tend to view rich
people as other people.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.560
And however, we are all
richer than somebody.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.500
And there is somebody who is
viewing us as rich in turn.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.410
And so we can pivot
between those situations.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.140
And here is the pivot
that white women could do,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.050
because white women are less
privileged than white men,

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.660
but more privileged
than non-white women.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.560
And any time you take two
adjectives where one of them

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.510
has privilege and one doesn't
and put them together,

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.240
you can have this
situation where

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.120
if you only see yourself
as under-privileged

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.730
and everyone else sees
you as over-privileged,

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.660
then antagonism will
result from that.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.350
So finally, I'd like to
talk about, sum up, what I

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.690
think intelligence is, really.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:19.244
And because I've been
drawing all these diagrams

00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:21.910
of interconnectedness, I thought
I'd draw one about intelligence

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.100
to show what I think
are the contributing

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.690
factors to intelligence.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:30.240
So I do think that intelligence
involves being reasonable,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.370
being not just logical,
but powerfully logical,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.180
and also being helpful.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.784
So if you just sit in
a cave and use logic,

00:36:37.784 --> 00:36:39.700
I don't think that's
particularly intelligent,

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.200
because you're not
really helping anything.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.310
I mean, people can disagree.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.480
You can disagree
with me about this,

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.280
but I don't think
that's very intelligent.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.590
So what do these things mean?

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:52.070
I think that being reasonable
means you can be reasoned with.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.400
And what that means is not
just that you use logic,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.980
but you have some kind
of framework for it,

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.740
a framework for telling when
you should change your mind.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.130
I think that's really important.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.650
You can tell when
someone isn't reasonable

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.230
if there's no possible situation
in which they would change

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.875
their mind, if there is
no possible evidence that

00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:10.000
would convince them that
the moon landings actually

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.490
happened, then that isn't
terribly reasonable.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:16.450
So what about being
powerfully logical?

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.430
Well, I gave an
example of saying,

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:22.149
if you say something twice,
so if you don't believe

00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:24.190
in gay marriage because
you think marriage should

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.630
be between a man
and a woman, you've

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:26.950
just said the same thing twice.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.160
That's not powerfully logical,
even though it's not illogical.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.170
So I think being
powerfully logical

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:36.580
involves not just using logic,
but also using techniques

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.280
to build up logical
arguments and unravel

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.010
logical arguments so that you
can actually get somewhere

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.360
with your logic.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.570
And finally, being helpful
crucially involves, well,

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.460
some techniques
for being helpful,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.860
but it really involves
using our emotions,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.870
because people are
emotional beings.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.900
And if we don't use emotions to
communicate with other people,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.030
then we'll just be
throwing cold logic at them

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.800
all the time instead
of understanding

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.060
what it is that they are feeling
and why they are feeling it.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.350
So I really like Carlo
Cipolla's theory of stupidity.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.370
It's a slightly tongue-in-cheek
but quite serious theory.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.160
He starts by saying he
thinks that in any given

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.230
group of people, there's
the same proportion

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:21.340
of stupid people, whether
those are scientists,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.310
people who work at Google,
maybe more in politicians--

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.870
--professors, Nobel Prize
winners, prisoners, criminals,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.260
street sweepers--

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.780
he thinks that there's
exactly the same proportion

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.720
of stupid people
everywhere, and that it's

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.270
more than you are
ever expecting,

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.220
even after you've taken
that into account.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.340
So OK, what does
he mean by stupid?

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.140
Well, he has a
definition, and it

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.420
involves a graph with two axes.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.940
And this axis is how much
you benefit yourself,

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.340
and this axis is how much
you benefit other people.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:56.590
So if you benefit yourself
and hurt other people,

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.630
then you are a bandit.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.480
If you benefit other
people but hurt yourself,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.600
then you are what he
calls unfortunate.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.730
I sometimes think of
this as being a martyr,

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.562
where you sacrifice
yourself all the time

00:39:08.562 --> 00:39:09.520
for the good of others.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.990
And I used to do
this a lot, and I

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.626
think that quite
a lot of women do,

00:39:12.626 --> 00:39:14.000
because we think
that it's noble,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.880
and we're supposed
to efface ourselves

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.949
for the good of our people.

00:39:17.949 --> 00:39:19.990
I've eventually realized
that that's not terribly

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.670
productive in the long run.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.840
If you hurt others and hurt
yourself at the same time,

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.956
you are stupid.

00:39:26.956 --> 00:39:27.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.785 --> 00:39:29.470
And that's how he
defines stupid.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.570
Whereas, if you
benefit other people

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:35.030
and you benefit yourself at the
same time, that's intelligent.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.210
And I think this is
what intelligence is.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.060
I don't think it has anything
to do with qualifications,

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.870
degrees, education, money,
status, job, achievements,

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.300
prizes, accolades,
any of those things.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.900
I think it's about this.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.780
And I think that we should use
logic and emotions together

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.870
so that we can benefit
ourselves and other people

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.710
at the same time, and in that
way, create a virtuous circle,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.950
because logic and abstract
mathematical thinking, I think,

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.510
can actually help
us to understand

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.910
how other people think
from their point of view

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.550
rather than from our point
of view, which helps us

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.360
to empathize with other people.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.600
And if we can empathize
with other people,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.720
then that will help us act
in a logical way for them

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.370
and for us all
together so that we can

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.380
create this virtuous circle.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.350
And I think it might
be a surprising idea

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.170
that abstract mathematics
can do that for us,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.720
but I truly believe
that it can, and I

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.630
hope that I can persuade
many people to join in

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.550
with this lofty aim.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.442
Thank you.

00:40:34.442 --> 00:40:37.334
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:45.487 --> 00:40:48.070
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much,
we do have time for questions.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.820
Please raise your hand.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the
talk, that was really amazing.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.000
I also have a background
in mathematics

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.710
and have always wished that I
could help other people not be

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.520
as afraid of it.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.230
And I see that you're writing
books to accomplish this.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.100
And I had always planned to
eventually create a website

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.780
where I could
offer free tutoring

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.960
and then end up with this
kind of database of questions

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.400
that are well-answered.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.140
But now after
seeing your chart, I

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.930
feel like that's
the martyr route.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.870
So I'm just wondering if you
have any suggestions for what

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.840
I could potentially do or
if this is something you've

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.740
thought about at length, maybe.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:36.440
EUGENIA CHENG: I did start out
by just making videos of me

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.010
explaining things to people.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:42.270
And it wasn't too much
martyrdom-ish at the time,

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:43.970
because I did also feel that--

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.650
I mean, there are many ways
that you can benefit yourself.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.220
And one is that if you get
a feeling of self-worth

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.350
from having helped someone
understand something,

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.730
then you have
benefited yourself.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.770
And personally, I
do derive my self

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.700
worth from how much
I help other people.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.410
So maybe it gets a bit cyclic.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:59.870
And if I have
helped other people,

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.340
then I have helped myself.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.790
But what I had to stop doing
was actively hurting myself.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.220
So I was I was quite
unhappy in a job that I had,

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.680
but I thought that
I should carry

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.360
on going because I
was helping people,

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.040
even though I was
completely miserable.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.410
And that was what was
particularly unproductive

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.130
about it.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.310
So I think that the way in
which you benefit yourself

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.080
can be measured in many ways.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.960
And if you feel like
it's benefiting you,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.580
then it's not
necessarily martyrdom.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.020
If it feels like
it's hurting you

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.090
and that it's making
your life miserable,

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.220
then I think it
limits your ability

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.699
to help people in the long run.

00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:35.240
So you help people tons for a
week, and then you're burnt out

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.180
and you hate everybody, and then
you can't help anyone anymore.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.194
Or you help people a
bit less, and you also

00:42:40.194 --> 00:42:42.110
look after yourself or
do things for yourself,

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:45.230
and then you have a
much longer run of being

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.130
able to benefit other people.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:51.350
So that's some sort of vague
answer to that, I think.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.730
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:55.810
EUGENIA CHENG: Hi.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.510
AUDIENCE: Amazing talk,
and what a fantastic way

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.520
to look at the world.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.390
One question though, when
you're starting to break down

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.710
challenges in life, and
particularly looking

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.710
at the weight loss slide
as one that jumped out,

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.840
I start to see a building
series of contributing factors

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.880
to why this becomes a
challenge to overcome.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.160
How'd you get over that?

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.285
Do you find that when you
start breaking things out

00:43:22.285 --> 00:43:26.560
into all the different reasons
why something is one way,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.660
mentally it becomes
harder to then make

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.030
that change, how do you
get to that next step?

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.410
EUGENIA CHENG: What I do
is, well, first of all,

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.620
I'm so used to dealing
with these huge diagrams

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.699
that I'm less daunted
by them, maybe.

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:40.240
And the more you deal with them,
the less daunted you become.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.347
And it actually becomes
clearer, it's reassuring to me.

00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:46.930
And that's not the
same for everybody,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.138
but because I've been trained
in this way of thinking

00:43:49.138 --> 00:43:52.000
for a long time, it has
become very reassuring to me.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.880
And I think that
what I can then do

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.650
is look at all the
individual parts

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:58.720
and see which is the
arrow that would be

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.460
the best one to try and break.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.830
And once you've
actually made clear

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.539
what all the connections are--

00:44:04.539 --> 00:44:06.580
this is a bit like a
cognitive behavioral therapy

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.160
technique, where you try and
see which arrow you can break--

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.807
but it is about seeing
which one is the weakest

00:44:11.807 --> 00:44:14.140
or which one would be the
easiest one to try and change.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.350
And then, you can try it.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.480
And if it doesn't
work that well,

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.230
at least you might
have weakened it a bit.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.230
And then, you can try
weakening another one.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.646
And then eventually,
there will be

00:44:21.646 --> 00:44:24.460
enough that has become weaker
that the end result doesn't

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.600
happen quite so strongly.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:31.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for this amazing talk,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.960
I really enjoyed it.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.130
EUGENIA CHENG: Thank you.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.710
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering about--

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.380
so obviously, we would
all be better off

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.697
if we all used such logical
mathematical constructs,

00:44:42.697 --> 00:44:45.030
but I think it's clear that,
especially on the internet,

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.970
a lot of people do not.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.980
I was wondering,
are you optimistic,

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:55.100
or do you have any tips for how
we can engage people via logic

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.860
if they're not, even at
all, willing to acknowledge

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.200
that maybe that's a
helpful thing to do?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.900
EUGENIA CHENG: I am optimistic,
and that's why I'm here,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.566
and that's why I write
books, and that's

00:45:04.566 --> 00:45:07.160
why I'm in education, because
I am optimistic that we

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.750
can change things.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:14.690
I think that there are some very
extreme people who we might not

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.540
be able to reach immediately,
and that that's OK,

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.780
and we shouldn't get too
upset about those people.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.530
But there are a whole
load of other people

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.470
who aren't so far gone.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.680
We shouldn't start with the most
absolutely difficult people.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.350
But there are other people
who are, first of all,

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.000
there are people who really,
really want to do better

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.190
but don't know how.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.220
And those are people we can
definitely help to do better.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.922
Then, are the people who
aren't really terrible people,

00:45:40.922 --> 00:45:43.130
they just don't have the
techniques or don't realize.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.870
And then once you
explain it to them,

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:49.220
just like with
things like sexually

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.940
inappropriate comments, some
men, especially older ones,

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.797
have just got used to the fact
that they can say those things

00:45:55.797 --> 00:45:56.880
and they don't understand.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.504
But they're not really
terrible people,

00:45:58.504 --> 00:46:00.600
and once you explain it
to them, then they get it,

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.641
and then they can change.

00:46:01.641 --> 00:46:03.980
Whereas the ones who are
really absolutely morons,

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.320
maybe we can't change
them yet, but eventually,

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.600
if we sway enough people
in that direction.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.760
So I see it as being
a kind of continuum,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.320
and that these are
the people that we

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.710
can most easily convince,
and then once we convinced

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.360
these people, then
everything will

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.130
have shifted a bit further
this way so that then we

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.330
can convince these people.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.600
And then everything
will shift this way,

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.975
and we can convince
these people.

00:46:22.975 --> 00:46:24.590
And eventually,
everything will shift,

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.720
and then maybe we can
get back to a situation

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.360
where it is not acceptable
to be those people anymore.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.360
And one of the problems
with the current climate

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.480
is that it has become acceptable
again to be those people.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.445
And they probably
were always there,

00:46:38.445 --> 00:46:40.820
but maybe they felt like they
weren't supposed to show it

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.650
or that they was not supposed
to be really like that.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.312
And if we can persuade everyone
to come a bit further back

00:46:46.312 --> 00:46:48.770
that way, I don't think we have
to just flip everybody over

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.520
overnight.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.320
But if we can shift the
balance a bit further,

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.160
then I think that could
just flip it back again.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.260
And yes, I am optimistic.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.380
The people who are
unreasonable on the internet

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.900
are often the loudest
and the most annoying,

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.000
but I don't think that they're
the majority of people.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.140
And I've seen enough reasonable
conversations on Twitter, even,

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.410
that I believe it is possible
if we all slow down a bit

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.724
and try to understand what
other people are thinking,

00:47:14.724 --> 00:47:17.140
rather than immediately trying
to show that they're wrong.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.190
AUDIENCE: You are an
accomplished artist as well.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.690
And your title of your
book [? says ?] about art.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:32.452
So where does the art play a
role in making sense of things?

00:47:32.452 --> 00:47:34.890
EUGENIA CHENG: Oh, thank you.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.244
I think that anything is an art.

00:47:36.244 --> 00:47:38.410
Well, it's interesting,
because I teach art students

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:39.970
at the school of the Art
Institute of Chicago,

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.160
so we've had many
discussions about what art is

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.480
and what science is.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.180
And what we have collectively
decided one semester

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.030
is that science is about
trying to understand

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.130
the world around us,
and that art is about

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.040
trying to interpret
the world around us,

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.790
and that in order to
understand the world,

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.020
you have to interpret it.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.160
And in order to
interpret the world,

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.243
you have to understand it.

00:47:58.243 --> 00:48:00.340
So they're really
joined together,

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.810
they're not completely separate.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.730
And to me, something
becomes an art

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.800
if it's not an algorithmic
process that you just

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.884
follow step-by-step.

00:48:09.884 --> 00:48:11.800
And that's why there is
an art to using logic.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.960
Because if you were
just doing, say,

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.259
computer-aided proofs
of something, then maybe

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:19.300
the computer wouldn't be
using an art, because it

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.650
would be using an algorithm.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.190
But when we're
using logic, we have

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:25.930
to understand the
people around us,

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.000
and we have to engage
emotions, and we

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.460
have to pick ways
of speaking, and we

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.460
have to use techniques to
understand what's going on.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.430
And that, to me, is
what makes it an art.

00:48:38.005 --> 00:48:38.505
Hi.

00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:38.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.448
I also enjoyed your
talk very much.

00:48:40.448 --> 00:48:41.760
EUGENIA CHENG: Thank you.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.750
AUDIENCE: You claim that
in any group of people,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.397
there is roughly the
same ratio of stupid--

00:48:48.397 --> 00:48:50.230
EUGENIA CHENG: That's
Carlo Cipolla's claim.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.770
AUDIENCE: But you seem
to be agreed with that.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.950
EUGENIA CHENG: I
was neutral about

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:52.970
whether I agreed with that.

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:54.844
I agreed with his
definition of intelligence.

00:48:54.844 --> 00:48:55.970
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.490
Because it is somehow--

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.030
how to understand
that one would feel

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.880
that in a group of more
intelligent people, are

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.250
were less martyrs.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:10.160
EUGENIA CHENG: Well, only if you
define intelligence like this.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.100
If you define intelligence
by who has really prestigious

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.970
degrees from prestigious
universities,

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.460
I don't know that that's--

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.960
I've worked in some
of those places,

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.640
and I don't know that that's--

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:21.723
I don't know.

00:49:21.723 --> 00:49:22.556
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:29.397 --> 00:49:31.980
AUDIENCE: I was struck right at
the beginning when you started

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.416
talking about the
abstraction of 2 by the fact

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:37.290
that that's maybe
straightforward in English,

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.270
and there are several
languages where

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:42.900
there are particles you
put after the number

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.490
to talk about what kind it is.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.530
So they've got more
levels of abstraction

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.060
built into the language.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:52.630
Does that change anything
in practice or anything

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:54.990
an implication in the process
you're thinking about?

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.670
I guess the child development
aspects is way outside scope,

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.470
but--

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.840
EUGENIA CHENG: I think that
it means, like you say,

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.790
that there are some more
intermediate levels.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.720
But I think at the level of 2,
there's still the concept of 2,

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.970
then there are some
other refinements

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.010
of 2 bleh, and 2 bleh.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.139
And I know what you
mean, because there

00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:16.180
is this in Cantonese, and
it's terribly confusing

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.240
when you're trying to
speak it and it's not

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.420
your first language.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.090
But I think at the
level of 2, there

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:25.690
is still a concept
of 2 that sits kind

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.680
of above all of those things.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.750
And so yes, at different
levels of abstraction,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.240
you get different subtle
nuances in between things.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:42.086
And I don't know what that means
for we native English speakers

00:50:42.086 --> 00:50:43.960
and whether we have a
less subtle distinction

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.849
between different
types of objects.

00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:47.140
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.640
Again, Dr. Eugenia Cheng.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.098
EUGENIA CHENG:
Thank you very much.

00:50:50.098 --> 00:50:51.990
[APPLAUSE]
