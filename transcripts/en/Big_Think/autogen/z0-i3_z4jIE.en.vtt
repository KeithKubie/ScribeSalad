people are interested in such matters I
 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.780
people are interested in such matters I
think we're we're interested in the

so it's true

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890
so it's true

what would love to be able to do that as
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.759
what would love to be able to do that as
a matter of course and that's when I set

some of these broad gestures right so it
seems to me that to ask for a poetry

we're after that because we realize that
part of that clarification actually

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910
part of that clarification actually
 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.390
part of that clarification actually
illuminates the complexity that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400
illuminates the complexity that
 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.029
illuminates the complexity that

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039
surrounds it and sometimes the
 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.149
surrounds it and sometimes the
clarification itself must contain

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159
clarification itself must contain
 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.420
clarification itself must contain
something of that complexity and we know

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
something of that complexity and we know
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.249
something of that complexity and we know
indeed that sometimes the poems that

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259
indeed that sometimes the poems that
 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.219
indeed that sometimes the poems that
seem most simple the ones that we

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229
seem most simple the ones that we
 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.350
seem most simple the ones that we
remember the ones that we go back to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
remember the ones that we go back to
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.839
remember the ones that we go back to
every time we go back to them we realize

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849
every time we go back to them we realize
 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.710
every time we go back to them we realize
actually they're not so simple at all so

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720
actually they're not so simple at all so
 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.159
actually they're not so simple at all so
there's a very this is a this is a is a

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169
there's a very this is a this is a is a
 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.729
there's a very this is a this is a is a
big topic it's a big job
