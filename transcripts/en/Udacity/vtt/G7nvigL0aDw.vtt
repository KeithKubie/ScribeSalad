00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] So, in this class you will learn about particle filters.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In our sequence of algorithms for estimating the state of a system,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this is the third one and in many ways is the best one.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's the easiest to program

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and in most ways is the most flexible.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And to understand why I'm saying this let me start

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with a little quiz that goes back into the first 2 classes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In class 1, we learned about histogram filters,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in class 2 about Kalman filters,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we even had to prove there.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Today, I'll teach you about particle filters,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but we can't really know about particle filters quite yet.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, my questions will only pertain to histogram filters and Kalman filters.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
First, I'd like to know whether the state space was discrete or continuous.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Please check exactly 1 of those 2 boxes over here,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I understand these are not entirely non-ambiguous questions,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.159
but in the spirit of the method please check whichever fits best.
