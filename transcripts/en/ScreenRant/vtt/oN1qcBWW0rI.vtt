00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.880
The days of Television being seen as a smaller,
cheaper, or less ambitious sibling to movies

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.920
are long gone, as some of the best writers,
actors, and directors are turning their talents

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.110
to the small screen.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.050
But they’re also required to churn out countless
hours more every year – for fans, that means

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.870
plenty of tiny mistakes and laughable errors
you don’t want to miss.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.790
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Huge Mistakes You
Have To See In TV Shows.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.790
Breaking Bad

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.950
Creator Vince Gilligan’s story of a chemistry
teacher turned drug kingpin was carefully

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.620
planned, which means major mistakes are hard
to find.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.329
As the show built towards its second season
finale, Walt was forced to break into his

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.649
partner Jesse’s house, and steal his stash.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.760
With Jesse and his girlfriend in a heroin-fueled
haze during the visit, it must be a crew member

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.329
awarding himself a hard-to-miss cameo, peeking
around a door frame as Walt makes a fast exit.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.329
Orange is the New Black

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.260
Complicated doesn’t begin to describe the
relationship between Orange is the New Black

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.879
heroine Piper Chapman and her ex-girlfriend
Alex.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.140
Aside from being the one responsible for landing
Piper in prison, fans could have seen early

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.320
on that Alex wasn’t to be trusted based
on her tattoos alone.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.970
The first episode of the Netflix series gave
a clear look at the salt shaker on Alex’s

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.440
left shoulder that would last for the rest
of the series.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
Or would it?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.500
Two episodes later, it’s changed its position,
returning to its original angle from then

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.520
on.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520
Mad Men

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.380
Creator Matthew Weiner knew that setting a
TV series in the early 1960s would mean plenty

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.480
of fact-checking, but Mad Men has been noted
for several mistakes and inconsistencies.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.360
Gadgets that weren’t invented yet, or modern
sayings are on thing, but Weiner has admitted

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.840
a few are more embarrassing.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.300
When Joan mentioned a reservation at the famous
New York restaurant Le Cirque, food buffs

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
called foul, since it didn’t open until
1974.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.160
The creator first blamed actress Christina
Hendricks for ad-libbing the line, but would

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.500
later admit it was an oversight, and a “terrible
error.”

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Game of Thrones

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.960
It didn’t take long for Prince Joffrey to
prove he wasn’t born to lead once he took

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630
the throne in the fantasy series’ first
season.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.440
Among the most surprising twists was releasing
Barristan Selmy from the kingsguard without

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
warning.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.760
The proud knight didn’t go quietly, forcing
the rest of the king’s knights to draw their

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760
blades.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.210
No blood was spilled, but the standoff was
enough to rattle one of the guards, as one

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.460
can clearly be seen shaking and struggling
to sheathe his sword without ruining the entire

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.460
shot.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.090
In hindsight, the humor probably helped break
the tension in the throne room.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.090
House of Cards

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.340
With Frank Underwood having climbed to the
rank of Vice President in the first season

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.180
of the Netflix original, the second season
finale saw him claim the Oval Office for himself.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.040
To do it, he sends a typewritten letter to
the president, offering to take the fall for

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040
his scandal.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
Using an Underwood typewriter raises the drama
of the scene, but it also means Frank lets

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.100
a typo slip through.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.819
Although he narrates the letter as “staring
at the desk,” the letter clearly shows the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.830
word “started.”

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.240
Where’s spellcheck when you need it?.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.690
Better Call Saul

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.250
Fans of Breaking Bad were all too happy to
see an origin story of attorney Saul Goodman,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.700
but the timeline meant it would have to be
set in the year 2002, with Breaking Bad taking

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.880
place seven years later.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.530
The show runners did a good job of keeping
new model cars and technology out of the fiction

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.890
– but they weren’t perfect.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.520
The background of one scene includes the AT&amp;T
logo.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.069
It’s actually the logo introduced in 2005
– in 2002, the sign should have featured

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.490
the company’s previous logo.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.490
Sons of Anarchy

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.540
The boys of SAMCRO may have won over fans
with their criminal adventures, but masterminds

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540
they’re not.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.810
That usually isn’t a problem, but it also
means that Opie makes more work for himself

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.340
than he has to, breaking into a car in the
second season.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.990
He’s using a slim jim properly, sliding
it into the window casing to pop open the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.990
lock.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.099
But from the interior shot, it’s obvious
that the car is already open, with the door

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.930
lock shown in the raised, unlocked position.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.930
Homeland

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.960
Every movie and TV fan knows that no matter
how intimate or personal a performance or

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.239
scene may be, there are dozens of producers
and crew behind every camera.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.870
But it’s the director’s job to make sure
that the casual viewer never actually SEEs

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.870
them.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.430
Sometimes, that’s easier said than done.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.819
For instance: an episode of Homeland that
required a Saudi diplomat be interviewed in

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.620
a window-filled building in broad daylight.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.209
The scene may be gripping, but it’s hard
to not be distracted by the entire crew reflected

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.069
in his glasses against the sunny background.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.010
American Horror Story: Freak Show

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.610
Jessica Lange’s leading lady Elsa in season
2 of the TV series had a more tragic backstory

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.000
than most, having lost both of her legs.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.980
Her prosthetic legs are hidden under stockings
for most of the show, until the series finale.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.060
When her dream of superstardom is briefly
dashed, Elsa collapses to the floor in hysterics.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.500
Apparently, the editors determined there wasn’t
any point in pretending her legs were prosthetic,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.900
simply hoping fans no longer cared about keeping
up appearances.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900
Modern Family

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.750
It’s not really fair to criticize the Dunphy
clan for their mistakes, since Phil’s flawed

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.910
thinking is what made him a fan-favourite
cast member to begin with.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.690
He has his successes, though: like making
his family proud by learning to walk a tightrope

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.960
in Season 3.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.370
He makes his dream come true by the episode’s
end but… it shouldn’t have been a dream

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.370
to begin with.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.470
Two seasons earlier, Phil revealed he was
already an expert at the tightrope, thanks

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.250
to his time spent at trapeze camp.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.850
Maybe all those knocks to the head finally
caught up with him.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.270
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.130
