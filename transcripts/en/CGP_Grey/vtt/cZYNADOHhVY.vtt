00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.440
Once upon a time, a dragon tyrannized the kingdom.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.300
Covered with thick black scales, its eyes glowed with hate ,…

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.440
… and from its terrible jaws flowed evil-smelling slime.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.640
Some tried to fight the dragon …

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.340
… priests and magicians called down curses to no avail.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.560
Warriors, armed with the best weapons, attacked, only to be incinerated.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.900
The dragon’s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, …

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.580
… its scaly armor so hard, as to make it invincible.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.060
The dragon demanded from humankind a tribute: …

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.500
… ten thousand men and women, randomly chosen, …

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.580
… to be delivered every evening to the foot of the mountain to be eaten.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.300
The king and the kingdom, their weapons useless, …

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.760
… had no choice but to pay the grisly tribute, ….

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.880
… to suffer the misery, to feed the insatiable hunger.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.840
And humans, ever adaptable, came to accept the dragon-tyrant as a fact of life; …

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.840
… knowing, even embracing, that everyone’s final moments would be in its maw.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
How could the world be otherwise?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.720
The kingdom began to teach its children that the dragon had its place …

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.720
… in the natural order and, the very meaning of being human to end up …

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.400
… in the dragon’s stomach, their shorter lives motivating them to lead good lives.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.680
And the dragon was helping the kingdom by keeping the population …

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840
… from growing too fast.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
Learning this, attacks on the dragon ceased.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.680
But the kingdom still grew, slowly, and with it so did the dragon, …

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.600
… becoming as big as the mountain on which it lived, its appetite increasing.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.120
The logistics of collecting and transporting so many every day…

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.240
… to the mountain came to occupy the king’s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.440
The king had to hire registrars to keep track of who would be sent.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.280
There were people-collectors dispatched to fetch the designated victims.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.720
There were clerks who administered the pensions to be paid to decimated families.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.560
And there were comforters who would travel with the doomed …

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.040
… on their way to the dragon, trying to ease the anguish.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.760
And there were dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.400
Steam engines were invented and a railway constructed leading to the dragon’s abode.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.880
Trains arrived at the mountain terminal crammed with people and return empty.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.080
Some dragonologists also studied the dragon’s behavior and collected samples …

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
… its shed scales, the slime, the excrement speckled with fragments of human bone.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.240
The more the beast was understood, the more its invincibility confirmed.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.880
But. . . humanity is a curious species.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.920
Every once in a while, someone gets a good idea.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.040
Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.120
Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.200
Some of these tools make it easier to generate new ideas.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440
Thus, the great wheel of invention, …

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.680
… which in the older ages turned imperceptibly slow, …

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.040
… began to accelerate and humans did what would have seemed magic before, …

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.480
… communicating instantly across great distance, building machines that could fly,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.160
… and many other astonishing things.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.520
A few dragonologists argued it might be time argued for a new attack …

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.680
… one had invented a material so sharp it could pierce a dragon’s scale.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.160
It would not be easy but if a huge projectile could be made out of this material …

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.600
… and launched with sufficient force and sufficient precision it might penetrate the dragon’s armor.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.920
However, it would be difficult and expensive and time-consuming to do.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.160
The dragonologists explained their proposal to anyone who would listen.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.240
But the people were skeptical; they had been taught the dragon-tyrant was invincible and the sacrifices it demanded a fact of life.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.240
Yet when they learnt about the new material and the idea for a projectile, many became intrigued.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.880
When the king read about the plans, he decided to hold an open hearing …

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.280
… it took place on the last and darkest day of the year, in the largest hall of the royal castle.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.320
People packed in to every last seat and crowded the aisles.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.360
The king's advisor spoke first: telling the people it was best they accept the inevitability of the dragon…

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.320
… and the dragon-administration department provided many jobs …

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.000
… that would be lost were the dragon slaughtered and, in any case, …

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.520
… the kingdom's coffers were empty after building the new railway.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.040
Next the leading dragonologist explained how the proposed device would work, …

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.400
… how the requisite amount of new invented material could be manufactured.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.560
Given the requested amount of funding, it may be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.720
With greater funding, maybe twelve.  However, there could be no guarantee.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.520
Last to speak was the king’s advisor for morality:

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.000
"Let us grant" he said "The project is technologically possible, though it hasn’t been proven to me.  …

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.440
… Presumably, you think you've got the right not to be chewed up.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:37.760
How willful, how presumptuous, how vain.  The shortness of human life is a blessing.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.560
Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our dignity.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.840
This preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully …

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.360
… the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.160
The nature of the dragon is to eat, and our own nature, my friends, is nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.000
The dragon is necessary.  The dragon is good."

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.640
The great hall was silent.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.640
Then a small child yelled out from the audience: "The dragon is bad!"

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.040
The child’s parents turned red and hushed, but the child said again:

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.560
"The dragon is bad -- it kills people... it ate my Granny... I want my Granny back."

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.640
The hall was silent again -- then a woman stood: “The dragon killed my parents.”

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.400
And man followed and stood: “The dragon killed my wife and my daughter.”

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:50.160
More and more people stood -- the simple fact that the dragon killed everyone, the loss of it, the weight of it, crashing over the hall.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.800
The way out from under remote, yet maybe possible.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.400
The king, looking at the first child to speak, announced: "Let us kill the dragon".

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.960
The next morning, a billion people woke to realize they or those they loved might be sent to the dragon before the projectile launched.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.720
Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragon cause had been limited, …

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.880
… it now became the number one priority and concern on everyone’s mind.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.320
Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase support, …

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.240
… which he did, passing extra appropriations bills and selling his summer castle, announcing:

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.120
"I believe that this kingdom should commit itself to achieving the goal, …

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.400
… before the decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon."

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.280
Thus started a great technological race against time.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.080
To make the dragon-killing weapon required solutions to a thousand technical problems, …

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.200
… each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.400
Test-missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.600
Terrible accidents happened.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.880
But there was now a seriousness of purpose, and the work continued.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by technicians, the king’s deadline could not be met.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.040
The task was hard.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.160
The decade concluded and the dragon still lived — still ate.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.600
But the effort was getting closer.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.360
A year later the first prototype missile successfully launched.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.800
The construction of the final projectile eventually set to complete and launch on New Year’s Eve, …

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.800
… twelve years after the project’s inauguration.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.040
The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but still and clear — good launch conditions.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.000
As the sun set, technicians scuttled around making the final adjustments and checks.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.680
The king and his advisors observed from a platform close to the launch pad.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.600
Further away, behind a fence, the public assembled to witness the great event.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:10.800
A large clock counted down: ten minutes to go -- the dark slumped profile of the dragon beyond, eating.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.720
From the crowd, someone jumped the fence and ran to the platform where the king sat.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.160
He arrived, accompanied by security, in a frenzied state, his nose bleeding.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.640
He shouted: "The last train! Stop the last train!"

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.520
The young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.840
He had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.160
The king had ordered the trains to continue to the very end, …

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.400
… fearing any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and the missile to miss.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.120
The young man begged the king to issue a recall-order for the last train, …

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.280
… due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.000
"I cannot do it," said the king, "I cannot take the risk it will alert the dragon“.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.320
The clouds above their head let loose the rain.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:10.280
“I am so sorry” The king continued, “had we started but one day earlier your father would not have to die.”

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:17.440
Looking at the crowd, thinking of all the losses that they and he, had endured.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.640
“This project should have been started years earlier than we did.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:31.040
So many need not have been killed by the dragon, had we but awoken from our acceptance of its horror sooner.”

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.120
The young man's wailing ceased.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.800
The king looked up at the countdown clock: five seconds remaining.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.000
Four.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.360
Three.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.640
Two.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.000
One.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.320
Zero.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.480
A ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.000
The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old…

00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.000
... that white flame, shooting into the dark embodied the human spirit, its fear and its hope.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.120
It struck the heart of evil.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.280
The silhouette on the horizon tumbled and fell.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:15.520
Thousands of voices of joy rose from the masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn-out thud from the collapsing monster.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.800
After all this time, humanity was at last free from the dragon.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.320
The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant:

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.480
"Long live the king! Long live us all!"

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.280
The royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.240
So much had changed in the last hour.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:45.520
The right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear abolished, and many long-held assumptions overturned.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.080
“What do we do now?" they asked.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.520
"We have come a long way. . ." said the king, "yet now we are like children again.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.000
The future lies open before us.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:02.360
We shall go and try to do better than we have done in the past, for we have time now…

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.640
… time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.160
Let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight, in remembrance of our dead.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.920
Then after, we will celebrate and begin the process of building a better world. . . for we have time now.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:59.960
[Music and crackling sounds]
