00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.210
NARRATOR: Following the advice
of their eyewitness, Grandpa--

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.210
What should I look for?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620
NARRATOR: --the team has
found several symbols

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.960
that, according to
Martin, coincide

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.040
with the Golden Lily Code.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.210
A pyramid, a set of box
markers next to breach six,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.500
a pack animal trail leading to
a possible collapsed tunnel,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
as well as a possible
gorilla face marker.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.580
But the team has yet to find a
viable way inside the mountain.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.080
To help with their
search, the LiDAR team

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.580
arrives to conduct
its aerial scan

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.500
of the 5,000 foot
mountain, and hopefully

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.170
reveal a potential opening.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.540
Hey, guys.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.710
Welcome to the jungle.
- How are you doing?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.500
Good.
Yourself?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.250
Good to meet you.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.170
How was your ride?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.420
Hey, nice to meet you.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.040
We're excited to
have you guys here.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.080
Yeah, we're all ready to go.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.250
Absolutely.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.880
All right, let's
get stuff done.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.670
Jamie and his
team wrote the book

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.920
on this type of technology.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.460
What they will show us
will be invaluable to what

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.750
we do on this mountain.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.420
There's so many places
on this mountain

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.460
that the Japanese could have
potentially buried treasure

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.620
or brought treasure to,
and having that LiDAR

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.620
here is the key to
getting into the mountain.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.290
NARRATOR: A sensor
with 360 degree vision

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.580
is mounted beneath the drone.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960
As it flies, it fires
rapid pulses of laser light

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960
toward the ground
and then measures

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.620
how long it takes for the
light to return to the sensor.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.420
Collecting millions of
measurements per second

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.580
enables the LiDAR to produce
a 3D map of the area.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.330
The goal-- reveal what could
lie beneath the dense foliage.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.500
All right.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.250
Spinning up.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.920
All right.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.500
Taking off.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.670
Right now, we're at 150 feet.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.420
NARRATOR: When the drone
reaches its cruising altitude,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.000
the LiDAR begins
scanning the mountain,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.290
gathering the data
for its 3D map.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.290
Is that a road going
across the top over there.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.290
Yeah, that's a road.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.170
Wow.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.960
All right.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.500
Ready?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Scan the whole thing.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.460
I want to see everything.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.790
Don't miss a spot.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.540
I want to see where the Japanese
actually drove their trucks

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.210
or had their encampments.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.380
Show me something really good.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.000
I need you guys to step back.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.620
Nice job.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.120
Thank you.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.290
We just used the best
technology on the planet.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.710
And the data they
provide with their LiDAR

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.380
is going to certainly
come in handy

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.710
and help us to
find this treasure.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.710
NARRATOR: Later that
day, back at base camp,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.330
the LiDAR team is ready
to share their results--

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.500
a digital map of the surface
of the mountain with all

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.210
the vegetation removed.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.750
Show us what you've got.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.750
So this is the surface
model we have with all

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.500
the vegetation in the way.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.580
That's a lot of vegetation.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.330
There's a lot of it.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.500
Holy crap.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.420
And I'll turn off
that vegetation.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.420
Oh, look at that!

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.880
That is sweet!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.420
So this is the
bare earth model.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.920
This is just ground.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.580
That's unbelievable.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.580
You can see all the nooks
and crannies, every elevation,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.000
every little runoff area.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.420
This is just awesome.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.670
So if you think
this is impressive,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.920
I actually took the
time to digitize

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.250
all the trails that I found.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.250
Let me bring that up.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.880
There she is.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.500
Ah-ha!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.710
Holy moley!

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.120
So there are the
trails in there.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.040
That is more than
I even anticipated

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040
we were going to see.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.620
That is just unreal.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.960
There's a hell of a lot of
trails and roads, possibly,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.460
all over this mountain that
we couldn't see before.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.120
The possibility of [inaudible]
treasure being here,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.710
based on just what we're
seeing, is phenomenal.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.380
So those trails, if there
were foot trails or footpaths,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.210
they just go up into the
mountain and they stop.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.080
Why would they just dead
end somewhere, especially

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.290
into the side of a hill?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.880
This right here could
be a cave entrance.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.460
What makes you think
that it's a cave, based

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.080
on just what we're seeing?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.830
How the path that goes
up to it, like right here.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.790
There's a
depression right here.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.330
We have to go up
there and look at it

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.250
to try to really understand
what's going on there.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.830
It looks like it's actually
the entrance way to something.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.420
Yep, it looks like you
probably could get in there.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.620
If there's a possibility that
there's a pathway dead ending

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.120
at a cave, I want to see it.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.000
I'm taking Jamie,
we're going up there.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.960
We're going to find it.
