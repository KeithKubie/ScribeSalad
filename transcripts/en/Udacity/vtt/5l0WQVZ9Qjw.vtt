Well it seems like each stage has a bunch of set times, so

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.260
I want the relationship to go like that. And each band can sign up

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.570
for multiple set times, so I want the fork on that end as well.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.780
So I guess the forky end goes on set time for both of em?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.980
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; Cool. So this is our junction object.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.780
&gt;&gt; Looks good. Let's build it.
