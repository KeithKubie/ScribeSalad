00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to Unit 3 of CS 215. I'm so glad to have you back!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's start off with a little magic trick.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
All right for this trick, I'm going to ask you to write your initials.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
First initial of your first name and your first initial of your last name on top of each other--like so.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
My name is Michael Littman, so I'm going to write my initials like this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then, I want you to mark all the end points and crossing points that are created.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All right. What I want you to do is count up all the dots and all the regions and all the segments,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and segments in this case are the things connected by dots.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we've got one, two, three, four, five, six and then finally take the number of dots

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
plus the number of regions minus the number of segments and write your answer in this box.
