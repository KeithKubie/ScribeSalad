00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, Michael, so here's the quiz. Are you ready?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.740
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.287
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's what's going on. I have copied over our little grid world

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:15.315
over here twice. So it's the same grid world except I have changed the rewards

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:20.180
that you will receive in all of the states other than the two absorbing states.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.440
So for the top one you get a reward of plus two. In every single

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.720
state, except for the absorbing states, and in the bottom one you receive a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.200
reward of minus two in every single state but the absorbing states, got it?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.120
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.120
&gt;&gt; So, what I'm going to want you to do is, I'm going to want

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
you to fill in for these boxes that I've indicated, these same four boxes in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.970
the top and the bottom, whether you should go up, down, left or right. So

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.380
enter into each one of them either Up U, D down, R right, L left,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.590
okay?

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I appreciate you making the numbers nice and big, because I was

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.950
worried you're going to say something like minus 0.13. But this, this I think.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.670
&gt;&gt; I can do that.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, that wasn't a suggestion. Yeah, let's go with the plus two and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.870
minus two. I feel like there's a better chance I might be able to get it.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so you think you got the what we're trying to do here?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.440
&gt;&gt; I do. Now just to, just to keep, just to make sure that I'm there,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.700
the plus one and the minus one end the game,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.230
and there's no more reward after that, it's like zero forever.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.060
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.100
&gt;&gt; And the other things, the blueish rewards, I would get them.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.480
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.510
&gt;&gt; Continually until a state is reached.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.020
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.595
&gt;&gt; Where the game ends, okay Yeah. No, that's, that's, that's cool.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Alright so go.
