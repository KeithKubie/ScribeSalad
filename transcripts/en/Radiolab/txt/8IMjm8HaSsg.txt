Speaker 1:          00:00          You're [inaudible] to too. You're listening to radio lab. I just thought I'd see if I can get the sound of babies sleeping.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20          This is Radiolab. Today's program is about sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:27          I don't have to tell you how good sleep is. You do it yourself every night. Will you try and how wonderful when it actually works. When you can close your eyes and forget the day and just drift off into oblivion like a little baby. But let's suppose that you are a little baby, this little baby and you grew up to become a scientist, like one of the scientists we'll hear from in this program and you decide to ask what should be the dumbest question ever. Why do we sleep and not just us.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Pretty much everything. Sleep as far as we know. All mammals do it. All birds, bees, locusts, cockroaches, crayfish, reptiles in sex, scorpions, everything that's been studied has something that looks like sleep.

Speaker 2:          01:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:18          it's a mystery. Most things we sort of know what they are for and also how they work, but sleep is really in your face. I mean everybody does it. You do it from the cradle, the grave. You can't help doing it because if you try to stay awake, you know at some point it's a repressible and we don't know why. That's a shameful state of affairs. How can you be a scientist and the 21st century and not know the answer to that? There you go. Okay. That's a pretty good way to begin. No shame. Yeah. Yeah. Today on Radiolab, we're going to try to correct this, a shameful state in the fingers when it comes to the subject of sleep. We'll talk with people who can help us understand what it's for, why we do it, and what happens when we don't. I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Jen. Boom. Ron, stay with us.

Speaker 2:          02:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:16          for centuries people thought that sleep was kind of the opposite of being awake, which reasonable thing. Sure. Because you know, during the day you're doing all these things. You're having all these thoughts and feelings at night. You just lie there very, very still. Like sometimes a bomb could go off and you wouldn't wake up. I can hardly wake up even in a fire.

Speaker 1:          02:41          No, I'm a really highly sleeper. Amy. Very heavy, heavy sleeper. The blended is

Speaker 3:          02:45          it? If all you've got are your eyes to go on sleep can seem like being well, like being off. Yeah, like off ness, right or worst? Well, both Shakespeare and servant is referred to sleep as death. That's Dr Carlos Shank. He wrote a great book about sleep called paradox loss. We go to, we go to bed every night. We die every night and then we wake up in the morning. We're alive again, and that was the prevailing theory for centuries for Dr Shank, the awakening to just how wrong Shakespeare and Cervantes were about sleep came one day while he was sitting in a class for med school my first year at medical school, this was back in 1972 we had an Ameritas professor who actually was a Nobel Prize winner of Dr Up Eccles, Josh or John Kuru Eccles from us. What happened is esteemed lecturer walks into class, pops the cassette into the tape deck, hits play and outcomes. This sound well, the sound was, or wait a second, let me get it right. Oh, here we go

Speaker 3:          03:52          and multiply this by a hundred this is the professor announced is the sound of a cat's brain while asleep. My God shake almost fell out of the seat. This is the brain during sleep making these really rapid, high pitch multiple sounds. That just blew us away, wasn't it? Clearly while that cat was curled up on this little kitty basket, it's brain. It was very, very alive. Much more than anyone expected, and it's, this is still a little weird revelation. Like take my cat, Sammy, Amy. All right. This is the sound like cat Sam. He sleeping to think that well Sam, Sammy is sitting on my lap totally out.

Speaker 4:          04:34          No,

Speaker 3:          04:35          there's a circus happening in his brain. What's going on in there? You can imagine back in the 70s this was a paradigm shift. People were suddenly like, oh my God, we're going to figure out anything about sleep. Right? All right, we have to ask the brain, and this is the room where we do all of our surgeries and luckily that's easily done if you're willing to get your hands dirty.

Speaker 1:          05:03          Okay. So the first step is you have to make an incision on top of the animal's head. When you've done that, we drill holes through the animal skeleton and uh, and then you insert your electrode, your stands, and that's simply it. A little window into their brain. You can see right there on the, on the screen, you can see that mainly wait, are you out of your mind? And you just, did you just put a hole into a kittens head? No, this wasn't my cat. Come on. So what was it we were doing there?

Speaker 3:          05:29          Well, you just heard was a mock surgery in Guana actually. And you didn't make one. I mean it's, it's not a nice look, look, look, look the animal,

Speaker 1:          05:39          within 20 minutes of coming out of the anesthetic, the animal is moving around. It's eating, it's climbing and it's, it's basking. It might seem like a rather invasive procedure, but in actuality it's, it's not too bad at all. Yeah. And that, by the way, is John [inaudible], he's a graduate student at the a Ecology Department at Indiana State University, which is where we are. John gave our reporter

Speaker 3:          05:58          Kara older testing a tour of the lab or a big noise here and they all have nice hats, cheered with ego on us. These kids are a little frightening to me. They're pretty huge. They're like four feet long, head to tail. Oh, I didn't know that. I mean they looked like baby alligators sick that went up and John measures their brainwaves at night to see what happens in their head as they sleep. In a way, it's a continuation of that cat experiment that Dr Shank just told us about except what they're looking for is much more peculiar than could ever happen in a cat or an us. [inaudible]. What does that, let me put it to you as a puzzle. Okay. Forget Iguanas. Dolphins. Dolphins. Yup. How is it that a dolphin in the ocean or even say the dolphins that you might find at six flags in New Jersey?

Speaker 3:          06:44          They have to. Cody is our 10 year old Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Buddy Avalon is 12 years old and that's their trainer Megan to Tarot of year. Mitra is holding the mic. Anyhow, here's the puzzle. We asked Megan about this. How is it it hurt two dolphins, Cody and Avalon can successfully sleep. Given the inherent challenges of being a dolphin. I don't, I don't. What do you mind are the challenges of a dolphin? Well, they have significant challenges. My friend first, they've got to breathe. They're not, they're conscious breathers. They're not unconscious breathers, so they, they have to think about breathing. Making matters worse. Dolphins are not fish, so they have to breathe air, which means they have to constantly consciously come up to the surface to greet area every few minutes. So you can imagine what would happen if they decided to go unconscious for awhile. Ala Drown. Right. And yet they do manage to sleep a lot.

Speaker 3:          07:39          Oh, how long? Eight hours a day. Like Eileen. Yeah, eight hours. But how, that's the puzzle. What happens is they do what we call logging. It's when they rest on the surface of the water, you know in a log floats down a river. It just floats. Huh? That's exactly what they look like. And they rest half their brain. Yeah. Time. Their brain is this, half their brain is asleep at a time. That is the nature of solution. To cut the dolphin brain in half, you mean literally, literally in a half. So that one half can snooze while the other half keeps the Dolphin Swimming and surfing just enough to breathe from the outside. You can't really tell what's happening. It just looks like the Dolphin is sort of a wig but a little out of it, but it's almost like the state of when you're falling asleep.

Speaker 3:          08:23          But if something happened, you'd wake right up. So they're in that state all the time. It sort of can be characterized as groggy that Steve Lima, he runs the one of the labs back in Indiana. There's sort of a wig and you're sort of asleep. It's just a way of staying awake enough and again, it's easy to miss, but if you look inside that groggy dolphins brain, what the brainwaves are doing [inaudible] exquisitely obvious. It's clear as that six year old can figure it out when half of the brain has these beautiful slow waves, like a sign for

Speaker 2:          08:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:54          and you other to just,

Speaker 2:          08:56          just jacking all over the place. Oh, those are beautiful.

Speaker 3:          09:06          Wow. That is amazing. Yeah. It's called the uni hemispheric sleep. That's what the guys at Indiana state are really interested in because, and here's the next surprise. It seems to go way beyond dolphins. They're aquatic mammals like whales, seals and sea lions. John says that all the marine mammals that have been studied seemed to do it too recently. Walruses they're all found to engage in uni hemispheric sleep as well. And now the Indiana team led by a okay. By this guy, I'm Charles M Lanner, chair of the Department of Ecology and organismal biology. They have found this weird split brain behavior in creatures of the air. Let me, let me just back up a little bit and describe, uh, this experiment. Charlie and a student had been at the park one day and they noticed something. We observed that ducks, ducks, sometimes we'll get together into groups like on a log for ducks. We'll get together and snooze in a neat little lie and the birds that were sitting in the middle of that line tended to be sleeping with both eyes closed. The birds that were sitting on the outside of that row tended to look a little bit more wary.

Speaker 3:          10:16          The inevitable question, what's going on here led to a very simple experiment. We put four birds in a row for Mallard ducks this time in the lab and they watch them sleep. The two birds in the center of this row slept with both eyes, closed the birds on the outset, outer edges both left and right, slept with one eye closed and one I opened one more time, slept with one eye closed and one eye opened. It's just like in that song,

Speaker 2:          10:44          do you know? You know that

Speaker 3:          10:45          Metallica Song? I missed it. I missed a good one. I knew they were all bought in. This is true, you know, no one knows this, but that song is really about adaptive sleeping behavior in dogs. The outer eye, the eye that was faced away from the group, the eye that was facing towards where potential predators might come from that stayed open. At this point, Charlie had a pretty good idea of what was going on because he knew that inside bird brains, each eye is attached to the opposite hemisphere. The left eye is attached to the right hemisphere. The right eye is attached to the left hemisphere, so his team and planted some electrodes to measure what the duck brains were doing and like the dolphins, the ducks two were sleeping one half of their brain at a time. The bird could simultaneously sleep and be awake.

Speaker 3:          11:40          Not only that, here's the cool part. After a few hours, what happened was is that the birds that were on the outer edge then would rotate, stand up, turn around 180 degrees and then sit back down and the other I would then get sleep and consequently the opposite hemisphere would get some sleep. When we saw that, we said, Oh yeah, this is my back. Good, good. Because right there in the docs was the perfect illustration of what these guys think. It's all about you got asleep for whatever reason. Right? Sleep is dangerous. Danger, danger, danger. That's the headline for dolphins. The main dangerous, drown danger, danger. You know, for ducks getting eaten, pager ain't ducks have to sleep nature, but how can they nature when lurking in the darkness or foxes? Wolves in a hundred other eaters of ducks. Do you like snakes? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          12:36          I don't dislike snakes. He's good man. Good man. In another nifty experiment, John took the residents, snake Montes, big snake. He is. What about a four foot long python and at night you're so cute. John Brought Monte the python into the room where his iguanas sleep and he terrifies that really well. I mean Monte was in a cage so he couldn't really hurt the Iguanas. But as soon as that snake appeared, all the lizards popped one eye over and they train that open eye right on Monte, the snake snake in the room and they'll watch it. When I oh night that Steve Lima again, they don't like these names. That's for sure. And then remove the snake from the room the next day and they're still looking for the next night or two. So they keep one eye, you know, trained on that door for a few more days or three days. They go back to a regular sleep.

Speaker 2:          13:28          Whoa. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          13:40          so what does this all mean? Well, think about this. Okay. All the sea mammals, they do it right. We'll list the ones I've been studied. All the flying creatures, they do it. The reptiles seem to do it too. Who does that leave? You mean? Who's left? Not Sleeping with a half a brain on in the other half a brain off. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:57          Cool.

Speaker 3:          14:00          Um, us, we may be the strange ones. Well, it is sort of strange in that terrestrial mammals can't do it for estriol mammals. Just for some reason to have lost the ability to do this. That all mammals says, John to terrestrial mammals, the ones that live on land. Ah, and here's this theory. Sometime long ago, our scaly ancestor wanted up on the land and thought, I think I'll dig a hole. Yeah, I'm going take a hole. The hole was dark. And it was safe and for the first time, millions of years of evolution, that little creature closed both eyes. Ah,

Speaker 2:          14:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          14:44          and so we lost it. Totally speculative theory of course. But the basic idea though is if you are protected and you can afford to close both eyes conk out completely. And that simple idea of safety that explains while these guys think almost everything where you sleep, how you sleep, how long you sleep, it all boils down to two words. Predation risk per dation, risk prediction risk, which is really just a fancy way of saying generally speaking, just your risk of being killed, the risk of being eaten. Now what does this have to do with us? Here we are, top of the food chain in our warm beds, nice warm bed lock door, a locked door covers maybe a nice neighborhood, a good police force looking after you at nighttime

Speaker 1:          15:33          and you live in a country that has a very secure living environment.

Speaker 3:          15:38          You would think that this whole predation risk idea has nothing to do with us.

Speaker 1:          15:44          Wow. So there's a few studies that have looked at a c sleep patterns where people are sleeping in novel environments.

Speaker 3:          15:51          What's a novel environment? Did you mean like a hotel

Speaker 1:          15:55          that first night at a hotel? Why is it no one could sleep well that first night at a hotel on your first night of sleeping in a hotel room, you generally have less rem sleep and less and deep slow wave sleep relative to sleeping in your house. I, I suffered from that myself. I don't sleep well in hotel rooms, especially if it's just one night per place or something I have. My sleep is terrible. There are some folks that actually hypothesized they're at certain Predator relays in the brain, danger, danger, danger, and that these circuits to remain active at all times.

Speaker 3:          16:31          Now what does that, it's true that, yeah, we all have buried deep in our reptile brain as sort of Predator alert system perhaps in some of us it's a little too sensitive. Okay. We're in the sleep lab at the Minnesota Regional Sleep disorders center, mission control, we call it. We're viewing the typical sleep terror episode. This little girl who is a five years old would engage in these sleep terror episodes every single night. Now that's Dr Carlos Shank, who we heard from before. We're in Minnesota now at the Hennepin county sleep center here in a sleep lab where he works. We're standing in front of a grainy black and white video of a little girl in her PJ's screaming time. Eight in the morning after shank discovered an odd category of sleep disorders called Parasomnias, which is why we came to talk to him. Para means around Somnio means sleep around sleep. This might be the human analog to the ducks. People whose brains never quite shut off completely drink sleep. Well, this guy is interesting. He has seizures. No, no, no. He doesn't. Wait a second. He showed us tape after tape. We're viewing a man. We are very affectionately call Santa Claus. Yeah. On the screen. Large guys thrashing back and forth. His legs are moving. He's going back and forth for the sides of his back and then suddenly he starts to

Speaker 4:          17:52          [inaudible]. Oh, oh. [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          18:02          Is this real? Yeah. This guy is in and out of sleep. He has no idea what he's doing. One of the interesting things Dr Shuck noticed when you first began to diagnose parasomnias in the early eighties is that while they were in that kind of liminal space around sleep, a huge percentage of the patients would have these visceral dreams of being attacked. The common theme is a menace is posed from nowhere coming out of nowhere. It's an immediate threat that you, you just can't ignore. Let's put it that way. You have to either fight it or run away from it. Your dreams can be very violent. This is Martin Sabelle, h 88 he's another if Dr shanks patients, I don't remember someone coming up the stairway. In Martin's case, the attackers never had a face. Sometimes it was a bear and I was gonna fight with him. He'd yell at him, get here.

Speaker 3:          18:53          That's Martin's wife Gertrude Glam. It was always trying to protect me. Yeah, I'd have black and blue bruises on my arms and hands because I was hearing English bored. Not Infrequently. The man is dreaming in bed with his wife that he is fighting to defend her. If I'm an attacker. When in fact he's beating her up. The one night I was sleeping and all of a sudden he's got his hands tightly around my straw. I am petrified. Quit mark, you're dreaming. You're hurting me. She should mark. You're dreaming. Gertrude and Martin, Isabelle are still married. Believe it or not, after 57 years though, she did force him to sell his guns. He has never been happy about that. Well, they were quite valuable. So you're suggesting then that all these people and the Iguanas and the ducks and the dolphins all have a portion of their brain which is weary in the night.

Speaker 3:          19:48          That's what I'm hinting at. I don't want to go any stronger than hinted, but there seems to be, uh, something in us that's always watching out. Always wary. Bottom line here though is that sleep for all creatures is a dangerous thing and a few unfortunate people are still awake to that fact. That's right. Before we go to break, I just want to thank Anne Habermann for her excellent reporting in Minnesota and also before her Cara older, and to remind you to stay with us because we're going to turn her attention shortly from danger to deprivation. Radiolab will continue in a moment.
