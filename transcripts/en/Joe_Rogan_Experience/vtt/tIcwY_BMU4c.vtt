1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.560
The Joe Rogan experience.
Different things mean this is not news.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.570
Different things mean different things to different people.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.720
And if you're using it in one context doesn't mean other contexts aren't

4
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.530
legitimate.
That's how art and images work.
Yeah.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.180
I mean that's almost like what happened with the guy in Montana.
Right?

6
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.240
So when he takes his work and then turns into Nazi stuff and then all the sudden

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.570
he becomes a nod.
Right.
And that's what they do with it.
With pepe the frog.

8
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.140
Cause that guy who may area,
oh he's so upset.
I know.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.960
Cause he know what they did to him log.
Do you know what they did to him?

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.700
He had a cartoon where he killed peppy.
So all the trolls are like,

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.230
oh that's interesting.

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
So they took all his other characters and made them full blow Nazis.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.010
So Heinrich,
who's the wall,

14
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.300
instead of having reflections in a sunglasses had the SS,
they're like,

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.880
oh you want to,
you want to throw it out,
we'll throw it down,
asshole.

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.820
And that's what ended up happening to him.

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.870
Wolf has a Nazi name already now they gave him the last name.
It's like Hendrix,

18
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:57.360
something else,
but that name,
I'll tell you what they know.
Oh my God.
I know.
No,

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.720
no.
They're not seeing,
what do they call it?
That's a Nazi wolf.

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.350
Sounds like a Nazi.
Well,
maybe they,
what was the,
that's hilarious.

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.020
He thought he could just kill it off.
That's like d platforming.

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.490
He thought he was going to d platform.
Pepe.
Let's also like,

23
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.190
let's suppose I decided to kill off Paul Bunyan put the fuck how I can,

24
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.750
what does that mean?
This doesn't mean anything.

25
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.390
Like the idea that he's going to kill it off and they're going to say,
oh,
Whoa,

26
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.950
oh no.
His name was originally land wolf,
so they said,
oh,

27
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.240
his first name is Heinrich land.
Wolf and Eagle pull it up and the glasses,
well,

28
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.770
maybe we shouldn't have that sense of the imagery here,

29
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.380
but man wolf as opposed to what's sky wars?

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.910
Fuck does that mean,
the funny thing is about pepe?
It was,

31
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:40.590
it was always so bland and the lame,
well,
I think for,

32
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:45.290
it was adopted as a meme.
Like when you see like feels bad man,
right?

33
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.750
Like it was like,
Whoa,
this is so low.
Blood sugar bothers me.

34
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
But it's also the idea of,
you're saying that because Nazis are using it,

35
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.030
you can't use it as feels bad man.
Like right.

36
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.010
If you're giving the okay symbol and they're using this way,
you can't say,
oh,

37
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:02.820
that's okay.
That's make any sense.
Yeah.
You can't say something to me.
I go,
okay,

38
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:07.770
my mouse if I do that.
That's white supremacy.
Yeah,
no.
Everybody.

39
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:11.730
For years I had a whole series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay

40
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:16.110
sign.
Of course,
including me back when I had earrings,
there's radio days,

41
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
bill Cosby doing the okay,
symbol is fucking,
come on man.

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.980
You guys know this is not,
that's not what this is.

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.950
Just because people are using it and saying it is,
and they were investigating.

44
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.530
People are investigating people.
There was a guy who was on television,

45
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.820
they blurt it out.
Yeah,
and he,
they bind blurted out in Assembler.

46
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.670
And the other thing is we're at a point now where it's more easy to give the

47
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.170
finger to someone than to say,
okay,
yeah,
you blur the finger out.
Nobody cares.

48
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.310
But if you do that,
like,
oh,
what is he doing?
He's touching his fingers.

49
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.370
You can't even do like you're holding a joint cause that's like a white power

50
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:52.020
joint.
Like if you're like doing that like a roach,
that's bad.

51
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.260
That's bad.
How do you do you have to use a roach clip?

52
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.340
It's a ploy by the roach clip industry.
It's like we don't want to train in a way

53
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 1>that we're going to have to change our training to try to make up because all</v>

54
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.150
the damage we've done.
Let's try to avoid the damage for the beginning.

55
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.290
It's already too late for me.
I got seven,
you know,
I got six broken ankles.

56
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.340
Seasons got broken,
arches broken.
What the hell did you just do?

57
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.330
Your ankle was like,
what's been broke six,
six or seven times broke the arch,

58
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.900
broke all the messages from surfing all different motorbike surfing,

59
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.170
snowboarding because you mess up your hip.
Uh,

60
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.200
probably cause my broke walking on a broken ankle for uh,

61
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.190
all those years that cause each time I broke it I have five or six different

62
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:37.030
breaks and then I would keep going.
So I would keep walking on it and,

63
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.940
but I'd means I had to carry the load on my right hip.

64
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.740
So I think I just wore the cartilage out from offsetting and carrying the load

65
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:49.240
of the broken Lake Jesus.
So that was,
but so I mean it's so,

66
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:52.440
it wasn't like one injury where you hurt your hip.
It was just slung.

67
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.740
I just wore it out.
I just,

68
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.580
I said I lived a couple of lives with LNL is that that was only on one life hip

69
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.200
and I had three lives in it.
What is it like having a fake hip?

70
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.790
Insane,
incredible bionic.
That thing's not even in my,
in my,

71
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.410
in my brain.
Not even how so it doesn't,
I just,

72
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.330
I don't ever even bring it into consciousness.
It's,
it's slicker.

73
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.460
It's like a Mercedes Benz ball joint.
I mean it's absolutely perfect.
Wow.

74
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.610
It's a,
and you know,
I mean I've had ACL,

75
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.490
had some knee stuff before that was harder to recover from them.
The hip,

76
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:28.324
the hip was,

77
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.960
I just felt like I got kicked by a horse for a couple months and then after that

78
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.830
it was like no brainer.
Jump off a cliff,
go stand up,
paddle,
run.

79
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.510
I mean not I tell you to not do certain things.
Nope.
Really?
Nope.

80
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.220
You could like,
you could just start,

81
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.000
he don't do anything you should do with your real one.
Really.

82
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.450
That's going to do anything you shouldn't do with your real one.
Yeah,
absolutely.

83
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.100
That was the only thing.
I mean,
the guy,
the doctor Penn Nunberg who did mine,

84
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.340
he did it to a contortionist,

85
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.010
I guess some contortionist had some blown hips and he'd get it too.

86
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.290
And the girl is still performing and stuff.
So I don't,
I think it's,

87
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800
I mean the stuff is,
the technology is amazing.

88
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.330
And the thing that I,

89
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.860
the thing that I would consider if I ever had to do it again is that the atrophy

90
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.920
from the,
the,
the,

91
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.760
the initial problem is harder to recover from.

92
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.330
Then you just go in and get in the new one.
And I think when people push it,

93
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.721
you know,

94
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.230
they used to try to push that stuff because they want to wait for the technology

95
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.260
got better and they only last 15 years and all that stuff.
Um,

96
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.440
but the atrophy that you try to recover from,

97
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.150
it was harder to recover from than if you would've gone in and gotten it done

98
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.540
when you need,
when,
as soon as you needed to have it.
So the one you have now,

99
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:47.010
you have to get it swapped out every 15 years.
No,
no,
no,
no.
But,

100
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.050
but in the back in the early days,
well they,
they,

101
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:51.790
they don't know how long this new stuff last.
They had some,

102
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.230
they had some material that that wore out after like,
cause there's a,
uh,

103
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.920
like a,
some kind of polyurethane,
some kind of psych outer layer.

104
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.140
Well like a cart lit like a,

105
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.140
like a manmade cartilage between the ball joint in the socket.

106
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.730
And so that stuff wore out in the past.
But those,
yeah.

107
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.900
And they had this new stuff that,

108
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.950
that has been in for 10 years and a lot of people are ready and they've seen

109
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.810
zero where on it.
So you don't know.
It could be 30,
could be,
you know,
could be 10.

110
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:25.070
I mean I I was actually,
uh,
I stayed conscious in,
in,

111
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.360
I was able to stay awake for my hip surgery cause I didn't want to have to

112
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.570
recover from the,
from the uh,
yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

113
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.140
Take people a month to get the anesthesia out of their system.
Really?
Oh yeah.

114
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.960
To try to get the anesthesia.
Anesthesia is controlled death.

115
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.960
They're just put you right to the edge of dying and keep you alive.
I mean,

116
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.950
anesthesia,
some hard stuff on your system to get that stuff out of your organs.

117
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.600
You've got to do like a full detox cleanse.
It's not dislike.
Oh yeah.
Anesthesia,

118
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.010
<v 2>you know,
a sicario that when we sit card.
Okay.
Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.950
Those people are looking at that movie.
A lot of the followers,

120
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:00.460
just suspicious of that,
of an ACL total.
Having an MP five,

121
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.760
I was the only Mexican rockin and MP five submachine gun down there.
Right.

122
00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:07.810
So that's like,
is that,
you know,
what did you think of those movies?
Oh,
horrible.

123
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.320
Horrible,
unrealistic.
You know,
they should,
hey,
if somebody doesn't hire me,

124
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.000
I'll do it for free just to,
you know,

125
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.390
I'll consult for free on that and I'll make it look a little bit more closer to

126
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:23.380
what it is.
Uh,
but it's,
uh,
the main thing is how,

127
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.100
how w everybody saw that movie and that's how they would,
you know,
that's,

128
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:31.420
that's the reality.
You know,
how fiction is kind of a basis where reality,

129
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.490
so sicario two comes out and it's basically the United States declaring the

130
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:40.930
cartels a terrorist organization.
You know,
and I saw that and I was like,
hmm.

131
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.850
Usually fiction kind of pre kind of has a,
uh,

132
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.880
a way of influencing reality further on the line.

133
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:53.881
You know that a Denzel Washington movie called siege where the budget terrorist

134
00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:57.370
attack in New York and then militarized New York and that's kind of like a

135
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:01.690
president for nine 11.
So you'd see sicario too.
And then,
you know,

136
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.840
we're gonna terrorist prompt now says they're going to thinking about declaring

137
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:11.620
the cartels as a terrorist organization.
That's pretty interesting.

138
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.370
Uh,

139
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.370
mainly because realistically Mexico has been calling them terrorists forever.

140
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.550
What did you think about that,
about Trump doing that?

141
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.680
Do you think that that actually is something that can happen,
uh,
if,
if,

142
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.760
if you're going to militarize efforts against it and not just considered as a

143
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.380
law enforcement type situation,

144
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.360
I think people should be afraid down there if you do go that route.
Uh,

145
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.410
but just realize that's going to be open warfare,
not in a foreign country,

146
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.930
across the ocean.
It's going to be right next to your border.
Yeah.

147
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:42.760
Where people can walk across yes.

148
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.650
Or make things happen now in there that will affect you up here in a very real

149
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:51.790
way,
you know?
And it'll get ugly before it gets better.
Uh,
you know,

150
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.760
I,
hopefully it doesn't,
you know,
but that's,
if that doesn't happen,

151
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:00.930
if they don't treat it as a terrorist organization and try to have some sort of

152
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.450
impact on it,
what could be done?
I mean,
I think,

153
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.050
I think culturally they're trying to get us ready for that,
you know?

154
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.850
I don't know.
I mean,
I think that's what's happening.

155
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.460
You see a lot of the cross,
you know,

156
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.260
borders a US military assets training,

157
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.300
uh,
Mexican marines down there and having an open relationship with them.

158
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.530
You see that and that pushes to maybe,
you know,

159
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.890
preparing for something,
you know,
I think that preparing for something,
you know,

160
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.260
what,
what could that be?
I don't know.
So the,

161
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:39.261
what we get about it publicly is just a small sliver of the actual conversations

162
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.870
that are being had.
Yeah.
And also there's a lot of,
you know,

163
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:45.930
misdirection and there's a lot of misdirection.
I that I'm personally,

164
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.923
yeah,

165
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.340
<v 3>the first bit we did was an accident.</v>

166
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.220
It Cheech got logged outside the mixed own room.
No,

167
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.320
we were [inaudible] you know,

168
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.020
the old Charlie Chapman studio and it was little courtyard that where the sun

169
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:08.021
was beating down was like noon and it was hot and teaches a method actor and he

170
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:12.080
had it put on all the costumes,
you know,
they can get into character.

171
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500
So he's got all these costumes Ziney knocks on the door and I was working the

172
00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:19.790
tape recorder and when he knocked out,

173
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.270
I looked up at the door and I didn't see if the needle moved or not.

174
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.280
And so when he knocked it didn't answer and then you knocked again.

175
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.010
And I saw the needle moved and so I said,
who is it?

176
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.460
And I was supposed to just open the door and let him in.

177
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.890
And so there was a pause.
It's a meme there.
It's me.
Let me in.

178
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.200
Come on man.
So then there's that where Dave's not here came from it.
So I waited.

179
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.010
Then he knocked again in a long pause.
The pause.

180
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.140
Who is it?
And he's getting,
man,
come on,
man.
It's me.
I think the cops saw me.

181
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:58.780
You come on openness,
you know,
they went into character then.
Then are just,
wait,

182
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.820
wait,
wait.
It's way for me to open the door.

183
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.290
Then he knocked again and then finally goes,
it's me,
Dave,
man,
Dave.

184
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.880
I said,
Dave.
And he goes,
yeah.
He goes,
Dave's not here.

185
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.610
He blew it,
kicking the doors,
screaming,
opened the door.

186
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:20.720
You're almost punched me.
And,
but I said,
listen,
listen,
listen.

187
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:26.000
We played it back and
then Lou heard it.
We recorded it.

188
00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:26.751
Not as funny,

189
00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:31.400
but we recorded it and next day it was all over America.

190
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.680
Cheech and Chong was born.
Yeah.
Then you're like,

191
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.470
<v 2>no,
I don't.
I don't really want this.</v>

192
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.160
Do you see Gaffigan and Neil and Neil Brennan?
No.
Dope.
No Way.

193
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.220
Gaffigan lit Neal Brennan on fire.
Shit.
On his embers.

194
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.750
No.
For what?
Neil started it.
Why he'll start it.
I'm going to,

195
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:50.970
I'm going to send it to Jamie.
I'm going to send it to Jamie.

196
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.190
I'm so in my sober October text message

197
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.750
<v 0>group and listen,
I love Neil
when someone gets roasted,</v>

198
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.620
so I'm going to gets roasted Kanban and it's even better because he started it.

199
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.800
He started for no reason.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

200
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.490
He tried to be snarky here.
Jamie,
I'm sending this to you right now.

201
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.300
Jim Gaffigan is a mama.
I'm a monster.
Fantastic.

202
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.420
In Transylvania three you're buzzing.
Oh,
amazing.
Oh,

203
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:20.680
I saw that and was he was van Helsing.
Oh my God.
It's amazing.
Great.

204
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.250
I love those movies.
They're fun.
I love when my son gets into that stuff.

205
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.950
Just fucking animation today is so incredible.

206
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.380
I find myself sitting there watching the animation going,

207
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.860
this is a mate that's shading and the just the detail of it,

208
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:36.190
he can get into it where it's,
even if it's meant for kids.
As a parent,

209
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:40.800
I'm good man.
You Watch the despicable me's?
Oh yeah,
great.
Great frees up.

210
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.560
All three of them are great,
but I love part three with the 80 soundtrack.

211
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:46.630
It's not the creator from a South Park.

212
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.740
And isn't there another one with just the fucking yellow dudes?
The minions.

213
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.090
That's good too.
That's good too.
Yeah,
I saw that one little long towards the end.

214
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:57.610
It gets a little weird when they get to London,
but very good.
Yeah,

215
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.950
they're good man.
It's so funny when you,
so this is the text,

216
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.500
Brennan Service.
So,
uh,
what happens is,

217
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.730
uh,
Gaffigan puts up a thing saying,
hey,
why are you looking at your phone?

218
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.240
You could be watching my Netflix special.
I made them all for you.
And he says,

219
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.160
Neil says,
which one has the joke about food?

220
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.820
You say like a food and then you talk about it.
And I'd be over here dying.

221
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.930
And then Gavigan says Neil,
it's a special where I have three microphones.

222
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.500
One microphone is for jokes.
I pretend I can't remember that I read off a card.

223
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.230
One Mike is for emotional manipulation of the audience.

224
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.370
And one microphone is for mentioning the Chappelle show and celebrity friends.

225
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.340
Boom.
That's like oh core.

226
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.560
That's like one of those bombs that goes off in the distance.
You do see it.

227
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.520
And we're just like this with got a little frisky.

228
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.410
Got a little frisky.

229
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.210
<v 4>Okay.</v>
