00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.280
It’s been said that pain is temporary, but
film is forever. Perhaps that’s why some

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.000
of cinema’s best scenes come from making
actors suffer.&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.100
Whether it’s being put in a barrel with
raw fish or having to eat it, saying something

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.170
nasty about another character or sharing a
sex scene with them, there are plenty of things

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.890
that can make an actor uncomfortable on set.
If they’re lucky the scene can be done in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.430
just a few takes, but some of these scenes
can take literally months.&nbsp;

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.520
Here are 20 Amazing Scenes that Actors Hated
Shooting&nbsp;

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;
The first teaser trailer of Captain America:

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
Civil War features a shot of Steve Rogers
stopping a helicopter from taking off with

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.050
his bare hands. Chris Evans beefed up even
more for his fifth outing as Captain America,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.810
and the filmmakers wanted to show this off
by having him actually strain against a crane

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.760
holding helicopter. This gave the effect of
Evans’ very real muscles bulging, and co-director

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.510
Joe Russo said that it’s "the most powerful
shot of the film”.&nbsp;

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.829
The Force Awakens
To shoot the scenes that take place on Rey’s

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.879
home planet of Jakku, the cast and crew of
Star Wars: The Force Awakens spent the first

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.590
part of the film’s production in the blazing
desert heat of Abu Dhabi. Actors Daisy Ridley

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.210
and John Boyega trained on treadmills for
all the running they’d have to do, but that

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.549
didn’t prepare them for the added challenge
of running on sand. Ridley said running on

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.549
the combination of hard and soft sand was
killer on the legs, and she was thankful for

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.920
the shots that included explosions, because
that usually meant fewer takes.&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.759
Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;
Since Mad Max was essentially a two hour car

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.920
chase in the dessert, the film was extremely
trying on the cast and crew. Tom Hardy in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.049
particular struggled to see George Miller’s
vision through the sand and sweat of the production.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.299
Both Miller and costar Charlize Theron described
Hardy as difficult to work with, but once

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.240
Hardy saw the final product he was thoroughly
impressed and apologized to Martin and Theron

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.669
for failing to see the big picture while on
set.&nbsp;

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.880
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2&nbsp;
The Hunger Games cast has said multiple times

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.099
that the hardest scene in Mockingjay to shoot
was the sewer scene. It was three weeks of

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.340
shooting in an actual hot sewer that Liam
Hemsworth, the tallest cast member, couldn’t

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.889
even stand up straight in. It didn’t help
matters that their costumes were super absorbent,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.749
adding up to 20 pounds of water weight.
The Shining

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.599
In a production that by all accounts took
a big toll on Shelly Duvall, there was one

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.310
scene in particular that earned a spot in
the history books. When Wendy is wielding

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.760
a baseball bat to defend herself from her
deranged husband Jack, Duvall needed to maintain

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.960
a hysterical state for 127 takes… we’re
not sure there was much acting involved by

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.140
that last one.&nbsp;
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.099
For all the CGI Peter Jackson used in his
Hobbit films, you’d think some fish would

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.230
be easy to fake, but for the Laketown scene
in which the Dwarves hide in barrels, the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.590
actors had to be covered in real fish. Adam
Brown, who played Ori, actually has a phobia

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.769
of fish, so he wasn’t very happy about being
covered head to toe their juices.&nbsp;

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.260
The Revenant&nbsp;
Say what you will about Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.530
but you can’t deny his commitment to a role,
particularly with regards to his work on The

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.189
Revenant. It’s now a well known fact that
there was nothing fake about the raw bison

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.790
liver he makes a meal of, and while any meat
eater would probably have a hard time with

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.180
this, the fact that Leo is usually a vegetarian
made this an even tougher pill to swallow.&nbsp;

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.709
The Exorcist&nbsp;
The famous vomit scene from The Exorcist wasn’t

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.980
fun for anyone. The projectile pea soup was
meant to hit actor Jason Miller in the chest,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.590
but accidentally hit him in the face. His
shocked reaction you see is real and he was

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.450
not happy about it. Linda Blair hated vegetables
so much at the time, that the use of the pea

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.670
soup actually did make her vomit, though fortunately
not in Jason Miller’s face

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.500
Django Unchained
One of Leonardo DiCaprio’s first days of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.549
filming on Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained
was a dinner scene that he shared with costars

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.489
Samuel L. Jackson and Jamie Foxx. DiCaprio
had to stop in the middle of a take at one

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.299
point because he was struggling with character’s
excessive use of the ’N word’. Jackson

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.980
famously pulled him aside and told him "Motherfucker,
this is just another&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;for us.”

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.310
Apparently this helped, as there is nothing
sugarcoated about DiCaprio’s performance

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.760
of slaveowner Calvin Candie, and Django Unchained
holds the all time record for most uses of

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.439
the ’N word’ with 116 uses.&nbsp;
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.700
Every Guardian of the Galaxy has a near death
experience at some point in the film. As Drax,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.670
Dave Bautista had one of the most difficult
scenes to survive. After losing a fight against

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.299
Ronan, Drax nearly drowns before before Groot
pulls him out of the pool of yellow liquid.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.409
Bautista was already recovering from a cold
and could barely speak, yet he was required

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.909
to be shirtless, freezing, and covered in
goo while delivering a scene which serves

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.989
as the emotional centre of his character.
On top of all that, he gets mocked by a racoon.&nbsp;

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.910
Black Swan
There is nothing sexy about shooting a sex

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.930
scene. Surrounded by crew and worrying about
minute technical details is not an aphrodisiac

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.840
for most actors. Black Swan was no exception
when it came time for Natalie Portman and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.590
Mila Kunis to film their sex scene. While
audiences seemed to enjoy the finished product,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.000
the longtime friends have both gone on record
saying it was one of the hardest scenes to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.560
shoot, though Kunis denies the rumour that
they did shots of tequila to help get through

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.330
it.&nbsp;
The Evil Dead

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.470
To achieve the creepy white-eyed look of the
deadites in the first Evil Dead film, director

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.669
Sam Raimi used crude contact lenses that were
uncomfortable and made the actors virtually

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.300
sightless. During the scene where the possessed
Linda attempts to stab Ash with the dagger,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.210
actress Betsy Baker actually had no idea where
costar Bruce Campbell was, so he there wasn’t

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.490
much acting required as he defended himself
from the blind actress.&nbsp;

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.110
X Men Apocalypse&nbsp;
The Quicksilver scene was arguably the best

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.610
of X Men Days of Future Past. With the character
returning for X Men Apocalypse fans are anxious

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.840
to see how they’ll top it, and it sounds
like they won’t be disappointed. There’s

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.530
only a couple seconds of it in the trailer,
but Quicksilver’s run in the X-Mansion was

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.580
shot with 3-D Phantom cameras traveling at
50mph, while shooting at 3,100 frames per

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.470
second. Actor Evan Peters spent more time
on set than any other actor in the film, with

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.860
this scene reportedly taking three and a half
months to film.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.680
Hot Fuzz
The Brits take their football pretty seriously,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.099
so make sure you never get caught calling
it soccer around them. For the scene in Hot

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.990
Fuzz where Nick Frost is trying to break through
his new partner’s tough exterior, director

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.129
Edgar Wright chose a very particular shirt
for Frost to wear: a&nbsp; jersey sporting colors

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.620
of the Bristol Rovers football team. As a
die hard West Ham United fan, Frost hated

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.639
wearing the jersey for this scene.&nbsp;
What's Eating Gilbert Grape

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.419
In What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Johnny Depp’s
title character is embarrassed by his obese

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.470
mother and insults her when she’s not around.
Depp hated referring to the character played

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.979
costar Darlene Cates as a ‘beached whale’
so much that he felt guilty about it and apologized

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.879
to the actress later, even though it was all
done in character.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.590
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire
When shooting the scene where Katniss, Finnick,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.849
and Peeta eat fish on the beach, the actors
were actually eating raw fish. It was sushi-grade

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.110
snapper but that didn’t make it any easier
for the cast members who didn’t like fish,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.550
particularly Jennifer Lawrence. She said in
an interview that raw fish tastes just like

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.419
it smells, then gagged just thinking about
it. Her costars apparently found her struggle

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.460
very amusing.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.500
In order to increase the squirm factor after
having 10,000 snakes in the first Indiana

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.470
Jones film, Spielberg arranged for 50,000
cockroaches and 30,000 beetles to be brought

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.420
to set for the bug scene in the Temple of
Doom. Many of them had to be placed on Spielberg’s

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.060
future wife Kate Capshaw, who said she had
to take a Valium before filming in order to

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.910
calm her nerves.&nbsp;
Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&nbsp;

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.890
British actor Terrence Stamp said in an interview
that he took a role in Episode I of Star Wars

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.669
for two reasons: pressure from his agent and
to work with Natalie Portman. When it came

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.569
time to shoot his scene with Portman, she
was nowhere to be seen. He asked Lucas where

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.050
she was and Lucas pointed at a piece of paper
for reference. Stamp did not reprise his role,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.610
as he described the experience as boring and
said that “actors prefer to work with actors.”

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.770
Batman
While Michael Keaton was clearly having fun

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.669
with his scenes as Bruce Wayne in Tim Burton’s
Batman, he wouldn’t say the same for his

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.080
scenes as the caped crusader. In 1989 super
hero costumes weren’t nearly as advanced

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.639
as they are today and Keaton could barely
move in his. He said the costume made him

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.500
extremely claustrophobic, but he worked that
into the character, by making every little

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.569
movement extremely deliberate and calculated.&nbsp;
Suicide Squad

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:36.810
While we haven't seen the movie yet, we've
heard enough stories from the set of Suicide

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.530
Squad to know that Leto's Joker made some
of his costars a little uncomfortable. While

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.139
the rest of the cast rehearsed together, Leto
was off working on his own brand of crazy

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.069
while sending them strange gifts. When he
did show up to film his scenes Leto refused

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:52.099
to break character between takes. It made
for a weird energy on set, so director David

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:56.910
Ayer brought a therapist to set just in case
any of the actors became a little&nbsp;too&nbsp;tormented.&nbsp;

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.509
