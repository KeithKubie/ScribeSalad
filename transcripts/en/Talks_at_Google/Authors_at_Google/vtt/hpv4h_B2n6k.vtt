00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.560
&gt;&gt;Joel Constable: Hi everyone. My name is
Joel Constable and I work in Leadership Development

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.559
as part of Google Edu and I'm thrilled today
to introduce our newest Authors@Google speaker,

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.559
Tim Ferriss.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.090
Tim was nominated as one of FastCompany's
most innovative business people of 2007 and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.359
is the author or the number one New York Times,
Wall Street Journal, and Business Week best

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.320
seller, The Four Hour Workweek, which has
been translated into 35 different languages.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.070
Wired Magazine has called Tim the Superman
of Silicon Valley for his manipulation of

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.700
the human body.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.020
A few interesting things about Tim: he is
actually a tango world record holder and a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.940
former National Kickboxing Champion, which
I guess means that he could sweep you off

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.360
your feet in multiple different ways.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
[laughter]

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.730
Tim is also a guest lecturer at Princeton
University and a faculty member at Singularity

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.230
University based at NASA Ames Research Center.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.210
Today Tim is going to be talking about his
new book, The Four Hour Body: An Uncommon

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.560
Guide to Rapid Fat Loss, Incredible Sex, and
Becoming Superhuman, which is perhaps why

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
all of you are here.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560
[laughter]

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.900
As a big fan of both Tim and becoming superhuman
I'm really excited to hear what he has to

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
say.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.421
So please join me in welcoming Tim Ferris.

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:18.421
[applause]

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:25.430
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Alright, thank you for being
here everyone. I'm excited to be back at the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.939
Googleplex yet again.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.939
[pause]

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.960
It's all downhill from here after that introduction
so. [laughs]

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.969
This is delicious peppermint water. You don't
seem to have anything other than flavored

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:37.969
water.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.799
So The Four Hour Body is the topic of a very
brief presentation today. I'm gonna keep it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.609
exceptionally short. I wanna get to Q and
A as quickly as possible.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.070
And I put masochism first in the subtitle
because that will be reflected in the video

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.899
that I'm going to show you. And then I'll
add commentary after that.

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.490
So I'll explain why I do such things to myself.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.409
[video playing]

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.560
Male #1: This is a biopsy needle.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.540
[sound of clapping]

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.212
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: This is for comparative purposes.

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:12.212
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yes. It's about the thick ?

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:13.212
[sound of clapping]

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:14.212
just a little bit thinner than a pencil.

00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:15.212
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yes.

00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:16.212
This might seem a little bit strange.

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:17.212
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: This is in Cape Town,
South Africa where you don't have to sign

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:18.530
a hundred thousand waivers to have such things
done to you. [chuckles]

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.930
[pause]

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.570
That is in the vastus lateralis on the right
thigh. I have a nice scar for that.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.570
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So that's ?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: That the depth that we've created
to [uintelligible].

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.570
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: [sighs]

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: I'm going to get a sample.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.520
[two people speaking Afrikaans]

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.370
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: That is Afrikaans for
those of you who speak Afrikaans here.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.690
&gt;&gt;male #1: I'll say, I'll say "suction" and
you pull back a bit if you feel resistance

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.810
you just [inaudible]. And then I'll say "release."
Then I'll say "suction." And then I'll say

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.810
"release."

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.690
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: This is a hollow biopsy
tube and they use the suction to pull muscle

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.480
tissue, which doesn't have any pain receptors
as far as I could tell into the tube so they

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.840
can then sever it and use it for analysis.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:10.040
&gt;&gt;male #1: Relax the leg for me as far as
possible. There we go. And just [inaudible].

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
[laughter]

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.380
And suction.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380
[pause]

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.710
And release.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.710
[pause]

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.040
And suction.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040
[pause]

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.370
And release.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.370
[pause]

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.700
And suction.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
[pause]

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Did we get it?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.800
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: [laughs] Alright, who
wants to sign up?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.170
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible] just take it off.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.730
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: That wasn't my muscle
samples.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.320
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. Thank you
a little Carpaccio, steak tar tare, Tim tar

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.980
tare. [laughs]

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.054
Okay so these will be used for the anti-[inaudible],
the fiber type ?

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:51.054
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yes.

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:52.054
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: and the comparisons that we
talked about with the graphs.

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:53.054
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yes.

00:03:53.054 --> 00:03:54.054
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: And then that one over there
will hopefully be used for the ?

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:55.054
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah.

00:03:55.054 --> 00:03:56.054
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: contractility and all that
good stuff.

00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:57.054
&gt;&gt;male #1: This is exactly ?

00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:58.054
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss live: Okay, so there you have
it.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:03:59.054
So I spent three years doing that type of
thing to myself.

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:00.054
Now why would you do such a thing?

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:02.930
Well, as it turns out that what you would
expect to happen based on tests like 23 amino

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.070
AVIgenics doesn't always pan out in the real
world when you actually look at, for example,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.490
muscle fibers under the microscope so.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.820
According to a number of genetic tests that
I had to look at my genotype I lack, or I

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.530
should say, I have a nonsense allele for actin
3 and that codes for fast twitch muscle fiber.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.449
So I wanted to see what my potential was for
gaining muscle quickly or becoming an Olympic

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.449
sprinter.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.310
The results came back, "Sorry, you're gonna
be really, really piss poor at both. But good

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.009
luck. You have a genetic predisposition."

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.939
Alright, so I had my muscle fibers removed
to look at my genetic potential for endurance

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.870
and this is what we turn out with.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.439
So we're looking ? [laughs]

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.439
[laughter]

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.520
You can see right from the outset, not looking
good.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
[laughter]

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.150
And Dr. Cohen who was one of the two doctors
performing the biopsy came in with the results

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.430
and before he described them he said, "I'm
going to speak simply because I'm a doctor

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.800
and I like to speak simply." I was like, "Alright."

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.210
He says, "You would have trouble finishing
a 10K.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.210
[laughter]

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.340
No you would have trouble finishing a 5K."

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.729
I was like, "Alright." [laughs]

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.729
[laughter]

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.360
So here are a number of enzymes that limit
endurance potential in aerobic capacity among

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.379
other things. So you have citrate synthase
on the left which has been studied quite a

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.850
lot, [3H]AD, and so forth and so on.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.449
And you have South African antelope in the
red, so I'm not gonna be beating them in 40

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.830
yard dash or 100 mile races anytime soon.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.509
Then you have endurance athletes.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.960
And then you have Tim Ferriss below the line;
below zero. [laughs]

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.460
I don't know how that's even possible; turns
out that the Y axis here is the enzyme activity

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.090
percentage of untrained humans. So if that
zero is Homer Simpson, then the green is me.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.090
[laughter]

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.270
Is basically what that means.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.169
So there's another graph that I didn't include
in this presentation which is equally instructive

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.580
and that was muscle fiber type.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.159
Turns out I have very little slow twitch muscle
fiber, but I have a lot of what's called Type

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.409
IIa fast twitch muscle fiber; purely through
training.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.180
Alright, so the genotype what you would expect
based on my genetic predisposition and what

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.070
I've been able to produce through training
are two very, very different realities.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.370
And The Four Hour Body, The Three Hour Body's
next. Damn I already told you guys.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.760
The Four Hour Body was a three year process
of testing all of this, whether it was fat

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.759
loss, endurance, sleep related, maximal strength
related, to see if the lab results or lab

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.539
expectations held up under field testing.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:45.520
And it turns out that a lot of it does not
hold up and that I believe you can reach your

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.311
genetic potential in almost any one of these
physical performance areas in about six months.

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:52.729
And we can talk about some of those examples.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.449
One of my inspirations was this girl right
here.

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.479
So Barry Ross, who trained one of his athletes
to break all of Marion Jones' records in high

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.849
school, and his athlete Allyson Felix ended
up becoming the first professional track athlete

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:12.749
right out of high school. Looks something
like this; this is another one of his trainees.

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.379
And I worked with him for maximal strength
development because he's very good at it with

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:17.379
sprinters.

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.610
So he sent me this photograph to illustrate
a movement called "The Torture Twist" which

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.830
is a horrible, horrible movement. I'm happy
to show you how to do it after the presentation.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:32.509
This girl is a high school runner. She is
132 pounds; looks pretty normal from all indications;

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:37.439
and she deadlifts 405 pounds for repetitions.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:43.650
And that alone was severely emasculating for
me. [laughs]

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.900
[laughter]

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.310
And inspired me to train, not harder, but
much more intelligently and I was able to

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.050
go from being able to pull roughly 300, 315
pounds off the floor to doing rack pulls with

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.389
about 650 with a double overhand grip, that's
not a hook grip.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:04.270
So I'll let you guys Google that later, but
it's a hell of a lot harder than doing an

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.339
alternating grip using wraps.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:13.619
And it was from training using less than five
minutes of tension per week in the deadlift.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:16.689
The volume was exceptionally, exceptionally
low.

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:21.319
Alright, and that would be one example of
the minimum effective dose, which we will

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.319
come back to.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:30.830
So the guiding tenet for this entire exploration
which started actually coincided with beginning

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:36.060
to invest in startup companies and advise
startup companies; so I'm in Twitter and Evernote

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.039
and StumbleUpon and others.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.870
I wanted to see if you could apply split testing,
multi-variant testing, that type of data crunching

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:49.630
to the physical body, but in general the tenet
came from Mark Twain. "So whenever I found

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.970
myself on the side of the majority it was
time to pause and reflect." Not just pause

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.310
and reflect, but to test the opposite approach.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:01.660
So if everyone's doing 20 to 30 hours of training
for Ironman, let's say, well could you do

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.350
4 or 5 hours of training and get better results?
Are there any outliers who have been able

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.861
to achieve that? It turns out there are.

00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.360
[pause]

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.430
So I'm gonna keep the presentation based on
a number of what I would call, "first principles"

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.570
that are organizing principles for all of
the tactics. So these are more strategies

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.570
than anything else.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.570
[pause]

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:29.190
Okay, [laughs] so the means inform the mean,
I think I read that incorrectly. The extremes

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.600
inform the mean, not vice versa.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.279
How many people here have seen the movie Objectified?
Anyone? Wow, I'm amazed only three people.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:45.950
Objectified also done by the director of Helvetica;
fantastic movie; and there's a moment, an

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.320
anecdote interview in that movie that involves
garden shears.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.320
And Frog Design is being interviewed or they're
explaining how one of their clients came in

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.390
to ask them to develop a new type of garden
shears and they said, "Our average user is

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.920
a 45 year old woman, she is in this type of
job, she behaves this way." And they said,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.980
"We don't care about your average. We wanna
know the extremes."

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.240
So on either side in each pole we wanna know
about let's say the 400 pound body builder

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.950
who can't brush his own teeth, and we wanna
know about the paraplegic and their limitations.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.820
And if you handle the extremes then you cover
the means.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.990
It just so happens it doesn't work in the
opposite direction.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.940
So you've probably heard the joke about Bill
Gates walking into a bar and the average net

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.110
worth jumps to $150 million each.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.810
The mean and the average oftentimes mean nothing,
from a practical standpoint.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:41.660
So on the right hand side you have me posing
with a number of syringes that have three

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.500
inch needles. And they contain a number of
different things. And this is experimenting

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.029
with the mean, with the extremes rather, to
inform the mean.

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:56.350
And that particular cocktail is very simple;
it's effectively sugar water; its dextrose,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:02.480
saline, a few other things, perhaps some glucosamine
which I have mixed feelings about, B12 for

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.800
injury repair.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.959
Some of the others are a bit more aggressive.
They contain things like stem cell growth

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:13.570
factors that I flew in from Israel, IGF-1,
and some of my growth factor one. So some

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.319
pretty, pretty powerful stuff.

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:21.030
But what you realize is that when you look
at, let's say, how someone who is 400 pounds

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.430
lost their first 150 pounds of fat, then you
look at how the professional body builder

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:30.171
gets from 6 to 4% body fat, you learn a lot
more than if you're looking at anything in

00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:32.250
between those two ranges.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.199
So that's the first principle. Look for the
outliers and study the outliers.

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:42.839
Alright, tracking plus loss aversion is more
important than how-to.

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:48.899
So the emphasis in exercise and diet in particular
tends to focus on the latest and greatest.

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:52.579
And the business model seems to be complicate
to profit. So you can't publish a magazine

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:57.480
every month without new material. Unfortunately
that leads to a lot of confusion.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.029
And what I realized very early on was that
the how-to does not matter as much as the

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:08.190
motivation for the behavioral change; and
spent time with people like BJ Fogg at Stanford

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.310
University in the Persuasion Lab, among other
people, to really drill down into the specifics

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.560
of this.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.910
And this is a photograph of Chad Fowler before
and after who runs the RailsConf Conference,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.120
among others.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.810
And Chad knew what to do on some level, but
he didn't make the change until the pain was

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:32.629
painful enough. And I think that for many
people the tracking was the second piece that

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:36.779
he used to provide the feedback necessary
to compel him to continue.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:42.160
So self-discipline, willpower all very overrated.
If you just use tracking you can oftentimes

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.990
catalyze a behavior change that you want to
make.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.660
And a good example of that would be The Flash
Diet. The so-called Flash Diet. All that entails

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.569
is taking an iPhone or a camera phone of some
type and taking a picture of every meal before

00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:55.730
you eat it.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.160
It's a pattern interrupt that makes you aware
of your decisions that were previously subconscious

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.500
or habitual and leads to dramatically more
fat loss than even written food journals.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.019
And if you were to take that as one option
and then personal trainers and a sophisticated

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:15.139
strict Zone Diet on the other, I would actually
bet on the people with the iPhones, based

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:17.610
on all the data that I've seen.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.170
Loss aversion also is very, very important.
Let's see we have, where's Trevor? Trevor?

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.940
Trevor? Trevor, there he is.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.360
So Trevor Claiborne here makes a guest appearance
in the book as well, and I think accentuates

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.600
I think one principle behavioral change that's
very undervalued.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.350
In the U.S. in particular we tend to focus
on rewards and patting everybody on the back.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.769
In fact fear of loss if you look at let's
say, bidding behavior at auctions. People

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:50.400
will overbid dramatically more to prevent
losing, let's say, $10 as opposed to gaining

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.740
$10. No big surprise.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.660
But you can use that to your advantage. So
Trevor, in particular, bet a co-worker, was

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.920
it one dollar a workout? So one dollar a workout;
if one of them missed their workout they had

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.160
to pay the other a dollar.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.370
So in lifestyle impact one dollar does very
little, but from a psychological standpoint

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.370
it has a tremendous impact.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.339
So focusing on tracking, using data to your
advantage, and that type of feedback to your

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:18.300
advantage, and then loss aversion beat the
method.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.690
To give you a very clear example of how method
can fail.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.540
I had a number of CEO's here in Silicon Valley
ask me for an index card. They said, "I don't

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.981
want the story. I don't want the details.
Give me an index card with the bullet points

00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:31.449
for losing abdominal fat and I'll do it."

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:36.449
And so I gave each of them the index card
with the bullet points; success rate 0%.

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:42.519
Alright, so the reasons for change and the
feedback mechanisms are more important in

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:43.930
many cases than the actual how-to.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:54.509
Then we have the minimum effective dose. So
the minimum effective dose is a way of looking

00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:59.540
at exercise and diet, among other things,
as you would look at medicine or drugs.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.029
So what is the minimum effective dose to achieve
a very precise, quantifiable outcome? Anything

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:11.339
above that produces side effects and the side
effects could be from over training, they

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:17.230
could certainly be from supplementation, they
could be from simply trying to maintain a

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.629
low calorie diet of 1200 calories that's unsustainable.

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:24.870
Alright, so in this particular case you have
two pictures. On the right hand side this

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:30.000
is a fairly typical meal of mine. I follow
a diet called The Slow Carb Diet and I could

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.680
go into great detail about that if you want
in the Q and A.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.279
If people ask me the first step that they
should take I'm not gonna give them a list

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.410
of five things to change.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.790
So if you talk to BJ Fogg, he'll tell you
if you ask, let's say people over 50, if you

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.620
try to teach them to learn to text in order
to lose weight or to quit smoking it won't

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.399
work because it's two behaviors.

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:56.569
So I say change your breakfast: 30 grams of
protein within 30 minutes of waking up.

00:15:56.569 --> 00:16:01.100
My dad who ended up losing a total of more
than 90 pounds of fat and gaining 20 to 30

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.410
pounds of muscle at age 65, began with changing
his breakfast and he went from approximately

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.980
5 pounds of fat loss per month to 18.75 pounds
in the first month after changing his protein

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.920
intake within 30 minutes of waking up.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.490
That's where I would have people change.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.470
Another case study; a female who was running
five hours per week, five, six hours per week

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:26.251
and could not lose the last 10 to 15 pounds
changed her breakfast and lost 3% body fat

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:31.250
between four and five weeks; very small change
with a disproportionately large outcome; so

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.410
looking for that minimum effective dose as
the starting point.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.370
On the left hand side you have Tracy.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:45.480
Tracy lost 117 pounds with two or three 10
to 20 minute kettlebell workouts per week,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.420
focusing on the two-handed swing which you
see here. That's the down swing. Mother of

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:56.430
two and it started with that minimum effect
dose of very short duration: kettlebell workouts

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.420
and then she also adopted the same diet.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.350
[pause]

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.310
So, last but not least, [laughs]

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.980
[laughter]

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:11.689
You wanna keep improvement relative. So I
do not have the actin 3 to do that, nor do

00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:17.430
I have perhaps the liver drug tolerance to
do that -- [laughs]

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.850
[laughter]

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:24.049
But the goal is not to be the best in the
world, necessarily.

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:29.241
The goal is to use numbers to be the best
you, the best version of yourself you can

00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:36.409
possibly in these various domains; these various
areas of physical performance or appearance.

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:37.409
And that's it.

00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:40.070
Those are the overarching principles that
you'll see in every single chapter of The

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.070
Four Hour Body.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.750
All of the various self-destructive experiments
that I perform on myself so other people don't

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.460
have to, I'm happy to talk about anything
related to self-experimentation in the book

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.110
or otherwise, but that's the end of the presentation.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.720
So thank you for listening.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720
[applause]

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720
[pause]

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.730
Sorry.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.730
[pause]

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:09.230
Oh, yes. We have a microphone. So you can
go to the microphone over here or you can

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.760
yell it out and I'll repeat your question.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.760
[pause]

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.760
&gt;&gt;Charles: Hi Tim, I'm Charles.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Hi Charles.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.820
&gt;&gt;Charles: I lead design for our mobile products
and social products here at Google.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.770
Big fan of what you do; it looks like the
least paritofied, if that's a word?

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.770
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.400
&gt;&gt;Charles: chapter of your book might be about
the endurance?

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.160
&gt;&gt;Charles: stuff; I don't know if that's a
fair statement. Seems like based on the analog

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160
graph?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160
&gt;&gt;Charles: your endurance is something you're
kind of?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.230
&gt;&gt;Charles: slow to love, maybe.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.520
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. I'm definitely
slow to love endurance.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: And so I was just wondering, there's
like a little bit of a cliff hanger in the

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.870
book?

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: How did it come out?

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Okay.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: And are you gonna continue?

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Um-hum.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: tryin' to?

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:51.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Uh-hum.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: run long distances? That's my question?

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:53.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Good question.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:54.870
&gt;&gt;Charles: Thanks.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So there is a cliff hanger
in the book with the endurance training.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.870
So there are a few things I'd say.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:01.929
The first is that the greatest progress that
I've made has been technically related; so

00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:08.130
biomechanics related as far as running; really
a combination of Pose Method and a few other

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.130
methods.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.360
For those people who are really into running
Pose Method does have its risks. There is

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.090
a sidebar in the book that discusses how the
forces get transferred from the knee to the

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.480
ankle; side note.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.289
In my particular case I hate running. I hate
running. I really, really, really hate running,

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:28.260
so I knew that the best way to ensure that
I completed an ultramarathon which will be

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.450
my first goal; so I've never run a 10K but
I'm try to run a 50K minimum; is to do it

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.850
in front of the entire world while they're
watching.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.950
So I'm actually gonna start that beginning
of next month. And I've been making sure that

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.720
my body is as symmetrically capable as possible
before beginning the training to avoid injury.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.049
So the pre-hab chapter is what I've been focusing
on thus far. But I'm gonna start in earnest

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:53.030
next month and maybe do, I'm not sure if it'll
be the Quad Dipsea; a little too much vertical

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:58.370
[laughs] in the Quad Dipsea, but I will be
starting that in February and I'm expecting,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:05.029
aiming within six months to complete; hopefully
sooner. I think it could be done in 12 if

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:06.600
I really focused on it and didn't have to
travel.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600
&gt;&gt;Charles: Um-hum.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.710
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: That's the goal.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.220
Thanks.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.220
Other questions?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.220
[pause]

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.220
Um-hum.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220
[pause]

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:22.960
&gt;&gt;male #1: I was curious that I'm generally
comfortable with like a liquid diet a lot

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.929
of times. I can find that I can supplement
really almost anything in liquid form and

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:25.929
it's convenient and fast for me.

00:20:25.929 --> 00:20:26.929
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:35.440
&gt;&gt;male #1: Have you seen any kind of like
psychological reports or analyses that follow

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.429
that? Because a lot times obviously I'm not
nearly as satisfied

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:40.429
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:41.429
&gt;&gt;male #1: when it comes to liquid diets comparative

00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:42.429
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:43.529
&gt;&gt;male #1: to finding the same supplements

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:44.529
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:20:44.529 --> 00:20:45.610
&gt;&gt;male #1: on a plate.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:52.309
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So the question of solid versus
liquid food. It's easier to over consume with

00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:56.640
liquid and that's part of the reason that
if people are trying to gain mass; most controversial

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.779
topic in the book by far is the mass gain;
that's where like the meathead brigade has

00:21:00.779 --> 00:21:04.630
come down upon me in force on the Internet.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.620
But I gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days.
So I was supervised by a Ph.D. as San Jose

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.520
State University and to do that you have to
consume a pretty atrocious number of calories.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.520
And the easiest way to do that is through
liquid.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.270
But, as an example, so this morning I was
running out and didn't have much time to prepare

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.770
so I had unflavored whey protein with some
cinnamon and vanilla extract. And then I had

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:31.010
Brazil nuts and a handful of different seeds
and that was it. And that will keep me sated

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.299
because of the protein content for a number
of hours.

00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:39.000
So as long as it has high protein percentage,
I don't see any problem with it.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.130
I know people who've lost a tremendous amount
of weight doing using primarily liquid meals

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.630
and one or two whole meals per day.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:51.450
But if you have the control to keep an eye
on the actual macronutrient and caloric intake

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.790
then I don't see a problem with it.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.350
[pause]

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.840
If people don't wanna get up and walk over
that's fine too.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.039
&gt;&gt;Peter: Hi, my name's Peter.

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:01.039
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Hi Peter.

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:05.020
&gt;&gt;Peter: So you showed the woman who lost
117 pounds of fat through changing her breakfast

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.550
and doing kettlebell swings. So I understand
the concept of minimum effect dose to accomplish

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.040
that goal of fat loss.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.220
Did you evaluate whether those same techniques
actually were resulting in holistic, overall

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.309
health for her?

00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:23.840
I understand she lost a lot of fat, but like
hormone markers, all kinds of other measures

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.040
of health, were those improved as well? And
is there like a minimum effective dose for

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.120
holistic, overall health?

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.210
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Um-hum.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.230
So the question is, is there a minimum effective
dose for minimum, I'm sorry, for overall,

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.230
holistic health?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.230
&gt;&gt;Peter: Expansion of life span, that sort
of thing.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.230
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Yeah.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.230
&gt;&gt;Peter: Like is she gonna live longer 'cause
of that?

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.230
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Yeah.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.840
So the health is like success in the sense
that it's defined differently by different

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.510
people. So we would have to sit down and actually
look at the actual markers.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:52.470
What I would say is that in her particular
case, certainly by improving insulin sensitivity

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:57.260
and so forth I would wager that her life span
would be extended.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:04.280
If you take anything to an extreme with physical
performance like power lifting; I mean I know,

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.990
a friend of mine is 145 pounds and he can
bench press 600 pounds, as an example. Or

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:14.710
running 100 mile races; he's done that in
competition too. I doubt any of that's terribly

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.279
good for the body long term.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:22.450
But I think that many of the, if we're talking
about longevity specifically, there are a

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.929
few takeaways that I'd suggest looking closely
at.

00:23:24.929 --> 00:23:31.870
One would be protein cycling and minimizing
complete amino acid profile intake for at

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:39.460
least 16 hours a week which isn't that hard;
things like wheat lack lysine, as an example.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:46.740
Donating blood; many of the managers of centenarian
studies; I think Boston University most notably.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.830
This is a male; donates blood because last
I checked men don't menstruate. That's one

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:57.880
of the hypotheses as to why women in general
live longer than men is the reduction of toxic

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.640
iron accumulation, things of that type.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.169
But it would really come down to looking at
the markers individually I would say.

00:24:04.169 --> 00:24:10.299
But if you're looking at, let's just say,
the general health markers of, let's say,

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:18.870
total cholesterol to HDL, triglyceride, fasting,
glucose, hemoglobin A1c, things of that type.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.179
In these particular instances I would wager
they've all been improved.

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:27.340
For most of the case studies, certainly for
myself, I've done thousands of line item blood

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.029
tests over the last few years; most of those
have been improved longitudinally overtime.

00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:37.040
But if I'm doing an experiment like I eat
nothing but meat and mixed nuts for 21 days

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.100
to see what effect it would have on those
markers. If you remove some of those more

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.679
extreme experiments, then I would say, for
the most part, they're being improved at the

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:47.679
same time.

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:48.679
&gt;&gt;Peter: Thanks.

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:49.679
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Yeah. Welcome.

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:53.510
If you wanna talk about anything specific
markers afterwards, I'll hang out for a bit.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.020
[pause]

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.020
Any other questions?

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.549
&gt;&gt;male #2: What happened when you ate nothing
but meat and nuts for 21 days?

00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:00.549
[laughter]

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:01.549
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: [laughs]

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:04.029
So I was in Nicaragua for this particular
test. I was doing some experimentation with

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:10.960
medical tourism. I ate grass fed beef, few
pounds a day, and almonds primarily; pretty

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.660
boring diet. [laughs]

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:22.799
My conventionally assessed cholesterol values
improved. So my HDL to total cholesterol ratio

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:23.799
improved.

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:30.779
There were a few things, let me think offhand,
it was an improvement on average over my baseline

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:31.970
beforehand.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:37.970
And I think that underscores a point that
is neglected oftentimes which is, you are

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:43.081
what you eat, yes that's true. But you are
what you eat ate also. In the sense that I

00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:48.510
would rather eat grass fed beef than grain
fed salmon, as an example.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.850
So that was to try to highlight the importance
of understanding your sources.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.850
[pause]

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.850
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hello.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.090
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Hi. Nice shirt.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:26:00.870
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.870
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: [laughs]

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.289
&gt;&gt;female #1: I wondering what advice or warning
you would give to women who reading your book

00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:04.490
as far as things that might need to be modified
or --

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.490
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: additional consideration.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.159
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So good question. So things
in the book that might be modified for women

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:13.690
or emphasized for women; there are a few.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.289
The first is that it is extremely important
on The Slow Carb diet to ensure that you're

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:19.309
getting enough calories.

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:24.130
So many women who have tried low carb diets
in the past will default to eating, let's

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.059
say, a chicken breast and leafy salad for
lunch.

00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:33.760
And what you'll find, this is true on any
low calorie or sub maintenance diet, that

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.830
you could stop menstruating. It's very, very
common among athletes as well. And that's

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.980
generally not a good thing.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.279
So I would say if you eat for fertility as
a woman you'll generally also get optimal

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:48.320
athletic performance and fat loss.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.370
A few things related to fertility very quickly.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.350
I've seen, this is dozens, I'm not talking
about one or two case studies of women who

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.549
have just gone from miscarriage, miscarriage,
miscarriage to pregnant.

00:26:58.549 --> 00:27:04.350
And the two most common changes were removing
gluten from the diet. For a host of reasons

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:09.179
that affects hormone regulation; so removing
grains effectively.

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:16.320
Number two would be adding in increasing saturated
fat intake, oddly enough. So I don't know

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.350
if that's due to long chain fatty acids. I
don't know if it's due to replacing the gluten

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.559
and therefore increasing protein and fat intake
as a side effect.

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:28.679
But those were the two most common changes.

00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:35.540
Otherwise, from a training standpoint, from
a dietary standpoint, men and women more or

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.350
less respond the same way. There is a lot
of variability between people but not as much

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.539
as we would sometimes like to think.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:48.169
There's been some speculation that because
women have a higher percentage of slow twitch

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:53.080
muscle fibers they should train with a higher
repetition range in resistance training or

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.230
weight training.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.000
My position on that is that you should train
for your desired outcome, not for your current

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
state.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.080
Because if I train for my current state based
on my genetics testing it wouldn't go anywhere.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.080
[laughs]

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.309
Like I would be well suited to I don't know
what sports; sliding down slides or

00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:09.440
[laughter]

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.440
Monopoly.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.840
[laughter]

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.789
So those would be the highlights.

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:18.600
But I would say that women are fortunate on
one hand because they have very clear indications

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.409
of their hormonal state through menstruation
and other things.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:25.159
Whereas men are just kind of wandering around
not knowing what the hell's going on. And

00:28:25.159 --> 00:28:29.789
then they're like, "Oh no my sperm count's
four times lower than it should be. Uh-oh;

00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:33.399
didn't realize that until I wanted to have
kids."

00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:38.049
Side note: the starting point for all of this
is comprehensive blood testing. So I would

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:41.780
highly, highly recommend once every three
or six months you get comprehensive blood

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.059
testing done. Certainly everyone here can
afford it.

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:51.130
And additional testing that I would recommend
is SpectraCell. S-p-e-c-t-r-a-C-e-l-l dot

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:56.360
com, allegedly used by Lance Armstrong and
others which wouldn't mean anything incriminating;

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.559
it's for nutrient deficiency.

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:01.970
I identified that I had a selenium deficiency.
How many people here track their selenium?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.260
Probably not many. And selenium's very important
for spermatogenesis.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.230
So I actually did a number of things: fixed
my selenium deficiency; used cold exposures;

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.800
and stopped carrying my cell phone in my pocket,
side note. And doubled my sperm count in three

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.960
months.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.601
For those of you who are interested in such
things.

00:29:19.601 --> 00:29:20.601
[laughter]

00:29:20.601 --> 00:29:25.840
&gt;&gt;male #2: So as far as I can tell from the
quick look through the book, it pretty much

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.880
concentrates on what we would normally consider
physical attributes.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:43.039
Do you have any research or anything interesting
on minimum effective dose either for balance

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.039
and coordination?

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.039
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:46.039
&gt;&gt;male #2: 'cause I didn't see much there.

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.140
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: And also mentally; Nootropics or

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.660
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: or diet as sort of

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.660
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: opposed to mental

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.660
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Good question.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.340
So the, have I found anything for the minimum
effective dose for balance, agility, or mental

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.370
performance like Nootropics?

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:08.280
So I was as an undergrad first a neuroscience
major primarily because I wanted to focus

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.750
on smart drugs. [laughs]

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.419
I've seen a lot. There are many different
approaches you can take.

00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:19.240
As far as balance goes, there's quite a lot
of debate in the PT and athletic training

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.720
community about whether balance is a general
skill you can train, just like if there exists

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:33.000
a general intelligence. Usually people would
segment it out into, for example, [pause]

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.190
muscular symmetry.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:39.419
So one of the fastest ways to improve general
agility and balance, I would say, is by doing

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:43.390
an assessment called the FMS, the Functional
Movement Screen.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:49.889
And I'm sure there are people at SF who can
do that. And that'll assess imbalances from

00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:55.030
left to right or contra laterally. And when
you fix those it's pretty astounding. It's

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.850
in the pre-hab chapter.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.039
But if you identify using, for example, there's
a movement called, or there are two movements

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:07.600
called the "chop and lift" where you're using,
generally speaking, a cable and you're doing

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.399
this type chopping diagonal movement and then
you're reversing it and going up.

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:17.059
And so you test your four quadrants and you'll
generally find that one quadrant is extremely

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:22.480
weak, relatively speaking. And when you fix
that it's incredible how many aches and pains,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.470
how many problems, how many injuries just
disappear.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.710
So I would say that from a functional standpoint
that would be one.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.639
If we're talking about equilibrium I haven't
found anything to be particularly effective

00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:34.220
for general balance.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.880
For mental performance, this is something
that I really debated quite a lot because

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.649
I'm a huge fan of cognitive enhancement. And
I didn't include any chapter specifically

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:52.159
on that because I found looking at the literature
that improving physical performance, what

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:55.980
most people would divorce from their mind
or brain, is actually the best way to improve

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.019
cognitive performance.

00:31:57.019 --> 00:32:02.130
And there's a great book called Spark which
is written by a Harvard M.D. that looks at

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.809
physical education in some very sophisticated
programs from improving academic performance

00:32:05.809 --> 00:32:11.710
specifically by making students perform at
a certain heart rate immediately prior to

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.669
their worst subjects; really fascinating stuff.

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:19.679
But if we're talking about drugs. [laughs]
I'm sure there a few people in this audience

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:25.860
who probably tried Modafinil, among others.
So Provigil which is an anti-narcolepsy drug.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.669
There are a lot of drugs that will improve
short term memory, working memory, reaction

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:30.669
speed.

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:36.740
Vasopressin which is an anti-diuretic hormone
that's used in, let's say, bedwetting in children

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.320
in some cases, also can improve short term
memory.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.929
The reason that I have ended up staying away
from any of these drugs is that I've realized

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:48.669
in the course of doing all this research and
all this testing, that the brain is a very

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:50.450
sensitive instrument.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:56.360
And the brain, well the body, likes homeostasis.
So if you interrupt any of the feedback loops

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.759
you can cause some really significant long
term problems.

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:04.409
That's certainly true if you look at, let's
say, anabolics' use. If you're using super-physiological

00:33:04.409 --> 00:33:11.750
high dose, let's just say, testosterone cypionate,
then you can screw up your HPTA Axis. And

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.490
if you screw up your hypothalamus, boy you're
gonna have a lot of issues.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.880
So I've ended up staying away from the smart
drugs most recently.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:26.389
The exceptions would be Yerba Mate tea. I
love Yerba Mate. And it contains a handful

00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:31.179
of stimulants that all have different pharmacokinetics
so you end up getting this nice extended,

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:34.779
like three to four hour buzz, which is great
for writing, among other things.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:39.179
And the other, I would say, for mental performance
would be hunger.

00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:46.110
So when you are in a fasted state whether
that's through intermittent fasting or otherwise,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.010
you will experience a heightened level of
cognitive function and I think that does reflect

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:54.870
back to evolution. From an evolutionary standpoint
if you're hunting and gathering it's a good

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.971
idea to have better visual acuity if you're
really hungry [laughs] and you need to find

00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:02.679
food, among other things. But that's somewhat
speculation.

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:04.210
Hopefully that helps.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.210
Any other questions?

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.870
&gt;&gt;female #2: I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about fruit and why you

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.450
don't recommend it and also beans and why
you recommend it [inaudible] ?

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.530
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Beans. Um-hum. Are you Paleo?

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.530
&gt;&gt;female #2: Uh ?

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.530
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Paleo person?

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.530
&gt;&gt;female #2: [inaudible]

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.530
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Semi.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:26.579
So the question was why do I recommend against
consuming fruit, for the most part, and why

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:31.310
do I allow beans on The Slow Carb Diet?

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:38.429
So the first fruit. Fruit as it existed 100,
200 years ago is very different from fruit

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:44.050
as it exists today. It's selectively bred
and modified to have the highest level of

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.129
fructose or fruit sugar possible.

00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:55.440
And fructose is problematic for fat loss specifically.
So if you're not trying to lose fat, I have

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.400
no particular problem with consuming fruit.
But if you wanna get the best results possible

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.700
from a fat loss program, fructose is converted
to glycerol phosphate which is then converted

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:09.200
to body fat very, very efficiently. It's like
there's no more efficient pathway you could

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.619
find just about; the same reason that high
fructose corn syrup will make you really,

00:35:13.619 --> 00:35:14.930
really fat.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.940
Another note: same reason agave nectar will
make you very, very fat. It's 90 percent concentrated

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.060
fructose.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:28.460
So looking at, again from an evolutionary
standpoint, the nutrient necessity of fruit;

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.490
if you get it once a week; I have the one
day off, the cheat day or the binge day once

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:38.290
per week on The Slow Carb Diet. That's more
than enough to satisfy any sweet tooth requirement

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.920
as it relates to fruit.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.370
If you absolutely have to have fruit; and
I'm experimenting with fruit again in very

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:50.450
moderate doses using primarily berries because
it does have a fascinating effect on blood

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.470
glucose. It flat lines your blood glucose.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:59.040
So I do recommend fruit on your off day; having
it in the beginning of the day, such as grapefruit,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:06.099
which also includes Neurogenin which is interesting
for extending the half life of caffeine.

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:10.230
I implanted a Dexcom SEVEN device in my side.
It's a continuous glucose monitor used by

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.450
Type I diabetics. And I implanted it in my
side to track my blood glucose 24/7 for about

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:16.450
three weeks.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:20.609
And what I noticed is when you have this small
amount of fruit in the morning it allows you

00:36:20.609 --> 00:36:26.410
to keep your blood sugar below, I think its
100 nanograms per deciliter, milligrams per

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:30.290
deciliter. It allows you to keep it below
this critical threshold for fat loss which

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.290
is pretty fascinating.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.141
But, in general, I would say just stay away
from fruit, from what I've seen. And I haven't

00:36:35.141 --> 00:36:38.369
seen any deleterious health effects from that
at all.

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:45.481
Beans; so beans if anyone here is a strict
Paleo eater, beans and legumes are a big no-no.

00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:51.240
For that same reason, peanuts are a big no-no;
and cashews; I love cashews.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:37:01.300
But if you prepare beans properly; so if you're
soaking them let's say overnight, I simply

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:08.000
haven't seen the digestive issues that one
would expect based on how strongly they are

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.800
avoided on the Paleo diet. I just haven't
seen the problem.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:18.150
So I do recommend lentils and other legumes
and beans for the simple reason, among others,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:22.430
that if people are only consuming leafy vegetables
or steamed vegetables and protein, they're

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:28.170
almost always hypocaloric. And then they get
irritable, they get headaches, and they quit.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.650
So that would be the main reason.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.831
And I'm convinced someday I'll either be proven
right or wrong, as I suppose is the case with

00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.831
everything.

00:37:35.831 --> 00:37:40.580
Lentils, there's some property in lentils
that is just, it's a force multiplier for

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.980
fat loss. I cannot figure out, I don't know
what it is. I have my speculations, but lentils

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.680
are amazing; taste pretty good too.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680
No problem.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.640
&gt;&gt;male #3: So did you put lots of sort of
distillation of successful experiments, do

00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:00.330
you have any stories about things that went
wrong, maybe in a spectacular nature?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.330
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: [laughs]

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.330
[laughter]

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.330
Oh yeah.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.609
Somebody asked me recently, "You seem to always
land on your feet." And I was like, "Really?"

00:38:05.609 --> 00:38:06.609
[laughter]

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:08.970
And two of my doctors were in the audience.
I was like, "You should ask [laughs] them

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.720
how often I land on my head. It's pretty bad."

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720
Spectacular or dangerous fashion?

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.990
Yeah, so I had a PRP injection. So PRP is
fascinating; there's some really good researchers

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:22.800
here in the Bay Area. Allan Mishra in particular
is fantastic; he's at Stanford.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:29.530
PRP stands for platelet rich plasma and this
is a way of getting around the illegality

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.020
of anabolics, as a side note.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.950
What many athletes will do is they'll have
their blood taken out; they'll have a blood

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:40.630
draw performed; they'll put that whole blood
into a special centrifuge and spin it so it

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.170
separates out the plasma and white blood cells
and growth factors that are associated. And

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:51.010
then they re-inject or they inject that locally
into the site of injury. And it works spectacularly

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.010
well.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.560
There are a number of cases of Super Bowl
athletes; eight weeks out; one of them tears

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.290
an Achilles tendon; now what? PRP. And then
they compete.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:04.130
I've seen world class sprinters win gold medals
at the world championships something like

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.349
12 weeks after hamstring or Achilles tendon
tears; PRP.

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:10.359
I'm sure there are other things being used
as well.

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:15.290
But I had a number of PRP injections and most
of them worked very well and then there was

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.760
on botched injection.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.860
When I say botched injection it should have
been injected laterally on the elbow and it

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:26.480
was injected really right at the point of
the elbow where the skin is the thickest.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.450
Now the bad part about thick skin is there's
a lot of bacteria, there's always bacteria

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.829
in skin, but the thicker it is, the more bacteria
there is.

00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:40.960
And they pushed through the bacteria and gave
me a MRSA infection which is a antibiotic

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.510
resistant staph infection. And within 48 hours
my elbow was the size of a football.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.040
And I was talking to a friend of mine who's
a Harvard trained doctor; I was eating lunch.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.910
And she goes, "Put down you lunch. Get in
a taxi. Go to the emergency room." And she

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.460
said go to this particular emergency 'cause
she's based around here.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.283
And I had to have emergency surgery. I was
put on intravenous antibiotics and had to

00:40:01.283 --> 00:40:06.040
have emergency surgery. Because that can not
only eat your joint it can kill you dead.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.090
So I would say that was probably one of my
more

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.170
[laughter]

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:14.430
"Don't try this at home. Not recommended to
my readers," mistake. And I did put that in

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.651
the book because I don't people to get trigger
happy with injections and things like that.

00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:18.651
They can be really serious.

00:40:18.651 --> 00:40:19.651
[pause]

00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:23.180
&gt;&gt;female #3: Tell us a little bit about your
feelings around the amount of sleep

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.180
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Um.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.040
&gt;&gt;female #3: that you get. I thought I heard
some comment around like two hours of sleep?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: Um-hum.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.760
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So sleep; my opinions on sleep.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.390
My opinions on sleep depend on how many sessions
of sleep you get per day.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.910
So most people in this room will be familiar
with what's called "monophasic sleep;" that's

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.140
just go to bed, wake up. You get one session
of sleep.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.089
If you're doing that or speaking from a personal
basis, if I'm doing that, I like to get 9

00:40:49.089 --> 00:40:52.540
to 10 hours of sleep. I sleep a lot.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.680
If, on the other hand, you're doing what's
called polyphasic sleep, where you break it

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.720
up into multiple segments per day. And that
can be taken to an extreme in something called

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:07.010
Uberman, which is I believe two and a half
hours of total sleep per day which is comprised

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.880
of 20 minute naps. [laughs] Not terribly social
as you can imagine.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.809
[laughter]

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:16.240
That can be sustained. And there's a lot of
debate about this; there are long articles

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.480
online about why it's impossible.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.460
I can't divulge it yet, but I can say right
now I'm using along with a few other groups

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.640
some pretty sophisticated equipment to demonstrate
that it is possible. We're tracking people

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.050
using EEG's while they sleep on Uberman.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.170
So it can be done. Should you do it? That's
a separate question.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.460
For most people it's gonna be completely untenable
and unsustainable. But there are people like

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.170
Matt Mullenweg, usually called the lead developer
or one of the lead developers of WordPress.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.500
And while he was working on WordPress he had
his most productive year of coding; probably

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:56.359
produced, I'm just speculating here, but 60%
of the WordPress code in one year and he was

00:41:56.359 --> 00:41:57.359
following Uberman.

00:41:57.359 --> 00:42:00.270
To most people if you feel like you have to
sleep two hours a day to get more done, I

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.180
would say let's look at the time management
[laughs] first before we start cutting you

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.490
back to two hours.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.579
But those would be my feelings.

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:07.579
[pause]

00:42:07.579 --> 00:42:09.849
&gt;&gt;female #4: I'm a runner and I like run in
the morning

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:10.849
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:13.369
&gt;&gt;female #4: but I don't want to eat breakfast
before running.

00:42:13.369 --> 00:42:14.369
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:17.390
&gt;&gt;female #4: What do you recommend that I
eat protein right after [inaudible] ?

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.390
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.390
&gt;&gt;female #4: but [inaudible].

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.000
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So if you're going to; the
question was I'm a runner, I don't like to

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.330
eat before I run. What's the distance?

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.900
&gt;&gt;female #4: Like six miles a day.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.369
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Six miles; alright.

00:42:30.369 --> 00:42:34.530
What I would suggest, if possible, it depends
on why you're running. If you're training

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.280
from competition it's one answer; if you're
doing it for, let's say, general fitness and

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.780
fat loss it'd be another answer.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.380
But I would say that if you're consuming a
very quickly digested protein like whey protein,

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:50.000
whey protein isolate, it shouldn't cause too
much stomach upset.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000
If you don't want to eat prior to your workout
then, and you're doing it for training, I

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.970
would suggest consuming either during the
run or after a carbohydrate supplement like

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:09.760
Vitargo S2, which is a waxy maize starch which
will help you to replenish your glycogen,

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.440
particularly if you're following a diet that's
Paleo or Slow Carb or something like that.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.760
Otherwise, if you wanna get extra fat loss
out of it you could just have a double espresso

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.930
before you go running.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:23.619
But the cold water will also help quite a
lot.

00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:27.690
So if you're doing it for fat loss or body
composition or recomposition purposes, 500

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.310
milliliters of ice water will do wonders.
I kid you not. It's pretty astounding the

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.230
difference that it makes.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.230
[pause]

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:44.280
&gt;&gt;male #3: So fat loss [inaudible] nice because
you can have dietary [unintellgible] intervention

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.960
as a result of [inaudible].

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:57.540
So I was wondering what your research turned
out regarding HDL, LDL [inaudible].

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.740
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.950
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:04.160
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.369
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:08.579
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Um-hum.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.790
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:15.599
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Whew! This is a big question.
[laughs]

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:18.579
Very important question.

00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:21.559
The question, correct me if I get this incorrect.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:28.300
With dietary interventions, or I should say
with body fat loss or muscular gain, it's

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.700
very easy to see the short term consequences
or outcomes.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.109
With something like cardiovascular health
or disease it's quite a bit harder because

00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:38.530
you can look at the short term effects which
could be quite divergent from the long term

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.530
effects.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:43.250
And what's my opinion or what are my theories
on cardiovascular health?

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:49.910
So the first I would say is that cardiovascular
is a good word to use. Aerobic is usually

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.950
co-opted by people trying to sell you something.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.170
So like aerobics versus aerobic are very different.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:59.300
You actually get a fantastic aerobic if we're
looking at the pathways workout after resistance

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.501
training when you're body's trying to clear
lactate and so forth; it's actually a fantastic

00:45:02.501 --> 00:45:07.900
[laughs] aerobic workout usually called "after
burn" so post-workout oxygen consumption things

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.020
like that.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.750
As far as cardiovascular health goes, there's
no consensus. That's part of the problem.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:23.099
And my position, at the moment, is that it
is important to look at the sub-fractions

00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:28.170
of, let's say, LDL or HDL. Berkeley Heart
Labs, I believe, does a very comprehensive

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.569
fractionated analysis.

00:45:30.569 --> 00:45:35.450
But as with any type of data gathering the
problem is, "Okay. Well that's fine, but now

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.000
what do I do."

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.950
And my suggestion to most people is if you're
getting your fat from good sources, meaning

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:51.670
if it's an animal product the animals are
eating the feed they were intended to eat.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.700
Or coconut milk, let's say; but not all coconut
milk is good for you and you have to look

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.910
at your ingredient list.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:01.820
If you're consuming high quality fats as long
as you're not spiking your insulin levels

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:07.599
at the same time by consuming lots of carbohydrates,
I think it has a minimal effect; minimal negative

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:15.319
effect, if any, on cardiovascular, meaning
arterial health or blood vessel health.

00:46:15.319 --> 00:46:16.690
That's my position at the moment.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.560
So I've been following this diet for the last
seven years. Not to say that because as of

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.520
an end of one it works for me, it'll work
for everybody.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.960
But looking at the blood tests, again I'm
not a doctor, I don't play one on the Internet,

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.210
but having looked at a lot of blood tests
longitudinally, I think as long as you separate

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:36.180
the carbohydrates from the protein and fats,
for the most part, then you're fine.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.400
That's been my experience thus far, but I'm
not a cardiologist.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:46.270
&gt;&gt;male #4: This is kind of a follow up to
that question which is: are you aware of the

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.880
published research on successfully reversing
heart disease, reversing diabetes, and slowing

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.920
down the growth of prostate cancer?

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.500
And I ask because the dietary recommendations
are precisely the opposite of what you have

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.829
in your book which is the recommendation that
you increase whole grains and starches; increase

00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:09.080
fruit and vegetable consumption; and probably
you both would agree on fats so.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.790
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: So I would say, I appreciate
that.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:16.530
The first thing is you should be skeptical
about everything that I say. I don't want

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.711
anyone to take my word for anything. And I
would say look at the data.

00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:25.569
So while we're talking about published research,
I would also say that not all published research

00:47:25.569 --> 00:47:33.460
equal. And in many of the, I'm not gonna name
names 'cause there's no purpose to it, but

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:39.180
in many of the multi-variable tests that show
reversal of heart disease, they're also doing

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:43.880
Yoga, they're also doing therapy, they're
also doing exercise, and then they have a

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.390
diet with grains. And they say, "Well, told
ya. It was the diet with grains."

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.569
And I think that's bad science.

00:47:49.569 --> 00:47:53.799
So they're not controlling their variable
sufficiently in most of the tests.

00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:57.609
What I would say is if anyone's interested
in looking at this topic in depth, read what

00:47:57.609 --> 00:48:02.549
Gary Taubes has written; meticulously researched;
Good Calories, Bad Calories or Why We Get

00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:06.760
Fat: And What To Do About It, which is his
most recent book. If you want to look at the

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:13.230
role of carbohydrates in endocrine health
and also as it relates to disease states.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:19.000
If you have the patience and concentration
for it, Good Calories, Bad Calories has probably

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.540
100 pages just on the role of carbohydrates
in cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:28.869
I have seen people, I know a mother in particular
who reversed Type I diabetes in two of her

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:35.020
children. And she did it by eliminating carbohydrates.
In every other attempt up to that point using

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:40.030
what most people label as complex carbohydrates,
it had precisely the opposite effect.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:47.549
And most recently, I know another woman; one
of her children is in ketosis or potentially

00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:52.900
ketoacidosis. I'm waiting to hear what the
doctor's verdict is. And complex carbs; [snaps

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.420
finger] diabetic coma, like that.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:00.400
So I think that based on the data I've seen
at least, the safest bet is removing any type

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.460
of refined carbohydrates or carbohydrates
that have been introduced into industrial

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.250
agriculture in the last 10,000 years.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:08.260
It's just my experience.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.370
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yeah, I think we agree on refined
carbohydrates being bad.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:18.130
But Good Calories, Bad Calories has a lot
of omission of key science. For example, it

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.420
doesn't address the fact that the entire nation
of China lives on primarily carbohydrates

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:26.010
and they have a much lower rate of heart disease
and diabetes than we have here.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.670
He just doesn't deal with that in his book.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.710
So if you omit key data?

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:34.830
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: I don't think, I would say
that we should invite Gary and you can take

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:36.720
him up on it. Gary would be happy to debate.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.490
But what I would say is that gluten and rice
are very different, number one.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:46.140
Number two, if you look at the disease states
as recorded in China and the data gathering

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:50.470
is not very good in China. I'm very familiar
with The China Study, the monograph, the original

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:55.170
monograph not the book, which I think is largely
propaganda.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:58.329
I think that we'll see a lot of changes in
China if they're not occurring already.

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:04.299
But, needless to say, I think it's an area
worth a lot of additional research, but just

00:50:04.299 --> 00:50:10.609
based on everything that I've seen, that I've
measured directly and watched, omitting carbohydrates

00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:17.180
is, and not all carbohydrates, but omitting
grains, starches; I have yet to see any negative

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.180
impact from that.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.240
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yeah, thanks for the response.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.651
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks for
the question.

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.299
[pause]

00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:37.510
&gt;&gt;female #4: So the event description had
a bullet point that said something about 15

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:38.510
minute female orgasm?

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.510
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferris: [laughs]

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.510
[laughter]

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:41.510
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible]

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.510
[laughter]

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:43.510
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: I'll give you your $50 bill
later. Thank you for bringing that up. I thought

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.510
we might miss it.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.510
[laughter]

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.819
Right. So, [laughs] 15 minute female orgasm.
[sighs] Where to begin with this?

00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:49.849
[laughter]

00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:56.180
So this chapter, it's actually two chapters,
were included at the request of female friends

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.339
and female readers.

00:50:57.339 --> 00:51:01.930
The book was originally gonna be titled, Becoming
Superhuman and it was gonna focus on muscular

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.400
gain and fat loss and that was it.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.721
And what happened was looking at limiters
of muscular hypertrophy pretty quickly you

00:51:10.721 --> 00:51:11.721
have to look at testosterone.

00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:15.619
So I was looking at testosterone; did a number
of experiments; tripled my testosterone; that

00:51:15.619 --> 00:51:19.740
has a number of interesting positive sexual
side effects.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:26.380
And so I was talking about this with a number
of my friends over dinner; two of them were

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.450
female and they're like, "What is this, a
dude's club? [laughs] Why aren't you gonna

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.869
write about anything that has to do with female
sexuality."

00:51:31.869 --> 00:51:32.869
Okay.

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:41.290
So I looked into it and I was amazed at how
problematic sex is for a very high percentage

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:46.079
of women in terms of, how explicit can I get
here, pretty explicit?

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.079
In terms of

00:51:47.079 --> 00:51:48.079
[laughter]

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:53.960
Let's say, let's just say what most people
would consider the involuntary contractions

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.089
that characterize vaginal orgasm through intercourse.

00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:57.580
&gt;&gt;female in audience: How's it?

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.580
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Everybody okay?

00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.770
[laughter]

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:00.980
Okay.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.190
[laughter]

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:05.280
Very problematic. It has a lot to do with
the distance, well I'm not gonna even get

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.280
into it.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.280
But

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.280
[laughter]

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280
Anyway.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.369
I guess I lost my composure there for a second.
[laughs; clears throat]

00:52:13.369 --> 00:52:19.010
So let me give one, but where I'm going with
this is, sex is a very sensitive topic in

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:20.069
the U.S.

00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:24.200
I was told by a number of morning shows in
the U.S., very popular morning shows that

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.210
have had me on as a guest before and were
very happy, "We'd love to have you on, but

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.369
we can't because you have sex in the subtitle."

00:52:30.369 --> 00:52:35.920
And that, I think, has led to a lot of broken
relationships. Sex makes or breaks relationships;

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.820
makes or breaks marriages. Therefore, makes
or breaks families. I think it's a very important

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.030
topic.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:47.760
Your choices, if you want to self-educate,
are usually I'm gonna go to some fairly strange

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.890
cult-like environment where it's like worshipping
the Goddess Noonie, which most people don't

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:52.890
want to do.

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:57.089
Or I can deal with this very nebulous sexual
advice that's based on a book, that's based

00:52:57.089 --> 00:53:00.299
on a book, that's based on a book. There's
no testing.

00:53:00.299 --> 00:53:04.180
So the 15 minute orgasm I set out to sacrifice
myself for science.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.690
[laughter]

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:12.410
to identify what best practices, what techniques
could be used that would have the highest

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.780
success rate.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.049
I'm not gonna go too far into this, but for
those interested, how can I do this?

00:53:18.049 --> 00:53:19.049
[pause]

00:53:19.049 --> 00:53:25.069
Let's say this is a clock face. Alright, so
this is a clock face. And that clock face

00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:28.310
represents the clitoris if you're looking
at it from between the legs.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.790
[laughter]

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:34.349
On, I would say, 95 plus percent of women
the most sensitive part is gonna be between

00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:36.430
1:00 and 1:30. Okay?

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.730
Look on Twitter if you don't think this works.
[laughs]

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:46.190
It sounds like some hocus pocus nonsense and
I'll just leave you with that so.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.220
Very important topic and I think that for
many people the sex and the sleep will have

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.210
the greatest impact on quality of life.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:57.581
I'll answer follow up questions, but unprompted
I don't wanna go into all the [laughs] particulars.

00:53:57.581 --> 00:53:58.581
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [inaudible]

00:53:58.581 --> 00:54:02.200
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: Yep.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.200
Oh, one more question? Okay.

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200
&gt;&gt;female #5: So I'm trying to just look from
diet so do you have any advice for people

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200
who are vegan versus [inaudible]

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:14.990
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: No, I, okay.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:18.770
So the question was can you follow The Slow
Carb Diet if you're a vegan.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:19.790
The answer is yes.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:26.990
So there are two appendices in the book called
The Meatless Machine I and II and I do profile

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:32.609
Mark who, Mark Bozeman, who is a vegan and
followed The Slow Carb Diet.

00:54:32.609 --> 00:54:37.099
And you can move that direction; you will
most likely have to supplement with different

00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:38.970
types of protein.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:46.089
It's challenging and the reason it's challenging
is that you will very often end up including

00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:49.490
things that I would prefer be avoided like
soy.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:51.280
[pause]

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:57.760
I think soy, soy milk, isolated soy is extremely
risky as an endocrine disrupter. And if you

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.119
look at reproductive specialists at different
centers, there's one in Edinborough who's

00:55:02.119 --> 00:55:06.340
name escapes me at the moment, but he said,
"Until I see data that refutes everything

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:11.150
I have seen I will not feed soy to my children,
specifically because of the effect on reproductive

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.150
health."

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:17.530
It can be done; it can be done. And I do have
readers who have done it successfully.

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:21.900
What I would say is take another look at the
Meatless Machine chapters in the appendices

00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:29.960
and then also go to the blog post that catalyzed
this entire thing, which is just how to lose

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.010
20 pounds in 30 days without exercise [chuckles]
on my blog.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.230
There are 4,000 comments or 5,000 comments
so just search "vegan" and I think you'll

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.940
probably find a number of suggestions there
as well.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.099
&gt;&gt;female #5: Thank you.

00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:43.270
&gt;&gt;Tim Ferriss: You're welcome.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:50.530
It's made a lot easier if you do make the
allowance to have let's say whey protein or

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:57.270
cottage cheese or eggs, let's just say, with
yokes. It makes a big different; it's a lot

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.270
easier.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.650
But if you if you're not willing to do that,
which is a personal decision, I would just

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:01.650
say to look at the comments as well.

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.240
[pause]

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.050
Okay, I think that's it guys. I'll hang out
for a little bit longer if people have questions.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.050
Thank you for coming.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.890
[applause]
