00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.770
There are two different kinds
of in-game currency you can

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.680
use to purchase in-app items,
soft currency and hard currency.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.390
Soft currency is easy to get and
is often used to pay for

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.940
consumables, whereas hard currency
is more difficult to get and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.130
is used to get rare items or
entitlements.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090
Soft currency is easy to get
because it's very grindable.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.450
And grindable just means that you can
play parts of the game like levels or

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.470
mini games over and
over again to accumulate soft currency.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.400
So the more time you
spend playing a game,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.060
the more soft currency
you slowly accumulate.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.390
One example of this is
Fruit Ninja's starfruit currency.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.610
Players accumulate starfruit
over time as they play the game.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.620
And once they save up enough, they can
use these starfruits to buy consumables

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.200
like bomb deflects or game power-ups.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.170
Hard currency is between real money and
soft currency.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.270
It's difficult to earn and can also
usually be bought with real money.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630
Like we mentioned before,
it's often used to pay for

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.970
entitlements or other rare items.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.330
In Fruit Ninja golden
apples are hard currency.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.310
You can only earn them by
paying real money for them or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520
by watching offer wall adds.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.340
These apples are used to unlock
levels in tournament challenges.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.540
So if you want a fun
multiplayer challenge,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.270
you'll have to pay hard currency for
that entitlement.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.820
Let's look at some other
examples of in-game currencies.
