00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.300
Filming a show
like "Hostile Planet"

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.667
comes with a lot of
unique challenges.

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.266
Check out this from
"Behind the Scenes."

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.300
OK, ready?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the aims
of "Hostile Planet"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.133
was to try and
immerse the viewer

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.600
in the world of the animals.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.467
You want to film something
people haven't seen before

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.066
or film it in a
new surprising way,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.467
which is going to be difficult.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:21.633
[chirping]

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:26.767
We went to the heart
of Ecuadorian Andes

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.934
to film hummingbirds.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.200
That's nice.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.467
We spent four weeks
out there, filming

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:38.767
12 hours a day, every
day, just to capture

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.066
this hummingbird sequence.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.967
That's the one.

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:42.166
I think it looks great.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.667
But it's really
challenging to capture

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:49.200
how a hummingbird moves,
because you can barely see it.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.367
So this is a Phantom
high-speed camera.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.433
It's one of the cameras that
can record almost as fast

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:56.867
as the hummingbirds can fly.

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:59.567
And what we've done is
we've suspended this rather

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.667
expensive camera from a rope.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.667
And we've created a little
hummingbird paradise here.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.734
And the idea is that we
can just move the camera.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:13.200
And so we get that feeling of
flying with the hummingbirds.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.834
That's very nice.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.200
It's super sharp.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.433
That may sound easy.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:21.100
The shot's over
in half a second.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.166
This camera allows us to
take that half a second

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.767
and stretch out into 30.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.333
[motor buzzing]

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.233
We also wanted to
give the perspective

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.300
of what it's like
to be a hummingbird

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.800
flying through the forest.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.700
So we got this racing drone
pilot to go out with us

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.834
and fly his really
fast 4 agile drone

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.000
dodging between the trees.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.166
He came for five days.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:57.700
And for the first two
days, it rained solidly.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.066
And you were just thinking,
how can we get the sequence?

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.633
But we got inventive.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.200
You'll see the very expert
taping around the whole drone,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.700
just to keep the
water out, because it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.934
just keeps on pouring.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.834
And then we had to build
a little roof for it.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.467
Isn't she a beauty?

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.734
Water dripping
everywhere, so you

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.667
think you got the
most perfect shot,

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.734
and there's this splash
of water on your lens.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:23.400
And it's like, ugh!

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.433
After a while, we
actually realized

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.567
that that looked really good.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.967
It made you feel immersed
in this environment in a way

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:33.400
the clean image wouldn't.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:38.633
[chittering]

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:41.367
We entered the
project with the idea

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.800
that we were going
to try and push

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.066
things as much as possible.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.266
[wings beating]

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.066
I know what we're trying to do.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.200
And I'm seeing the raw footage.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.800
And I'm going,
that's incredible.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.800
That's when you know it's going
to work I hope you'll be blown

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.834
away, because I know I was.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:57.834
