00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:10.800
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.570
I’ve always thought of myself as a hands
on kind of learner.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.970
I learn better when I can DO things with what
I’ve learned.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.980
That’s why experiments are one of my favorite
parts about science classes.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.690
You get to test what you’ve learned by applying
it!

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.831
Meshing is the idea that a teacher should
match their teaching style for a kid’s individual

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:26.990
learning style.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.600
Like using flash cards for those who are visual
learners!

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.650
Basically, treat kids like the special snowflakes
they are and poof!

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.390
All their school troubles will go away!

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.050
Buuuuuuuut not so fast.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.280
The topic of learning styles is super complicated.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.300
I mean there’s supposedly a lot of learning
styles out there.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.560
One study from the Learning and Skills Research
Centre in London found over 70 different types.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.579
Most of these are constructed as dichotomous
with opposing concepts, like visual learners

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.579
vs auditory.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.579
That sort of thing.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.960
So it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly what
we mean when we talk about learning styles.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.420
That’s the first problem.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.280
Another problem, There’s not a lot of empirical
evidence to support learning styles.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.769
Sure it’s been studied, but most studies
weren’t well designed.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.119
A 2009 study published in the journal Psychological
Science in the Public Interest found a “lack

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.280
of methodologically sound studies of learning
styles”.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.940
The authors looked for a rigorous approach
to testing the validity of claims that learning

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.940
styles matter.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.850
They laid down requirements for a thorough
investigation.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.920
Divide people up based on their supposed learning
style, randomly assign them whatever method

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.100
of instruction, then test all the students.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.630
Basically the authors were looking for an
experiment that “revealed a specific type

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.460
of interaction between learning style and
instructional method”.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.900
The students who were assigned their preferred
method should perform better on the test.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.810
They looked at lots of different studies and
found that lots of people will proclaim some

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.930
type of preferred educational experience.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.470
But what they found was nilch.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.470
Nada.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.130
Basically of all the studies that are out
there, most rely on self-reporting for determining

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.130
someone’s learning style.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.170
Self reporting… really isn’t the most
scientifically rigorous.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.729
Those studies that were somewhat better had
contradicting results.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.880
but that’s not so say it’s totally junk.The
researchers even caution that they aren’t

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.540
saying the same manner of instruction works
for all students in all situations.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.190
People do differ in personality, temperament,
and ability, no one is doubting that.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.849
Treating students as individuals probably
won’t hurt them.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.779
So the best way to teach a subject?

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.010
Well depends on the subject.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.590
The authors of the study use the example of
teaching writing.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.180
Of course it’s going to be a heavily verbal
course.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.980
And something like geometry is going to use
a lot of visuals to aid in learning.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.599
As for the best way to teach a student?

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.560
Well one study published in the journal Educational
Psychologist found that people who are new

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
to a subject learn differently than those
who have more expertise.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.810
In what’s called the “Expertise Reversal
Effect”, learning something new can overwhelming

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.329
someone’s working memory, they don’t have
any prior experience or knowledge to draw

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.400
upon, so they need more guidance.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.099
On the other hand, those who are experts or
more knowledgeable about a subject might be

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.329
harmed by too much guidance.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.689
People without a lot of experience learn better
by looking at examples and those with more

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.529
experience need to be more hands on, it’s
better for them if they solve problems by

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:55.569
themselves.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.519
Other studies show that engaging students
is the best way to go.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.049
One study published in the journal Science
found that a way to teach called “deliberate

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.209
practice” helped students do twice as well
on a test and increased attendance by 20%!

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.209
The trick?

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.710
This practice relies less on lectures and
focuses more on the students.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.749
Students are first asked what they know about
a subject in a short multiple choice test

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.529
and they are encouraged to discuss what they
think they know with other students, then

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.529
once the teacher understands what the students
know or might actually be wrong about, they

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.839
are better able to deal with it and addresses
those problems directly.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.279
I mean I’d much rather a teacher get right
to the stuff I have questions about than spend

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.519
whole boring class periods going over material
I understand.

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.949
And really, learning is so hard anyways, all
that over-thinking actually makes it more

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:45.319
difficult to learn, Crystal has the scoop
on that, in this episode right here.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:55.180
So what do you think?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.079
What’s your favorite way to learn?

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.759
