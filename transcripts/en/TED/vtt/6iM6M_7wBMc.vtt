00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.360
Hello. I'd like to show you guys
30 seconds of the best day of my life.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.240
(Applause)

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.416
So that was El Capitan
in California's Yosemite National Park,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.976
and in case you couldn't tell,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.016
I was climbing by myself without a rope,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.696
a style of a climbing
known as free soloing.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.336
That was the culmination
of a nearly decade-long dream,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.976
and in the video I'm over
2,500 feet off the ground.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.536
Seems scary? Yeah, it is,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.576
which is why I spent so many years
dreaming about soloing El Cap

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.856
and not actually doing it.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.016
But on the day that that video was taken,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.616
it didn't feel scary at all.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.376
It felt as comfortable and natural
as a walk in the park,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.376
which is what most folks
were doing in Yosemite that day.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.536
Today I'd like to talk about
how I was able to feel so comfortable

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.896
and how I overcame my fear.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.896
I'll start with a very brief version
of how I became a climber,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.856
and then tell the story
of my two most significant free solos.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.216
They were both successful,
which is why I'm here.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.456
(Laughter)

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.976
But the first felt largely unsatisfying,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
whereas the second, El Cap, was by far
the most fulfilling day of my life.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.976
Through these two climbs,
you'll see my process for managing fear.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.936
So I started climbing in a gym
when I was around 10 years old,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.496
which means that my life
has been centered on climbing

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.736
for more than 20 years.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.096
After nearly a decade
of climbing mostly indoors,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.576
I made the transition to the outdoors
and gradually started free soloing.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.136
I built up my comfort over time

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.656
and slowly took on
bigger and more challenging walls.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.016
And there have been
many free soloists before me,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.136
so I had plenty of
inspiration to draw from.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.296
But by 2008, I'd repeated
most of their previous solos in Yosemite

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.856
and was starting to imagine
breaking into new terrain.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.776
The obvious first choice was Half Dome,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.066
an iconic 2,000-foot wall that
lords over the east end of the valley.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.256
The problem, though also the allure,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.696
was that it was too big.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.656
I didn't really know how to prepare
for a potential free solo.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.496
So I decided to skip the preparations

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.136
and just go up there
and have an adventure.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.056
I figured I would rise to the occasion,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.480
which, unsurprisingly,
was not the best strategy.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.136
I did at least climb the route
roped up with a friend two days before

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.496
just to make sure
that I knew roughly where to go

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.176
and that I could physically do it.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.376
But when I came back
by myself two days later,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.496
I decided that I didn't
want to go that way.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.536
I knew that there was a 300-foot variation

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.296
that circled around
one of the hardest parts of the climb.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.336
I suddenly decided to skip the hard part
and take the variation,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.296
even though I'd never climbed it before,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.256
but I immediately began to doubt myself.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.656
Imagine being by yourself
in the dead center of a 2,000-foot face,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.920
wondering if you're lost.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.816
(Laughter)

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.136
Thankfully, it was
pretty much the right way

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.136
and I circled back to the route.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.696
I was slightly rattled,
I was pretty rattled,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.536
but I tried not to let it
bother me too much

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.536
because I knew that all the hardest
climbing was up at the top.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.976
I needed to stay composed.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.936
It was a beautiful September morning,
and as I climbed higher,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.376
I could hear the sounds of tourists
chatting and laughing on the summit.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.736
They'd all hiked up
the normal trail on the back,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.896
which I was planning on using
for my descent.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.656
But between me and the summit
lay a blank slab of granite.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.776
There were no cracks
or edges to hold on to,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.016
just small ripples of texture
up a slightly less than vertical wall.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.056
I had to trust my life to the friction
between my climbing shoes

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.376
and the smooth granite.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.096
I carefully balanced my way upward,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.896
shifting my weight back and forth
between the small smears.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.576
But then I reached a foothold
that I didn't quite trust.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.016
Two days ago, I'd have just
stepped right up on it,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.945
but that would have been with a rope on.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.856
Now it felt too small and too slippery.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.416
I doubted that my foot
would stay on if I weighted it.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.296
I considered a foot further to the side,
which seemed worse.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.576
I switched my feet and tried
a foot further out.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.816
It seemed even worse.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.056
I started to panic.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.776
I could hear people laughing
on the summit just above me.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.936
I wanted to be anywhere but on that slab.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.816
My mind was racing in every direction.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.456
I knew what I had to do,
but I was too afraid to do it.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.576
I just had to stand up on my right foot.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.976
And so after what felt like an eternity,
I accepted what I had to do

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.736
and I stood up on the right foot,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.736
and it didn't slip, and so I didn't die,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.256
and that move marked the end
of the hardest climbing.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.936
And so I charged from there
towards the summit.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.016
And so normally when you summit Half Dome,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.496
you have a rope and a bunch
of climbing gear on you,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.136
and tourists gasp and they
flock around you for photos.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.016
This time I popped over the edge
shirtless, panting, jacked.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.096
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.080
(Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.736
I looked like a lost hiker
that was too close to the edge.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.736
I was surrounded by people
talking on cell phones and having picnics.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.136
I felt like I was in a mall.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.296
(Laughter)

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.336
I took off my tight climbing shoes
and started hiking back down,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.016
and that's when people stopped me.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.336
"You're hiking barefoot?
That's so hard-core."

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.640
(Laughter)

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.016
I didn't bother to explain,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.896
but that night in my climbing journal,
I duly noted my free solo of Half Dome,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.200
but I included a frowny face
and a comment, "Do better?"

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.376
I'd succeeded in the solo

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.736
and it was celebrated
as a big first in climbing.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.696
Some friends later made a film about it.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.296
But I was unsatisfied.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.136
I was disappointed in my performance,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.656
because I knew that I had
gotten away with something.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.896
I didn't want to be a lucky climber.
I wanted to be a great climber.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.656
I actually took the next year or so
off from free soloing,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.696
because I knew that I shouldn't
make a habit of relying on luck.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.736
But even though
I wasn't soloing very much,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.776
I'd already started to think about El Cap.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.256
It was always in the back of my mind
as the obvious crown jewel of solos.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.616
It's the most striking wall in the world.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.696
Each year, for the next seven years,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.616
I'd think, "This is the year
that I'm going to solo El Cap."

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.896
And then I would drive into Yosemite,
look up at the wall, and think,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.176
"No frickin' way."

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.056
(Laughter)

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.656
It's too big and too scary.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.416
But eventually I came to accept that
I wanted to test myself against El Cap.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.616
It represented true mastery,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.336
but I needed it to feel different.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.216
I didn't want to get away with anything
or barely squeak by.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.880
This time I wanted to do it right.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.336
The thing that makes El Cap
so intimidating

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.976
is the sheer scale of the wall.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.816
Most climbers take three to five days

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.696
to ascend the 3,000 feet
of vertical granite.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.896
The idea of setting out
up a wall of that size

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.216
with nothing but shoes and
a chalk bag seemed impossible.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.856
3,000 feet of climbing represents

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.056
thousands of distinct
hand and foot movements,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.416
which is a lot to remember.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.816
Many of the moves I knew
through sheer repetition.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.416
I'd climbed El Cap maybe 50 times
over the previous decade with a rope.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.536
But this photo shows my preferred
method of rehearsing the moves.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.776
I'm on the summit,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.736
about to rappel down the face
with over a thousand feet of rope

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.296
to spend the day practicing.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.896
Once I found sequences
that felt secure and repeatable,

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:09.026
I had to memorize them.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.026
I had to make sure that they were
so deeply ingrained within me

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.926
that there was no possibility of error.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.856
I didn't want to be wondering
if I was going the right way

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.096
or using the best holds.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.976
I needed everything to feel automatic.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.376
Climbing with a rope
is a largely physical effort.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.976
You just have to be strong enough
to hold on and make the movements upward.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.096
But free soloing
plays out more in the mind.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.056
The physical effort is largely the same.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.096
Your body is still climbing the same wall.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.376
But staying calm
and performing at your best

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.616
when you know that
any mistake could mean death

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.776
requires a certain kind of mindset.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.376
(Laughter)

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.896
That's not supposed to be funny,
but if it is, it is.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.176
(Laughter)

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.976
I worked to cultivate that mindset
through visualization,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.176
which basically just means imagining
the entire experience of soloing the wall.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.736
Partially, that was to help me
remember all the holds,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.296
but mostly visualization
was about feeling the texture

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.536
of each hold in my hand

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.296
and imagining the sensation of my leg
reaching out and placing my foot just so.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.896
I'd imagine it all like a choreographed
dance thousands of feet up.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.416
The most difficult part of the whole route
was called the Boulder Problem.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.296
It was about 2,000 feet off the ground

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.296
and consisted of the hardest
physical moves on the whole route:

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.496
long pulls between poor handholds
with very small, slippery feet.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.416
This is what I mean by a poor handhold:

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.616
an edge smaller than the width
of a pencil but facing downward

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.136
that I had to press up into with my thumb.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.016
But that wasn't even the hardest part.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.776
The crux culminated in a karate kick

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.616
with my left foot over to the inside
of an adjacent corner,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.856
a maneuver that required a high degree
of precision and flexibility,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.616
enough so that I'd been doing
a nightly stretching routine

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.056
for a full year ahead of time

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.176
to make sure that I could comfortably
make the reach with my leg.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.456
As I practiced the moves,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.895
my visualization turned
to the emotional component

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.376
of a potential solo.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.176
Basically, what if I got up there
and it was too scary?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.496
What if I was too tired?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.378
What if I couldn't quite make the kick?

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.656
I had to consider every possibility
while I was safely on the ground,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.376
so that when the time came and I was
actually making the moves without a rope,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.336
there was no room for doubt to creep in.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.836
Doubt is the precursor to fear,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.256
and I knew that I couldn't experience
my perfect moment if I was afraid.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.096
I had to visualize and rehearse
enough to remove all doubt.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.576
But beyond that, I also
visualized how it would feel

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.336
if it never seemed doable.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.400
What if, after so much work,
I was afraid to try?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.936
What if I was wasting my time

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.296
and I would never feel comfortable
in such an exposed position?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.656
There were no easy answers,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.416
but El Cap meant enough to me
that I would put in the work and find out.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.656
Some of my preparations were more mundane.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.816
This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.496
climbing up the bottom of El Cap
with an empty backpack.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.176
We spent the day climbing together

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.336
to a specific crack
in the middle of the wall

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.936
that was choked with loose rocks

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.776
that made that section
difficult and potentially dangerous,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.456
because any missed step
might knock a rock to the ground

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.216
and kill a passing climber or hiker.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.096
So we carefully removed the rocks,
loaded them into the pack

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.376
and rappelled back down.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.656
Take a second to imagine
how ridiculous it feels

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.896
to climb 1,500 feet up a wall
just to fill a backpack full of rocks.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.536
(Laughter)

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.296
It's never that easy to carry
a pack full of rocks around.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.256
It's even harder on the side of a cliff.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.776
It may have felt silly,
but it still had to get done.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.496
I needed everything to feel perfect

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.096
if I was ever going to climb
the route without a rope.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.936
After two seasons of working specifically
toward a potential free solo of El Cap,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.856
I finally finished all my preparations.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.406
I knew every handhold
and foothold on the whole route,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.856
and I knew exactly what to do.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.336
Basically, I was ready.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.880
It was time to solo El Cap.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.936
On June 3, 2017,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.176
I woke up early, ate my usual
breakfast of muesli and fruit

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.656
and made it to the base
of the wall before sunrise.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.656
I felt confident as I looked up the wall.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.640
I felt even better as I started climbing.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.576
About 500 feet up, I reached a slab

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.936
very similar to the one that had
given me so much trouble on Half Dome,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.416
but this time was different.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.016
I'd scouted every option, including
hundreds of feet of wall to either side.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.336
I knew exactly what to do
and how to do it.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.680
I had no doubts.
I just climbed right through.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.536
Even the difficult and strenuous
sections passed by with ease.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.480
I was perfectly executing my routine.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.856
I rested for a moment
below the Boulder Problem

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.456
and then climbed it just as I had
practiced so many times with the rope on.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.496
My foot shot across to the wall
on the left without hesitation,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.960
and I knew that I had done it.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.776
Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.016
and I did it,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.896
but I didn't get what I really wanted.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.216
I didn't achieve mastery.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.896
I was hesitant and afraid, and it wasn't
the experience that I wanted.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.576
But El Cap was different.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.336
With 600 feet to go, I felt like the
mountain was offering me a victory lap.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.976
I climbed with a smooth precision

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.936
and enjoyed the sounds of the birds
swooping around the cliff.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.456
It all felt like a celebration.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.896
And then I reached the summit

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.456
after three hours and 56 minutes
of glorious climbing.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.176
It was the climb that I wanted,
and it felt like mastery.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.416
Thank you.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.720
(Applause)
