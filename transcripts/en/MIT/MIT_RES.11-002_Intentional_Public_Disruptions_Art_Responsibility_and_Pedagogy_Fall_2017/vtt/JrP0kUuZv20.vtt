STEPHEN CARPENTER: I thought
these three questions could be

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.915
part of our conversation later.

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:09.967
I want us to get up and
actually create a public work.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:11.550
But I've been thinking
about how might

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.560
contemporary art
and social practice

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.930
enable conversations
about difficult subjects?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.650
And that's part of what
we're interested in.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.150
Couldn't that be the
focus of a curriculum?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.860
A multi-week, a
multi-session unit

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.020
of instruction with
learners of a range of ages

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.210
and in the range of spaces.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.287
Or why prepare
teachers as agents

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.370
of positive social change?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.080
I mean, some people say, oh, we
have to prepare them for that,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.104
but why?

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:42.270
What would come out of that?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850
Or why not, right?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.600
What does it mean?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.974
Maybe the question
should be what

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:48.890
does it mean for
teachers to be prepared

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.010
as agents for social change?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.270
Some of you are studying in
departments or programs, where

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.780
social change, social activism,
positive social responsibility

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.390
is central to the mission.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.730
Why do that?

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.780
Is that such a good thing?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.240
Or how can creative
responses to social injustice

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.160
interrupt conditions
of inequality?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.540
We might not be
able to change them.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.910
Might not be able to stop them.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.190
But maybe it interrupts
it just long enough

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.800
to reposition or find
other ways, other tactics,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.610
other approaches to engage.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.110
I think this is a
good time to stop.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.620
And let's get up, and let's
make some public trouble.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.330
I brought with me
some children's books.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.920
And I also brought
some children's toys.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.290
How many of you
brought cellphones?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.600
How many of those
cellphones take pictures?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.530
Oh, yeah.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.330
Now we can work as individuals.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.520
We can work in pairs
or trios, if we want.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.260
All right?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.970
I have some
children's books here.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.220
I'll share them--
show these to you.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.760
Not all of them deal with
uncomfortable stories.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.256
Some of them do.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:02.380
There's a whole range of
things, like Flat Stanley.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.550
I don't know if you know
of the Flat Stanley.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.415
To me, there's a Henry
Box Brown deal here,

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:07.540
where you can mail individuals
to different places.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.940
Here, he's pretty happy about
going to visit his family.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.550
But Henry couldn't do that.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.980
Or The Big Orange Splot,
this is about one house

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.500
being different.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
And then I won't ruin the
story for you at the end,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.437
but it's about
finding your own way.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.020
Little Blue and
Little Yellow, I don't

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.680
know if you know this story.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
But when you mix blue and
yellow, you get green.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.770
And what does it mean
to be blue or yellow?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.410
And how does mixing happen?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.089
Tar Beach, about a
little girl who--

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.130
she doesn't have something
or can't go somewhere.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.290
She just imagines that
she can fly there,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.600
and she can capture
that experience.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.750
Bell Hooks-- I don't know if you
know her children's book, Skin

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.610
Again.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.740
There's a wonderful book about
learning disabilities, reading,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.700
in particular.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.210
And it's called The
Art of Miss Chew, where

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.640
the art teacher,
her art teacher,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.860
essentially figured out she was
seeing the world differently.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.520
Her reading-- and
she was reading

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.402
the spaces between the words,
not the words themselves.

00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:13.860
Just like an artist might try
to render the negative space,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.170
rather than the positive space.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.250
Or a Maya Angelou poem and a
Jean-Michel Basquiat poem put

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.662
together--

00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:25.830
or Jean-Michel Basquiat images
and a Maya Angelou poem, Life

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.060
Doesn't Frighten Me Anymore.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720
These are children's books
that I found kids respond to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.230
in interesting ways.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.190
So you might choose
one of these books

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.720
and find one of those
unexpected public spaces,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.300
where you don't think education
or art, making your art

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.220
practice, is supposed to happen.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.080
You could take one
of these books,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.070
and go and read
it there out loud.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.030
And have somebody else or
yourself video tape you or--

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.640
not video tape, you
can tell how old I am.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.240
What is it?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.330
Make a video, a
mobile video of you.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And you can put one
of the hashtags.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.710
Where are our hashtags, Steve?

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.890
Here it is.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.510
You can hashtag it, and
pop it up on social media,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.790
if you'd like.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.530
Or you can take still
photo of yourself

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.161
or someone else
reading out loud.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.160
Or you can take several.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.140
Document that experience.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.360
What would be interesting
is to see what kind

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.827
of social interaction happens.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.035
And think about the critique.

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:23.830
Remember those little
tiny townspeople

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.120
and the tiny presidents?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.940
The critiques of
then the stories

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.280
of the little people and
the stories of those spaces.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.840
There's a conversation
that happens.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.770
Think about the story you
might read in that space

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.400
in relationship to that space.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.490
Or I have these little toys,
just three firefighters,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.980
two of whom have razor stub
and one has a mustache.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.940
I wonder how gendered this is.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.590
I'm just asking
questions right now.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.040
Or little animals.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.630
Or I have little
Lego mini figures.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.710
These have to be put together.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.168
I mean, you're welcome to take
them, and put them together,

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:06.640
and use them in the ways that
you saw in the photographs,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.290
critiquing, having a
conversation in a public space.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.870
That story-- where's
my-- oh, there it is,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.770
Henry's Freedom Box.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.728
I think I'm going to take
one of these pallets.

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:18.390
I can't take both of them.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.900
I'm going to take one of
these, and I'm going outside.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.250
I'm going to read
this book outside.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.916
I'm going to perform
that story outside.

00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:29.220
Henry was lonely.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.870
One day, he met Nancy, who
was shopping for her mistress.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.016
They walked, and talked,
and agreed to meet again.

00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:38.870
Henry felt like singing.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.110
But slaves didn't dare
sing in the streets.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.020
Instead, he hummed
all the way home.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.300
Henry knew they were very lucky.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.220
They lived together, even though
they had different masters.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.386
STUDENT 1: "Life doesn't
frighten me at all, not at all.

00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:09.830
Life doesn't
frighten me at all."

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:12.806
Thanks a lot.

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:14.440
GIRL: Well, what's this for?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.839
STUDENT 1: Oh, it's a class
assignment I'm having.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:17.380
GIRL: Oh, OK.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.850
I noticed there are some
other people as well.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.158
STUDENT 1: There are
a couple other people

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:20.810
doing the same thing.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.280
GIRL: [LAUGHS]

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.730
STUDENT 2: "The house was
looking like it was green."

00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:34.470
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Does anyone want

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.770
to talk about-- you want to
talk about your own specific

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.090
experience, either reading
a book out loud in public

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.830
or reading a public space in
conversation with your figure?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.280
STUDENT 2: Mainly,
people ignored me.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.490
Some people, like you
said, made sort of a wide--

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.820
somebody came, realized
they were sort of

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.150
in the scope of the photograph.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.820
And oh, I'm so sorry.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.470
Oh.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.031
And you were taking
a photograph,

00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:05.280
and you said, no, no, it's OK.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.000
You can go in.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.330
No, no, no, I'm good.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.230
So that was interesting.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.280
I used to love to read
children's books to my kids.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.230
So I mean, it was
just so much fun

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.340
to be out there and
showing everybody.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.320
And some people looked
at me, like oh, OK.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.480
And some people smiled.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.425
And I saw people sort of taking
pictures as they walked by.

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:28.590
STEPHEN CARPENTER: They looked
stealth at the time, right?

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.054
STUDENT 2: [LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:31.470
And then I was
watching you, and I

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.120
saw somebody doing posing off
to the side in front of you,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.250
like wanting to have a picture.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.840
They figured this
was some thing.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.200
And they wanted to be in
it, but not really in it.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.670
So they were off on the
side, posing while you--

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.417
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:48.000
STUDENT 3: That
fascinates me, though.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.416
If you don't even
know what it is,

00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:51.690
why are you so desperate
to get a picture?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.880
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Nicholas
Mirzoeff, visual culture

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.520
scholar, uses the
word "sublime" to talk

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.200
about those visual moments,
or those moments that are so

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.140
repulsive, you can't look away.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.790
And so seductive, you
can't bear to look at it.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.050
I mean, it's that tension.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.389
But he calls that the sublime.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.305
So maybe there is something
sublime about that

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:17.847
that they wanted to
be part, but not.

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:19.221
They knew something
was going on,

00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.040
but they weren't supposed
to be part of it.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.123
STUDENT 4: I don't know
if we were doing it right.

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:25.487
But I just had a
little Lego guy, and--

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.570
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Can we
see the little Lego guy?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.710
STUDENT 4: Yes.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.535
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Can you describe--

00:08:29.535 --> 00:08:31.160
STUDENT 4: And we
were just playing--

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.600
he is a ninja with a hatchet.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.400
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Of course.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.289
STUDENT 4: And so we
playing around with

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.330
whether he had the hatchet
or not had the hatchet

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.159
and giving him--

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.650
he had different pictures from
magazines or the newspaper.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.050
And he was in
different contexts.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.280
And I put him on
the water bubbler

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.200
and was playing with him
on the water bubbler.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.769
But it was
interesting, and I did

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:52.560
think that my kids
would have a lot of fun.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.540
My students would have
a lot of fun with it.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.040
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
So, the hatchet--

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.440
tell me about why with
and without the hatchet?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.280
Is this the accessorizing,
or why was--

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.830
STUDENT 4: We had him in
front of the headlines.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.170
And according to the headline,
if he had the hatchet,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.777
the headline meant one thing.

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:10.860
But if he didn't, then it
meant a different thing.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.537
So that context changed, once
that weapon was introduced.

00:09:13.537 --> 00:09:15.870
STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK, can
you give us an example of one

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.800
of those headlines?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.590
STUDENT 4: Someone
won an reward.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.871
And we put him in front of that.

00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:21.330
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
With the hatchet?

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.950
STUDENT 4: With the hatchet,
which made it a little bit more

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.430
ominous.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.600
And then without the
hatchet, he was like, yay,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.780
I got this award.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.071
STEPHEN CARPENTER: [LAUGHS]
So you see in that example,

00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:31.140
you're playing with the
various symbolic meanings that

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.160
are referenced with
not just the ninja,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.180
but with that
hatchet and the text.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.920
So there's the layered readings.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.370
And even that subtle
seemingly innocuous change

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.236
of hatchet or not
hatchet shifts readings--

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:46.110
shifts meaning there.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.360
It's very powerful.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.540
I hope some of what
we've talked about

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.300
gives you beginning
points or places

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.710
of departure for your own
work as educators or artists.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.360
Continue this work.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.910
See what else you can trouble,
what other kinds of questions

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.660
you can ask, what other
stories might be told.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.170
Maybe take the little figures,
and go make some more imagery.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.660
Maybe find a fire hose, or
attempt other performances.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.689
Maybe this is an assignment that
would work with your students,

00:10:17.689 --> 00:10:18.480
and give it a shot.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.860
And if it does or if it
doesn't, maybe share it.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.990
Social media, drop me a line.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.470
We'd love to hear what you're
up to as a ripple from what

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.360
we're doing here.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.160
I said yesterday, and last week,
as an artist, as an educator,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.310
as a researcher, I
have found that I'm

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.040
more interested in
questioning the answers

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.446
than I am in answering
the questions.

00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:46.540
And for me, the answers are
those social constructs,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:52.160
those practices, those systems
that people have put in place.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.180
Sometimes remaining
unquestioned or under analyzed.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.050
And maybe art making
through social engagement

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.570
is one way to
provoke reflection,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.790
hoping to discover
something in the process

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.850
about those constructs.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.170
I'll leave you with this.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.960
The National Art
Education Association

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.720
is a professional
organization in North America.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.540
It's open internationally.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.220
Primarily made of
K-12 art teachers,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.320
but there are
other art educators

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.410
in the group, higher education
professionals, museum

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.300
educators.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.230
There are two
journals they publish.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.300
Studies in Art Education,
which is essentially

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.630
the Journal of Issues and
Research in art education.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.830
And then Art Education, which
is essentially primarily

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.510
for K-12 and museum educators.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.460
And each issue,
they typically have

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.010
six articles in here and
then an instruction resource.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.650
But this particular
special issue

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:54.380
that came out in July of
2017 is a special issue.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.590
And the call for the theme
was creative activity

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.080
as a human right.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.580
And the editor said,
instead of getting six,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.980
I want to see how
many I can get.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.640
So he cut down the length
of the submissions.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.880
These are shorter pieces,
but they're really

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.830
potent little pieces.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.600
There are so many in here.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.590
One of the articles in here is
called "Socially Engaged Art

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.130
Education--

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.590
Practices, Processes,
and Possibilities."

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:28.880
And it's about ceramic water
filters, public performance,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.920
socially engaged art.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.060
And I co-authored this
with two colleagues,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.740
Ross Schlemmer, who is a
professor of art education

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.520
in southern Connecticut,
and Erika Hitchcock,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.774
who is a high school art
teacher in Virginia Beach.

00:12:45.774 --> 00:12:47.690
And so the three of us
put our voices together

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.470
to talk about our
experiences here.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.680
The other piece that I
wanted to share with you

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.350
is one that was written
by three art educators

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.792
at Maryland Institute
College of Art in Baltimore.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.500
I just want to read
the opening paragraph

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.440
to you and then another
excerpt, and then we

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.950
can have a final
set of comments.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.500
Their article is called
"Baltimore Uprising--

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.470
Empowering Pedagogy for Change."

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.860
And it was written by Vanessa
López, Adriane Pereira,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.960
and Shyla Rao.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.390
"The Baltimore uprising
was in response

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.810
to the death of Freddie
Gray, who was fatally

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.490
injured in April 2015 while
in police custody in Baltimore

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.390
City.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.310
The first evening
of the uprising,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.350
we were home, glued
to the television,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.530
communicating with each other
and our pre-service teachers,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.020
worried about violent
protests that were

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.770
erupting in parts of the city."

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.610
That's one of those moments
within your own community

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.620
that changes the community.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.140
Certainly now, Freddie
Gray's name is well-known.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.500
And so these three art
education professors,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.130
who were working with
pre-service teachers,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.460
were faced with this
real life situation.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.460
And what is our responsibility,
as art educators, as artists,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.820
as teachers, as citizens
within this community,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.250
to prepare our teachers to face
these issues, these situations?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.980
And how do we do so responsibly?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.880
Not only as community
members and related to them,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.850
to these teachers
as our students,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.950
but knowing that these
folks are going to become

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.080
teachers who might face
similar situations.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.910
And they constructed a pedagogy.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.220
They called it a pedagogy
for change framework.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.160
I just want to read briefly what
they wrote and then open it up.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.110
Because I think this piece
goes to the heart of what

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.910
this theme for
this week has been,

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.610
dealing with
difficult situations

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.790
and challenging
social constructs,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.030
primarily in this
case, police brutality.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.640
There's elements of white
supremacy and racism

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.140
that flow throughout as well.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.670
They said, "If we, alongside
our pre-service teachers

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.020
engage with self."

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.080
That's the first piece.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.960
So there's four
components here, self.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.570
"To understand the
intersections of identities

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.240
from our lived
experiences, examined

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.370
through the lens of
the historical context

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.540
of established social injustices
in schools and communities."

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.126
Context being the second.

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:23.750
"Then we have an
informed understanding

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.490
of these complexities
that," three,

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.850
"students contribute
to the cultural assets

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.400
of every classroom,
with the goal

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.920
of developing a critical for
pedagogy for effecting change

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.140
were deemed necessary."

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.510
So the culmination of self--

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.360
not only teachers, but also
the selves of the students--

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.410
in understanding the context--

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.880
social, cultural,
political, locational--

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.940
and bringing the students
in there as cultural assets

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.190
within the conversation.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.440
Perhaps the pedagogy
emerges from that formula.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.790
I think it's a brilliant piece.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.710
And they walk through each
of those components for you.
