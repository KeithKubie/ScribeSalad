Hello, my name is Mike Denny.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.940
And welcome to This Week in
Android Development on Monday,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.690
January 27, 2014.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.066
Last week, Nazmul and his
special guest Laura Klein

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.440
discussed the
differences between

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.020
qualitative and quantitative
measurement on UXD.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.370
Todd continued his
onslaught of learning.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.510
Neto Marin lectured us
on design in Portuguese,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.930
and Tony Chan spoke to us in
both Mandarin and in Cantonese

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.840
on what's new in
Android 4.4 KitKat.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780
This week, Todd
continues to take us

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.130
to school on achievement enums.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.740
Joe Fernandez makes his
debut on DevBytes showing us

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.700
how to record app
videos directly

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.670
on our Android devices using
only USB cable and adb.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.740
And finally, there are
two special episodes

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.420
being released later this week.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.410
The first is a
PlayByte from Todd,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.025
and the second is a
DevByte from Paul Carr.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:56.900

That's all for This Week
in Android Development.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.380
I'm Mike Denny.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.140
Until next time, just
hold on, we're going home.
