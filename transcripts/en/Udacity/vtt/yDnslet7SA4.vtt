00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.810
We have concluded that any forward edge
from A to B must be saturated, and

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.390
any backward edge from
B to A must be unused.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.270
Before going any further,
let's illustrate this with an example.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.190
Here we have a flow on the left and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.820
the corresponding residual
graph on the right.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.050
Note that there is no path from
s to t in the residual graph.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310
Let's mark the vertices we
can reach from s in green and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.280
the other ones in orange.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
Now it's easy to see that all the edges
from the green to the orange vertices

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.130
are saturated, and the edges from
the orange to the green are empty,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.210
just like the theorem claims.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.656
Recall that for any cut, the value of
a flow is the flow out of the partition

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:47.700
with the source minus the flow into
the partition with the source.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.440
As we just argued,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.860
however, in this case there is no
flow back into the source partition.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.940
Moreover, the flow
saturates all the edges.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.340
So it's just the sum of the capacities
across the cut from A to B,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.560
which is then defined
as the cut capacity.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.230
That completes the second
part of the theorem.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.990
Lastly, we need to show that
the existence of a cut that has the same

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.450
value as a flow implies that
that flow is a maximum flow.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.050
This follows immediately from the fact
that a cut is an upper bound.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.310
If it's not an upper bound, then cut
capacity wouldn't be an upper bound

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.340
on the value of the flow, so
this would produce a contradiction.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.240
That then completes the theorem.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.340
These three things are equivalent,
maximum flow is equal to minimum

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.510
capacity cut, and the Ford-Fulkerson
approach returns a maximum flow.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.108
If you followed all that,
congratulations.

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:44.840
The Max-Flow Min-cut Theorem
is one of the classic

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.700
theorems in the study of algorithms, and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.970
a wonderful illustration of duality,
which we'll discuss in a later lesson.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.800
For now, however, we're not quite
ready to leave maximum flow yet.
