00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.370
firstly we've been helped very much by

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.380
firstly we've been helped very much by
 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.440
firstly we've been helped very much by
the Nobel Committee because they really

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450
the Nobel Committee because they really
 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.170
the Nobel Committee because they really
helped to define a certain part of work

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180
helped to define a certain part of work
 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.919
helped to define a certain part of work
and I would say that the work that we

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929
and I would say that the work that we
 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.339
and I would say that the work that we
did was to develop models for the big

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349
did was to develop models for the big
 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.930
did was to develop models for the big
molecules in chemistry and biology that

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940
molecules in chemistry and biology that
 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.700
molecules in chemistry and biology that
would enable one to do calculations on

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710
would enable one to do calculations on
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.650
would enable one to do calculations on
these models now one needs to remember

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660
these models now one needs to remember
 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.870
these models now one needs to remember
that computers were really really slow

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880
that computers were really really slow
 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.769
that computers were really really slow
back then something like a hundred

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779
back then something like a hundred
 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.290
back then something like a hundred
million times slower than today and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
million times slower than today and
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.120
million times slower than today and
basically the key thing was was to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130
basically the key thing was was to
 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.340
basically the key thing was was to
simplify things and like Einstein once

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350
simplify things and like Einstein once
 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.510
simplify things and like Einstein once
said something which was least is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520
said something which was least is
 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.250
said something which was least is
executed is agnolotti

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260
executed is agnolotti
 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.800
executed is agnolotti
wikiquote said it wasn't really him and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810
wikiquote said it wasn't really him and
 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.000
wikiquote said it wasn't really him and
that wasn't that you should make

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010
that wasn't that you should make
 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.980
that wasn't that you should make
everything as simple as you can but no

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990
everything as simple as you can but no
 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.500
everything as simple as you can but no
simpler so we had to make things as

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
simpler so we had to make things as
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.300
simpler so we had to make things as
simple as we could sort of the computer

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310
simple as we could sort of the computer
 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.340
simple as we could sort of the computer
could do the calculation but not so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350
could do the calculation but not so
 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.600
could do the calculation but not so
simple that the results would be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610
simple that the results would be
 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.080
simple that the results would be
meaningless

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090
meaningless
 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.670
meaningless
and we were lucky I think we got the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680
and we were lucky I think we got the
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.770
and we were lucky I think we got the
right level of simplicity we were then

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780
right level of simplicity we were then
 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.140
right level of simplicity we were then
able to put it into the computer and do

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150
able to put it into the computer and do
 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.820
able to put it into the computer and do
calculations on large molecules

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830
calculations on large molecules
 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.010
calculations on large molecules
simulations it's a bit like simulating

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020
simulations it's a bit like simulating
 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.259
simulations it's a bit like simulating
the weather which I guess in Sweden

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269
the weather which I guess in Sweden
 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.300
the weather which I guess in Sweden
doesn't work very well but in some

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
doesn't work very well but in some
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.740
doesn't work very well but in some
countries like California it really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750
countries like California it really
 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.149
countries like California it really
works well because tomorrow will be like

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159
works well because tomorrow will be like
 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.219
works well because tomorrow will be like
today will be like yesterday and so on

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229
today will be like yesterday and so on
 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.779
today will be like yesterday and so on
but in calculations you can do the same

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789
but in calculations you can do the same
 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.279
but in calculations you can do the same
thing for a lot of biological molecules

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289
thing for a lot of biological molecules
 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.529
thing for a lot of biological molecules
and then you can sort of calculate the

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539
and then you can sort of calculate the
 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.120
and then you can sort of calculate the
data in between experiments so it

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130
data in between experiments so it
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.039
data in between experiments so it
becomes a tool that can be used with

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049
becomes a tool that can be used with
 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.810
becomes a tool that can be used with
experiments and I think it's it's I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
experiments and I think it's it's I
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.069
experiments and I think it's it's I
think there's gonna be many many things

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079
think there's gonna be many many things
 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.380
think there's gonna be many many things
in the future where computers are going

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390
in the future where computers are going
 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.200
in the future where computers are going
to be so important
