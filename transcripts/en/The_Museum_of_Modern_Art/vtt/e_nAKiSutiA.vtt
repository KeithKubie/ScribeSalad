00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.559
I think that the first time I saw this was
when I was a teenager in the '80s, and I think

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.870
it is the first Rauschenberg that I ever saw.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.750
And as a sculptor, I'm a sculptor, but I'm
very interested in always talking about the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.369
edge between sculpture and architecture, the
edge between sculpture and painting, the edge

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.990
between sculpture and the moving image.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.680
So this was actually a really, really important
painting/sculpture for me, because it really

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.649
showed me what that discussion is.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.350
It's so precise, it does so many things at
once.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.360
This painting for me is so much about gravity,
the fact that everything in it is being pulled

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.850
down in real time and real space, that the
paint is dripping, that the pillow is sagging.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.579
If you look at the bottom half of it, it's
really almost all the quilt.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.340
It was just these drips, and then as you go
sort of through, it's almost like a horizon

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.260
line, as very much like a landscape too, in
that you see the paint, you see the painting hand.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.680
But then you think about knitting, you think
about scraps, you think about the brush, that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.020
kind of touch, you think about it tucking,
you think about the hand, of course the drawing,

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.340
and this is very important.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.560
You think about all of these different ways
of touch and creation and in very, very different

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.120
ways, in very diverse ways, all knitted together.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.359
One of the very fundamentally important
things about Rauschenberg, and he talked about

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.950
this a lot, was how he played with the intersection
of art and everyday life, and he would always

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.219
play in that sort of space in between.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.320
And one of the things that's nice about this
piece is that its identity as a painting,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.179
or as a very familiar object that we know
is something you immediately are caught in  between, right.

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.349
And so you start to think about things that
you probably should be thinking about or could

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.959
be thinking about in any artwork, like the
height that it's hung, right.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.670
Because you have this sense of trying to wanna
move into it.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.049
So you start thinking, "Well, why is it hung
that high?

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.489
Why is it on the floor?

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:57.489
Why doesn't it rest?

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:59.239
Why shouldn't we put it horizontal?"

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.439
These are just fundamental questions that
you can ask about any artwork, but this simplicity

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.990
of the proposal, of making a painting into
a bed or a bed into a painting, that flipping,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.250
is so sort of very, very simple, fundamental
idea I think in Rauschenberg.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.290
This idea of, I don't know where in the process
it is, and that process is completely flipping.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.209
"Is it something I found in everyday art that
I made art, or was it art that then became everyday?"

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.909
This is about a bed, it's how a bed acts in
real space.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.860
Where you have sex, where you die, where you
give birth.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.189
It has this incredible intimacy of a site
that is then sort of revealed.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.150
the greatest gift of being an artist is that
you can actually have a conversation through

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
work without being there.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.770
That when you leave work behind, you're actually
having a conversation way beyond yourself.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.909
And I think that, for him, he loved, and he
wanted people to see that he was doing that

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:58.909
in real time.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.110
And there's a kind of privacy of the conversation
that becomes public when you see it.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.049
And I do think that kind of intimacy is very
specific to Rauschenberg, a willingness to

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.989
be tender, to be intimate, to share kind of
a very interior urgency, an urgency to share

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.249
a kind of interior self publicly,

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:25.599
so I actually made a piece that was completely
an homage to this piece, which is a piece

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.659
that was also a painting, but that you'd turn
the volume up on sculpture So, what would

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.359
be the formal properties that you would turn
up?

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.519
You would turn up gravity, you would turn
up sculpture in the round.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.469
You'd do everything that you can do in a sculpture
that you can't do in a painting.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.590
You would make it portable.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.409
You would make it site-specific wherever it
went.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.069
You would make it always in conversation with
the architecture, and not just with the wall.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.079
You would kill the frame.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.799
So, "Hammock" was really a direct homage to
"Bed,"

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.189
So, it was in many ways, in my mind, it was,
it did things like the bed, it had things

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.680
about it, the intimacy of a location where
one sleeps, where someone rests.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.770
It had the figurative nature of it feeling
like a place that was somewhere you could

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.540
sit, somewhere you could lie down.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.500
But also was, really harnessed this idea of
negative space and of the air around it, so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.889
that, you know, it was almost as there as
it wasn't there, that it could almost disappear

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.471
in a way, that the frame of it spilled out
in many ways into the space around it, in

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:29.139
a way that you can't do with a painting.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.470
I think that Rauschenberg, very much his persona
was as a diplomat, as a poet, as a friend to artists.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.900
But I think most importantly, he was rebellious.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.940
And while he brought people in, he was constantly
undermining the authority of the system he worked in
