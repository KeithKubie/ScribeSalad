do itself and more to do with you what
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.589
do itself and more to do with you what
you can be communicating to be to the

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599
you can be communicating to be to the

selfish let's think less about yourself
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.059
selfish let's think less about yourself
and more about the person you're talking

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
and more about the person you're talking
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.330
and more about the person you're talking
to and and then it you'll work it out

got that and when you you know inwardly
 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.880

sharing the responsibility and I think
that's what what's important is to is to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
