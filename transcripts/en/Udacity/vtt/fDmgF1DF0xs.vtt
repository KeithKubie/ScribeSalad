00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This quiz builds on the one before.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, the Euler method is in place and we want to experiment with the step size.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you look at the solution curves, you could get the impression

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that a step size of half a day is way too small.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Why should we be stepping in half days. What about steps of say 5 days.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Shouldn't that be working given these curves.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's step size in and leave that step size in for which the solution just doesn't explode

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and accuracy of 1 decimal place is enough.
