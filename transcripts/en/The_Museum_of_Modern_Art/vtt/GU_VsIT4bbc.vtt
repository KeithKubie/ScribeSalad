00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.060
Hi I'm Ellen

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.320
And I'm Diana.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.400
And we're sitting
here in MoMA's conservation studio.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.420
We're conservators. I work in sculpture and
I've been here for five years.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.900
And I work in paintings and I've been here
for seven months as a graduate intern.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.320
How do we hold our hands?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.720
"Whatever is natural"

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.100
Objects that come through the conservation
studio often tell their own stories if you

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.360
look closely enough.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.060
So we've made a lot of videos in the past.
Whether it's Yves Klein, or Andy Warhol,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.100
or Frank Lloyd Wright, and we've received a lot
of good questions. Zoe asked "Is that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340
a special flashlight they keep using?

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.380
Does it use a different hue or wavelength
of light?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.010
It's an odd looking flashlight."

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.600
David Robot says "Why are some individuals
in this feature wearing gloves when handling art

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.540
while others are not?"

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.540
Good question David.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.790
That's a great question.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.860
Alexis asks "Okay but what happened to her
head restoration?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.260
Rolling eyes emoji."

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.780
Good point.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.260
We are trying something new here at MoMA, since
we've got such great questions from you in

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.690
the comments section of our YouTube channel,
we thought we would do a Live Q&amp;A to let people

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.700
ask questions as they come to them.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.080
So send us any questions you might have in
the comments section down below or submit

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.240
them at 3PM on Wednesday.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.840
In the meantime check out some of the videos
that we've posted in the past here, and here,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.480
and here, and here, and there - and here.
