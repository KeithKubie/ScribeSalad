00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.820
- [Narrator] This program is presented by

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.240
University of California Television.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.877
(lighthearted music)

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.650
- Now we turn to our
very wonderful speaker,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.172
Alexandra Horowitz.

00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:02.600
Before I read anything
formal I have to tell you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.680
that I met Alexandra

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.280
at a small workshop that we both attended

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.400
a couple of, well,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.013
more than a few years ago,
three years ago, probably, and,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.950
she and her husband, and,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.387
I was immediately captivated
by their intellect.

00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:25.323
When I heard her speak,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.640
give her formal presentation
at this workshop,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.920
I knew I was really in the presence

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.533
of a very special intellect,
a really penetrating mind,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.380
which was a mind able to
express a lot of subtle ideas

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.750
in extremely accessible language.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.760
And, she writes the way she speaks,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760
she speaks the way she writes,
and, it's all very beautiful,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.150
completely comprehensible and revealing.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.920
So, I know you're gonna enjoy her.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.680
Alexandra Horowitz is
a well-known scientist

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.520
in animal cognition.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.070
Her research centers on
the behavior and cognition

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.770
of the domestic dog, with
a focus on dyadic play,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.690
metacognition, olfactory perception,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.690
and the behaviors implicated
in anthropomorphisms of dogs.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.570
In addition to the enormously
successful Inside of a Dog,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.780
which spends 63 weeks at a
New York Times Bestseller,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.260
her second book, On Looking:
Eleven Walks with Expert Eyes,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.313
was published just this January.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.760
Horowitz is also published extensively

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.990
in the academic world,
with articles appearing in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.650
Social Justice Research,
Learning and Behavior,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.430
Animal Cognition, and the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.490
Encyclopedia of Animal
Rights and Animal Welfare,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.580
among other publications.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.710
She's produced a number
of popular articles

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.110
for the New York Times,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.370
her work has been covered
in the New Yorker,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.780
The Chicago Tribune, and Time Magazine.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.040
Horowitz earned her BA in Philosophy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.930
at the University of Pennsylvania,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.010
and a PhD in Cognitive Science at the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.730
University of California San Diego.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.450
She's taught at Barnard College,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.990
of Columbia University
since 2004, and is currently

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.210
Adjunct Associate Professor
of Psychology there.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.360
She lives in New York City
with her husband, son,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.161
and her dogs, Upton, and Finnegan.

00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.690
In today's lecture, Alexandra Horowitz

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.330
will discuss how domestic
dogs, canis familiaris,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.560
have insinuated themselves into
our society and imagination.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.990
Having been long present
in our art and narratives,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.100
dogs are now ubiquitous in American homes.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.520
She will describe the dog's

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:48.930
historical and contemporary role,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050
attributions made to the dogs,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.970
and will propose and
alternative empirical approach

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.413
to considering dogs.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.237
Join me in giving a warm
welcome to Alexandra Horowitz.

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:03.987
(audience claps)

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.400
And, we'll have a short

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.763
question and answer period after her talk.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.993
- Thank you so much, Stanley.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.753
Hello.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.240
I should like to express my appreciation

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510
to the Foerster Lecture Committee,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.730
and to Stanley Brandes,
and Dean Ann Traseri,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.660
and Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.380
for the invitation to come
and speak before you today.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.120
As Stanley says, I'm a
researcher of the domestic dog,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.688
canis familaris, and as
observer of their behavior,

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:53.750
in natural contexts as they
interact with conspecifics

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.090
or with humans or in
experimental contexts,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.260
as they solve problems
that we have set them.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.710
I'm interested in animal
mind, and this research

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.105
is mostly about making
inferences of the cognition

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:10.330
of the members of this
species from their behavior.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.810
Ultimately I spend a
disproportionate amount of my time

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.870
videotaping dog, coding the behavior

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.440
from videotapes of dogs, or patting dogs

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.152
in appreciation for
letting me videotape them.

00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:23.150
(audience laughs)

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.810
These biographical facts,
viewed in the context

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.510
of the topic of this lecture series

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.350
may explain the upthrust of
my eyebrows on my forehead

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.895
after I was invited to speak here.

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:34.728
(audience laughs)

00:05:34.728 --> 00:05:37.920
For the phrases Immortality of the Soul,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.950
and Domestic Dogs do not
often find themselves

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.540
in the same academic journals.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.420
Indeed, the study of immortal soul

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.759
and the study of dogs

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.380
seem on first pass not to
bear on one another at all.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.130
But, of course, there's
plenty of precedent

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.300
for discussing the possibility
of the immortal souls

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.780
of dogs or of any animal.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.570
There's been furious debate on the topic,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.010
although the fury has been
stretched out over centuries.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.970
In Ancient Egypt, dogs and
souls were intertwined.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.230
Depictions of Anubis, this
dog-headed jackal or other canid,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.060
often decorated tombs, as a
guide of deceased human souls

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.493
into the immortal realm.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.200
Meso American cultures
repeated this motif,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.290
leaving pottery figures of
dogs within burial sites

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.253
as chaperones of human
spirits to the underworld.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.320
But was the dog himself

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.290
a traveler to that selfsame underworld?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.313
Surely not.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.986
In Ancient Greece against
the backdrop of Plato's

00:06:37.986 --> 00:06:41.840
reasoning, immortal soul,
the Aristotelian take

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.577
on the soul was more
generous, implicating,

00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:48.820
"that which can sense
and move" as ensouled.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.273
Certainly dogs were included.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.510
So, also would have been
single celled organisms

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.743
like paramecium, which flexibly
react to their environments,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.890
or, the Mimosa pudica, a sensitive plant,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.570
which responds in real
time to being touched

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.993
as here from top to bottom.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.183
Immortality, for plant or
dog, is another question.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.370
More recently, and most prominently,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.520
from the vantage of contemporary science

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.960
was DeCartes dualism,
segregating human animals

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.200
from non-human animals with the claim that

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.310
only humans have a soul not liable

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.783
to die with the body, thus, immortal.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.449
To animals he granted
souls but a material soul,

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.900
so intertwixed with body that it would die

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.840
when the body dies.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.960
Of course the extension of DeCartes' claim

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.490
that the immortal soul
was restricted to humans

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.070
was that the mortal soul of animals

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.010
was shortly interpreted to
be no sort of soul at all.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.390
Quite rapidly, one
transitions from this posture

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.510
to reducing animals to simple machinery,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.983
thus, incapable of
feelings including pain.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.770
Animals were hence subjected
to incredibly brutal treatment

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.520
under the guise of this philosophy.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.070
Today, by contrast, that
many current pet owners

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.840
believe in the availability
of the afterlife for animals

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.480
is implied by a phenomenon Stanley Brandes

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.900
has recently drawn our attention to again,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.322
the development and
success of pet cemeteries.

00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:21.155
(audience laughs)

00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:23.570
Such as New York's Heartsdale Pet Cemetery

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.920
and Paris' Cimetière des Chiens.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.481
Each features inscribed
monuments on the grave sites,

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:33.917
formal burials and pastoral services.

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:37.500
Surely, those who have
buried their animals thusly

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.010
are moved to do so by the at minimum,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.950
their sense of the continued importance

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.123
of the animal's fate after death.

00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:48.093
And often, as when a monument reads,

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:52.310
"Our friend forever", or "See you later",

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.413
their anticipation that they
will, indeed, see them later.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.370
We are thus confronted
with a range of opinions

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.470
on the matter at hand.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.190
The insistence that animals
have immortal souls,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.330
that animals have souls,
but not immortal ones,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.130
and that animals have neither
souls nor are they immortal.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.220
If you're keeping track, that leaves us

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.059
one option undiscussed,
and it will be my tack,

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:20.280
to suggest that the
question of soul is not

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.923
an answerable one, but that
indeed, dogs are immortal.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.240
To clarify, I want to
suggest that the question of

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.580
the soulfulness of the animal

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.110
is not the question we should be asking.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.300
To be sure, there's precedent

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.193
for asking questions of this sort.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.010
For example, much current
research in non human animals

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.630
comes from comparative psychology,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.580
which asks questions
cast in a similar mold.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.170
Have any animals the
intelligence of humans?

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.500
Do they feel the emotions that we do?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.740
Answers are discoverable, why,
yes, they perform admirably

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.670
like humans on this
test of problem solving,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.940
or, no, they do not succeed
at being quite human,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.083
at this task of social cognition.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.270
But, with comparison to humans,
or, to what humans value

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.820
as our measure, this approach
patently circumscribes

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.680
what we are able to see
in non-human animals.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.190
It delimits the abilities
they have to those

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.710
which mirror ours, curbs our imagination

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.420
from extending outside our humanness.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.023
The investigation ends
before it even gets going.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.150
It is reminiscent of the
famed exercise in exploration

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.030
and knowledge gathering
that might be called

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.410
The Safari Phenomenon.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.220
Gone to seek animals,
the patient observer,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.850
looking our over a
savannah, will finally see

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.270
a majestic creature approaching,
then another, then a herd.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.020
We tend to ask "What is that?"

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.020
It's identification, a greater
kudu, is met with head nods,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.613
and aborts most further inquiry.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.840
We move on, no closer to understanding

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.440
the creatures we have
spotted, they have been named.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.530
Similarly, designation of
the chimp as "like humans"

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.770
in these ways, or the rock
dove as most "unlike humans"

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.610
in these other ways brings us no closer

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.573
to understanding chimp nor dove.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.440
I think the aim of scientific
inquiry into animals

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.280
should be by contrast, animal centered,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.773
unpacking what their actual experience is.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.920
The question then, of the soul of the dog,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.160
strikes me as an illustrative example

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.623
of asking the wrong question of the dog.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.540
Having established or determined,
or living in the hope,

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.260
that we have immortal souls ourselves,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.976
we turn to the pup at our
feet and wonder it at them.

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:44.860
I do not mean by calling
this the wrong question

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.510
that that question is not germane

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:48.813
because the dog has no soul.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.470
Instead, it's not relevant to the dog

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.050
because of his dogness.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.500
In the first part, the
lion's share, as it were,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.600
of my lecture, I'll
expand upon this point,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.210
and try to say something
about what dogness amounts to,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.253
and just how and why we've missed it.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.730
Following that, I will
suggest, putting aside

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.270
the question of the dog's soulful status,

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.443
that the dog is in many ways, immortal.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.020
For the concern with
immortality is transparently

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.230
the interest in persistence,
that our essence,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.700
that those things we value, engage in,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.200
or that we define ourselves
through our interactions with,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.583
can live on in some sense
after we or they die.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.810
In the final part of this lecture,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.200
I'll describe how dogs
have attained immortality

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.800
through the roles they play or have played

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.300
in our perception of them
in contemporary society.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.790
I will begin, though, with a claim,

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.130
as it has some currency these
days, that dogs have souls.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.223
What could be meant by that claim?

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.470
It's likely that the maker
of this pronouncement

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.130
is certainly confident in his
belief that persons have souls

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.993
and has extended the same
nature to his canid companion.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.850
Historically, what the soul
is has been changeable,

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.540
spiritual, immaterial, essential,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.410
some component of mental experience.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.380
Without resolving this question,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.680
as my research with animals
addresses the fact of

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.410
and content of mental experience,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.933
that's the part I'll focus on.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.360
And, as an animal researcher interested

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.270
in making claims about
ability based on behavior,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.720
any prior attribution made to an animal

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.700
is approached with caution,

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.040
in an interest in deconstruction.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.200
What outward evidence is there

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.840
of the existence or non-existence
of the thing attributed,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.940
the thing about the
animal to which we point

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.020
as evidence of our claim.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.860
For instance, what behaviors
could induce people

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.451
to believe that dogs have souls?

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:50.573
Consider the case of Umka.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.643
Umka is a female Brussels griffin.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.911
Members of this breed, one
of the hundreds of breeds

00:13:57.911 --> 00:13:59.410
for which there is a national standard,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.880
restricting matings to maintain
a genetically ideal line,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.440
are expected to be under 10 lbs,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.743
and have faces with wide
set eyes, long eyelashes,

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:11.263
a diminutive nose, and an underbite.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.910
These features are intended to,

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.567
in the words of the American
Kennel Club standard,

00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:20.119
"Lend the dog an almost human expression."

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:22.560
Although, note that according to the AKC,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.789
a wry mouth is a "serious fault".

00:14:25.789 --> 00:14:27.280
(audience laughs)

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.960
In 2011, Umka was the subject of a lawsuit

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.700
filed by her owner against
Raising Rover, LTD,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.113
a pet store which sold
Umka to her for $1600.00.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.080
Shortly after purchasing
Umka, her new owner

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.080
became aware of various
serious health issues

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.193
in the then puppy.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.730
Umka underwent costly
surgery to try to correct

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.250
what was discovered to be
an inherited malformation

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.667
of her hip sockets and knee bones.

00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:54.880
In the complaint, the
attorney for Umka's owner

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.097
charges that "Even after
the first operation

00:14:57.097 --> 00:14:59.917
"to repair her knee, Umka cannot engage

00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:02.797
"in regular activities a
puppy should engage in,

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:04.930
"such as running around."

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.970
At the time of the
filing, Umka was waiting

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.463
for her next operation for her other knee.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.850
Plaintiff requests humanity
for Umka, complaint states,

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.527
it continues, "Umka is a
living soul with a heart.

00:15:18.527 --> 00:15:20.647
"She feels love and pain."

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.460
In some ways, Umka is
simply, under the terms

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.177
of our current law, a non-conforming
good, defective, unfit.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.360
Pets are considered
goods, they are property,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.060
and may be subject, under warranty,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.210
to meeting certain
specifications, in this case,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.760
a puppy who can engage
in puppy-like activities,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.683
such as running, jumping,
leaping, playing.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.000
But, above and beyond this,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.030
the fact of Umka's soul was invoked.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.880
She could not experience
the joys and sorrows of life

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.153
as other puppies, or indeed, we, do.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.083
Do dogs experience love and pain?

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.360
Have they the capacity?

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.660
Neurologically, persons and dogs, indeed,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.600
all other mammals, are
equipped with nociceptors,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.490
pain receptors, and have
a central nervous system

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.090
that receives information
about, and responds to pain.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.190
All move to avoid painful stimuli.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.510
All show behaviors
sufficient to demonstrate

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.680
that they experience pain.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.180
The answer to the question
of pain is affirmative.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.570
Next, while love would perhaps be called

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.400
affiliative behavior in scholarly
animal research contexts,

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.650
the very fact of affiliative,
affectionate behavior

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.000
and bond forming is widely acknowledged

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.470
as a premise of social species.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.283
It's not a stretch to say dogs love too.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.150
There is some evidence for her soulfulness

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.083
as defined, then, at
least in terms of pain.

00:16:49.083 --> 00:16:52.870
Umka is unable to leap on the
furniture without whimpering,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.010
cannot run with casts on
her legs, and generally

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.894
does not engage in other
puppy typical activities.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:03.120
We are given no evidence of Umka's love,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.660
it is assumed to materialize toward owner

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.623
just when the owner
materializes in the dog's life.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.540
But, the statement that
Umka is a living soul

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.960
is not presented as being
subject to examination,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.400
it is a statement of conviction.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.130
The issue for the asserters
is not whether or not

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.130
they are right in their assertion,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.363
it is how odd we act given
this self-evident fact.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.030
Before Umka could not leap, could not run,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.230
or before she was even
acquainted with her adopter,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.340
she was imbued with these traits,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.860
by her owner and by most
dog owners, as well as

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.560
by all manner of thinkers
on the condition of animals.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.520
But, by what authority
are we given this insight

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.770
into the dog's soulfulness,
or even any internal state?

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.180
How do we know about this dog,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.373
or any dog's, subjective experience?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.453
We do not.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.500
Umka and the question of
her being a living soul,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.510
stand as example of something
that is a more general

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.020
concern of mine as a
researcher of the behavior

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.890
of such a common and familiar animal.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.530
We, we livers with
dogs, we already believe

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.363
we know everything about
the animal, a priori.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.750
Prior to meeting a dog,
prior to living with a dog,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.743
prior to looking at a dog,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.840
we fail to use the one mechanism
readily available to us,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.660
asking questions of a dog's
capacities and attributes,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.223
and looking for answers
in the dog's behavior.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.700
And, on those occasions
when we do ask questions,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.930
we often ask the wrong questions of dogs,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.300
we ask person questions of dogs.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.310
This is called anthropomorphizing,
but I wanna be neutral

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:49.130
on whether we are correct
or not in our attributions.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.020
I simply suggest that what
we do by assigning the dog

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.020
soulful status, or any other
set of perfunctory attributes,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:03.170
is abort inquiry about the dog,
obscure our view of the dog,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.295
stop consideration, even
of the dog in front of us.

00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:10.383
Let us then reconsider
the nature of this animal.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.813
Who is the dog?

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.210
The domestic dog is a
creature of some paradox

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.920
in its life among humans.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.233
We breed dogs for sameness,
but celebrate their difference.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.133
They are kept, yet they
are regularly abandoned.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.740
We guide them and are guided by them.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.233
We name one, yet, anonymously
euthanize millions of others.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.330
They have the legal status of property

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.670
but we endow them with agency;

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.100
they want, they choose,
they demand, they insist.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.520
We sense their animalism,
feeding them bones,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.720
yet enforce an ersatz humanness,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.033
dressing them in raincoats,
celebrating birthdays.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.440
We cut their ears to be
more like wild canids,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.550
but in breeding, shorten their faces,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.113
to be more like primates.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.513
We speak of their gender,
yet regulate their sex.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.030
The dog is descended from an ancestor

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.440
of the present day wolf.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.470
A wolf-like creature, from
which the dog diverged,

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.313
some thousands of years ago.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.790
The matter of how many
thousands and in what manner

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.020
the divergence came is
subject to some theorizing.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.300
But, the best evidence is this;

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.740
about 14,000 years ago, in a
few areas around the world,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.710
homo sapiens became less nomadic,

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.543
created settlements, and came
into contact with canis lupus.

00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:43.980
The connection for the two species was,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.070
initially, garbage,
namely, the food remnants

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.670
that humans were leaving
outside those new settlements.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.240
In essence, this theory
goes, humans were creating

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.460
a new ecological niche
around those waste piles.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.640
Some wolves self-selected,
perhaps some had a lower

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.300
reactivity around humans,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.283
and they began scavenging
food from these dumps.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.000
One way or another, these
proto-dogs worked their way

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.930
into the settlements,
where they were tolerated,

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.943
and perhaps used once in a while as food.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.420
This is archeological
evidence of our coexistence,

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.960
from a Northern Israel grave
site of 12,000 years ago,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.590
an individual buried
with a hand over the body

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.143
of a five month old puppy.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.120
Artificial selection, wherein humans

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.630
control the breeding of the animals,

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.760
took off some time thereafter,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.000
based on human preference for behaviors,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.280
guarding, herding, hunting,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.080
and continued for thousands of years.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.120
Implicitly, we may have been selecting

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.700
by preferring certain traits,
as well, physical traits.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.430
For instance, following Konrad Lorenz,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.600
our lab has showed that
some of the neotinous

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.210
characteristics typical of children,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.080
big eyes, large cheeks,
are preferred in dogs.

00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:13.792
(audience laughs)

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.830
The result is a redirection to dogs

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.660
of the feelings of
attachment typically prompted

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.883
by the infant bearers of these traits.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.430
And, too, those dogs, or proto-dogs,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:32.430
which looked at us, giving the
impression of a shared gaze,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.240
the precondition, in some
sense, for conversation,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.603
were certainly selected.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.430
Their ancestors now, the
dogs of the 21st century,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.540
are magnificent examples
of gaze sharing creatures,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.720
nearly human, and I
use that intentionally,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.910
as all studies confirm their
ability to use our gaze

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.033
to get information, and interpret
our communicative signals.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.420
Here is some hint to how we
began to see dogs in our image,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.043
they began to mind us and reflect us.

00:23:05.632 --> 00:23:09.100
Quite late in this domestication
story, the 19th century,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.500
the selection process turned a corner.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.370
Breeding proceeded based not
on preferences for behavior,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.850
but particular constellations
of physical traits,

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.490
which began to be reified as purebreds,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.093
a concept that didn't
exist before this time.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.690
Even more than before, dogs were designed

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.213
to suit our fancy.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.260
This tale of domestication is usually told

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.380
through archeology or genetics,

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.880
but one might look at
dogs' representation in art

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.130
as instructive as well,
the story of how we have

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.340
thought of dogs penned on the page.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.680
What one sees is the rise of a particular,

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.290
contemporary view of who dogs are.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:54.740
The dog as confidant,
companion, bearer of secrets

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.282
and sharer of bed, sporting
sweaters and ribbons.

00:23:58.282 --> 00:24:02.670
Now, I'm not looking here
at the symbolism of the dogs

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.370
in these images, nor the
qualities they embodied,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.690
but at their actual depiction,
a kind of pathologist

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.680
at the museum approach,
so you will, I hope,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.070
excuse my riding roughshod
over the hard historical

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.653
or scriptural contexts of these images.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.420
Many early images cast dogs thusly,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.550
the Bayeux Tapestry from the 11th century,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.830
behaving as hunters, guards,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.463
flushers, or, retrievers of game.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.310
Just as importantly, on the canvas,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.700
they were at the side of the scene,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.163
participants but not principals.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.313
They then began sneaking
into domestic scenes.

00:24:53.261 --> 00:24:54.383
Underfoot,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.010
into street scenes as with

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.370
Rembrandt's Good Samaritan here,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:07.040
becoming a dog imbued image.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.603
Nice bit of naturalism there
in his excretal posture.

00:25:12.057 --> 00:25:12.890
(audience laughs)

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.817
And, into church, minding a column.

00:25:16.817 --> 00:25:19.870
(audience laughs)

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.900
And, popping up almost in people's stead,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.800
as in these Titian scenes, showing Venus,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.163
attended to by Cupid, and a lute player,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.363
or a dog.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.400
Not long thereafter they trotted
from the side of the canvas

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.400
to be featured with us centrally,
in the early 17th century.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.663
And in the 18th.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.143
Then as show breeding
began, as objects of fancy.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.250
Still objects, note, part of a still life,

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.283
objects collected by breeders.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.710
And finally, most recently,
from Darwin's time onward,

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.453
they took over the canvas.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.093
Center stage, the dog is
a subject for himself.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.990
The portrayed; no longer
figurative, or sidelined,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.573
this is when they became
individuals for us.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.570
As subjects of portraits,
they are extended

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.360
the capacities of human subjects.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.320
Indeed they are our
capacities, transplanted,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.520
furred, though often
diminished, we assign to the dog

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.210
all manner of human attributes.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.550
Domestication made the dog
easy to anthropomorphize,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.330
to see as human-like, though
their shared genetic ancestry

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.770
with homo-sapiens is millions
of years more ancient

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.593
than that with canis lupus.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.750
Indeed, domestication
itself might be considered

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.763
a process of making the
animal more anthromorphizable.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.380
The result of thousands of
generations of selective breeding

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.373
is an animal who looks to us,

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.773
and we imagine, understands us.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.690
He poses and it reads as familiar emotion.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.720
We call them proud,
faithful, jealous, guilty,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.640
feel sure that they are amazed or content,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.000
confused, or empathetic.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.160
Charles Darwin wrote of
his dogs as variously,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.160
magnanimous and sensible,
shameful and modest.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:00.690
I dare you to attribute
nothing to some of these faces.

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:03.630
(audience laughs)

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.100
This anthropomorphizing is
a natural human tendency.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.570
Just as young children
spontaneously attribute

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.320
life to inanimate objects,
practicing animism,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.550
in an early attempt to make
sense of the sensory chaos

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.870
of the environment,
anthropomorphism may have

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.750
arisen in our species as a strategy

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.140
to make predictable an
unpredictable world.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.850
It is notable that in addition
to the animistic approaches

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.210
that come naturally to children,

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.940
we steep childhood in anthropomorphisms,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.560
recapitulating in ontogeny our philogyny.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.050
Children's books are replete
with animals clothed and shod,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.880
and with human concerns and foibles.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.340
The cat has a hat, the fox has socks,

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.120
bunnies run away, pigeons
yearn to drive the bus,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.173
frogs are friends with toads.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.020
This cavalier be-hatting
and experience attributing

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.220
we drum into our children is a repetition

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.510
and an extension of the mythology

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.110
our species long ago created.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.250
In particular, early homo sapiens

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.420
may have found anthropomorphism
useful, to anticipate

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.230
and interpret the behavior
of non-human animals,

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.240
especially ascribing
motivations and desires

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.820
which would distinguish the
behavior of those animals

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.458
from whom one might want to flee,

00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:35.963
from those in whom one sees a meal.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.110
Today, some 75 million dogs live among us

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.570
in two of five US households.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:48.570
They are ubiquitous and
underfoot, familial and familiar.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.070
We humans are no longer attempting

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.000
to predict the behavior of the animal

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.223
we inexplicably find in our cave,

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.763
but we retain the vocabulary
developed to do so.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.700
In my research, I question

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.190
the anthropomorphisms we make of dogs.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.580
I attempt to deconstruct
them, in order to determine

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.490
both what has prompted us
to make these attributions

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.180
and if when one looks
closely at the behavior

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.083
that has prompted it, the
attributions are valid or sound.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.510
But, what is problematic
about these attributions

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.650
after all, one might ask?

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.180
Surely their endurance
marks them as at least

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.823
not irreparably harmful in
explaining animal behavior?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.490
I am concerned with three effects:

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.363
a perverting, a diverting,
and a subverting.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.163
First, the perverting.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.030
In much of Europe from
the later Middle Ages

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.160
until the 18th century,
anthropomorphisms to animals

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.510
had an extraordinary result;

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.910
animals were held accountable
for their actions.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.290
In particular, animals
were tried and punished,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.460
often by death, for all
manner of infractions

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.030
and trespasses against
humans and human property

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.717
from thievery to felonious
intent and murder.

00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:06.260
In each case, as detailed by EP Evans,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.623
the defendants were
represented by counsel,

00:31:08.623 --> 00:31:12.630
precedent was cited, and in most cases,

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.060
a judge returned a guilty verdict,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.390
delivered with solemnity
and often ceremony

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.130
by a specially appointed official.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.992
The animals so convicted included flies,

00:31:22.992 --> 00:31:27.460
horse flies, gad flies, Spanish flies,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.370
grasshoppers, locusts, and caterpillars,

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.260
worms, snails and weevils,
mice, cows, and horses,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.159
doves and roosters, dogs,
wolves, and dolphins,

00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:43.716
none so frequently as the pig.

00:31:43.716 --> 00:31:44.670
(audience laughs)

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.770
For example in 1386 in Falaise,
in Northwestern France,

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.080
a sow was sentenced to be
mangled in her head and forelegs

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.430
and then to be hanged for
having torn the face and arms

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.343
of a child and thus caused his death.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.520
The execution was a public
event, subsidized by the city,

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.920
and for the occasion the sow
was dressed in men's clothes

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.763
and the hangman was given,
it was noted, new gloves.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.840
In 1519, what is now Austria,
initiated criminal proceedings

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.750
against the moles or field mice,

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.140
which species was not determined,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.500
which were accused of damaging crops,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.200
by burrowing and throwing up the earth

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.823
so that neither grass nor
green thing could grow.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.760
A defense attorney was assigned
but the prosecuting attorney

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.317
presented a formidable list of witnesses,

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:36.580
and the presiding judge
sentenced the animals to death,

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.837
but gave safe conduct for 14 days

00:32:38.837 --> 00:32:40.923
for the pregnant and infant moles.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.210
This kind of radical
extension of responsibility

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.940
to non-humans, based on an assumption

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.540
that it is appropriate that
they bear that responsibility,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.080
pre-dates the Middle Ages.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.920
A Roman custom for many years
had a dog crucified each year

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.140
on the anniversary of the day
that a local dog did not bark

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.363
upon the arrival of invading Gauls.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.220
The responsibility even extended
to inanimate non-humans.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.140
In Ancient Greece, a special
court tried inanimate objects

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.730
such as stones and beams
that had caused human death.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.290
A statue that tumbled on
to and killed a passer by

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.253
was punished for murder by
being thrown into the sea.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.710
In Russia, the bell which pealed gleefully

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.620
despite the recent
assassination of a royal figure,

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.622
was convicted of treason
and sent to Siberia.

00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:33.455
(audience laughs)

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.740
This kind of perversion of the
impulse to anthropomorphize

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.230
is by no means an inevitable consequence,

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.853
simply a possible one.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.123
It is not entirely in our distant past.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.100
The circus elephant Topsy,
who in 1903 was electrocuted

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.730
in a gruesome fashion after

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.320
killing a number of her abusive trainers,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.740
stands as stark reminder
that we are not as far

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.443
from these animal trials
as we might like to think.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.660
And, it could be argued,
when faced with pet dogs

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.820
who are labeled aggressive and in fact,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.310
have been aggressors, or
societal response is often

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.729
more perfunctory than our
Medieval forbears had been.

00:34:12.729 --> 00:34:15.893
We kill them and spare the trial.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.033
The diverting.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.720
A far more common result of
making attributions to animals

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:28.140
is simply consequent
misinterpretation of their behavior.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.530
In private homes with dogs, for instance,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.363
these misunderstandings abound.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.330
While the consequences are not as dramatic

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.730
as those that befell the
sow in Falaise in 1386,

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.053
they are appreciable.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.633
For instance, it's widely
held that dogs feel guilt.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.370
One assumes, in the way that humans may,

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.503
without the intrapsychic
Freudian conflict.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.040
Three quarters of dog
owners surveyed in one study

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.200
expressed the belief that dogs experience

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.240
this self-conscious evaluative emotion.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.870
Another study found dog
owners confidently asserting

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.827
that their charges "understand
the rules of the household".

00:35:05.879 --> 00:35:06.712
(audience laughs)

00:35:06.712 --> 00:35:09.460
The guilty look that
inspires these assessments,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.523
including elements such
as pressing the ears back,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:19.614
averting the eyes, or lowering the head,

00:35:19.614 --> 00:35:20.447
(audience laughs)

00:35:20.447 --> 00:35:21.540
also, dropping the tail,

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.220
wagging low and quickly and so forth,

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.330
is recognized by owners
and non-owners alike.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.250
No less an observer of animal
behavior than Konrad Lorenz

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.308
concluded from the guilty look that we can

00:35:33.308 --> 00:35:36.234
"assume with certainty that
it hides a guilty conscience".

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.820
(audience laughs)

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.520
The anthropomorphism here
is the step from the dog's

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.400
looking guiltily, to the
dog's feeling guilty.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.020
That dogs realize, when they've

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.860
done something wrong, or inappropriate.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.710
Owners are presuming
mens rea, a guilty look

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:54.810
indicates a guilty mind,
moving from the outward

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.650
appearance of the animal
to the confident claim

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.313
about the animal's understanding.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.800
In our research we have shown

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.410
that this confidence is unwarranted.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.870
In a simple experiment, we demonstrated

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.287
that dogs did not show more guilty look

00:36:09.287 --> 00:36:13.100
when they did something for
which they might feel guilt.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.505
Disobeying an owner, for instance.

00:36:15.505 --> 00:36:20.330
They didn't show more than
when they hadn't disobeyed.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.930
Ah, but when we misled
owners into thinking

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.170
their dogs had eaten a
treat forbidden to them

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.480
whilst the owners were out of the room,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.710
and the owners scolded the dog
for this apparent defiance,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.093
the dogs rate of the guilty look shot up.

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:36.292
(audience murmurs in wonder)

00:36:36.292 --> 00:36:37.700
It was much higher than when
we misled the owners inversely

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.363
into thinking their actually
disobeying pups had obeyed.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.240
The dogs obedience or
disobedience turned out

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.950
to have no effect on the likelihood

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.030
that that dog showed the guilty look.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.090
Nor could owners reliably predict

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.913
what the dog had done
by assessing the look.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.460
The look marks not
guilt on the dog's part,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.413
but the perception of
guilt on the owner's part.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.940
Of course, I am, and the data are agnostic

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.940
about whether dogs do actually
experience guilt in some way.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.360
They may, certainly.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.240
One can plainly see

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.900
a negative emotional
state manifest in the dog.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.850
Although, the behavior
which prompts our belief

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.730
is simply due to factors not
related to their misgivings

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.433
about their misdeeds.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.290
So, while maintaining my agnosticism,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.800
I reject the anthropomorphism as asserted.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.810
To assume dogs feel the emotion of guilt

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.850
is to presume apprehension that their

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.580
wrongdoings are violative of
a particular code of behavior,

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.750
and leads, inevitably, to punishment,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.870
befitting that apprehension.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.850
This punishment is inappropriate,
in light of the evidence.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.093
The claim as it stands is unsupportable.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.480
Is this analysis diminishing
of the dog's capacities?

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.260
Replacing human emotive
language with the jargon

00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:01.720
of animal behavior unnecessarily?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.360
I would object to this charge.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.990
In this experimental context,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.500
the capacity of the dog
was in full evidence.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.100
Dogs observe their people with great care,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.710
learn the associations
appropriate to the context,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.130
and then apply from their
expressive toolbox, a look

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.390
which is likely to result
in less punishment for them.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.223
(audience laughs)

00:38:23.223 --> 00:38:24.843
It is a rather becoming look.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.330
Indeed, dogs discover that they will be

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.560
more lightly punished if one is up front

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.994
about displaying guiltily.

00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:36.290
(audience laughs)

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.910
Our preemptive assertions about them

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.750
divert us from seeing what
has actually been learned,

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.590
from seeing their actual capacities.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.940
So, too, with other animals.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.480
An animal's ubiquity leads to
claims of its ordinariness,

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.950
with it's depreciating assumptions.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.830
Discovery of the little brown
bat's echo location ability

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.020
was delayed because it
was considered absurd

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.520
that bats might be
navigating with their ears,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.010
let alone emitting the high
frequency sounds by which echo

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.500
they would so navigate, as Donald Griffin

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.303
discovered only 70 years ago.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.420
That a homing pigeon might detect

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.883
the magnetic fields of the
Earth was thought preposterous.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.220
A rat smells in stereo,
but we can only think

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.223
of their elimination as a species.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.570
Our insistence on viewing
animals through a prism

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.620
that is based on our own
abilities or more pointedly,

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.120
our lack of abilities,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.243
has an astonishing limiting
effect on what we see.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:39.873
Finally, the subverting.

00:39:41.187 --> 00:39:44.120
Remember that
anthropomorphisms are at best,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.170
unproven assumptions, reliance
on unproven assumptions,

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.800
if using them is justification for, say,

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.340
fair treatment of
animals or animal rights,

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.723
could backfire, undermining the cause.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.800
For our pure eagerness
to see intelligence,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.230
emotional sophistication,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.000
or other forms of
humanness in other animals,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.740
is matched by our profound skepticism,

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.670
if it appears that we've been tricked

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.283
into believing in an
ability which is not there.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.680
I consider this a kind
of Clever Hans byproduct.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.440
Hans, of course, was a
horse of a century ago,

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.150
owned by a German schoolteacher,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.670
whose action influenced the course

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.070
of animal cognition research
for that subsequent century.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.574
His sobriquet, Clever
Hans, has come to stand

00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:34.080
for what he could not do,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.373
and also as a caution against
over-attributions to animals.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.660
For Hans, his owner claimed, could count.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.690
Shown an arithmetic
problem on a blackboard,

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.453
he tapped the sum with his hoof.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.174
In this way, Hans could also
spell, recognize colors,

00:40:52.174 --> 00:40:56.860
could identify musical
intervals and German coins,

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.183
and he could name the
days of the calendar.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.830
Such was the tenor of
the time that discovery

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.200
of these presumed latent
abilities of horses,

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.753
demonstrated by Hans,
created a small furor.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.100
While Hans had, of course,

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.080
been trained to hoof count or spell,

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.550
he was able to generalize,
solve novel problems,

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.160
and answer questions
delivered by new people.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.131
For a time it looked as though

00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:22.600
there was no other explanation

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.573
but that a horse was doing arithmetic.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.530
Finally, the trick, an inadvertent trick,

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.040
unknown even to Hans' owner,

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.563
was discovered by a
psychologist named Pfungst.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.340
When the person asking the question

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.244
did not himself know the
answer, Hans was wildly wrong.

00:41:41.244 --> 00:41:44.010
Hans was not actually doing mathematics

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.140
or reading German, but was
instead extremely focused

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.610
on his questioners posture and breath,

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.072
such that a relaxation of the shoulders,

00:41:52.072 --> 00:41:56.370
a raise of the eyebrows, or
a widening of the nostrils,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.513
served as cue that he had
tapped the correct answer,

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.340
whereby the pendulum of
opinion swung the other way.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.470
Despite the efforts of
Pfungst to highlight

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.440
Hans' astute body reading abilities,

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.527
the prevailing conclusion about Hans

00:42:13.527 --> 00:42:17.266
was not that not only was
he not doing arithmetic,

00:42:17.266 --> 00:42:19.860
but that he was without mental capacity,

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.433
a Cartesian automaton.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.930
Not that the horse would make
a very good police detective

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:29.350
or poker player, not that the
horse had a fantastic ability

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.590
to notice what were,
to the crowds of people

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.040
who had come to watch him perform,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.863
indiscernible muscle movements,
and endow them with meaning.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.750
Feeling duped, we take
absence of human skill

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.130
for absence of any skill.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.350
Hans retired but his legacy remains.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.530
The field of animal
cognition has developed

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.030
in response to the Clever Hans phenomenon,

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.170
a constant reminder to find
the simplest explanation,

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.500
putting aside whether it is wrong,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.013
of what an animal is doing.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.490
Should I have succeeded in making you feel

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.430
imperiled by our anthropomorphisms,
I would be remiss

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.530
were I not to offer an
alternative approach.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.610
We are not left with no way

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.740
to understand or connect to animals,

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.490
without our overweening attributions.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.320
For animals are regularly
demonstrating for us

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.810
just what they're able to do,

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:24.770
giving us hints at their experience,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.503
it remains only for us to
figure out how to look.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.440
To do that, I will
return, briefly, to art.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.490
There is a class of art
featuring a technique

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.887
and product known as anamorphosis.

00:43:37.787 --> 00:43:40.830
The image is rendered so as to be visible,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.630
comprehensible, from an oblique vantage,

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.853
not a straight on frontal perspective.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.040
As in famously, Holbein's
The Ambassadors of 1533.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.830
The anamorphic image, here,

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.900
the splash along the
bottom of the painting,

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.640
may first seem unintelligible,
skewed, meaningless,

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.080
but gains coherence on viewing
it on sidelong approach.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.300
The portrait was to be
hung along a staircase,

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.033
and the skull becomes
intelligible from that vantage.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.280
But, the human tendency is to first

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.730
loiter with the skewed image, and,

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.140
as with most things we encounter
that we find difficult,

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.110
try to discover some meaning

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.513
in what might actually be meaningless.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.870
Similarly, this gallery's
lettering choice seems

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.740
intentionally opaque, unreadable,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.360
until one comes at it the direction most

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.433
gallery goers would from
the corner of the block.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.140
I encourage a similar, sidelong,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.210
eccentric approach to dog behavior.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.740
Not just looking at them
from the side, as it were,

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.156
which would just give us an
image of the dog's flank,

00:45:02.156 --> 00:45:04.620
but instead of our offhand observations

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.410
of the dog in front of
us, observing the dog

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:11.850
as though he is unknown,
not yet understood.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.690
If the dog is read anamorphicly,

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.780
we see how our role, the
role of the observer of,

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.450
and considerer of dogs is part
of the act of construction,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.693
of who they are.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.100
What we find is that
we've been caught in a way

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.690
of looking at dogs which obstructs

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.443
the genuine understanding of them,

00:45:29.443 --> 00:45:32.160
what the German biologist
Jakob von Uexküll

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.563
called the umwelt of the
animal, the self-world,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.150
wrought of those things in the environment

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:42.333
which can be sensed by and
are salient to the animal.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.630
Just the imagining of the
perceptual world alone

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.030
is enough to get a quite different picture

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.500
of what say, a dog's behavior indicates.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.020
For instance, all that gazing at us,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.040
all that eye contact, while real,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.100
while a mutual retina exciting activity,

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.350
is also an occasion when the dog's nose

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:07.560
is pointed in our direction, and for dogs,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.220
olfaction is the primary sense.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:15.220
The way to perceive, understand,
and organize his world.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.862
He is looking, surely,
but he is more smelling.

00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:24.980
The expanse of nasal
anatomy of canis familiaris

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.440
attests to this, with
hundreds of millions more

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.320
olfactory cells in their
nose than have humans,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.953
as well as their corresponding
olfactory biased cortex.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.780
And quite visibly, their mode of

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.820
olfactory investigation attests to this.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.720
Dogs sniff at the rate
of two to three hertz,

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720
two to three snapshots a
second of the olfactory world.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.390
Dogs sniff into the breeze, into the fur

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.070
along a fellow dog's haunches,
into the corners of our eyes

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.400
which corners, in dogs,
release pheromones.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.170
Along besplattered fire
hydrants and fence posts.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:11.170
We ignore, diminish, even
discourage this behavior,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.343
but it is there to see.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.700
And, by watching sniffing very carefully,

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.080
using flow visualization techniques,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.830
researchers have extended our knowledge

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.380
of what is happening at those moments.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.105
For instance, the canine nostril sends

00:47:28.105 --> 00:47:30.662
expired air out through the side slits,

00:47:30.662 --> 00:47:35.610
which allows for near simultaneous
sniffing and expiring.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.300
These expirations function
as what are called

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.693
turbulent canine nostril air jets,

00:47:41.863 --> 00:47:42.862
(audience laughs)

00:47:42.862 --> 00:47:44.610
making any nearby odorant
molecules airborne,

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.583
and pushing more smelly
stuff into the nose.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.290
The dog's world is olfactory.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:55.220
Want to ask what is the
experience of the dog?

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.120
What is his essence?

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.810
Begin and build from there,
instead of deploying our visual,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.623
cognitive, and spiritual
language onto them.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.620
The dog's leash,
tethering him to our side,

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.143
circumscribes who can be at the end of it.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.540
Finally, to return to the
proposal which I began,

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:20.363
the immortality of dogs,
I have proof of that.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.513
Dogs live on after they have died.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.770
After publishing a book
on the scientific inquiry

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.752
into the minds of dogs,

00:48:29.752 --> 00:48:32.980
into the question of the
dog's umwelt, four years ago,

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.763
I began receiving letters,
emails, usually, from readers.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.766
I've received several
hundreds of these letters,

00:48:40.766 --> 00:48:45.236
sharing the reader's experience
of, appreciation for,

00:48:45.236 --> 00:48:47.840
sometimes lack of appreciation of the book

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.110
or asking question about why
their dog rolls in smelly

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.450
things he finds in the park.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.543
Most also include something else.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:57.883
A photo of their dog.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:02.483
In many cases it is a
photo of a deceased dog,

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:06.130
whose life prompted them
to pick up this book,

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.658
read it, report to me about
it, and to share a few stories

00:49:09.658 --> 00:49:11.393
from their dog's life.

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:15.093
These dogs are immortal.

00:49:17.843 --> 00:49:20.676
(audience laughs)

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.530
I posit that what concerns
us when we think about

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.350
the immortality of souls,
is for the most part,

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:54.143
the immortality bit, the
keeping on past death.

00:49:55.185 --> 00:49:58.820
Were it one's soul, one's
body, or one's left eyebrow

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.240
that continued on indefinitely,
it would be the same to us,

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.990
the indefinite us, that
unbroken continuity

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.663
is the crux of the matter.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.180
With humans, we grant this
immortality to each other

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.803
through commemoration, through
reputation, through memory.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.170
So, too, do we memorialize our dogs.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.620
We remember them, capture their images

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.383
in pocket sized photos, we write of them.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.370
When still alive there
is a way in which dogs

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.810
do not act as if bounded by time,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.913
even as we watch them age
and see them through illness,

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:40.930
for their joy at reunion with
their owners is constant,

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.690
were one absent a day or a month.

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.840
Their willingness to appear to

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.946
listen to or comfort us does not waver.

00:50:48.946 --> 00:50:52.090
They do not collect record of our faults,

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:56.713
our disorders or meanness,
but, keep steady company.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.330
We see them mirror us in the
mirror of our imagination,

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:03.143
our idealized selves.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.310
Their fidelity to us is not diminished

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.063
by the simple fact of death.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.650
To have granted the dogs this immortality,

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:14.470
one might suggest is paradoxical,

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.250
it is but another anthropomorphism,

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.890
just of the sort which I reject.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.783
But, a difference can be marked.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:25.237
Wittgenstein, though
speaking not of dogs, said,

00:51:25.237 --> 00:51:29.377
"My attitude toward him is
an attitude toward a soul.

00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:32.307
"I am not of the opinion
that he has a soul."

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.890
I am concerned with our
opinions about dogs.

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.610
Matters which can be found
to be sound or unsound.

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.960
At the same time, I strike a

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.120
fully attributive attitude toward them.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.320
I feel about them and treat them as though

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.123
they feel pride, pleasure, love.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.370
Testing my opinions can inform
my attitudes, to be sure,

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:01.280
but opinions do not determine
the significance of the thing.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.800
We should extend our
compassion and respect to dogs,

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.370
soul or no.

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:08.410
Their differences do not grant
us the right to dominate,

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:09.853
diminish, or destroy them.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.490
So, I challenge us
thusly, step back from the

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:18.424
distorted image of the animal
from the human vantage.

00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:21.980
The measure of the dog ought not be man.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.560
Look from the side, and see
that something else is there,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.143
the naturalized creature, the dog.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.913
He is probably looking right back at you.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.596
Thank you.

00:52:35.596 --> 00:52:38.346
(audience claps)

00:52:39.676 --> 00:52:42.843
(lighthearted music)
