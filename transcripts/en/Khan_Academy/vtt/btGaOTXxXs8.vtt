00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.230
Over here I've drawn
part of the graph of y

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.550
is equal to x squared.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.780
And what we're going
to do is use our powers

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.510
of definite integrals to find
volumes instead of just areas.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.400
So let's review what
we're doing when

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.980
we take just a regular
definite integral.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.410
So if we take the definite
integral between, say,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.580
0 and 2 of x squared dx,
what does that represent?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.040
Well, let's look
at our endpoints.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.050
So this is x is equal to 0.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
Let's say that this right
over here is x is equal to 2.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.390
What we're doing is
for each x, we're

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.600
finding a little dx around
it-- so this right over here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.430
is a little dx.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.220
And we're multiplying that
dx times our function,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.970
times x squared.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.910
So what we're doing is we're
multiplying this width times

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.440
this height right over here.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.110
The height right over
here is x squared.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.180
And we're getting the area
of this little rectangle.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.740
And the integral
sign is literally

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.940
the sum of all of these
rectangles for all of the x's

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.290
between x is equal to
0 and x is equal to 2.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.530
But the limit of that as these
dx's get smaller and smaller

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160
and smaller, get
infinitely small,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.990
but not being equal to 0.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.870
And we have an infinite
number of them.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.490
That's the whole power
of the definite integral.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.190
And so you can imagine, as these
dx's get smaller and smaller

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.550
and smaller, these rectangles
get narrower and narrower

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.174
and narrower, and we
have more of them,

00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:31.500
we are getting a better
and better approximation

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.780
of the area under the
curve until, at the limit,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.590
we are getting the
area under the curve.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.780
Now we're going to apply
that same idea, not

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.690
to find the area
under this curve,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.090
but to find the
volume if we were

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.120
to rotate this curve
around the x-axis.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.900
So this is going to stretch our
powers of visualization here.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.620
So let's think
about what happens

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.380
when we rotate this
thing around the x-axis.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.794
So if we were to rotate
it, and I'll look at it

00:01:57.794 --> 00:02:00.210
and say that we're looking it
a little bit from the right.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.890
So we get kind of a base that
looks something like this.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.940
So this is my best
attempt to draw it.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.990
So you have a base that
looks something like that.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.180
And then the rest
of the function,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.020
if we just think
about between 0 and 2,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.430
it looks like one
of those pieces

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.370
from-- I don't know if you
ever played the game Sorry--

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.910
or it looks like a little
bit of a weird hat.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.067
So it looks like this, and let
me shade it in a little bit

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.400
so it looks something like that.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.816
And just so that
we're making sure

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.590
we can visualize this
thing that's being rotated.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.250
We care about the entire
volume of the thing.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.720
Let me draw it from a
few different angles.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.290
So if I drew from the top, it
would look something like this.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.710
It'll become a
little more obvious

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.560
that it looks
something like a hat.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.534
It would point up like this,
and it goes down like that.

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:54.950
It would look
something like that.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.300
So in this angle, we're not
seeing the bottom of it.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.330
And if you were to
just orient yourself,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.060
the axes, in this
case, look like this.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.016
So this is the y-axis.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.640
And the x-axis goes right
inside of this thing

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.650
and then pops out
the other side.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.640
And if this thing
was transparent,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.960
then you could
see the back side.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.890
It would look
something like that.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.500
The x-axis, if you
could see through it,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.979
would pop the base
right over there,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.020
would go right through
the base right over there.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.880
And it'd come out
on the other side.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.260
So this is one orientation
for the same thing.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.810
You could visualize it
from different angles.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.540
So let's think about how we
can take the volume of it.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.210
Well, instead of thinking
about the area of each

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.850
of these rectangles, what
happens if we rotate each

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.880
of these rectangles
around the x-axis?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.360
So let's do it.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.680
So let's take each of these.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.540
Let's say you have this
dx right over here,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.140
and you rotate it
around the x-axis.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.560
So if you were rotate this
thing around the x-axis--

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.477
so I'm trying my best
to-- around the x-axis,

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.060
you rotate it.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.090
What do you end up with?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.920
Well, you get something that
looks kind of like a coin,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.970
like a disk, like a
quarter of some kind.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.330
And let me draw it out here.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.320
So that same disk out here
would look something like this.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.860
And it has a depth of dx.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.170
So how can we find the
volume of that disk?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.130
Let me redraw it out here, too.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.740
It's really important to
visualize this stuff properly.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.160
So this is my x-axis.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.320
My disk looks
something like this.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.270
My best attempt at the x-axis
sits it right over there.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.870
It comes out of the center.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.040
And then this is the
surface of my disk.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.430
And then this right over
here is my depth dx.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.980
So that looks pretty good.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.890
And then let me just
shade it in a little bit

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.740
to give you a little
bit of the depth.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.170
So how can we find
the volume of this?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.210
Well, like any disk
or cylinder, you just

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.360
have to think about what
the area of this face

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.100
is and then multiply
it times the depth.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.180
So what's the area of this base?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.260
Well, we know that
the area of a circle

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.720
is equal to pi r squared.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.990
So if we know the
radius of this face,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.440
we can figure out
the area of the face.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.910
Well, what's the radius?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.390
Well, the radius
is just the height

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.800
of that original rectangle.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.770
And for any x, the
height over here

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.900
is going to be equal to f of x.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.830
And in this case, f
of x is x squared.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.625
So over here, our radius
is equal to x squared.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.380
So the area of the
face for a particular x

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.940
is going to be equal to
pi times f of x squared.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.280
In this case, f
of x is x squared.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.710
Now, what's our
volume going to be?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.570
Well, our volume is going to be
our area times the depth here.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.530
It's going to be that
times the depth, times dx.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.810
So the volume of this thing
right over here-- so the volume

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.420
just of this coin, I
guess you could call it,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.660
is going to be equal to.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.890
So my volume is going to
be equal to my area times

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:36.270
dx, which is equal to pi
times x squared squared.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.310
So it's equal to pi--
x squared squared

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.620
is x to the fourth--
pi x to the fourth dx.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.710
Now, this expression
right over here,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.470
this gave us the volume
just of one of those disks.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.060
But what we want is the
volume of this entire hat,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.899
or this entire bugle
or cone-looking,

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.190
or I guess you could say the
front-of-a-trumpet-looking

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.690
thing.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.930
So how could we do that?

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.010
Well, the exact same technique.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.450
What happens if we were to take
the sum of all of these things?

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.060
So let's do that, take the
sum of all of these things.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.622
And I'll switch to one color--
pi times x to the fourth dx.

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:19.580
We're going take the sum
of all of these things

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.550
from x is equal to 0 to 2.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.010
Those are the boundaries
that we started off with.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.510
I just defined them arbitrarily.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.980
We could do this, really,
for any two x values--

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.100
between x is equal
to 0 and x equals 2.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.840
And we're going to take the
sum of the volumes of all

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.030
of these coins.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.634
But the limit-- as the depths
get smaller and smaller

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.550
and smaller and we have
more and more and more

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.220
coins, at the limit,
we're actually

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.460
going to get the volume
of our cone or our bugle

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.540
or whatever we want to call it.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.550
So if we just evaluate
this definite integral,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.610
we have our volume.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.240
So let's see if we can do that.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.159
And now this is just taking
a standard definite integral.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.200
So this is going to be
equal to-- and I encourage

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.380
you to try it out
before I do it.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.640
So we can take the pi out.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.130
So it's going to be equal
to pi times the integral

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.780
from 0 to 2 of x
to the fourth dx.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.470
I don't like that color.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.680
Now, the antiderivative
of x to the fourth

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.310
is x to the fifth over 5.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:21.720
So this is going to be equal to
pi times x to the fifth over 5.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.775
And we're going
to go from 0 to 2.

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:26.770
So this is going to be
equal to pi times this thing

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.440
evaluated at 2.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:27.940
Let's see.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.773
2 to the third is 8.

00:08:28.773 --> 00:08:29.970
2 to the fourth is 16.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.440
2 to the fifth is-- let
me just write it down.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.300
2 to the fifth over 5 minus
0 to the fifth over 5.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.799
And this is going
to be equal to-- 2

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.700
to the fifth is 32, so it's
going to be equal to pi times

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.690
32/5 minus-- well,
this is just 0--

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.790
minus 0, which is
equal to 32 pi over 5.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.480
And we're done.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.540
We were able to
figure out the volume

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.240
of this kind of wacky shape.
