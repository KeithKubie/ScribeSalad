00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When we want to model a wildfire, heat transport is obviously a vital phenomenon to consider.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's going to occupy us for the major part of this unit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To get started, let's look at this system.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a tank that completely isolated from its environment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that contains two different compartments one that is filled with water that's initially hot

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and another compartment that's filled with water that's initially cool.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, I want you to describe the flow of heat from one compartment to the other

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the temporal evolution of the temperature of the left part

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the temporal evolution of the temperature of the right part.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Temperature is just another expression for energy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Energy is being exchanged between those two compartments.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
To include that idea in our equations, we should be using the Kelvin scale for temperatures,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
not the Celsius scale and not the Fahrenheit scale.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
At least for an ideal gas, the temperature measured on the Kelvin scale

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is proportional to the energy content of that gas.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To model the system, we could say that for instance that every hour

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
10% of the energy content of the left compartment flows to the right compartment

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the same percentage per hour would flow from the right compartment to the left compartment.
