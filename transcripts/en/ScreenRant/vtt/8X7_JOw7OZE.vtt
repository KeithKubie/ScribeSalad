00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.820
There was a time when kids could enjoy an
animated classic without their parents worrying

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.740
about what they were really learning.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
Or so we thought.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.110
It isn't just modern kids films that conceal
adult issues, but some of the most beloved

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:26.060
movies of the past send some truly weird messages
that older fans may have never even realized.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.890
The Jungle Book
When the hero of your story is a boy raised

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.480
by a completely different species, and was
written by a man living through England's

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.840
colonization of India, it's obvious that ideas
and philosophies will overlap.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.549
Basically, Kipling's Jungle Book can be seen
as a massive metaphor for Britain's view of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.440
India, with Mowgli in Britain's role, and
the animals as Indians.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.360
But the bigger message is a bit less disturbing,
since the jungle boy eventually learns that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
human villagers are just as strange to animals
as the other way around - it's just a matter

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
of perspective.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.390
Still, the overall message of people sticking
with their own kind is always going to be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.890
a tricky one to explain to kids.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.920
The Lion King There was no better King than
Mufasa, and his parents obviously knew it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.189
the moment he was born, naming him after an
actual African King.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.820
But you have to wonder: what was his brother
Scar's name BEFORE he got the Scar?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.460
Disney's Lion King novels revealed his name
was originally "Taka," but he took the name

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.190
Scar so he'd never forget how anger and jealousy
almost cost him an eye.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.360
Since that actually makes him seem decent,
it's probably his parents who are to blame

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:34.860
for him turning out evil: in Swahili, "Taka"
means dirt, or trash.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.210
Harsh.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
The Secret of NIMH
This cult classic may not have come from Disney,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.400
but its tale of intelligent mice and rats
earned it critical acclaim - from adults.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.390
But kids might have missed the actual disturbing
story at work, thanks to the magic elements

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.660
added to the book it's based on.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.710
The flashback to the rats and other animals
being tested is scary to young viewers, but

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
older ones able to grasp that NIMH is really
the National Institute of Mental Health may

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.160
realize that the movie is one big warning
about what medical research can create if

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.920
the ones in charge go too far.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.099
All Dogs Go To Heaven
You can't even blame a bad dog for being that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.800
way, since, as this hugely successful movie
taught us, all dogs go to heaven.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.030
Or, at least kids are led to believe that.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.410
When the star dog gives up heaven to head
back to Earth, he's warned that if he dies

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.350
again, he won't return - but he's never told
what will happen instead.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.530
But as he starts making dishonest, selfish
choices, a nightmare sequence confirms what

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.740
every older viewer fears: where there's a
doggie heaven, there's a doggie hell.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.820
Kids might see it as just a bad dream, but
the lava, the demonic doggie devil, and even

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.450
the hellhounds tearing at Charlie's hair are
pretty grim for a movie with such a sweet

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.780
message.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.370
The Good Dinosaur
It's the classic story of a boy and his dog

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.020
- except the boy is the dog this time around,
with a dinosaur named Arlo as the star.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.660
Pixar is know for jokes aimed squarely at
parents, but The Good Dinosaur goes further

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.350
than usual when the heroes start to bond over
what else?

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.570
An intense drug trip.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.640
Thanks to some fermenting fruit, the two of
them get hallucinating instantly, leaving

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.781
younger audiences wondering how bad fruit
can swap the characters heads, and send them

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:10.781
flying through the air.

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.600
While older viewers realize what story the
filmmakers are really telling.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.319
Alice in Wonderland
Every kid learns about Alice's journey down

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.940
the rabbit hole sooner or later, and when
every one of them sees it again as an adult,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.240
it's hard to believe that it's basically all
just one big drug trip.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.849
Well, maybe not according to Disney, but watching
as Alice eats magical mushrooms that make

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.260
her feel giant, tiny, or floating through
the air all speak for themselves.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.069
Why parents would tease their kids with the
amazing adventures eating mushrooms can take

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.489
them on is a mystery.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.770
That's not even mentioning the slow, drowsy
caterpillar who can't stop smoking... something.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.840
Use your imagination.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.489
The Little Mermaid
She wasn't the first Disney princess to ignore

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.670
her parents advice, but Ariel the mermaid
went farther than most, basically making a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.560
deal with the devil, swapping her tail for
legs after falling in love with a man.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.750
But the deal has a catch: if he doesn't fall
in love with her fast enough, she loses everything.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.780
It's a chance to tell a serious cautionary
tale, or at least it would be, if the movie

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.500
didn't end with the evil Witch murdered, and
Ariel living happily ever after.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.420
Basically, teaching kids that selling your
soul is a bad idea...

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
If you don't do the smart thing, and kill
the one you sold it to.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.710
Wreck-it Ralph
Being the bad guy isn't anyone's first choice,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.530
so when Ralph decides he wants to be a Hero
instead, he makes his dream come true.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.530
Well, not quite.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.449
You see, in the video game universe, it doesn't
really matter if you want to be a Hero or

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.449
villain...

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.199
Things only work if everyone plays their role.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.939
It's a surprisingly depressing message to
send to kids, revealing that bad guys don't

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.830
necessarily have to be BAD guys.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.259
They can be good at heart...

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.259
But yeah.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.479
They're still bad.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.539
Snow White
There are a few Disney morals that never change:

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.559
love beats hate, good beats evil, and nothing
is as important as being beautiful.

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.309
That's the message made clear by Snow White,
who almost gets killed for breaking and entering,

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.069
until the dwarves see her face.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:13.759
It's even her beauty that sends the evil Queen
after her, in fact it's the only reason.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.499
Get the message kids, being beautiful saves
lives, but can also get you killed.

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.710
And after she's eaten the poisoned apple,
what is it that breaks the Curse?

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.039
She's so beautiful, Prince charming can't
help but kiss her when he lays eyes on her

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.199
lifeless body.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.879
Creepy.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.780
Zootopia
It isn't hard to see how many serious messages

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.419
are sent with this Disney hit, since it all
begins when a strange new drug - cooked in

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.979
a secret lab by a sheep version of Breaking
Bad's - starts turning everyday animals into

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.750
out of control maniacs.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.080
Add the fact that it's only minorities turning
feral, with the police suggesting they're

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.319
biologically prone to violence, and whether
intentional or not, Zootopia couldn't be more

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.680
relevant to the issues of racism in today's
world.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.139
Those are the children's movies we found sending
some seriously complicated or downright weird

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.870
messages to their audience, but which ones
have we missed?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.110
