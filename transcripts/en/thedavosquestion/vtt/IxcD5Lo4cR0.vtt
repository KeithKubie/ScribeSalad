00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Julia, and I'm going to be on a
panel debate about female

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.789
genital mutilation.
It's a really complex issue.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.880
It's a human rights cause.
And the YouTube community voted for me to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.200
go to Davos to have this
debate.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.940
The debate will be facilitated by Nick Kristof,
who's an award-winning

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.770
journalist for the New York Times as well
as other experts and leaders

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.910
on the panel.
And what we want is for the community to pose

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.800
questions.
So please go to YouTube.com/Davos and either

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.100
video or text in your
questions.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.430
Also, favorite the ones that you like the
best.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.949
We'll be picking the favorite questions and
be putting them to the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.180
panel, so please submit a question now.
The deadline is Saturday, the 30th of January.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.170
And we really look forward to answering them
live at Davos.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.820
