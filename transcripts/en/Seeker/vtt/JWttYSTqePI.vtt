00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.800
Let's say I only wanted to eat natural food…
what exactly does that mean?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.350
Natural…

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.669
Sup sup nature-eaters, Trace back again with
you at DNews.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.100
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration
decided to look into 'natural' as a food label.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.050
We'll see what the FDA decides, but on their
website they specifically say, 'natural' foods

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.610
are difficult to define because all food goes
through processing.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.290
They don't object to using natural on a food
if it doesn't have synthetic substances or

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.660
artificial flavors, but otherwise?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.660
Pbhht.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.440
Could be anything up in there.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.120
For example, would you say red grapefruit
is natural?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120
Probably.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.030
It's a tasty breakfast delight.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.330
But, the first red grapefruit was a natural
mutant which lost its color as it matured,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.430
so companies irradiated the seeds of that
red mutant grapefruit creating the Star Ruby

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.700
and Rio Red grapefruit in the 1970s and 80s.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.200
Are irradiated mutant fruits 'natural?'

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.030
You'd probably think so, until I call them
that.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.500
The problem is, no one knows!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.750
What is natural food?

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.500
We probably don't have any!

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.310
So now the FDA has quite the task ahead of
them, because they have to decide what 'natural'

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.540
means in our food chain.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.420
Almost ALL soybeans and corn are genetically
modified food products, in fact two thirds

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.150
of all food in the US is genetically modified
-- and 80 to 90 percent of the bacterial enzymes

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.140
which create hard cheeses are too.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.060
Is parmesean not natural?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.340
Is genetically modified food NOT real food
somehow?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.030
In the 1990s, papaya were being devastated
by disease, but genetic modification saved

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.430
them, and now 77 percent of all papaya are
GM.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.020
Squash, Zucchini… all have species which
are genetically modified organisms…

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.110
Which isn't inherently a bad thing…

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.740
Hundreds and hundreds of scientific papers
agree, GMOs are not dangerous, and the World

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.880
Health Organization has noted no negative
effects on human health from eating GM foods!

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.340
Natural foods are not necessarily better for
you across the board than other foods, it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.789
the same with organics.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.980
The problem with Internet debates on food
is, food is complicated.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.170
Genetically modified organisms are plants,
animals and microbes where genes have been

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.200
artificially inserted in a lab -- NOT through
selective breeding or natural recombination.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.790
But once they're modified, they grow just
like any other thing.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.480
If scientists add genes from a rice crop that
evolved in drought-stricken place to rice

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.599
with a high yield, ideally we'd have a drought-resistant
plentiful crop!

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.890
And it would grow just like any other rice…
only… more… and in drier places.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.800
Is that natural?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.620
*shrug* Is that good!

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.040
In the era of climate change, maybe.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.120
What we commonly hear, is natural foods FEEL
a certain way.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120
That's just marketing.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.620
The Journal of Business Ethics found when
people touch things that say "fair trade"

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.620
or "made with organic ingredients" they feel
better about themselves -- it's called the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.440
positive contagion effect.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.280
They feel as though they're more ethical because
they associate with something they believe

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.510
to be ethical.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.580
And maybe that's the crux of this 'natural'
and 'organic' debate!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.239
A 2015 paper in Cell hypothesizes that we
freak out about natural and GMO because we

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.800
don't reason, we intuit, we go with our gut!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.800
We use intuition and say, GMOs and cold and
scientific... they're bad, natural feels good!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.879
In all this hubbub a major point is lost -- blanket
statements about global food security and

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.090
supply are useless.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.879
All natural foods are not one thing, neither
are all organics or all GMOs.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.940
The World Health Organization said "safety
should be assessed on a case-by-case basis…"

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.210
And until the FDA does create a solid definition
of what 'natural' means -- scientists can't

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.090
create studies comparing natural to non-natural.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.780
Sure, not all GMOs are above reproach, but
that's more about the admittedly shady agribusinesses,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.220
not necessarily the foods themselves; geneticists
have created tomatoes that resist frost, apples

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.430
that don't brown, and salmon that grow faster
for fish farming… all great things in a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.560
planet with a changing climate and growing
population.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.759
Obviously, skepticism in this area is important,
but going with your gut?

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.289
That's a good way to eat, but not a good way
to think.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.770

How do y'all feel about GMOs and natural vs
regular old food.
