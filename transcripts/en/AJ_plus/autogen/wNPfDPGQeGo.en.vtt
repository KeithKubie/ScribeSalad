00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.250
 in the multi viral 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.329
 as they define his music he tried it 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.760
 I will not be able to define spinning 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.010
 everything for me has so many aspects 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.980
 street 13 what 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.559
 what is better to feel it as an energy 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.769
 that is there and that is 13th street 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.949
 I would say that you represent a 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.649
 Latin resistance at a certain point 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.930
 How do you respond to that which is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.960
 how they represent a fight that's how 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.970
 a double-edged knife because that is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 all those titles that put us where 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.640
 we represent a fight and all that we 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 it turns out we sometimes 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 counterproductive 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.619
 this 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
 there are people who misunderstand they believe that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.430
 we grab that baton and we want 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.110
 we feel that we are the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.680
 revolutionaries that we want to represent 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.210
 to everyone and that is not true and I 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.840
 I prefer to simplify the basics we do 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.830
 honest music we document a moment 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.049
 a time by means of music and 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.320
 when they ask us for help we are there to 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.320
 help 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 Well here we are in the USA and the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.560
 people from a recital here in san 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 francisco are screaming boricua 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.860
 Mexican people are very energized 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 very energized worth for their countries by 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 Latin America I do not know I think they fill a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.069
 empty there yes I do not know if it's politics or something 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.410
 more I think it's all I hope you're 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.650
 The entire proposal is composed of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 in many issues it's not just the political 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.500
 not only the social brings love too 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.200
 dance is educated occur I have no more 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.069
 trivial 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.890
 and then I go 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.780
 that's just what life is about with a 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.909
 moment in the life of any being 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.819
 human that the moment of love the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.819
 moment of dancing political moments there 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.040
 moments to help in moments of 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.489
 discomfort the moment of being happy and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.560
 that is what we propose that 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.040
 must understand people about puerto rico 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.629
 and its relationship with the us a new 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.549
 puerto rico in a colony of states 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.379
 united of a small amount wants 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.469
 be independent independence not 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.450
 it means that you hate the us or what 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.310
 you are going to make enemy now of it not 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 can be friends the other way around that they can 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.340
 negotiate you can open to negotiate with 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.340
 different countries 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.050
 you do not have to be asking for permission 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.970
 to a country to do anything not 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.660
 you have to go to war for wars 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.660
 that are not yours 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.409
 you have a president by whom you vote 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 we do not vote for obama but let's go 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.060
 our president is like half 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.530
 unfair is super old-fashioned what 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.269
 what is happening put up 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.190
 after the time I do not know about the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.920
 colonizers that we are still a 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.720
 colony is like having slaves still 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.260
 although there are slaves I think that still 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.920
 there are slaves 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.590
 this here the many emigrants who 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.959
 they work for nothing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.239
 but then like having slaves with him 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.709
 whip the same in a colony of these 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.709
 heights is ridiculous 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.060
 do not come to me 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 conversation
