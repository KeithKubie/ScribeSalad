00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.940
So I have the equation 7 minus
10/x is equal to 2 plus 15/x.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.550
And so this isn't
the type of equation

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.780
that you might think that
you're used to solving.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.640
But I'll give you a
few moments to see

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.210
if you can solve it on your own.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.260
Well, what we'll see is we
can do a quick multiplication

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.740
of both sides to actually
simplify this to a form

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.990
that we are more
used to looking at.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.630
So what's probably bothering
you, because it's bothering me,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.220
is these x's that we have in the
denominators right over here.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.144
We're like, well, how
do we deal with that?

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.060
Well, whenever we see
an x in the denominator,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.400
the temptation is
to multiply it by x.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.620
But we can't just multiply
one of the terms by x.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.320
We have to multiply
the entire side by x.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.850
So we could multiply
this entire side by x.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.280
But we can't just multiply
the left-hand side by x.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.130
We'd also want to multiply
the right-hand side by x.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.790
And so what will that give us?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.800
Well, we distribute the x.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.190
We get x times 7 is 7x.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
And then x times
negative 10/x, well,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.750
that's just going
to be negative 10.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.990
So you get negative
10 right over there.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.750
So the left-hand side
simplifies to 7x minus 10.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.810
And then your right-hand
side, once again,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.512
distribute the x.
x times 2 is 2x.

00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:21.890
x times 15/x, well,
x times something

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.910
over x is just going to be
the something. x times 15/x

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.270
is just going to
be 15-- plus 15.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.180
So now we've simplified
this to a linear equation.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.220
We have the variable
on both sides.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.210
So we just have to do
some of the techniques

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.001
that we already know.

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.500
So the first thing
that I like to do

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.210
is maybe get all my x's
on the left-hand side.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.490
So I want to get rid of
this 2x right over here.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.510
So I subtract 2x from
the right-hand side.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.170
Now, and I always remind
you, I can't do that just

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.140
to the right-hand side.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.420
If I did it just to
the right-hand side,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.190
it wouldn't be an
equality anymore.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.430
You have to do that to the
left-hand side as well.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.470
And so we are left with-- let
me get that pink color again.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.590
On the left-hand side, 7x, 7 of
something minus 2 of something,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.340
well, you're going to have 5
of that something, minus 10.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.720
These two x's negate each other.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.060
And you're left with equals 15.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.060
Now we can get rid
of this negative 10

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.205
by adding 10 to both sides.

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:21.580
You know, I like
that green color

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.550
when I do stuff to both sides.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.680
So I can add 10 to both sides.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.860
And I'm left with
5x-- these negate

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.460
each other-- is equal to 25.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.700
And this is the home stretch.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.510
You see where this is going.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.620
We can divide both sides by 5.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.860
And we are left with
x is equal to 5.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.170
Now let's verify that
this actually worked.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.030
So let's go back to
the original equation.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.430
We have 7 minus 10/5.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.160
This needs to be
equal to-- I'm just

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.570
taking our 5 and
substituting it back here.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.020
This needs to be
equal to 2 plus 15/5.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.070
So this is 7 minus 10/5.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.980
This is just 2.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.780
It needs to be equal to 2
plus 15/5, which is just 3.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.580
So 2 plus 3, 7 minus
2 is 5, 2 plus 3 is 5,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.780
5 is indeed equal to 5.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.730
And we are done.
