00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.210
So essentially, I mean, when we're making this

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.262
all of our attendees where going to cloudstock.

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.930
&gt;&gt; If we had had multiple festivals, I

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.660
assume, I don't think, we didn't do anything to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.260
say, hey, you know, keep track of, make sure

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.420
that these attendees are going to one certain festival.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.500
&gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, so, we would have to add a filter into our report.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.311
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.310
&gt;&gt; To be, especially for just one festival with CloudStock. So.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; We could say total CloudStock revenue.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.580
&gt;&gt; This is really total of all festivals, as is.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.750
&gt;&gt; As is. But, yeah. So let's go into our report.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.875
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.009
&gt;&gt; And modify that.
