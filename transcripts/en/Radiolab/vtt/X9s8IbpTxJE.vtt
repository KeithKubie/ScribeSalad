1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.870
An upscale mall in Nairobi has turned into a battleground.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.500
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.060
<v 2>armed men stormed Westgate Mall in the Canyon Capitol just before lunchtime,</v>

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.370
firing weapons and throwing grenades.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.930
What appears to witnesses to be at least a dozen gunman have taken hostages

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.270
inside. Others have reported that the,

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.590
<v 0>there have been reports. There have been unsubstantiated reports. No, no.</v>

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.010
Let me not do those ones. Kenyan police and counter terrorism officers are,

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.300
I almost feel like I need to start with the caveat that all these other stories

10
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.480
that we've, you know, gotten to do together, frequent gunfire and, um,

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.820
have been me telling you a story. As a journalist, I feel like this story,

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.370
it's going to be a story where I'm going to have to stop being a journalist at

13
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.990
some point. Hey, I'm Jetta. Boom, Rod Iron Robert Krulwich,

14
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.020
Radiolab. Oh, check your age. I keep waiting for you to say yes,

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.330
but we don't do that. And we don't say anymore.

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.750
You just heard that was NPRs east Africa correspondent, Greg Warner,

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.350
who's done a bunch of stories with us recently. He came to us with another one.

18
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.060
It was all about a struggle.

19
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:07.780
He was having trying to figure out how to tell a story.

20
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.170
That is true. I'll just leave it at that.

21
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.380
It's actually a story about the aftermath of an event that um,

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.820
probably got more media coverage than almost any event in east Africa last year

23
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:19.654
and that is the,

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.750
the terrorist attack on Westgate Mall in Nairobi. Uh,

25
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.150
this was uh, September 21st, 2013.

26
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.180
It was a kind of Balmy Saturday afternoon Westgate shopping mall crowded with

27
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.930
more than a thousand shoppers.

28
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.770
Even more families than usual were there that day because there was a children's

29
00:01:38.771 --> 00:01:42.490
cooking competition. In fact, the kids were just sitting up their ingredients.

30
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.650
Parents are just taking their seats when, um, shortly after noon

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.950
<v 1>[inaudible] gunman</v>

32
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.200
<v 2>entered the building shooting AK 47 is going Florida for killing people and the</v>

33
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:57.410
seats would last for 48.

34
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.693
<v 1>Hello</v>

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.820
<v 2>now for four days. Essentially I end, you know,</v>

36
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:08.821
like dozens of international and [inaudible] and local journalists are outside

37
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.980
the mall listening to the sounds of it

38
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.063
<v 1>done. Fuck.</v>

39
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.810
<v 2>I'm trying to guess what's happening inside because the press is of course not</v>

40
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:20.710
allowed in. While this,

41
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.100
while this battle is only going while I'm getting on the air every hour,

42
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.460
sometimes trying to just piece things together. Once they were inside,

43
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:29.640
they continued to shoot. I'm mentioning a,

44
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.020
there's a plume of tear gas coming my way.

45
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.040
So I'm going to have to try not to cough as I'm answering this, uh,

46
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.190
this question, Gregory move as you need to move.

47
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.610
But my point is that there was no information at the scene other than this

48
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.600
gunfire, what there was, were a whole,

49
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.700
<v 0>a bunch of survivors.</v>

50
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.900
<v 1>How do you feel? Great. Help us help.</v>

51
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.560
<v 2>Yeah. In fact, all the journalists, myself included,</v>

52
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:00.130
were racing around interviewing eye witnesses. Everybody was, I mean, uh,

53
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 0>everybody was, uh, really running for their lives,</v>

54
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.130
<v 3>talking to them and also to Kenyan officials to get a picture of what happened.</v>

55
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:11.750
And the story that emerges from those interviews is basically this,

56
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.060
that the number of terrorists

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.900
<v 0>inside that mall, or at least the beginning,</v>

58
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.850
was 10 to 15 gunmen to between 10 and 15 gunman, 10 to 15 attackers,

59
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.680
up to 15 arms militants with her profile is multiethnic, Kenya,

60
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.560
the United Kingdom, and you know, Arab origin.

61
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.940
This is like a rainbow coalition of Somalis, Kenyans, Arabs,

62
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.560
mostly men, but also including a British woman and a young British woman.

63
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.110
They call the fight widow eye witnesses,

64
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:44.740
eye witnesses on different floors in the mall, all talking about their gunman,

65
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.090
the people they saw. And it's this multiethnic group. And then of course,

66
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.930
perhaps most alarmingly for the, those of us, you know, living in Nairobi,

67
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.931
there's reports that at least one gunman had after shooting some people thrown

68
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.700
away his gun and actually escape with the fleeing shoppers.

69
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.240
We hear that from a couple of witnesses. So, um,

70
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.920
that's the initial story, but it's not really until eight weeks later,

71
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.210
uh,

72
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.210
in November that u s officials invite about a dozen British and American

73
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.990
journalists into a conference room in the u s embassy.

74
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.830
And we meet in official there from the FBI?

75
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.550
<v 3>Uh, no,</v>

76
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.990
we had known that the FBI was involved in the postmortem analysis teams from the

77
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.500
United States in Europe joined the investigation.

78
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.970
So this is like a global terrorism events.

79
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:41.740
So Kenya had invited Scotland Yard and the FBI to figure out who these

80
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.670
terrorists were.

81
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.450
But the FBI had not actually said anything officially in this meeting.

82
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.200
Inside the US embassy was on what's called deep background,

83
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.770
which isn't even off the record. It's, it's a, it's a deeper level of secrecy.

84
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.120
We weren't at that time even allowed to say that a US official head said any of

85
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.260
this stuff. This was just information for us to know. Since then, uh,

86
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.590
I can talk about this meeting because everything that was revealed there has now

87
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.720
become a part of the public record. In fact,

88
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:10.540
the FBI's has come out publicly and said all these things,

89
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.160
but at the time this was new

90
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.870
and what the FBI, uh,

91
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.960
person said at the time was that his team had access to all the closed circuit

92
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:24.840
camera footage. Remember, this is, this is a mall. It's a modern mall.

93
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:26.220
So there's cameras everywhere.

94
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.370
He's seen it from the beginning to the end of the attack from all those

95
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.220
different perspectives and that according to that footage,

96
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.640
everything that we had reported in those first few days was wrong.

97
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.770
Wrong. Ron, in what way?

98
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.840
<v 0>For instance, 10 to 15 terrorists? No, there weren't 10 to 15 terrorists.</v>

99
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.520
There were four, four. They also said, okay, you've been reporting this a,

100
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.040
this multiethnic coalition of Arabs,

101
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.340
Kenyans and Somalis that so many eyewitnesses told, you know,

102
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.880
they're all Somalis, they're all Somalia, ethnicity, all four of them.

103
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.940
And there was also no evidence than any of the gunman escaped.

104
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.850
I'm just curious from his perspective with where's he trying to, I don't know.

105
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.430
What was your read on this meeting? I actually felt,

106
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.550
and I know other people in that room felt a huge sense of relief because you

107
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.930
know, here we are all are trying to do the work of journalism, you know,

108
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.931
trying to get credible testimony and suddenly here's a guy saying,

109
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.860
okay, take away all that speculation, all those contradictory stories,

110
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.400
all those different reports. Here's some objective evidence.

111
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.150
You can't see this state because it's secret for various antiterrorism reasons,

112
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:40.490
but this is solid.

113
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.830
And after that time details tonight about the man,

114
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.290
everybody was reporting the same thing.

115
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.710
Unreleased surveillance video shows for arm to Salem only for terrorists,

116
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.710
for terrorist cameras show for arm to sales force suspects are believed to be

117
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:59.690
from Somali or all Somalis will confirm that all four were killed and none

118
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.280
escaped. The attack is on our debt.

119
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.630
So it kind of put a cap on all those conspiracy theories and speculations that

120
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.020
we're really filling the media. You weren't the slightest bit curious about why,

121
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.970
what might've been left out? Well, I mean, what I guess I really felt was, um,

122
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.663
was sort of empty.

123
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.230
<v 5>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.421
<v 0>You know,</v>

125
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:24.421
I'm not only a reporter in Nairobi or I'm also a person living in Nairobi.

126
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.280
I mean, I mean I live here, you know, I go to dinner parties,

127
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.570
I take my kid to birthday parties and you know,

128
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.870
I remember especially then in the first months after west gate or so many people

129
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.450
in that mall, invariably somebody would be there at the party.

130
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:41.440
You had their own survivors story. And you know, it's one thing to say,

131
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:45.880
oh well that was all this eyewitness testimony. You know, it's not accurate,

132
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.910
but it's another thing to look into the eyes of somebody who's sitting there

133
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.760
with a paper plate of cake in their hand telling you that the terrorist that

134
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.950
they saw is not the terrorist that they saw on this bit of footage that had been

135
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.070
released and was playing on heavy rotation on Kenyan television.

136
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.840
Did that happen more than once? It was, yeah,

137
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.220
and it happened much more than once. I mean, you want me to use your own,

138
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:13.870
your first name and say Pony my nickname. I'll give you an example.

139
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.280
My friend pruny former neighbor of mine in Nairobi that Saturday morning she

140
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.910
went into the West Gate Mall to get present for her friend's daughter.

141
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.080
I think it was a puzzle, a little puzzle for a four year old girl.

142
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.820
And I'm standing there, I'm just about to pay. And then, Ooh,

143
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.280
explosion automatic weapons. [inaudible] you know, there were shooting,

144
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:39.400
you could hear the, the grenades and like she says, she ran out of the store,

145
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:41.660
passing a bunch of chairs and tables that have been set up,

146
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.110
that cooking competition. I didn't have much time to think.

147
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:47.950
I just ducked under one of those tables. And then it got quite

148
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.873
<v 1>okay.</v>

149
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.710
<v 0>You could hear people praying, muttering prayers. Um,</v>

150
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.750
she said she heard a man gasping for breath and she says at one point another

151
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:02.430
woman was under the table with her.

152
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.300
Her and I would literally get squeezed together. She was pregnant.

153
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.160
She was pregnant. Yeah. And that's the first thing she said. She was like,

154
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.850
I'm pregnant and I'm shot. I didn't have the presence of mind to help her.

155
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.530
She basically took one of those drapes and wrapped it around.

156
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.210
Um, I'd like to stop the bleeding later on. I mean,

157
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.200
cause we were there for quite some time. She said to me, I'm dying.

158
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.510
And um, yeah, at that point I was stroking her hair saying, no, you're not.

159
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.580
You're fine. It's just your leg is just your leg.

160
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.490
And 20 says that while she was under that table,

161
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.820
she would try to peek up through the cloth and for the longest time I couldn't

162
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:45.630
see anything. Finally, I see, I see the guys

163
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

164
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.390
<v 0>too. There was two young boys, cute little young innocent looking boys,</v>

165
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.810
you know? Yeah.

166
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.250
It's hard to match and you can't reconcile what they're doing with how they

167
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.340
look. One of them was was kind of, I don't know,

168
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:06.690
maybe a 1718 year old kid and cute. I mean he's just,

169
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.140
I could just see him as being the son of one of my friends.

170
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.980
This particular one who was closest to us was wearing a red tee shirt and here's

171
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:20.550
where you get to a small but significant discrepancy that still haunts spooning.

172
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.140
She says she is sure that the two guys she saw and they're just a few feet away

173
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:25.974
from her,

174
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.100
were wearing short sleeve shirts and afterwards keep seeing these images of four

175
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:35.460
guys, none of whom are wearing short sleeve. I mean at the beginning,

176
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:37.440
if you remember, they were saying they were 15 guys,

177
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:39.240
so then it kind of made sense that,

178
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:42.870
well the two guys that I saw were different from the four that we're seeing on

179
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.980
TV. But then when people like me started to report that there were only four

180
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.240
categorically only four guys, then I started to say, wait, wait a minute.

181
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.760
I saw their arms. I know I saw short sleeve tee shirts.

182
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.930
You know, it just does not make sense. Nothing adds up. You start to think,

183
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:05.250
am I crazy? Uh, is my mind playing tricks on me?

184
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:08.970
I think I saw one thing and then I didn't, but I'm quite sure I saw this.

185
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:10.380
I mean every day,

186
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.370
every moment of the day you're thinking about what happened,

187
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.180
what happened that day, you know, at these parties out here,

188
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:21.320
all of these stories like Bruni's the wort, the official narrative,

189
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.880
and yet they felt real. All the details seemed weird enough to be true,

190
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.710
surreal enough to be true. You know, another person was talking about, yeah,

191
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.580
if his powerful story where with the this man was shooting and then he got a

192
00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:39.581
phone call and stopped shooting long enough to answer the phone and then hang up

193
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.640
and start shooting again.

194
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.830
I mean it's like you don't make details like that up and this is what I think

195
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:53.830
made things so awkward at those conversations because they knew the terrorist

196
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.040
they saw was different then on the video and what that left them with.

197
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:01.901
Two things.

198
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.901
One is that that I might think that they were lying and two,

199
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.010
that the terrorist that haunts them is still out there.

200
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.440
He know that guy could just be around

201
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.010
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

202
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.420
<v 6>He could see me again. Yeah,</v>

203
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.060
<v 3>and here's where things get a little weird. Okay, so this is four months later.</v>

204
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.210
Definitely. The news cycle is kind of moved on as a journalist.

205
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.810
I don't really have to report on Westgate anymore. At Saturday afternoon, again,

206
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.410
I'm actually just at home with my kid and

207

<v 8>to call.</v>

209
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.290
That kind of up ended the whole story for him and that's after the break.

244
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.320
This is Radiolab and we'll get back to Greg, uh,

245
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.500
reporter Greg Warner's story of the aftermath of the West Gate,

246
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.470
a terror attack in Nairobi, Kenya. You just heard the beginning.

247
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.380
We're not going to tell you the end if there is an end. Yeah,

248
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.380
and we'll pick things up with, uh, Greg getting a phone call.

249
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.630
I get a phone call from a guy who we haven't met yet. The guy named Faruq.

250
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.540
Now a Faruq is not his real name.

251
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:21.820
He asked Greg to change his name for the story.

252
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.570
It'll become clear why and a bit later and they'll for roots.

253
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.770
<v 11>Can you go further up please, please.</v>

254
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.050
Cause we're right in the line group is one of the first people I met in the

255
00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:35.740
parking lot on that first day of the attack. Anybody who was a, I mean,

256
00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:40.600
I just had gunfire, gunshots, and I was just, uh, everybody was running away.

257
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.350
It was when I met him. He was actually trying to reach his fiance.

258
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.530
She's stuck in them. Still in there. She's not picking the phone.

259
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.710
I've even written in the message. I don't mess it up. I'm okay. How are you?

260
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.500
She's not just bonded yet. Even I lost my specs,

261
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.700
lost his eyeglasses as he was fleeing. So, oh, let me see if you want,

262
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.290
what name are you looking for? Right to read it.

263
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.290
You hadn't gotten a text from her at messages? No reply. Then, uh, uh,

264
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.060
I called her no replay. What happened? What do I have to switch?

265
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.213
Which she killed.

266
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.970
<v 0>Oh yeah. She was later found among the, uh, bodies at the morgue and Oh gosh.</v>

267
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.190
But then a week later I met back up with Farrukh and he told me some things that

268
00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:27.390
he had not told me that morning

269
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.680
<v 11>from first floor, everybody was going to second floor.</v>

270
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.960
There was this moment in the mall,

271
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.520
utter panic where a bunch of people were running up the escalator and one of the

272
00:16:36.521 --> 00:16:40.180
terrorists came down the opposite way down the escalator,

273
00:16:40.181 --> 00:16:44.560
and this guy was pushing everybody down the trucking's somehow for, he says,

274
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.640
you got spun around in the opposite direction of the crowd, and then I saw him.

275
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.140
He gets a good look at this guy. I saw the person very, very clearly.

276
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.160
This person, he was an Arab guy. He says he's sure of it. Yes.

277
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.720
And then he says that he ran and found a hiding spot and after some time he

278
00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:04.210
pokes his head out and he saw him again.

279
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.850
When I told this guy you were standing his clothes,

280
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.510
he had clothes on him. No, but he removed those clothes.

281
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.320
Then he was wearing another clocks inside another platoon site. Basically.

282
00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:21.700
He says that after that first part of the siege, the guy changed his clothes,

283
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.940
dropped his gun, and then insinuated himself into the crowd. And, uh,

284
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.040
when we came out, this guy joined us, he joined us.

285
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.940
So when I saw him outside and I was telling everybody, he's one of them,

286
00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:37.660
he was one of them, but everybody was in shock. Nobody could, uh,

287
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.700
see what I'm saying. And, and do you know what happened to him? No,

288
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:44.290
I don't know. No idea.

289
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.190
<v 0>Okay. So back to that phone call in that I was telling you about</v>

290
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.580
<v 2>[inaudible] Farouk, he calls me out of the blue. He says, Hey,</v>

291
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.280
I'm sitting at a bar at a place called Diamond Plaza,

292
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:01.310
which is interesting because diamond plaza happens to be one of the prospective

293
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.060
terrorist targets in Nairobi, a known terrorist target besides West Cape Mall.

294
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.130
And he says across from him a few tables away is the fifth gunman.

295
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.760
The Guy who got away, oh, I see him. He's at the next table.

296
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.210
And he says, can you come

297
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.970
good? I got this. And you actually went, well,

298
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.900
at first they told him you should just finish your beer and go home.

299
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.110
I actually hung up, but then I thought,

300
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:38.260
I probably shouldn't blow this guy off if this were happening in the United

301
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.000
States. I could've just said to the guy, look, if you're so sure about this,

302
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:45.320
why don't you just call nine one one but there is no nine one one and in Kenya.

303
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.580
And so he called me and I basically said to him, well, what do you,

304
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.220
what do you want me to do? And he said, just, but the police know.

305
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.250
And then I did, I,

306
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.950
I called the source that I know in the police department and he called his

307
00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:00.380
people and they say, okay, we're, we're going to be right there.

308
00:19:00.381 --> 00:19:04.010
Where's this location? You know,

309
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.980
they treated it seriously. So I took it seriously.

310
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.800
Plus there was this small but amazing possibility of this being an incredible

311
00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:15.830
scoop. Yeah, okay. This is my point. Basically I figured like, okay,

312
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.670
I'm gonna wait downstairs until the police show up and then, you know,

313
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.400
cops style, I'm going to race up with them.

314
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.570
And sort of be behind the police so I'll be able to witness it,

315
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:30.620
but I'll be safe. Right. But I get there and the police are like not there yet.

316
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.250
So I'm waiting downstairs at this bar for weeks calling me like,

317
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:36.710
where are you man? And I said, well I'm downstairs. And he's like

318
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.670
<v 12>lucky come up. Oh, he's dead.</v>

319
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.820
I don't think I should go upstairs. Oh Mom. I'm like,

320
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.550
I don't think this is a good idea. Fit on here. No, come on.

321
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.110
<v 2>And as I'm sitting there arguing with him, he says,</v>

322
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.190
we have to hurry because I've invited this guy, this,

323
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.910
but suppose a terrorists to sit with me at my table.

324
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.400
What you gave him sit with me when he told him to Sydney.

325
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.713
Yeah.

326
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.860
I guess the guy was about to leave and Faruq didn't want him to leave so he

327
00:20:11.861 --> 00:20:14.650
jumped up and somehow convinced this guy,

328
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.820
this stranger does fit, have a drink with him at the table

329
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.500
<v 12>and he's really scared. Hold on,</v>

330
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:27.550
let me go get, man, I think it's going to alert.

331
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.360
Nice. Okay. Even those. Yes. Let's go. We'll come.

332
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.870
You are a friend of mine. Yeah, no, no.

333
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.610
So I come

334
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.330
<v 2>up, I walk into this bar past the pool table, you know,</v>

335
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.980
to this out outdoor bar we bring to the table. And this is Yemen or

336
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.550
<v 12>from Yemen? Yeah. Yeah. There's this Guy English knows Whaley</v>

337
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.820
late twenties,

338
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.810
<v 0>uh, fairly slender. He was wearing a tee shirt, black jeans.</v>

339
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.880
One odd detail that stood out to me was that he was wearing two watches. Really?

340
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.590
<v 2>What are you taking? That's Oscar.</v>

341
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.350
So I sit down, order a beer,

342
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.920
make up this terribly lame story about why I'm there. I'm going all right.

343
00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:17.210
I would just getting a phone case from my wife.

344
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.290
We used to talk to the guy. Yeah. Well the guy didn't speak English,

345
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.270
so you're like Nairobi

346
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.760
[inaudible] I did try to engage this guy in conversation.

347
00:21:28.761 --> 00:21:32.540
He didn't really understand what I was saying except for very basic stuff.

348
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.940
But within a few minutes of my sitting down, the police finally arrived.

349
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.380
<v 12>Oh Mom. Yeah. This is on the ultrasound.</v>

350
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.460
This is the ocs for you Gregory.

351
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.480
<v 2>Right away. Faruq jumps up. Ids,</v>

352
00:21:47.481 --> 00:21:49.980
the guy who is completely confused about what's going on.

353
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.830
[inaudible] he was at the mall the day of the attack,

354
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.580
<v 12>the way I told, you know, my wife got three bullets. Yeah.</v>

355
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.530
<v 2>And so the police start to question the guy [inaudible] and the interaction is,</v>

356
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.840
is, is very suspicious. They ask him where he's from. He says Nairobi,

357
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.540
even though he had told us that he's from Yemen,

358
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.490
and then they ask him for a passport and then he says, oh,

359
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.410
I don't have my passport. But then he does something, he says, Oh,

360
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:20.270
I'm from Yemen. So anyway, so that's enough for the police. They,

361
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.930
they put the rubber handcuffs on him and they take him away.

362
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.480
<v 0>Well, how did the Guy React? He didn't, he seemed kind of, oh, he seems high.</v>

363
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.800
Actually. It's something I hadn't mentioned was that the guy had been chewing,

364
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.430
uh, a narcotic leaf. It's called neuron or cot.

365
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.120
And so he, he seemed, you know,

366
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.720
like a scared high person, you know, or you're scared,

367
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.420
but you're kind of numb to whatever, everything that's happening.

368
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.070
It all seems like a dream. I mean this,

369
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:52.240
this is like very conjectural but what was not conjectural was that as the

370
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:57.241
police were leading him out for Rukh just loses.

371
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.530
<v 12>Huh? You wanna look [inaudible]</v>

372
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.040
<v 2>he says you kill my wife,</v>

373
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.620
<v 12>your mother. He starts cursing at the guy, you know,</v>

374
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.070
and then he starts just shouting so that anyone at the bar right here,

375
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.990
here [inaudible] shooting him. Huh? He's the one like,

376
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.080
it's all we could do to kind of calm him down.

377
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.520
They mentioned something four months back in day,

378
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.330
you know my family saying a whooping life in Paris.

379
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.930
I said, I know. Never life. I lost my life.

380
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.300
I saw a man manuals was watching me. You short my love man.

381
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.060
How can I let it go?

382
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.390
<v 1>This is the day under 10%</v>

383
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.070
[inaudible] that's when the call to prayer comes out of the speakers from a

384
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:03.071
nearby mountain is the one and for Rick rented all the way through right now.

385
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.940
The Bay then left directly from the [inaudible]

386
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.080
<v 0>bar to go to the police station to give a statement. And I,</v>

387
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.060
I felt really bad actually.

388
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.663
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

389
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.020
<v 0>I never felt like I was doing something wrong per se,</v>

390
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.520
but I felt that harm had come to this person.

391
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.600
And actually at that point I didn't feel that he was a terrorist.

392
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:34.520
And I just hoped that the system to which I had helped commit him,

393
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.200
would treat him fairly.

394
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.360
After that, I kept calling the police station, um, every few days,

395
00:24:46.361 --> 00:24:50.920
about 10 days later I found out the guy was released and he hadn't been charged

396
00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:54.070
with anything. And at that point I was like, all right, great.

397
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.510
It all worked out fine for guy was in the wrong place,

398
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.690
the wrong time and you know, got falsely ID possibly. But look,

399
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.591
everything is done.

400
00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:05.290
Everything kind of worked out the way it was supposed to and that's what I

401
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:07.270
assumed, you know, for, for months basically.

402
00:25:07.271 --> 00:25:10.510
And kind of like went off to do other kinds of reporting, other stories.

403
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.410
But a few months later

404
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.070
<v 3>I was talking to that police source again and I happened to mention,</v>

405
00:25:18.071 --> 00:25:19.360
we were talking about a different story. I said, yeah,

406
00:25:19.361 --> 00:25:23.500
whatever happened to that. Um, did that guy from Yemen,

407
00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:26.710
that fellow that was picked up at Diamond Plaza and he said, Oh, you know,

408
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.150
it's funny that the witness that you told us about, he never showed up.

409
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.080
He didn't show up. You didn't show up.

410
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.990
They called him for three consecutive days. I never saw it. I said, what for?

411
00:25:37.991 --> 00:25:41.480
Ruth never showed up to give his testimony. Like you can hear from the table.

412
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:48.090
One thing the bait get so clear on anyone is that he's on his way over to the

413
00:25:48.971 --> 00:25:53.920
police station, full barrels blazing. And so I call Faruq

414
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.770
<v 1>sorry. No, move on. No.</v>

415
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.510
<v 0>And his phone is off. And then I called him a week later,</v>

416
00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:03.480
his phone is still off. It's giving this like,

417
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.130
this phone number is no longer in service kind of thing.

418
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.770
So it's actually not until

419
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.000
close to the year anniversary of a Westgate that I get a call.

420
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.580
<v 14>Okay.</v>

421
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.870
<v 0>Yeah. Are you okay?</v>

422
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:16.800
<v 14>Okay.</v>

423
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.790
<v 0>I've been trying your number and it hasn't worked for weeks.</v>

424
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.243
<v 14>Aw, okay.</v>

425
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.620
<v 0>And it's Faruq and he's very nervous. He says,</v>

426
00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:30.910
are you alone asking me not to record this conversation?

427
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.780
And he tells me, um, he had gone to the police station just as I suspected,

428
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:37.570
he marched right over to the police station and they told him, oh, well no,

429
00:26:37.571 --> 00:26:39.550
this is being handled by the antiterrorism police.

430
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.500
So you leave your phone number and the antiterrorism police will give you a

431
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.000
call. A week later

432
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:46.630
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

433
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.430
<v 3>he started getting calls,</v>

434
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.010
several calls from unknown numbers where people who did not identify themselves,

435
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.930
threatened him, told him not to say anything about this guy.

436
00:26:58.931 --> 00:27:02.020
He had had arrested not to talk to the press

437
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.710
<v 0>or he'd be sorry and his family would be sorry.</v>

438
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.090
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

439
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:12.650
<v 0>he was extremely rattled by these phone calls and ultimately actually turned off</v>

440
00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:14.270
his phone. That's why I couldn't get ahold of him.

441
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.450
Had left the country for a short bit,

442
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.530
had come back and was laying very low.

443
00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:24.800
And that's why I'm using an assumed name for him. Well,

444
00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:27.260
I'm not telling his full name because he doesn't want that.

445
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.410
And do you believe the story is about the threats and

446
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.270
I have absolutely no way of knowing for sure. Um, yeah,

447
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.600
that part of his story though seemed the most likely to be true.

448
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.110
The fact that the antiterrorism police, uh,

449
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.140
had called him allegedly and made threats.

450
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.680
That does not sound strange, unfortunately to me. I've,

451
00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:54.410
I've heard that story from lots of very credible people.

452
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.270
Does this make what he saw truer or untrue or we go, I don't know. Suddenly,

453
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:04.390
suddenly I found myself less willing to discount the story and I was less

454
00:28:04.461 --> 00:28:09.350
comfortable with the official narrative than I want it to be at that point.

455
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.760
So I called up one more guy,

456
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:18.761
a guy who is not a government official who is not the FBI and yet who had seen

457
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.230
all the video tapes from the mall.

458
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.490
<v 16>Okay. So can you just give me your name and your, and your title.</v>

459
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:25.840
My name is Dan Reed.

460
00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:29.620
I'm a producer and director of documentaries most recently terror at the mall,

461
00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.170
which was made for HBO and the BBC.

462
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.830
<v 0>And for that documentary,</v>

463
00:28:33.831 --> 00:28:38.831
Dan got exclusive access to all the surveillance footage inside that mall.

464
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.340
Right. They figured if, if there were more to this story, you could tell me.

465
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.203
So how much footage

466
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.500
<v 16>did you get? If I can ask again, how many hours or uh, are out?</v>

467
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.420
The footage we obtained added up to about more than 2000 hours. Wow.

468
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.440
And we analyze the timeline where the cameras were and we figured out the

469
00:28:56.441 --> 00:29:00.130
offsets between different cameras. We really did a huge forensic job.

470
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.020
It's mind numbingly tedious to watch a lot of it. But if you do go through it,

471
00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:07.270
you do get the key to a lot of the mysteries of West Gate.

472
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.730
<v 17>So</v>

473
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.470
<v 0>like me, he had gone into this project</v>

474
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.260
<v 16>open minded in some very kind of, you know, sober, sensible people who said,</v>

475
00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:21.190
yeah, there was seven terrorists. I saw seven terrorists. I mean,

476
00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.090
you dream of being able to confirm that there was seven gunman.

477
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.660
You dream of being able to confirm that they all escape. What if that were true?

478
00:29:28.661 --> 00:29:33.040
What if we could find evidence, some evidence that that were true,

479
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.220
but in the end he didn't? No. As we,

480
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.070
as we progress further and further with our forensic analysis became harder and

481
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:45.850
harder to give any credit to some of the wilder pieces of, of eyewitness.

482
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.740
<v 0>He says, what you see on those tapes is what the FBI said. You'd see four guys,</v>

483
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.080
all Somali, no evidence they escaped.

484
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.610
Exactly was then how does he square the stories you were hearing with the

485
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.110
stories you were reporting?

486
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.080
<v 16>Well, uh, that part was actually quite interesting. We had a lot of people say,</v>

487
00:30:03.081 --> 00:30:03.840
yeah, there was a woman,

488
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.320
<v 0>young British woman, they call the fight widow.</v>

489
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.030
<v 16>And it's interesting because when I was going through this footage,</v>

490
00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:10.350
my wife looked over my shoulder,

491
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.860
pointed to one of the four terrorists on the screen. And at one point you said,

492
00:30:13.861 --> 00:30:18.180
oh, is that a go? And we came to the conclusion that that one of the gunman was,

493
00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:21.000
you know, very slender and he actually does sashay along in,

494
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:23.400
in what is frankly quite an a feminine way.

495
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.010
<v 0>And similarly he says,</v>

496
00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:29.690
you can justify some of the reports that one of the gunman was an Arab because

497
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:33.470
one of them did in fact have lighter skin than your average Somali.

498
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.440
And you can explain that people thought that they were more gunman,

499
00:30:36.441 --> 00:30:40.610
10 or 15 gunman because there were a lot of guys with guns running around

500
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.790
including security guards and later policemen.

501
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.190
<v 16>There were a lot more policemen than there were gunman.</v>

502
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.200
<v 0>I did speak with one eye witness who said that,</v>

503
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.800
that that t saw one of the terrorists, excuse me, change clothes and escape.

504
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280
Well, is it a

505
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.390
<v 16>no, that doesn't, that doesn't match anything that we saw.</v>

506
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.150
I think the thing that's the question we'll ask your eye witnesses is,

507
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.300
is how do you know this person with a weapon who changed clothes was a

508
00:31:05.301 --> 00:31:06.920
terrorist. It may have been a policeman.

509
00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:11.390
We certainly heard stories of policemen taking off changing clothes or taken off

510
00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:14.270
the and any distinctive clothing. I don't know if those stories were true,

511
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:16.920
but we, we heard stories [inaudible]

512
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.620
<v 0>the uniform policemen took off their uniform because they didn't want to fight.</v>

513
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.370
<v 16>I guess. Yeah, I mean that, but that's pure Greg. That's pure.</v>

514
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.230
I mean there was totally speculation and you did not see that on the,

515
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.450
any of the security. Certainly didn't. I mean, I, I've,

516
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:34.570
I've just had so many conversations like people saying to me, no, they escaped.

517
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:36.580
And I'm like, why do you think that escapes? You know,

518
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:39.400
these guys don't come to escape. If you escape, you failed.

519
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.980
<v 0>He says, take the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.</v>

520
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.730
They had murdered 35 people at the hotel. This is another film that he made.

521
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.460
There's a moment in that film where one of the gunmen,

522
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.650
one of the last remaining gunman,

523
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.330
<v 16>the guy is trapped in a hotel room and he is next to,</v>

524
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:58.580
he's in the bath tub next to his, his comrade who's dad is dying.

525
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.070
He's talking to one of his handlers on the cell phone.

526
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.910
<v 18>Well, they come from [inaudible].</v>

527
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.930
<v 16>Dan was able to get a recording of that call.</v>

528
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.160
<v 18>Hello, hello. [inaudible]</v>

529
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.800
<v 16>and the, the handlers very calmly say to him, you know, your, your mission</v>

530
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.600
<v 18>[inaudible]</v>

531
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.710
<v 16>will not be a success until you are killed. And then they say to him,</v>

532
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.680
<v 18>yeah, the incident last Salami I beat you,</v>

533
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.220
<v 16>please leave your phone on, switched on,</v>

534
00:32:23.221 --> 00:32:27.900
leave the line open in your pocket so that we can hear when you go out and are

535
00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:30.180
killed by the enemy security forces.

536
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.493
<v 19>Hello.</v>

537
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.890
<v 16>So there is a whole script for this kind of operation and it ends with the death</v>

538
00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.490
of the gunman at the hands of the enemy.

539
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.680
<v 0>Wow. That's how he knows they didn't escape.</v>

540
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.160
He says not just because there's no evidence on the film,

541
00:32:56.161 --> 00:33:00.180
but because it's the last thing they would've wanted. And yet

542
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:04.020
<v 16>it's, I mean I, I the, the, these, the rumors that the terrorist escape,</v>

543
00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:05.720
the rumors that there was a woman amongst them,

544
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:10.010
the rumors that they got changed, the rumors, they don't seem to go away.

545
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.440
Even when confronted by quite solid evidence.

546
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.160
It's almost as if the facts don't matter.

547
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.580
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

548
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.390
<v 0>so I called Farrukh. He's still sticking to his story.</v>

549
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.040
He says he saw it. He saw though he's really too nervous to go on tape.

550
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.250
But I did run it by puny my former neighbor in a rugby who's 100% still pretty

551
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:38.120
sure that the guy she saw in the mall hasn't been accounted for,

552
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.190
I think I'm sure about it. But

553
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.830
what if the government said, here's the bodies, here's the DNA evidence,

554
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.660
here's the four. They dog died, they died in the second day or third day,

555
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.050
whatever it was. This is how they died and here's the DNA proof.

556
00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220
You know what would really make me happy is if they even ask the questions,

557
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.630
be it the media, be it the government. Why did we go from 15 to four?

558
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.930
Yeah.

559
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:10.930
So I told her quickly tell you how we arrived at four cause I told her about the

560
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:15.020
meeting with the FBI and how we got this information.

561
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.580
Then I told her about Dan Reed watching 2000 hours of videotape and I told her

562
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:23.090
about how I investigated for Rukh story and mostly came up empty.

563
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.880
I told her not just everything that I know all these facts,

564
00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:28.530
but how I got to them.

565
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.700
Because in the end maybe the facts aren't enough.

566
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.110
The facts need to make sense, especially for people who were there.

567
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.370
But I can imagine for anybody who was not there, anybody who's reading it. Yep.

568
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:42.330
The evidence says, and then you move on.

569
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.810
<v 11>You're listening to you. I feel like I'm,</v>

570
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.840
I'm learning much more about my job and being a journalist and maybe it's not so

571
00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:53.660
pretty because I feel like, uh,

572
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.640
that day coming out of that meeting with the FBI and feeling like,

573
00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.533
okay,

574
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.280
now we have some solid evidence that can be reported and we can move on.

575
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.410
Uh, felt good. I mean, it felt like offering,

576
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.770
instead of offering shaky s as testimony,

577
00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:15.980
we could offer truth at least as best we could understand it,

578
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.560
but it feels like maybe that was too sudden and too

579
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:28.150
to an inquisitive in a way to match the emotions that were still in the air and

580
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.370
wrote me at that time. Maybe it felt like abandonment,

581
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.360
even though it was meant to feel like clarity for me.

582
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.800
It still, there's a little

583
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.270
<v 0>glimmer of maybe that's not the full story. I, I,</v>

584
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.940
I'm inclined to believe that there were four,

585
