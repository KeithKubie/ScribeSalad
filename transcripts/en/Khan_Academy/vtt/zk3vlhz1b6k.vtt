00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
To us modern folk, we tend to take for granted the existence of cells

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
and the idea that all living things are made up of cells

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that we as human beings, as living organisms, we are made up of many, many, many cells

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.380
the estimates of the cells, of the human body, are around the order of 37 trillion cells!

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.200
But, if we were to rewind, even 400 years ago to the 1600's

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.000
this wasn't so obvious.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.920
and that is because people really didn't have the tools

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.960
to make direct observations of cells. They didn't know that these cells were around.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040
They didn't know that things, even like unicellular organisms, even existed!

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.340
But, all of that began to change, with Robert Hooke.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.500
Robert Hooke, was able to leverage a primitive microscope

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.400
and this is a picture of his microscope

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.980
and when you see this, you appreciate how

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.720
at least relative, to what we have today, how primitive it was.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.660
He had lenses here, that would provide some magnification,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.280
but he had to use -- this right over here -- this is a flame, and he is able to channel that light

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420
so that it gets reflected over whatever he is observing.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.840
And in, 1665, he publishes the "Micrographia".

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.340
I am probably not pronouncing it right.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.740
So, this is 1665, Robert Hooke publishes this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.760
and in this, he describes and he draws a lot

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680
of his observations, using his microscope.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.320
He has some fascinating drawings,  he was actually quite a good artist,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.720
where he was able to draw pictures

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.940
of his observations, of things like lice, and fleas.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.580
But, it's not just lice and fleas that he is able to observe.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.880
He actually takes a look at some corks or what he just sees as "cork"

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:49.160
and when he makes that observation, he says, "Hey look, you know there are these little squares over here, and this kind of seems to be somehow kind of a basic unit of this cork. "

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.160
And he says, " Well, this kinda reminds me of these little rooms that monks live in and spend their time in, which we call cells".

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.040
So he calls these cells.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.220
And, that is where the word comes from.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.060
He calls them cells, in "Micrographia".

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.020
That is a cell.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.140
Now unfortunately for us, he was a great artist

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.780
and he was really good at drawing things

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.580
and he drew a lot in his "Micrographia", but we don't have any pictures of Robert Hooke anymore.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.880
And it's a fascinating story. Most theories are that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.920
actually,  it was Isaac Newton, who burned the only original painting, that we have of Robert Hooke.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.320
And, that is another intriguing story, that we can talk about, at a future date.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.800
But, what Robert Hooke — he coined these things "cells" — but he was looking at dead tissue, and actually he was

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.040
looking at the remnants of cells. And what he saw was really just the cell wall remnants.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.920
He wasn't actually able to observe, directly,  "living cells". And he didn't have enough to go on

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.140
to think , "Hey maybe, this is a building block of all life and maybe, cells themselves reproduce."

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.520
"And, all cells come from other cells. "  And that doesn't start to get developed, until we get further on into history.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.320
You go a few years later, we get to Antonie von Leeuwenhoek.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320
I know I'm not probably pronouncing it right.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640
But he was a Dutch lense crafter, and he was inspired

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.940
by Hooke's work , and he says "Hey, I can craft lenses, maybe I can use that to make better microscopes, and make better observations. "

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.240
And he was able to do that, and doing that he was able to directly observe

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.040
living cells and living unicellular organisms.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.920
So, he was able to directly observe sperm.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.340
He said, "Hey this thing looks like it's alive!"

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.960
He was able to directly observe protists — so these unicellular, eukaryotic...

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.780
... they have cell walls, these things that look like unicellular animals.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.780
And he called them, actually, "animalcules".

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.240
Saying, "Hey, look, these look like these little mini-animals going on here. "

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.060
And so he started to say, well maybe this is some form of a basis of life, or at least started to say,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.300
at this very small scale, you actually have life.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.040
But, a fully, modern theory of the cell, doesn't really start to emerge until we get another 100-150 years, into the future.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.480
And, we get into the early 1800's.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.620
So, if we fast-forward, to the 1830's , these two gentlemen, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, come into the picture.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.360
And, they are the one's that start laying the foundation

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.240
of what we can call, "modern cell theory".

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.320
So, modern cell theory

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.720
And using their observations and kind of what they are able to deduce

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.480
they said, "Hey maybe, all living things

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:42.360
all life,  is composed of one or more cells."

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.660
And today, we kind of take this for granted, but this wasn't obvious.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.600
It wasn't obvious that all things, that this was somehow a building block for life, one or more cells.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.100
And then, following that if all life is composed of one or more cells,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.740
you can also say, that a cell, is the basic unit of life.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.480
Cell is basic unit of life

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.680
And these are strong statements, that all life, if you were to get down small enough,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.820
you are going to come to cells, living cells, that make up that life.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.840
Now, this isn't our full, complete cell theory and both of these gentlemen, they knew that cells could come from other cells.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.320
They were able to observe cells reproducing, but, it still

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.820
was an open question, "Hey, maybe some cells come from other cells? While others, maybe they somehow get spontaneously created ....

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.700
... if you have the right elements and the right amount of conditions. Maybe they somehow just emerge out of nothing. "

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:46.580
And, it wasn't until this kind of third tenet of modern cell theory, it wasn't until the mid 1800's that we get our third tenet of modern cell theory that gets established.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.300
And this is this idea that all cells come from other cells.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.340
All cells from other cells

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.960
And the real father of this idea, the one that really established this,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.800
is this gentleman, right here, Robert Remak.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.200
Now sometimes, the credit for this goes to, Rudolph Virchow, right over here, but it turns out that

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:17.840
he plagiarized Remak's work, so it's really Remak who deserves the bulk of the credit

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.060
for this tenant, that all cells come from other cells.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.980
And once again, he wasn't the first person to say, "Hey, maybe, we will observe that some cells..

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.560
.. come from other cells." But he said, "This is a fundamental thing, all cells, this is how they actually come about  they aren't just somehow, spontaneously emerged".

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.780
Now whenever, even in today's world, people

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.020
see this last thing, all cells come from other cells,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.740
there is a natural question, " Well, there must have been a first cell or an initial set of "proto-cells ?".

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.100
And, people aren't a hundred percent sure, but when we

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.320
look back, at the evolution of life on earth, we think the first cells emerged about three and a half billion years ago.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.480
And we are not a hundred percent sure about how they emerged, but there are some theories.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.600
For example, we have videos on, phospholipids,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:09.460
and it turns out that, phospholipids, naturally form bi-layers

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.500
and they can actually form, spherical membranes, that have phospholipid bi-layers.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.320
So, that kinda gets you a start, so that can spontaneously form.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.700
And, there is also, theories that maybe in the information, the machinery of cells

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.520
maybe their ancestors, if we were to go three and a half billion years or longer ago,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.840
that it might have been self-replicating RNA molecules or maybe it was somehow, self-replicating proteins

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.820
that over time, over very large, large time scales,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.820
were able to, start replicating themselves, have more sophisticated machinery,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.500
the ones that had or were approaching our modern cells, were able to reproduce more,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.340
were able to take advantage of more of the energy, the resources in an environment.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.540
So, that we eventually get to our modern cells. But, this is a fascinating question, and is still an area of research.
