DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.310
I'm Don's Dodge, and this is
"Google Root Access," the show

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.370
for startups.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.960
And today we're going to talk
about user design and user

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.900
experience.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
I have a special guest, Izabel
Idris, who focuses on mobile

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.570
applications and user
experience.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.620
Izabel has worked with several
large companies to develop

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.120
applications and has also
had her own startup.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.350
So, welcome Izabel.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.820
IZABEL IDRIS: Thank you.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.660
DON DODGE: So we're going to
talk about how to start

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.990
building an app that delivers
a great user experience.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.160
So let's say I have a great
idea for a startup and--

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.230
how do I create user
experience?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840
What does that mean?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.880
IZABEL IDRIS: I think the way
to get started is to really,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.200
as a company or as a team,
define your goals, define your

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.850
user, and from that you create
personas and use cases.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.740
So personas are a fictional user
that actually capture all

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.490
the attributes of the real users
that your application is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.680
tailored for.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.250
So what you really want to do is
actually think of features

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.470
and implementation last.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.510
You really want to understand
your goals, your use cases,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.640
and personas, and throughout
the implementation process,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.510
you want to always kind of
go back to those, kind of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.550
reference that, because as
startups, you're pivoting

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.950
frequently, stress can get high,
you run out of time, you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530
have limited resources.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.600
So you always want to know
really, why are we here?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.360
What are our goals?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.390
What is the most basic thing?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.440
What do we really
need to nail?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.230
You got a nail the right things,
get things right.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.050
You need to get the right
things right.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.350
And so I think that it's really
important to always

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.630
kind of reference those
throughout the process.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.850
DON DODGE: So when you talk
about personas and use cases,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.300
I think what you're saying is
that for the same application

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.020
there could be different users
and different use cases.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.330
Is that what you're
getting at?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.580
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.080
An application can have several
different personas,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.740
and for each one of those
personas, you have several

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.160
different use cases.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.820
There's a whole process about
how to create use cases and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.550
personas, but basically you
always want to make sure that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.630
your application, your
experiences and service of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.130
those personas and their needs
and their use cases.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.479
DON DODGE: So you could have
teenage users and middle age

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.600
users and women and men, and
they have slightly different

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.430
use cases and personas.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.720
So that's the idea?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.210
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.870
There's a whole process to how
not to create conflicting

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.770
personas, like you can't please
everybody, so that's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.760
kind of a whole other process.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.890
But yeah, you kind of need to
spend a lot of time early on

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.920
in the process really figuring
out who your application is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.410
for so you can deliver delight
to those people.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.570
DON DODGE: So a lot of startups
aren't that focused

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.570
and methodical.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.250
They dive right in and start
developing features.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.080
I mean, we're engineers so
we're going to start

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.120
developing features, and then
pull the features together and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.770
try to build a demo, and then
give it to a few users and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.566
figure out how they're going
to use it, because they'll

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.030
say, I don't know what
the use case is.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.760
So how do you get involved with
a startup who's already

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.520
built something, and how do you
sort of put that on hold

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.400
and go back and do the user
experience design?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.120
IZABEL IDRIS: Well user testing
is crucial, so if you

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.270
were to have a prototype
already, I think it's really

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.530
good to test it with different
kinds of users.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.340
But when you do test it with
those users, have them

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.300
categorized in some way.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600
Understand that I'm going to do
a test with teenagers, or

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.250
I'm going to test with soccer
moms, or I'm going to do a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.150
test with people that are
foodies and then I'm going to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.020
do a test with people who
are bargain shoppers.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.680
So kind of understand who you're
testing with and then

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.370
see maybe who your application
is most

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.850
successful with those people.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.100
And then from there, I guess
you could kind of reverse

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.020
engineer it and then go
into use cases and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.190
personas from there.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.330
But ideally, you really want
to have a clear idea of who

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.270
your application is for.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.550
And everybody between
developers, designers, and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.180
product managers can reference
these throughout the process.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.550
Everybody we use uses cases
and personas in slightly

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.040
different ways to make different
decisions, but I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.320
think even if you start out with
a prototype and you don't

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.460
have spec that you might have
started out with, you

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.690
definitely need to try and
define who your users are and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.240
their use cases.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.420
DON DODGE: So earlier you
mentioned to me a application

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.000
for ordering pizza.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.040
And let's say there 850,000
apps in the App Store, and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.310
many of them do the
same thing.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.600
So what's an example of a great
user experience versus a

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080
not so great user experience
where the functionality is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.030
exactly the same?

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.360
IZABEL IDRIS: I think that comes
down to your special

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.010
sauce, no pun intended since
we're talking about pizza.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.960
So your special sauce is really
a way that you can take

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.580
your goals and actually turn
those into features to really

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.700
meld those two together and
elicit an emotional response

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.850
in your users.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.110
So that means it's something
you can engineer.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.750
So for example, let's say you
have a pizza application, and

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.390
this pizza application services
users who are foodies

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.150
and they're really interested in
getting pizza that's local,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.670
sustainable, and that
they want to give

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.950
back to local farms.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.560
So let's say that's my goal
as a pizza company.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.330
In my application when I choose
toppings for my pizza,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
they could have a sustainability
score.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.170
And then when I order my pizza,
I could share it on

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.510
Google+ and say, look I have
this certain sustainability

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.220
score, and try and get your
friends to see if they can

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.040
beat your source, so you can
actually gamify the whole

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
experience.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.470
And then the pizza company could
offer a free pizza to

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.620
the person who shared their
pizza if someone else were to

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.360
purchase as a result
of their share.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.570
So basically--

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.110
and also the users would feel
really good that they've

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.770
actually ordered your pizza,
because you're giving back to

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.610
local farms.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.550
They're doing something good for
their community by using

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.440
your product.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.020
Obviously, your pizza
has to be amazing.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.760
That's kind of a given.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.280
So you may have tons of
companies with great pizza and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.010
a really nice checkout flow
and a really nice ordering

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.740
flow, but you're pizza company
makes people feel good about

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.520
ordering pizza.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.060
They feel like they're doing
something good for the

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.890
community, good for
local farmers--

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.260
if that's important to them--
and then, of course, it's fun.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.240
DON DODGE: So building in
gamification into the user

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.540
experience makes a generic
kind of pizza application

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.910
special and unique and
more successful.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.840
IZABEL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.260
DON DODGE: Great.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.380
Who knew that user experience
could improve a pizza

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.720
application?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.730
Well, thank you very much.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.730
