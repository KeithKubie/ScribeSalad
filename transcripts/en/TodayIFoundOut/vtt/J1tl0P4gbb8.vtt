00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:16.340
“Have you confidence in me to trust me with
your watch until tomorrow?”

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.890
With these 13 words politely expressed, as
often as not William Thompson would acquire

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.890
another watch.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.550
Of course, Thompson wasn’t even close to
the first to run such a daringly simple scheme,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.570
but his bold method of gaining his mark’s
trust led a writer in the June 8, 1849 edition

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.700
of the New York Herald to pen a piece “Arrest
of the Confidence Man,” giving us the first

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.590
known documented instance of the term “confidence
man.”

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.150
Within a decade, Herman Melville published
his novel The Confidence-Man, which further

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.680
popularized the phrase.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.090
Over time, this has been shortened to the
familiar “con man” or “conman” and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.050
the derivative “con artist.”

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.470
Schemes like Thompson’s have been around
for seemingly as long as humans have had assets

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.300
to swindle, with various names for the scammers
popping up over the centuries.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.750
As for early-on in the United States, before
Thompson, con men were commonly called diddlers,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.909
after a character, Jeremy Diddler, from the
1803 play Raising the Wind, by James Kenney.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.610
Analyzed in depth by none other than Edgar
Allan Poe in an 1840 essay, Diddling, Considered

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.590
as One of the Exact Sciences, Poe noted the
qualities necessary to succeed at diddling:

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.550
audacity, minuteness (focusing on the small
crime), self-interest, ingenuity, perseverance,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.450
impertinence, nonchalance, originality, and
a grin.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.990
Having his fair share of each of these, good
manners and being well dressed, Thompson was

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.510
remarkably successful with his scheme… that
is, until he was finally caught, as described

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.670
in the aforementioned 1849 edition of the
New York Herald:

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.240
Arrest of the Confidence Man—For the last
few months a man has been traveling about

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.729
the city, known as the “Confidence Man,”
that is, he would go up to a perfect stranger

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.159
in the street, and being a man of genteel
appearance, would easily command an interview.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.099
Upon this interview he would say after some
little conversation, “have you confidence

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.220
in me to trust me with your watch until to-morrow;”
the stranger at this novel request, supposing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.099
him to be some old acquaintance not at that
moment recollected, allows him to take the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.790
watch, thus placing “confidence” in the
honesty of the stranger, who walks off laughing

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.669
and the other supposing it to be a joke allows
him so to do.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:46.099
In this way many have been duped, and the
last that we recollect was a Mr. Thomas McDonald,

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.820
of No. 276 Madison street, who, on the 12th
of May last, was met by this “Confidence

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.370
Man” in William Street, who, in the manner
as above described, took from him a gold lever

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.090
watch valued at $110; and yesterday, singularly
enough, Mr. McDonald was passing along Liberty

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.249
street, when who should he meet but the “Confidence
Man” who had stolen his watch.

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.029
Officer Swayse, of the Third Ward, being near
at hand, took the accused into custody on

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.530
the charge made by Mr. McDonald.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.290
The accused at first refused to go with the
officer; but after finding the officer determined

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.810
to take him, he walked along for a short distance,
when he showed desperate fight, and it was

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.870
not until the officer had tied his hands together
that he was able to convey him to the police

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.870
office.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.779
On the prisoner being taken before Justice
McGrath, he was recognized as an old offender

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:45.980
by the name of Wm. Thompson, and is said to
be a graduate of the college at Sing Sing.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.569
The magistrate committed him to prison for
a further hearing.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.699
It will be well for all those persons who
have been defrauded by the “Confidence Man”

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:09.329
to call at the police court Tombs and take
a view 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.209
of him.
