so all applications are running in their
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340
so all applications are running in their
own processes and the Android system

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
own processes and the Android system
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.950
own processes and the Android system
itself is responsible for starting these

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
itself is responsible for starting these
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990
itself is responsible for starting these

example that shows how that works now to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
example that shows how that works now to
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639
example that shows how that works now to
explain this example let me set up the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
explain this example let me set up the
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250
explain this example let me set up the
scenario in this example the user is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
scenario in this example the user is
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.810
scenario in this example the user is
going to navigate from the home screen

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
going to navigate from the home screen
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.830
going to navigate from the home screen
to their inbox in the mail application

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840
to their inbox in the mail application
 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.420
to their inbox in the mail application
they're going to select a mail message

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
they're going to select a mail message
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070
they're going to select a mail message
from the mail message they're going to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
from the mail message they're going to
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320
from the mail message they're going to
follow a link out to some web content in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
follow a link out to some web content in
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120
follow a link out to some web content in
the browser and then from the browser

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
the browser and then from the browser
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.350
the browser and then from the browser
they're going to click on something that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
they're going to click on something that
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.490
they're going to click on something that
takes them into the Maps application

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
takes them into the Maps application
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.850
takes them into the Maps application
which is a not unreasonable scenario now

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
which is a not unreasonable scenario now
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140
which is a not unreasonable scenario now
when they do this they're going to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
when they do this they're going to
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420
when they do this they're going to
actually navigate through four different

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
actually navigate through four different
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.490
actually navigate through four different
applications running in four different

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
applications running in four different
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320
applications running in four different
processes that are potentially written

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
processes that are potentially written
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.749
processes that are potentially written
by four different authors from the users

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
by four different authors from the users
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670
by four different authors from the users
point of view none of that is important

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
point of view none of that is important
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.109
point of view none of that is important
what they want is to be able to navigate

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
what they want is to be able to navigate
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090
what they want is to be able to navigate
forward clicking on what they want to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
forward clicking on what they want to
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890
forward clicking on what they want to
click on getting the component they want

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
click on getting the component they want
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929
click on getting the component they want
to have responding to each click and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
to have responding to each click and
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.010
to have responding to each click and
then they want to be able to go

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
then they want to be able to go
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719
then they want to be able to go
backwards and get back to where they

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
backwards and get back to where they
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969
backwards and get back to where they
were and in particular they don't want

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
were and in particular they don't want
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.960
were and in particular they don't want
to have to worry about which

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
to have to worry about which
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670
to have to worry about which
applications are running how much memory

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
applications are running how much memory
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.410
applications are running how much memory
they've consumed how much memory is left

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
they've consumed how much memory is left
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910
they've consumed how much memory is left
on the device whether they can launch

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
on the device whether they can launch
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469
on the device whether they can launch
that next process because all the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
that next process because all the
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359
that next process because all the
resources have been taken up so the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
resources have been taken up so the
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910
resources have been taken up so the
Android system manages all that for them

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
Android system manages all that for them
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530
Android system manages all that for them
here's how it works

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
here's how it works
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.230
here's how it works
at the start the user is on the home

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
at the start the user is on the home
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.560
at the start the user is on the home
page there are two processes in this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
page there are two processes in this
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450
page there are two processes in this
example that are running there's the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
example that are running there's the
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.880
example that are running there's the
system process which contains the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
system process which contains the
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100
system process which contains the
activity manager that contains the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
activity manager that contains the
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.260
activity manager that contains the
common back stack that is used by all

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
common back stack that is used by all
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.550
common back stack that is used by all
activities

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
activities
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050
activities
regardless of which process they run in

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
regardless of which process they run in
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.600
regardless of which process they run in
and then the home process is running and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
and then the home process is running and
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.910
and then the home process is running and
that has the home activity running

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
that has the home activity running
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.940
that has the home activity running
inside it now before launching the mail

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
inside it now before launching the mail
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430
inside it now before launching the mail
application the system is going to save

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
application the system is going to save
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.470
application the system is going to save
the state of the home application just

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
the state of the home application just
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.120
the state of the home application just
in case anything bad happens to it and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
in case anything bad happens to it and
 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.340
in case anything bad happens to it and
you'll see that bad stuff in a few

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
you'll see that bad stuff in a few
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.199
you'll see that bad stuff in a few
minutes so the home application has

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
minutes so the home application has
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.600
minutes so the home application has
saved its state in a little parcel that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
saved its state in a little parcel that
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.720
saved its state in a little parcel that
is been moved to the system process and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
is been moved to the system process and
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.199
is been moved to the system process and
at that point the system can create the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209
at that point the system can create the
 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.979
at that point the system can create the
mail process we can then launch the mail

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
mail process we can then launch the mail
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.340
mail process we can then launch the mail
list activity into that process and now

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
list activity into that process and now
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.990
list activity into that process and now
that's what the user is seeing on the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
that's what the user is seeing on the
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.720
that's what the user is seeing on the
screen their mail list if they click on

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
screen their mail list if they click on
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.150
screen their mail list if they click on
a particular mail message then that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
a particular mail message then that
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.449
a particular mail message then that
creates a request to launch the next

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
creates a request to launch the next
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.390
creates a request to launch the next
activity that goes to the system process

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400
activity that goes to the system process
 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.610
activity that goes to the system process
again before a new activity is launched

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
again before a new activity is launched
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.770
again before a new activity is launched
we save the state of the last activity

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
we save the state of the last activity
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.009
we save the state of the last activity
so the mail list saves its state into

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019
so the mail list saves its state into
 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.259
so the mail list saves its state into
the system process it's worth noting

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269
the system process it's worth noting
 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.180
the system process it's worth noting
that the state that it saves is not

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
that the state that it saves is not
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.040
that the state that it saves is not
every message in your Inbox

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
every message in your Inbox
 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.280
every message in your Inbox
it's meta information about the current

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
it's meta information about the current
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.920
it's meta information about the current
state of the activity things like where

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930
state of the activity things like where
 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.780
state of the activity things like where
you are scrolled to in the list which

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
you are scrolled to in the list which
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.819
you are scrolled to in the list which
item is selected you don't have to store

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829
item is selected you don't have to store
 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.420
item is selected you don't have to store
the complete mail list in that parcel so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
the complete mail list in that parcel so
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430
the complete mail list in that parcel so
now that the information has been saved

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440
now that the information has been saved
 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.850
now that the information has been saved
then the system is free to launch the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860
then the system is free to launch the
 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.680
then the system is free to launch the
next activity that shows a particular

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690
next activity that shows a particular
 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.350
next activity that shows a particular
mail message and now that is what the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
mail message and now that is what the
 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.140
mail message and now that is what the
user sees on the screen from the mail

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
user sees on the screen from the mail
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.630
user sees on the screen from the mail
message they then click on a link to go

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
message they then click on a link to go
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.420
message they then click on a link to go
out to the web so again another request

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430
out to the web so again another request
 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.259
out to the web so again another request
is created the state of the currently

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269
is created the state of the currently
 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.509
is created the state of the currently
running activity is saved in the system

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
running activity is saved in the system
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.300
running activity is saved in the system
process and now we need to create a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
process and now we need to create a
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.930
process and now we need to create a
process to run the browser in so we

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
process to run the browser in so we
 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.870
process to run the browser in so we
launch the browser process we launch the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880
launch the browser process we launch the
 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.060
launch the browser process we launch the
browser activity into that process and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070
browser activity into that process and
 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.210
browser activity into that process and
the user is now looking at the browser

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
the user is now looking at the browser
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.930
the user is now looking at the browser
we're going to do this one more time

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940
we're going to do this one more time
 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.210
we're going to do this one more time
where the user clicks on a link in the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
where the user clicks on a link in the
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.449
where the user clicks on a link in the
browser to launch a map we create the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
browser to launch a map we create the
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.539
browser to launch a map we create the
request we save the state of the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
request we save the state of the
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.250
request we save the state of the
foreground activity in this case the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
foreground activity in this case the
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.550
foreground activity in this case the
browser and we would like to launch the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
browser and we would like to launch the
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.040
browser and we would like to launch the
Maps application but as you can see

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050
Maps application but as you can see
 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.200
Maps application but as you can see
we're out of room so

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210
we're out of room so
 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.850
we're out of room so
in order to launch the Maps application

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860
in order to launch the Maps application
 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.129
in order to launch the Maps application
we have to find a process that we can

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139
we have to find a process that we can
 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.050
we have to find a process that we can
kill we don't want to kill the home

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060
kill we don't want to kill the home
 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.700
kill we don't want to kill the home
application because we use that for a

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710
application because we use that for a
 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.379
application because we use that for a
navigation hub we want that to be always

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389
navigation hub we want that to be always
 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.990
navigation hub we want that to be always
available so it's always responsive we

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
available so it's always responsive we
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.189
available so it's always responsive we
don't want to kill the browser because

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199
don't want to kill the browser because
 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.930
don't want to kill the browser because
that's the activity the user just came

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
that's the activity the user just came
 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.570
that's the activity the user just came
from but the mail application is a few

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580
from but the mail application is a few
 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.520
from but the mail application is a few
frames back on the back stack no one's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530
frames back on the back stack no one's
 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.379
frames back on the back stack no one's
looking at it it's a perfect candidate

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389
looking at it it's a perfect candidate
 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.270
looking at it it's a perfect candidate
to kill and so it's gone now that the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280
to kill and so it's gone now that the
 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.080
to kill and so it's gone now that the
mail application is gone we can create

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090
mail application is gone we can create
 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.350
mail application is gone we can create
the Maps process and in the Maps process

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360
the Maps process and in the Maps process
 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.020
the Maps process and in the Maps process
we can create the Maps activity and now

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030
we can create the Maps activity and now
 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.600
we can create the Maps activity and now
the user is looking at the map so it's

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
the user is looking at the map so it's
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.460
the user is looking at the map so it's
worth noting that all of this happened

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
worth noting that all of this happened
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.840
worth noting that all of this happened
without the user being aware of any of

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850
without the user being aware of any of
 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.700
without the user being aware of any of
the machinery from the users point of

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710
the machinery from the users point of
 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.710
the machinery from the users point of
view they clicked on mail they went to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
view they clicked on mail they went to
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.330
view they clicked on mail they went to
mail they clicked on a message they went

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
mail they clicked on a message they went
 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.770
mail they clicked on a message they went
to a message they clicked from the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
to a message they clicked from the
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.510
to a message they clicked from the
message to the web they went to the web

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
message to the web they went to the web
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.400
message to the web they went to the web
from the web they clicked on a map they

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410
from the web they clicked on a map they
 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.200
from the web they clicked on a map they
went to a map the fact that these are

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
went to a map the fact that these are
 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.700
went to a map the fact that these are
different processes different

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710
different processes different
 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.860
different processes different
applications different developers it's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870
applications different developers it's
 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.480
applications different developers it's
invisible to the user which is as it

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490
invisible to the user which is as it
 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.260
invisible to the user which is as it
should be now the reason we saved all

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270
should be now the reason we saved all
 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.120
should be now the reason we saved all
those little pieces of state information

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130
those little pieces of state information
 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.969
those little pieces of state information
in the system process is so that we can

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979
in the system process is so that we can
 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.830
in the system process is so that we can
go backwards and the user can navigate

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
go backwards and the user can navigate
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.350
go backwards and the user can navigate
backwards as seamlessly as they

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360
backwards as seamlessly as they
 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.990
backwards as seamlessly as they
navigated forward so from the current

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000
navigated forward so from the current
 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.659
navigated forward so from the current
state if the user hits back the first

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
state if the user hits back the first
 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.810
state if the user hits back the first
thing that we're going to do is pop the

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820
thing that we're going to do is pop the
 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.520
thing that we're going to do is pop the
Maps application off the top of the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530
Maps application off the top of the
 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.240
Maps application off the top of the
activity stack and restore the browser

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250
activity stack and restore the browser
 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.290
activity stack and restore the browser
the browser doesn't actually need to

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
the browser doesn't actually need to
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.760
the browser doesn't actually need to
restore its state because it's the same

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770
restore its state because it's the same
 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.460
restore its state because it's the same
object so at this point we can just

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470
object so at this point we can just
 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.710
object so at this point we can just
discard the saved state that was stored

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720
discard the saved state that was stored
 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.899
discard the saved state that was stored
in the system process and now the user

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909
in the system process and now the user
 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.250
in the system process and now the user
is looking at the browser that's the

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260
is looking at the browser that's the
 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.379
is looking at the browser that's the
foreground activity if they hit back

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389
foreground activity if they hit back
 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.020
foreground activity if they hit back
again they are expecting to go back to

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
again they are expecting to go back to
 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.300
again they are expecting to go back to
the mail message that they came from

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
the mail message that they came from
 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.159
the mail message that they came from
unfortunately the mail process isn't

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169
unfortunately the mail process isn't
 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.230
unfortunately the mail process isn't
running anymore so the first thing we

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240
running anymore so the first thing we
 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.409
running anymore so the first thing we
have to do is make space to run the mail

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419
have to do is make space to run the mail
 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.839
have to do is make space to run the mail
application we do that by killing the

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849
application we do that by killing the
 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.659
application we do that by killing the
Maps process and starting the mail

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669
Maps process and starting the mail
 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.360
Maps process and starting the mail
process once we've done that we can then

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
process once we've done that we can then
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.689
process once we've done that we can then
launch a fresh copy of the message

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699
launch a fresh copy of the message
 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.060
launch a fresh copy of the message
activity this is a new copy that doesn't

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070
activity this is a new copy that doesn't
 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.610
activity this is a new copy that doesn't
have any of the state that the user saw

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620
have any of the state that the user saw
 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.850
have any of the state that the user saw
when they left in order to get it back

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
when they left in order to get it back
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.899
when they left in order to get it back
into the state that the user is

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909
into the state that the user is
 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.970
into the state that the user is
expecting we then take that save part

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980
expecting we then take that save part
 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.560
expecting we then take that save part
full of information from the system

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570
full of information from the system
 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.190
full of information from the system
process and we restore the state of the

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200
process and we restore the state of the
 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.560
process and we restore the state of the
message activity once we've done that is

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570
message activity once we've done that is
 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.600
message activity once we've done that is
ready to be shown to the user we can pop

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610
ready to be shown to the user we can pop
 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.550
ready to be shown to the user we can pop
the browser off the top of the activity

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560
the browser off the top of the activity
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.100
the browser off the top of the activity
stack show them the message activity and

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110
stack show them the message activity and
 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.650
stack show them the message activity and
they're back where they started if we do

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660
they're back where they started if we do
 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.390
they're back where they started if we do
that one more time if we hit back again

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400
that one more time if we hit back again
 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.950

process because this one is still
running in the mail process we just

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680
running in the mail process we just
 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.470
running in the mail process we just
create a new instance of the mail list

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480
create a new instance of the mail list

to restore its state we take the state

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370
to restore its state we take the state
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.670
to restore its state we take the state
from the system process give that back

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680
from the system process give that back
 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.980
from the system process give that back
to the mail list now the mail list is in

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
to the mail list now the mail list is in
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.600
to the mail list now the mail list is in
the same state that it was when the user

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610
the same state that it was when the user
 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.210
