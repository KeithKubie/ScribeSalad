00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.266
Here I've drawn a graph showing how postage, which I'm going to call f of x,

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:09.484
depends on the cost of the order, or x. Note that like a couple of other

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:14.440
piecewise functions that we work with so far, this function has breaks in it.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.642
The different parts don't connect to one another. Because of this, we call

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:23.154
functions like this one, discontinuous. What I'd like to know is what piecewise

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:27.548
function this graph is representing? Please fill in the different parts of the

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.015
function for each of these parts of the domain right here. Of course, you can

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:33.029
always use our table for reference, too.
