[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.050
TIM HWANG: I called
the nuclear power plant

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.320
and basically asked them whether
or not I could do a tour.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.950
And they eventually
asked me, who are you?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.690
Where do you come from?

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.510
And I was like, I'm just really
interested in seeing the plant.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.080
We pretty much got a no.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.400
So what I did was worked
with a couple of friends.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.410
I had to put together
a fancy-sounding name

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.270
and a fancy-sounding
organization,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.460
and we tried again.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.240
And we got in.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.855
We weren't sure whether or not
it was going to work at all.

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:30.230
I wasn't even sure
whether or not

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.235
they would take one
look at the site

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.430
and say, well, that's
not a real organization.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.077
Because at that time,
it really wasn't.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.660
We were sort of like,
well, we kind of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.964
pulled off this weird trick.

00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:40.380
How many other
places could we get

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.750
into if we started doing this?

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.320
Hey, are you Dave?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.153
DAVE HYAMS: Hi, Tim.

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:50.250
Welcome to Sutro Tower.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.220
TIM HWANG: Hey,
thanks for having us.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.720
DAVE HYAMS: Glad
to show you around.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.170
TIM HWANG: Thanks.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.880
I'm fascinated by
Sutro Tower, because it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.770
looks so out of place.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.509
There's these beautiful
rolling hills and this fog,

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.300
and then there's just
this, like, enormous,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.590
protruding antenna in
the middle of the city.

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:09.829
DAVE HYAMS: Here we go.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:13.330
TIM HWANG: Infrastructure
is something

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.940
that your tax dollars go
to pay for quite often.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.050
But if you just walked
up as an average citizen

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.670
and tried to ask whether
or not you can get in,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.690
it's usually fenced off.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.760
It's impossible to
access these places.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.610
Kinda like, who's
this weird guy who

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.450
wants to drive hundreds of miles
to see this thing that no one

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.917
ever asks to visit ever?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.465
So when we started
doing more tours,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.090
people started to
get in touch, saying,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.380
this is a great idea--
how do I join up?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.520
And so now, we've got a
couple groups all over.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.770
So we have a chapter in
London, a chapter in New York,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.220
and a chapter in LA.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
Cities-- they're
incredibly dense places.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.620
And in your everyday
life, you actually

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.430
only end up seeing a tiny,
tiny percentage of it.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.460
Turning on the light bulb,
driving across the bridge,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.210
biking to work-- there's a whole
team of people that makes sure

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.920
it works every single
time you do that action.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.676
It's just very enjoyable to
appreciate the world around you

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:12.300
when you have the
opportunity to do so.

00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:22.490
You know, I'm always
really excited by the fact

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.560
that when people
start doing the tours,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.845
they may come because it's
really fun to go visit,

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.000
but once you're there, you
start thinking about, well, this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.090
is such a great resource.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.048
Why isn't more investment
going into it, right?

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:33.730
Or why is it broken in this way?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.560
Or why does it have
all these problems?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.559
And so I think it's really
important that people

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.090
kind of learn about the
state of infrastructure

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.520
and hopefully get motivated
to do something about it.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.740
We live in a culture
which is very,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.039
you know, move fast and
iterate, particularly

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.830
here in San Francisco
in the tech industry.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.050
But you can't just
hack a bridge.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.700
You can't just throw something
up, and then see what happens,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.560
and then debug it later, right?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.060
When a bridge goes into place,
it's pretty much got to work.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.604
If it doesn't, really
bad things could happen.

00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:04.895
And essentially we were really
fascinated by that idea,

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:06.630
like the idea that we're
building stuff that will

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.050
last for hundreds of years.

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:14.820
SPEAKER 1: Please check
out this next video.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.200
SPEAKER 2: You can see the
neon lights, the 40-story tall

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.180
casinos.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.860
And then right beneath that
is this dark and gray world,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.929
where people are just
trying to survive.

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.220
