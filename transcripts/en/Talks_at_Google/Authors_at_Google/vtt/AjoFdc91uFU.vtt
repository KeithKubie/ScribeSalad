00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.090
DAN STONE: How's it
going, everybody?

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.970
Thanks for coming.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.930
DANIEL HANDLER: Hello.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.260
DAN STONE: This
is Daniel Handler.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.540
DANIEL HANDLER: Hi.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.110
DAN STONE: Our guest for today.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.680
DANIEL HANDLER: How are you?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.943
Thank you for coming.

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:14.526
DAN STONE: We're
happy to be here.

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:16.610
DANIEL HANDLER: We're
gonna get you all smashed.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.735
DAN STONE: That's the goal.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.770
My name is Dan Stone.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.478
I'm the editor of
Radio Silence Magazine.

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:23.850
It's based up in San Francisco.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.070
Daniel and I have known each
other for quite a while.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.879
I first interviewed him about
Edgar Allan Poe years ago,

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.170
when I was still living in
DC, about a reading program.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.180
And then when I moved to
San Francisco years later,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.920
I started bartending at a place
in the city called the Alembic,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.300
and he's a big
cocktail fan, as am I.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.022
So we kind of solidified
our friendship across a bar.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:44.980
So when we were asked to
come down and do this,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.771
we thought it would be
good to set up a bar

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.254
and serve drinks to all of you.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:49.170
Talk about some stuff.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.410
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.700
It's fulfilling a long time
fantasy of getting everyone

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.366
at Google really drunk
in the afternoon.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.670
DAN STONE: He's been talking
about this for years.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.280
DANIEL HANDLER: I'm assuming
this is everyone, anyway.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.029
I'm assuming there are
no other employees.

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:00.780
I understand it's
just is a small--

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.820
DAN STONE: A couple
people missing, maybe.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.195
DANIEL HANDLER:
Intimate company.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
DAN STONE: So you guys
probably know who Daniel is.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.670
This magazine, Radio Silence, is
focused on literature and rock

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.990
and roll, which are two
of my favorite things,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.172
and also two of the things
that this guy excels in.

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:16.880
So he's a writer.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.960
Of course you know
him as the guy

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.585
who wrote all the
Lemony Snicket books.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.200
He also has written several
novels for adults-- "The Basic

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.340
Eight," "Watch Your Mouth,"
"Adverbs," "Why We Broke Up,"

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.200
and this amazing book
coming out next year that I

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.420
don't know if we're
allowed to name.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.570
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.403
DAN STONE: Can we name
it? "We Are Pirates."

00:01:33.403 --> 00:01:34.460
Is it February?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.420
DANIEL HANDLER: It's
called "We Are Pirates."

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.600
Yeah.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.440
It's coming out in February.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.440
DAN STONE: It's so good.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.009
I love it.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800
DANIEL HANDLER: I'll
let him compliment it.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.120
I'll say the title, and
then he can compliment it.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.730
"We Are Pirates."

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.400
DAN STONE: It's great.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.900
Great.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.531
It's great.

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.406
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:46.800
Because if it were the
reverse, it would be awkward.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.090
DAN STONE: Right.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.170
DANIEL HANDLER: If you were
saying what it was called,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.750
and I was saying,
and it's dynamite.

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:51.750
DAN STONE: Right.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.249
Right.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.660
Yeah.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
So we have a kind
of strange idea

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.886
for how we want to
structure this hour.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.510
We're going to make
drinks, but we also

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.325
want to talk about a few
works of art that are not his.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:05.950
We might talk about
some of yours, too.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.210
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.070
DAN STONE: Want to
explain the idea?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.400
DANIEL HANDLER: Who
knows what we'll do?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.805
Because we'll get
full of liquor soon.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:11.990
DAN STONE: Tell them.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.190
I'm going to start
making the first drink.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.981
DANIEL HANDLER: OK.

00:02:16.337 --> 00:02:18.420
We thought we would talk
about things that we like

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.760
and drinks that go with
it, which is basically

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.870
how I talk to just
about anyone I know.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.380
And we're going to
start with the gimlet.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.130
You say you serve
gimlets to everybody.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.127
This is a good
first drink to you?

00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:32.960
DAN STONE: Oh, yeah.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.418
I haven't served
them to everybody,

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:36.740
but I think it's a
great afternoon drink,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.750
it's a good brunch drink,
it's a good summer day drink--

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.569
it's classic.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.860
DANIEL HANDLER: It's versatile.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.340
DAN STONE: It is.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.270
DANIEL HANDLER: And you're
using this cool device that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.395
looked like a sex toy when
you unpacked it, but is,

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:52.250
in fact, also a citrus squeezer.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.350
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.350
Antique citrus squeezer.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.700
So we've got drinks
coming around.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.770
Pass them down the aisle.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.660
Those are some pre-batch
gimlets we did for you.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.163
And we're going to drink gimlets
and talk about crime fiction.

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.837
DANIEL HANDLER: Do you say your
recipe for the gimlet first?

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:11.670
DAN STONE: Oh, yeah.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.680
DANIEL HANDLER: I guess
it's right up there.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520
Our friend Wendy drew the
drinks and wrote the recipe

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.021
underneath.

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:16.686
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.630
Wendy McNaughton, an
artist in San Francisco--

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.720
she did these for everyone.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.890
If you want to make these
at home, there you go.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.390
Yeah.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.240
Two ounces of gin.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.060
I mean, there's a lot
of recipes for it.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.765
I make one slightly less sweet.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:30.640
Half ounce of simple
syrup, and then a couple

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.681
dashes of orange bitters.

00:03:33.342 --> 00:03:35.550
DANIEL HANDLER: I just always
put sugar in my gimlet,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.697
because I find simple syrup
too much of a pain to make.

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:39.780
DAN STONE: I can see that.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.130
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.504
I mean, I'm just
at home, lonely.

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:43.440
DAN STONE: Just shake
the hell out of it?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.315
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:48.118
DAN STONE: There we go.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:52.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:58.990
DAN STONE: We can do a
commercial for Beefeater.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.865
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.025
Beefeater, the gin Daniel
Handler's mother prefers.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.630
DAN STONE: My gin tastes are
pretty much simple London Dry.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.410
I like Bombay Dry a lot.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.650
DANIEL HANDLER: I
guess you and my mother

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.470
are alike in that way.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.790
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.300
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.845
DAN STONE: What are
your gin tastes?

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.220
DANIEL HANDLER:
I like a gin that

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.345
tastes like you've been
rolling around in a forest.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.100
It reminds me of my
wild and reckless youth

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.610
where I used to take girlfriends
to [INAUDIBLE] woods.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.810
DAN STONE: Nice.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.505
Kind of dirty gin, sounds like?

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:33.130
DANIEL HANDLER: Oh, I thought we
were talking about high school

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.630
again.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.170
Whatever I could get
away with, basically.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.370
Yeah, I like a
like-- I don't know.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.960
It smells herbal, but not like
some of them smell, potpourri.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.880
There are some gins that smell
like a scented candle store,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.766
and I'm opposed to that.

00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:50.980
I'm opposed to it in a
scented candle store, come

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.290
to think of it, and I'm
also opposed to it in a gin.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.998
DAN STONE: Right.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.000
OK.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.300
DANIEL HANDLER: You're going
to shake it and then strain it?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.150
DAN STONE: That's right.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.650
Yeah.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.540
We have an extra large ice
scoop for the occasion,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.464
so we might make some mistakes.

00:05:09.464 --> 00:05:10.380
DANIEL HANDLER: Never.

00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:15.260
But we're making gimlets
as the first round,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.050
which I hope you're
all drinking.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.460
I'm going to be very upset
if I see people taking

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.595
a little token sip, because my
ultimate fantasy is that we all

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:25.035
get really liquored up,
we get into a Google bus,

00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:26.940
and we go over to
the Bing campus

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.490
and we just start some stuff.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.750
I don't know what it is.

00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:34.730
DAN STONE: Missing one tool.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.110
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.416
DAN STONE: I'll wing it.

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.014
AUDIENCE: You can walk.

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:39.180
DANIEL HANDLER: We can walk?

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.200
We don't need to get there--
but getting there by Google bus

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.800
is kind of cooler.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.390
DAN STONE: You're that close?

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.150
Because they know what's coming?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.540
DANIEL HANDLER: You're like,
sorry, we were using MapQuest

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.691
and now we're lost.

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:46.190
Boom.

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:48.310
That's all you have to say.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.470
Like making simple
syrup, straining

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.178
is never anything I
do, because it's just

00:05:54.178 --> 00:05:55.280
another thing to wash.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.201
DAN STONE: Right.

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:57.450
DANIEL HANDLER: But you do it.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.991
You're a pro.

00:05:59.714 --> 00:06:01.380
DAN STONE: We can
have more if you want.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.750
Those look a little
small in these glasses.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.030
DANIEL HANDLER: Cheers.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.210
DAN STONE: Cheers.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.710
Cheers, everybody.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.140
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.098
DAN STONE: Is this the
first gimlet for anyone?

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:08.045
A couple.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:08.300
All right.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.940
DANIEL HANDLER: Well, today.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.439
Yeah.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.300
DAN STONE: Oh, that's
what I meant, yeah.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.250
I meant today.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.771
They have them on
tap in Building 39

00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:19.020
It's marked drinking fountain.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.900
DANIEL HANDLER: So
I like a gimlet too,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.104
and gimlets are a-- well,
where should I start?

00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:32.520
So there's a Lemony
Snicket series

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.470
that is out now, as
opposed to the one

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.261
that was out when you
were in grade school.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.240
And this is called "All
the Wrong Questions."

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.740
And "A Series of
Unfortunate Events"

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.580
was my take on Gothic
literature-- on Wuthering

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.490
Heights and other stories
of that ilk, in which

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.460
strange and sinister things
which happened a long time ago

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.580
are coming to bear on poor,
wretched people wandering

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.705
around terrible landscapes.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.690
And after 13 volumes
of that, I began

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.180
to get interested in noir,
in which corrupt people are

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.930
wandering around
more industrially

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.760
sinister landscapes, working on
secrets that probably they'll

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.680
never figure out,
and being forced

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.130
to behave more immorally.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.770
Which also seemed to me like
the journey of childhood--

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.680
that in a typical
noir detective story,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.082
the detective is
hired to do a case,

00:07:25.082 --> 00:07:27.290
and then the people are
lying to him about that case.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.600
And then as he discovers
this framework,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.160
then they say,
lay off that case.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.670
It's solved.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.730
We told you it's solved.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.810
And the detective
says, no, I'm going

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.180
to find my own solution to it.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.940
And that, to me, feels like
childhood, where everyone's

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.479
lying to you about
what's important.

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:42.020
And you gradually figure out,
wait a minute, this whole thing

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.425
is corrupt.

00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:43.870
And they're like, no no no,
stay in line, stay in line,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.660
stay in line.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.110
And you say, no, I'm going
to find my own moral path

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.000
in a world gone
hopelessly wrong,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.820
and live long enough to
invoke it on other people.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.970
As we're all doing.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.080
We're older than
we've ever been.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.330
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.038
DANIEL HANDLER: And
now we're even older.

00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:04.670
And "The Long Goodbye,"
by Raymond Chandler,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.970
one of the great American
novels in the world,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.070
was a focus of obsession for
me at various different ages.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.090
I first read it in high
school, and I loved it.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.690
I thought it was so sexy.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.714
I really hoped that I could
live the life of the characters

00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:23.630
in "The Long Goodbye."

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.110
Not even just the detective,
but kind of everybody,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.420
getting kind of wrecked
and sad all the time.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.830
Turns out even
when you're young,

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.913
it's kind of rough on you.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.539
But as I grew older, I
admired it more and more

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.720
as a well crafted novel--
that the language in it

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.429
is hopelessly
beautiful and lost.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.080
And I also think it's a great
portrait of male friendship.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.790
I think it's a
good book for a man

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.025
to give a woman who is
puzzled about his friends.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.570
I'm sure that's never
happened to anybody.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.269
Because it is
basically the story

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:02.560
of a friendship in which
Philip Marlowe, the detective,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.570
is friends with Terry Lennox
based on hardly anything

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.070
at first.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.430
DAN STONE: Kind of a
troubled friendship.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.820
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.528
And it's a troubled
friendship-- and then

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:12.570
keeps sticking up for
him way past all reason,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.070
but in a way that's
quite beautiful.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.210
It's beautiful as a love story.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.810
I've seen some people cast it as
a love story between men, which

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.739
I don't think it is, because
the men seem quite heterosexual.

00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:24.530
DAN STONE: They do.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.250
DANIEL HANDLER: I say this
as kind of a simpering sissy

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.465
myself, that they seem
extremely heterosexual.

00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:30.515
And the first
paragraph-- I'm going

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:32.299
to read the first
paragraph out loud,

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:34.340
because it's one of my
favorite first paragraphs.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.130
"The first time I laid
eyes on Terry Lennox,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.190
he was drunk in a Rolls
Royce Silver Wraith

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.725
outside the terrace
of the dancers.

00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:46.920
The parking lot attendant
had brought the car out,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.280
and he was still
holding the door open,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.120
because Terry Lennox's
left foot was still

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.500
dangling outside as if he
had forgotten he had one.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.474
He had a young looking face,
but his hair was bone white.

00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:57.890
You could tell by
his eyes that he

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.490
was plastered to the
hairline, but otherwise, he

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.700
looked like any other nice
guy in a dinner jacket who

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.920
had been spending too
much money in a joint that

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.760
exists for that purpose
and for no other."

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.220
I like the way it kind
of delves you into-- it

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.730
seems glamorous for a minute.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.530
Oh, he's in this car,
and he looks this way,

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.430
and what a glamorous life.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.630
And then there's this
kind of seething cynical

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.820
that exists for that
purpose and no other.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.230
That is, for Raymond
Chandler and Philip Marlowe,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.700
his detective, in particular
are full of this kind

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.710
of constant cynical judgment
on these people who he's

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.674
doing anything in the world
to help, which is fun.

00:10:36.674 --> 00:10:37.340
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:37.840
Yeah.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.390
Incredible tone to it.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.560
And I love how-- you do this
in your writing a lot, too,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.170
and this is something
that usually-- I

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.450
remember we published a
short story of Daniel's

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.025
in this first issue.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.360
Usually, you point
out when somebody

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.162
repeats a word too
close together,

00:10:53.162 --> 00:10:55.120
because it's something
you're just not supposed

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.828
to do in writing.

00:10:55.828 --> 00:10:58.660
And this whole paragraph
is tied together

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.987
with just repeated words,
one sentence after the other.

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:01.820
But he pulls it off.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.361
It kind of creates
this nice cadence.

00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.080
I love that.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.550
DANIEL HANDLER:
The fact that you

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.960
can't repeat words
is something you get

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.001
taught when you're writing
essays in high school,

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.070
and then some people
never have figured out

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.011
that they should follow
their own moral path

00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:14.510
and not listen to
the person telling

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.650
them to lay off the case.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.060
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.551
Yeah.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.042
Exactly.

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:17.542
Exactly.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.380
And then Lemony Snicket sort
came out of this tradition--

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.180
or, the new series.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.260
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.865
So, illustrated by
graphic novelist Seth.

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:33.390
I don't know if there are comics
fans in the audience today.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.404
I don't know why I
would think there would

00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:37.320
be comics fans in the
audience here at Google,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.777
but maybe some of
you know people

00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:40.860
who are into geek culture.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.900
I got Seth to illustrate
it by going to WonderCon

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.796
in San Francisco, which
is-- I'd never been

00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:50.045
to a comics convention before.

00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:51.630
DANIEL HANDLER: Never?

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.005
DANIEL HANDLER: I was told
that WonderCon is the smaller,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:58.540
artier one, which,
kind of, maybe.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.230
But I don't know what I
thought in my head, but I saw,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.620
oh, Seth is going to be signing.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.790
I'm interested in
working with him.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.998
I'm going to go to WonderCon.

00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:06.330
It's the smaller, artier one.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.870
So I think in my
head, it was like,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.670
I don't know what-- four people
in a room with a bottle of gin.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.580
And I'll go up to Seth,
and it'll work out nicely.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.580
And I walked in, and
literally when I walked in,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.560
an army of
Stormtroopers ran by me.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.240
And I had to recalibrate smaller
and artier for [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.950
And then I was talking to
one of the Stormtroopers,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.059
who was saying, oh,
yeah, we're reenacting

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.350
this battle in this other room.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.641
We have all these people going.

00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:33.085
And he said, you know,
like Civil War reenactors.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.210
And then he kept moving up.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.380
And I felt like, oh, yeah,
except the Civil War happened.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.700
It's kind of a big difference.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.760
So they're not reenacting.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.745
They're just acting.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.960
To which I have no
objection, but I just

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.940
thought it was a
distinction worth making.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.930
Like, people really
died in the Civil War.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.680
It really tore
our country apart.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.190
Tattooine is fine, what
with never existing.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.542
Maybe that's hard for people
to hear, but you have a drink.

00:13:02.542 --> 00:13:03.250
You have a drink.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.855
Slam it down if
you can't take it.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.150
And so I went to him, and
he was a lonely island,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.110
if you'll pardon the expression,
in the middle of WonderCon.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.210
He was literally in the shadow
of a huge statue of the Human

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.900
Torch.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.200
He was sitting in a
suit, signing copies

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.560
of his very, very sad and
miserable graphic novels.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.000
I mean, they're beautifully
made, but they're miserable.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.900
They're all about
depressed people.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.760
And I think if he hadn't
met me in that context,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.980
he wouldn't have agreed to
do it, but he did, so he did.

00:13:36.702 --> 00:13:37.660
DAN STONE: There we go.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.100
DANIEL HANDLER: I think he
was so desperate and lonely

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.480
and surrounded by the noise
of corporate superheroes

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.600
that he was like, somebody
wants to do something?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.100
Sure.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.700
I'll do that.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.450
DAN STONE: He didn't
know you were coming?

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.360
DANIEL HANDLER: No.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.550
DAN STONE: And you were
there just to find him?

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.424
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:13:52.424 --> 00:13:54.829
Well, my wife is an
illustrator, and she

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:56.370
was on a panel,
which was a disaster.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.710
And so I said, oh, well,
I'm coming with her

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.500
for moral support.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.030
And then, oh,
look, Seth is here.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.930
DAN STONE: Great.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.600
DANIEL HANDLER:
She was on a panel,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.600
and it was right when the
Walking Dead came out,

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.640
and there was the creator
of The Walking Dead,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.680
and then four illustrators
no one cared about.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.400
So my wife had to just sit
there while 3,600 people were

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.692
like, I have a question
about episode three.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.990
But the world of "All
The Wrong Questions"

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.100
is the world of
noir, and that tone

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.600
that I read you in
Raymond Chandler.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.308
I'll now read a
paragraph from this book,

00:14:28.308 --> 00:14:31.116
and you can see how
I ripped it off.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.750
Lemony Snicket is
narrating this.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.546
In this, he's an apprentice in
the secret organization that

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.170
is in "A Series of
Unfortunate Events."

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.080
He's about 13, and he's in this
lonely industrial town called

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.450
Stained by the Sea that has
made the mistake of draining

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.001
the sea.

00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:50.750
So it's no longer by
the sea, so it's even

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.850
more desolate and lonely
than it was before.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.230
"I used to be that
young man, almost 13,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.800
walking alone down an empty
street in a half faded town.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.880
I used to be that person
eating stale peanuts

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.000
and wondering about
a strange dusty item

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920
that was stolen or
forgotten and that

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.520
belonged to one
family or another,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.978
or their enemies,
or their friends.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:14.255
Before that, I was a child
receiving an unusual education,

00:15:14.255 --> 00:15:16.100
and before that,
I was a baby who

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.230
I'm told liked
looking in mirrors

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.770
and sticking his
toes into his mouth.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.840
I used to be that young man
and that child and that baby,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.340
and the building I
stood in front of

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.200
used to be a City Hall.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.870
Stretched out in front
of me was my time

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.650
as an adult, and
then a skeleton,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:36.150
and then nothing except perhaps
a few books on a few shelves."

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.660
Yeah.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.240
He's thinking about
death a lot in this book.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240
DAN STONE: Fantastic.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.640
DANIEL HANDLER:
I think you start

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.190
thinking about
death at 13, maybe.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:42.450
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.158
DANIEL HANDLER: Is
that when you started?

00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:45.380
DAN STONE: 12 or 13.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.510
Maybe even 11.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.110
13, I think, is a good age.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.610
I taught middle
school for a while.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.730
DANIEL HANDLER: Me too.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.450
DAN STONE: You
taught middle school?

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.570
DANIEL HANDLER: I taught
eighth grade, yeah.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:57.621
DAN STONE: Oh.

00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:00.120
I don't know how we've never
known that about each other.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.065
DANIEL HANDLER: We both
like eighth graders.

00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:03.100
DAN STONE: That's true.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.646
DANIEL HANDLER:
That came out wrong.

00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:05.954
DAN STONE: Yeah, that did.

00:16:05.954 --> 00:16:06.830
That did.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.080
But yeah.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.290
I think that's when
that dark side starts

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.160
to register a little
bit with kids.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
DANIEL HANDLER: Macbeth.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.440
I taught Macbeth to eighth
graders, and they loved it.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.610
They open on witches.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.180
Come on.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.337
That's like, the smartest--

00:16:19.337 --> 00:16:20.920
DAN STONE: One of
my students is here.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.470
Anne Farmer, who organized
the event-- her son Nick

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.240
was my student.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.340
And I taught the films
of Ingmar Bergman.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.620
A week long class
where all we did

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.746
was watch Bergman eight hours
a day, and they loved it.

00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:34.620
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.120
DAN STONE: They
absolutely loved it.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.420
Not even "The Magic Lantern."

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.940
They liked the really
strange dark stuff.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.180
DANIEL HANDLER: My middle
school was about two blocks

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.970
from the Parkside Theatre,
which is no longer there,

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.320
but it was on [INAUDIBLE]
in San Francisco.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.280
It was an art house
theater of the old school.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.600
And they had marathon days.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.150
And I can't believe I had
the stamina to do this,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.350
but we would go-- I went to
Bergman day, and Kurosawa day,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.470
and Woody Allen day,
and Orson Welles day.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.380
And they would show
like 12 movies in a row.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.020
And she would maybe take lunch
during one of the boring movies

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.819
and come back.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.560
It was crazy.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.940
Now I can't believe I did that.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.606
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.410
DANIEL HANDLER: And
on Friday nights,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.189
they'd stop making sense, and
they'd pull all the risers out

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.980
so you could dance.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.605
DAN STONE: Wow.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.329
That sounds fun.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.579
DANIEL HANDLER: It was another
thing to do with girls.

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:24.452
Besides roll around
in a forest, I mean.

00:17:24.452 --> 00:17:26.160
DAN STONE: I want to
start another drink.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.905
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.200
I better finish the first one.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.866
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.550
Finish up the first one.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.160
DANIEL HANDLER: This is where
you get in trouble, I always

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.290
think, in drinking, is
when someone's like, hey,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:34.925
you ready for another one?

00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:35.760
And you're not.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.350
And you're like,
yeah, yeah, sure!

00:17:39.377 --> 00:17:40.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:42.660
DAN STONE: We have an hour.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.160
We've got three drinks here,
so we've got to keep it moving.

00:17:46.192 --> 00:17:47.400
DANIEL HANDLER: That's right.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.110
We have drinking to do.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.943
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.130
DAN STONE: That only happens
at a bar at closing time.

00:17:55.636 --> 00:17:56.919
All right.

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:59.210
So here, we've got an old
fashioned to go with the poem

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.260
that we're going to talk about.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.926
And we'll show you
the poem in a second.

00:18:01.926 --> 00:18:05.860
But house bacon infused
Four Roses bourbon.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.520
So I went to Berkeley
Bowl yesterday,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.310
and they dragged a pig out from
the back of the butcher shop,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.150
and carved three pounds of fat.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.358
DANIEL HANDLER: Already dead.

00:18:17.358 --> 00:18:18.516
The pig was already dead.

00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:19.970
DAN STONE: Yeah,
the pig was dead.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.386
DANIEL HANDLER: I
had this fantasy

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:25.500
about how the customers
of Berkeley Bowl

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.830
would take to a pig being
slaughtered in the store,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.660
you know?

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.594
Because they're self
righteous about,

00:18:31.594 --> 00:18:33.010
like, are these
heirloom tomatoes?

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.010
It says organic, but is
it the kind of organic--

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.170
And then just if you were
like, hold on one second.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.180
We're killing a pig.

00:18:38.962 --> 00:18:40.170
We'll get to you in a minute.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.514
We'll get to you in a minute.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:43.770
DAN STONE: So yeah.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.603
It was already dead.

00:18:44.603 --> 00:18:48.700
So they carved three pounds
of fat off the side of it,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.620
and then we rendered that.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.530
DANIEL HANDLER: What
does that mean, render?

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.850
DAN STONE: Cook it
down until it's liquid.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.540
DANIEL HANDLER: Oh yeah?

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.206
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:18:55.206 --> 00:18:57.120
DANIEL HANDLER: So you
just put it in a pot?

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.786
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:18:57.786 --> 00:18:59.130
I put it in a covered pot.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.790
DANIEL HANDLER:
That pot is going

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.840
to make everything taste
delicious for the next nine

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.050
years.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:02.805
DAN STONE: I know.

00:19:02.805 --> 00:19:04.970
Well, it actually went
into several vessels.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.440
Like, my coffee
pot-- I could still

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.635
taste a little bit of
bacon in it this morning.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.072
So you steep it for four hours.

00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:13.571
DANIEL HANDLER: We're with the
American Medical Association,

00:19:13.571 --> 00:19:14.204
by the way.

00:19:14.204 --> 00:19:16.370
Put a little bacon fat in
your coffee every morning.

00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:19.470
DAN STONE: You steep
it for four hours,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.080
then freeze it for two hours.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.620
The one ingredient
we have that's

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.695
not up there is coffee beans.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.130
So it's also got a little
bit of caffeine in it.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.004
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:32.392
So it's like having a coke.

00:19:32.392 --> 00:19:34.314
Just going to put you
right on an even keel.

00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:36.730
DAN STONE: I don't know if a
vegetarian wants to drink it.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.459
It's up to you.

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:39.250
There's not actually
bacon fat in it still,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.890
but the flavor of it's there.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.830
So maybe that's what
a vegetarian could do.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.100
Maybe this is the perfect
drink to get away with.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.808
DANIEL HANDLER: Well,
that's a great line

00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:48.854
to see what kind of
vegetarian they are, right?

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:49.520
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.950
Exactly.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.846
I was at a wedding
recently with a vegan.

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:53.600
DANIEL HANDLER: Cheers.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.350
DAN STONE: Cheers.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:58.945
DANIEL HANDLER: That's good.

00:19:58.945 --> 00:19:59.910
DAN STONE: It's not bad, right?

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.280
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.590
It tastes a little breakfast-y.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.880
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.421
Well, a little maple
syrup, and yeah.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.262
Get coffee in the aftertaste.

00:20:06.262 --> 00:20:08.470
DANIEL HANDLER: You do have
coffee in the aftertaste.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:09.861
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:20:09.861 --> 00:20:10.360
So yeah.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.830
Old fashioneds
are coming around.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.705
So we made this drink
to pair with a poem

00:20:14.705 --> 00:20:15.580
that we want to talk.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.340
We'll read it to you.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:16.760
DANIEL HANDLER: There it is.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.843
DAN STONE: It's coming up.

00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:18.940
All right.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.280
Want to read it?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.988
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.
"Everything Will Be

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:25.090
Fixed By Love."

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.790
"Everyone woke up hungover.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.450
Everyone woke up
in the wrong bed.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.490
Everyone had the wrong
shoe on the wrong foot

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.365
in the wrong weather.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.470
Everyone was so hungry.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.600
Then everyone ate too much.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.140
Love me everyone said.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.160
Love me first everyone said.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.320
Fix me everyone said.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.774
Fix me first."

00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:47.440
I like this poem a lot.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.030
Part of it is that I'm addicted
lately to the word wrong,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.340
which was in "All the Wrong
Questions," because it's

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.580
instantly narrative.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.410
That's just a word that I
started falling in love with.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.962
"He opened the
wrong door," right?

00:20:58.962 --> 00:20:59.920
That's already a story.

00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:02.060
DAN STONE: I like that.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.870
DANIEL HANDLER: Right?

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.350
DAN STONE: That's great.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.350
DANIEL HANDLER: She was
waiting at the bus stop,

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.642
and out stepped the wrong girl.

00:21:06.642 --> 00:21:07.308
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.450
DANIEL HANDLER: It's great.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.020
DAN STONE: And three
times in this poem.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:10.930
DANIEL HANDLER: And I was
talking to another poet,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.140
and she likes it with real.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.473
She says, I like it with real,
because when you put real

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.060
in front of anything,
it automatically

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.950
sounds like it's not real.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.415
Like, have some real lemonade?

00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:20.810
And you're like,
what's going on?

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:25.560
DANIEL HANDLER: I'm gonna
wake up without a kidney.

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:31.070
So an old fashioned is another
really classic cocktail.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.390
Usually, if you order
it at your average bar,

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.630
it has fruit salad at
the bottom, basically.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.587
It has a slice of orange
and a maraschino cherry.

00:21:39.587 --> 00:21:40.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.836
DANIEL HANDLER:
Like the old fruit

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:44.450
salad of your grandmother,
and then bourbon on top.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.170
To which I have no
objection, by the way.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.294
DAN STONE: It's fine, yeah.

00:21:47.294 --> 00:21:50.904
So that is the
new old fashioned.

00:21:50.904 --> 00:21:52.820
The old old fashioned,
which I didn't actually

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.320
make it live up here-- we
already had it premade,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.330
because I accidentally
batched all of it,

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.740
and then realized I didn't
have any of the bourbon

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.720
left to make it
for you in person.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.290
DANIEL HANDLER: Oh yeah?

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.930
DAN STONE: But anyway.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.720
DANIEL HANDLER: Still good.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.390
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.890
So the old old
fashioned is just simply

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.840
bourbon, bitters, and sugar.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.735
And then at some
point, they started

00:22:09.735 --> 00:22:11.110
making a new old
fashioned, where

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.450
they would muddle the fruit
salad-- maraschino cherries

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.199
and orange slices.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.590
But this is a little
more extravagant

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.090
than with maple syrup
and bacon and coffee.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.440
But this is more the old
school old fashioned.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.315
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.310
And supposedly, it's
the oldest cocktail.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.320
DAN STONE: Right.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.111
Well, they also say
that about the sazerac.

00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.970
DANIEL HANDLER: Plus I
just figure, you know, now

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.530
some caveman was drinking some
distillation of something,

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.330
and then he was like, oh,
a little grass got in it.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.410
And he was like, well,
I'm not throwing it out.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.010
I'm a caveman.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.677
DAN STONE: Right

00:22:46.677 --> 00:22:48.134
DANIEL HANDLER: I
mean, he probably

00:22:48.134 --> 00:22:50.090
wasn't that self aware
about being a caveman.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.790
But still, the
point was, you know,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.237
he was like,
distillation's hard.

00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:55.570
I'm not throwing this out
because I got something in it.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.800
And that was probably
the first cocktail.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.175
DAN STONE: It
probably was, yeah.

00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:00.370
DANIEL HANDLER: They're
like, Ugg, it's delicious.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.870
DAN STONE: What did
you put in this?

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:03.940
DANIEL HANDLER: What is it?

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.652
Tastes grassy.

00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:05.610
Tastes a little grassy.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.640
Tastes like mastodon blood.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.480
What is it?

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.610
DAN STONE: So we were
drinking old fashions

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.090
while we were talking about
what we were going to do here,

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.450
and you pulled this
poem out of your wallet.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.710
You carry poems in your wallet.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.840
DANIEL HANDLER: I keep
poems in my wallet.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.030
DAN STONE: Show them one
of them, because they've

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.260
been in there for a
while, and you can tell.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.140
This was one of them.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.070
He pulled this out and said,
we can talk about this.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.860
DANIEL HANDLER: You're
never sorry if you

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.985
have a poem in your wallet.

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:30.480
Even though this is
something I never

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.720
did-- I never kept a
condom in my wallet--

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.465
but I feel like
it feels that way.

00:23:35.465 --> 00:23:36.340
Like, you never know!

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.470
Bring a poem.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.320
You don't know
what's gonna happen.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.180
You don't know.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.900
Because you might
need both, and you

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.350
could stop at a
drugstore for a condom,

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.933
but where are you
going to get a poem?

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.450
Yeah.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.520
I'm not going to read
them all, thank goodness.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.270
But here it is.

00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:57.520
I'm also working on a
new book about people

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.310
who are troubled in
love, and I liked this.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.500
And it has a panicky
feel to it, which I feel,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.470
when you're young and in love,
or looking to be in love,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.849
or love is over, there's
a pulsey, panicky thing

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:11.390
that happens.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.306
DAN STONE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:14.760
The whole poem's about
getting too much of something

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.520
and trying to deal
with the consequences.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.935
Everyone wakes up hungover.

00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:18.810
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.182
And sympathy for
somebody else, but still

00:24:22.182 --> 00:24:23.140
not putting them first.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.126
DAN STONE: Right.

00:24:24.126 --> 00:24:26.000
DANIEL HANDLER: Love me
first, everyone said.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.087
Fix me first.

00:24:27.087 --> 00:24:29.670
You have sympathy for, like, oh,
the whole world's in trouble,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.610
but still, my troubles
should actually be first.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.192
Which feels like a young
and in love problem.

00:24:35.192 --> 00:24:37.650
And it reminds me of the first
time I had an old fashioned,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:44.310
I was in my early 20s, and
I was at the first meeting

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.610
with my literary agent, who
is still my literary agent.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.980
But I had my first
novel, "The Basic Eight."

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.110
I'd given her 50 pages.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.580
She said she liked
it, and then she said,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.640
I'm going to happen to
be in San Francisco.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.760
Come have a drink with me.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.370
Which was-- I was so
young, and working at a job

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.750
that I had no commitment to
and wasn't a good employee at.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.420
So it seemed really glamorous
to go downtown to San Francisco

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.360
and have a drink with
a literary agent.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.660
And I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.040
I didn't know, like,
do I bring a gift?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.831
How does this work?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.839
So I only had one suit
and one nice white shirt

00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:24.880
then that I had to pin
together with safety pins,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.180
because the buttons were gone.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.860
So I wore those.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.360
Classy.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.300
And then she sat
down, and she said,

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.424
I'll have an old fashioned.

00:25:31.424 --> 00:25:34.100
And I was like, yeah,
me too, of course.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.210
And then thinking, I
wonder what that is.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.870
And then hoping
that there wasn't a

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.370
follow up question,
because I didn't

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.840
know anything about
cocktails then.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.710
DAN STONE: How do you like it?

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.920
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.190
Like, oh, yeah?

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.580
How do you like it?

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.665
I'd be like, oh, with
a wing wang wunnamunga.

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:45.220
You know.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.045
Belgian style.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.180
Yeah.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:49.600
But [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
They just brought me it.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.280
And it's a good drink to
nurse, because the ice melts,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.220
and everything
continues to be nice.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.260
And so if you're worried
about getting drunk

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.259
during your first meeting
with a literary agent,

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:01.860
you can just kind of nurture it.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.745
DAN STONE: It's always
a good drink to order.

00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:06.120
No one ever has a problem with
ordering an old fashioned,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.661
even if you get the
fruit salad kind.

00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:10.430
I went around the city with
a few friends the other day

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.880
on bicycles, and we
got an old fashioned

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.430
from every bar we walked into.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.404
Maybe six places.

00:26:16.404 --> 00:26:18.070
DANIEL HANDLER: I
hope you had a helmet.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.685
DAN STONE: We did, yeah.

00:26:18.685 --> 00:26:19.390
We had a helmet.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:19.810
We wore it in the bar.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.540
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.340
Can't be too careful.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.006
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:26:22.006 --> 00:26:23.040
Exactly.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.680
And they weren't all great,
but it's an old fashioned.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.815
So even if they're
not great, it's

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:29.690
one of those drinks
that's still pretty good.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.490
Not all drinks are like that.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.055
DANIEL HANDLER: And I would
say that's my connection to it

00:26:33.055 --> 00:26:33.555
with poetry.

00:26:33.555 --> 00:26:37.400
A, it's old, and it's being
reinvented all the time.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.420
And that I'm a big
reader of poetry,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.480
and a big believer
in poetry, and I

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.720
try to be something of a
proselytizer about poetry,

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.300
because I feel like if you
read poetry on a regular basis,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.880
you will achieve a calm state
that no other work of art, I

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.540
think, can provide.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.180
And particularly now
in the world online,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.352
it's really easy to find
poetry really easily.

00:26:59.352 --> 00:27:00.810
Actually, through
Poetry Foundation

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.090
and through Poetry
Magazine, they'll

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.080
send you one in your
inbox every day.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.190
And like an old fashioned,
it's not always great,

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.470
but it's never quite terrible.

00:27:09.482 --> 00:27:11.440
The poems that come from
the Poetry Foundation.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.390
I don't mean no
poetry is terrible.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.223
DAN STONE: OK, yeah.

00:27:14.007 --> 00:27:14.590
Yeah, I agree.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.090
DANIEL HANDLER: And I like
thinking about poetry,

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.040
because it's really old.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.320
I write novels, and the
novel was invented--

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.700
DAN STONE: It's a new form.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.050
DANIEL HANDLER: There are
different theories about when

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.240
the first novel was, but
they're all not so long ago.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.835
And poetry traces back to
when people were talking.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.820
And it's fascinating to me.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.709
And the practitioners of poetry,
particularly if you put a drink

00:27:38.709 --> 00:27:41.000
in them, will begin talking
about the ancient tradition

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.420
in a way that you
find fascinating.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.575
Although they're poets, so you
have to pay for the drinks.

00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:45.533
DAN STONE: That's true.

00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:46.420
That's true.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.800
Why do you think it
creates that sense of calm?

00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:52.190
DANIEL HANDLER: This will
sound kind of woo-woo,

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.106
but I'm on the second drink.

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.480
I think that it
puts you in touch

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.060
with this very
ancient tradition.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.910
I think in reading
a poem, you're

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.630
attaching yourself so
this long, glorious thing.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.160
And I think part of being in
the world is attaching yourself

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.210
to something larger.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.350
And I'm not a religious
person, for instance,

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.750
but that's an obvious
way in which people

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.249
attach themself to
something larger.

00:28:13.249 --> 00:28:14.764
But I think even
that's why people

00:28:14.764 --> 00:28:16.430
like to work at big
companies sometimes.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.980
You like to be part of
something that's happening.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.370
And poetry was invented
to make people feel better

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.084
about the world.

00:28:25.084 --> 00:28:26.500
DAN STONE: And to
remember things.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.207
DANIEL HANDLER: When
people would say,

00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:30.540
this is an old, ancient thing
that we say every morning,

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.880
and it makes us feel
better, and makes

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.463
us feel like we're not going to
get eaten by a mastodon today.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:35.875
And it's appealing.

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:38.000
DAN STONE: I think that
too, especially coming down

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.850
to talk here today.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.240
The oldest poetry we have was a
way of remembering our stories,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.230
because we set it down in
language that you can't forget.

00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:50.460
That will have these devices
like rhyme and meter, which

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.430
they all did back then.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.910
So you could memorize.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.285
That was a category in the
ancient Olympics-- poetry

00:28:56.285 --> 00:28:56.785
recitation.

00:28:58.466 --> 00:29:00.590
People would remember
thousands of lines of poetry,

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.548
and you'd preserve the
stories of your culture.

00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:05.616
Now we sort of do that
largely through Google

00:29:05.616 --> 00:29:06.490
and things like that.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.040
The internet.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.480
The stories are
preserved that way.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.900
DANIEL HANDLER: But even
things that I think of as poems

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.380
are kind of slogans,
like no shirt, no shoes,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.860
no service is a poem
that makes you remember

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.975
certain things that are the
basics of polite society.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.230
Which is that you should
wear a shirt and shoes,

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.417
and then people will serve you.

00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:25.750
That's a good thing to remember.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:26.416
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.400
I mean, I also am a
big lover of poetry.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.650
I think probably not
a lot of people are.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.400
Obviously not a lot
of people are anymore.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.540
DANIEL HANDLER: I don't know.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.956
It's one of those things where
if you show it to somebody,

00:29:39.956 --> 00:29:41.036
everybody likes it.

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:42.410
But people forget
to seek it out,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.201
so I like to be a
walking billboard for it.

00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:46.202
While I'm being a walking
billboard for Google.

00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:46.910
DAN STONE: Right.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.540
Yeah.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.714
I think people also turn
to it in difficult times,

00:29:49.714 --> 00:29:51.380
more than they'll
turn to anything else.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.800
Maybe music, but when
something goes wrong--

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.680
like, always at a
funeral, there's poetry.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.512
Or after September
11th, poetry everywhere.

00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:01.470
That's sort of how people
make sense of things.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:03.860
Anyway.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.210
DANIEL HANDLER: Anyway,
I'm in favor of it.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.876
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.250
Pro-poetry.

00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:10.450
DANIEL HANDLER: You publish
poets in Radio Silence.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.408
DAN STONE: Yeah, we do.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.045
And we have a great conversation
between Robert Pinsky,

00:30:15.045 --> 00:30:16.800
the British poet, and
Bruce Springsteen.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.634
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:17.634 --> 00:30:19.716
DANIEL HANDLER: And it
turns out Bruce Springsteen

00:30:19.716 --> 00:30:20.860
is a big Robert Pinsky fan.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.350
That's the most
fascinating part of it.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.808
So it starts with
Bruce Springsteen

00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.350
saying, like, hey,
I love your work.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.420
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.270
Big fan.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.120
DANIEL HANDLER: Which is not how
you thought it was going to go.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.840
DAN STONE: Right, right.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.339
Yeah.

00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:31.326
So usually in each
issue of Radio Silence,

00:30:31.326 --> 00:30:34.995
we'll publish a contemporary
poet and something old.

00:30:34.995 --> 00:30:36.370
Something in public
domain that's

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.911
sort of been overlooked
or forgotten.

00:30:37.911 --> 00:30:39.860
But yeah, in the
issue you have, it

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.530
begins with this
conversation between the two

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.360
that happened at
Farley Dickinson

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.260
University in New Jersey.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.560
And no one's ever seen it.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.240
They won't release it.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.960
I got a bootleg of
it, and Bruce's people

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.470
liked the magazine,
and said they'd

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.070
let us publish an excerpt of it.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.644
But what happened in it-- and
I'll show it to you sometime.

00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:00.310
We'll drink old
fashioneds and watch it.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.010
Springsteen started-- Pinsky's
got that great poem, "Samurai

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.500
Song," which is
a beautiful poem.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.250
And Springsteen was
talking about how much

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.610
he liked his work.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.349
And at one point,
he just started

00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:13.390
to recite "Samurai Song."

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.440
He had a guitar in his
lap, and he just slowly

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.825
played a few chords
along with it

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:19.050
as he was reciting
it from memory.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.170
And he just eased into the
"Darkness on the Edge of Town."

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.630
And it was just this
mind-blowingly amazing

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.760
performance, but they won't
let us do anything with it.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.840
So the people in
the room saw it.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.300
DANIEL HANDLER:
Someday, the lawyers

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.205
will arm wrestle it out.

00:31:32.205 --> 00:31:32.871
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:33.720
They should.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.689
It's really great.

00:31:34.689 --> 00:31:36.730
DANIEL HANDLER: Another
thing I like about poetry

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.800
and poets is that
rock stars love poets.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.620
And it's really fun sometimes
to watch a rock star get blown

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.220
away, because they're
not used to that,

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.640
or you're not used to seeing it.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.840
DAN STONE: Right.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.747
Well, I mean, song lyrics-- it's
probably more popular any type

00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:54.080
of literature we have right now.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.610
They're just poems set to music.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.485
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.132
DAN STONE: So I guess
it persists that way.

00:31:59.132 --> 00:32:01.360
DANIEL HANDLER: "Caught
Your Eye But Not Your Name."

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.901
That's a pop song
I'm into right now,

00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:04.970
and I thought it was a
great line of poetry.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.511
I caught your eye,
but not your name?

00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:07.020
It's great.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.810
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.310
Yeah.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.030
It is good.

00:32:10.057 --> 00:32:10.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:12.605 --> 00:32:14.730
DANIEL HANDLER: You know
what's another great song?

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.924
"Pretty Boy."

00:32:19.924 --> 00:32:22.340
I heard they have happy hour
at Google Wednesday, Thursday

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.855
and Friday.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.717
So we're getting you through.

DANIEL HANDLER: Between
the weekend and when happy

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.420
hour starts.

00:32:34.527 --> 00:32:36.860
DAN STONE: I think we're going
to go onto another drink.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.360
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:37.740
Yeah.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.573
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.600
DANIEL HANDLER:
Because we talked

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.270
about a book that I love, and
a poem that I love, and then

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.390
we're going to show
a scene from a movie

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.348
I love, which we saved
for last, because that's

00:32:48.348 --> 00:32:49.810
the easiest thing to experience.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:50.600
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.391
DANIEL HANDLER: And
we'll all be plastered.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.120
And the movie is a
Mexican melodrama.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.340
Here it is on DVD.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.161
We both brought this.

00:33:03.161 --> 00:33:04.160
I don't really know why.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.035
So we can hold it up.

00:33:05.035 --> 00:33:05.780
See?

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.579
And you thought I was lying.

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:09.870
DAN STONE: You carry it with
you everywhere, don't you?

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:10.690
DANIEL HANDLER: I kind of do.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:11.500
DAN STONE: He loves this movie.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.111
And I do, too.

00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:12.610
It's great.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.420
But I didn't know it until
you told me about it.

DANIEL HANDLER: No one does.

00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:18.510
And it's nice about having
a favorite movie that no one

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.940
else has seen is you
get to show to them.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:27.630
And I saw this movie
for the first time

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.800
in the mid-'90s at
the Castro Theater,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.980
and I moved to New York, and
it started playing in New York

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.490
right after I moved there.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.940
And so I saw it again
with a friend of mine.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.570
I saw two showings in a row.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.614
I saw it with one
friend, and then

00:33:42.614 --> 00:33:44.155
I said goodbye to
my friend, and then

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.940
I just waited
outside the theater,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.300
and my other friend came,
and we went and saw it again.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.790
And I didn't admit
it, because it

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.415
was going to be too
crazy to say that I

00:33:51.415 --> 00:33:53.415
wanted to show
people this movie.

00:33:53.415 --> 00:33:55.190
And it's great.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.130
"La Aventurera," or
"The Adventurist."

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.103
It's a 1950s kind
of noir melodrama.

00:34:01.103 --> 00:34:02.320
It's Mexican.

00:34:04.652 --> 00:34:06.860
I'm going to say the first
five minutes of the movie,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.950
because it's so insane.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.580
Our hero, Elena,
skips down the stairs.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.790
And we should say
that our heroine

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.789
is played by this
talentless actress.

00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:21.080
She can't act, and she can't
sing, and she can't dance,

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.243
and she does all of
them in the movie.

00:34:23.243 --> 00:34:24.659
And so the movie
is also this kind

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.980
of love story from the
director, who, big surprise,

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.320
was in love with this woman.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.710
So he's made this movie
around this woman.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.320
And he just says, well,
I'm taking it as a given

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.440
that everyone finds
this woman irresistible.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.860
And find her utterly
irresistible.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.679
So I love that it's this
movie where he's like, right?

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.179
Am I right?

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.389
The best dancer in the world.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.765
And you're like, mm, no.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:53.550
But she is taking dance
classes and living

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.639
with her kind of
uptight parents--

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.420
her sensitive father
and her brusque mother.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.610
And a man-- a family
friend-- comes up

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.210
to take her to dance class.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.010
And the mom says,
no, I don't want you

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.040
with that family friend.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.730
He flirts with you too much.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.710
You go by yourself.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.160
So she goes by herself to dance
class, and when she gets back,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.910
she finds her mother in the
arms of the family friend.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:23.000
[GASP] And then the father
gets home and learns this,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.590
and goes into the study
and shoots himself.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.550
And then Elena leaves the
house, and you get a flashback.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.961
You've gotten so many things--

00:35:30.961 --> 00:35:32.335
DAN STONE: This
is in 10 minutes.

00:35:32.335 --> 00:35:32.800
DANIEL HANDLER: That's
one of my favorite things.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.860
In the first eight
minutes of the film,

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.566
there's a flashback to
what you've just seen,

00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:40.440
because there's so much
shocking information.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.023
She's in the street
being like, oh no!

00:35:42.023 --> 00:35:45.010
And then it shows the
scene of it going on.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.930
And she's like, I
can't handle it!

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.330
And I love that it mimics
your reaction as the viewer.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.380
Because you're like, I
can't handle any of it.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.060
This is insane.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.690
Anyway, she ends up in
a white slavery thing.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.481
That's complicated.

00:36:02.129 --> 00:36:03.920
She ends up kind of in
a white slavery ring

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.602
run by the mother of
her subsequent lover.

00:36:06.602 --> 00:36:07.310
It's complicated.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.430
But what we're going to show
is one of the dance scenes,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.360
which, for me, because
it's the third drink,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.800
I think we all want to stare
rapturously at this movie that

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.022
is a love story about an
irresistible woman who's

00:36:23.022 --> 00:36:25.230
utterly resistible for
everyone else but the director

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.990
of the film.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.448
DAN STONE: You
know, it's funny you

00:36:27.448 --> 00:36:30.480
say that, because everything
I've read about this film,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.010
everyone just complements her.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.924
I found her to be not--

00:36:33.924 --> 00:36:36.215
DANIEL HANDLER: She's the
Elizabeth Berkley of her day,

00:36:36.215 --> 00:36:37.710
I think.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.790
It reminds me of Elizabeth
Berkeley in "Showgirls."

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:41.290
Distinctly.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.125
DAN STONE: Touche.

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:43.000
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.849
I mean, I found her to
not be a terrible actress

00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:47.890
to carry this movie, just
because the movie is so

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.470
over the top.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.050
Just so melodramatic.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:55.765
Just unapologetically excessive.

00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:57.205
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:36:57.205 --> 00:36:58.370
DANIEL HANDLER: And
there's poetry in it.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.940
I find it very
beautiful, this movie.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.590
I mean, it's
ridiculous, but when

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.500
you get past it
being ridiculous,

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.420
and you get all the way
all around the circle,

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.617
it starts to makes sense to.

00:37:06.617 --> 00:37:07.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.240
DAN STONE: You done with that?

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.760
You ready for another?

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:20.920
So this one's a little
bold for non-drinkers.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.160
So this is the Rosa Juarez--

00:37:23.424 --> 00:37:25.590
DANIEL HANDLER: You can see
who has a meeting later.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.900
Some people are like, huh.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.600
It's fine.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.516
We won't pressure you.

00:37:28.516 --> 00:37:30.430
I mean, we will, because we are.

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:33.790
DAN STONE: A lot of the
movie takes place in Juarez.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.880
A lot of the darker
scenes take place there.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.340
After she leaves the happy
home life, she goes there.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.380
Which, at the time, in
Mexico, I was reading about,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.980
there was a sort of
urbanization period

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:50.135
around then where those cities
became just dens of sin.

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:51.010
Juarez in particular.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.470
So it's sort of about that.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.900
There's a whole category
films that this came out

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.430
of a tradition, and this is
sort of the best of them.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.740
But we've got Mezcal,
which is smoky.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.310
DANIEL HANDLER: It's like
tequila's disreputable brother.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.460
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.860
But a good Mezcal is as
good as a good tequila.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.092
I mean, it can be incredible.

00:38:13.092 --> 00:38:15.050
DANIEL HANDLER: But I
feel like tequila's like,

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.825
hey, let's party.

00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:17.267
Don't talk to my brother.

00:38:17.267 --> 00:38:19.100
And the brother's like,
I'm doing something.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.465
Don't come in here.

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:21.840
I'll be at the
party in a minute.

00:38:23.377 --> 00:38:24.460
Is that someone screaming?

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.700
No, she's fine.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.390
She's fine.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.395
Don't come in here.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.854
DAN STONE: So Mezcal is a
smoky version of tequila.

00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:35.520
You the smoke go
through the distillate.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.840
So it's the same
difference between scotch

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.944
and other kinds of whiskey.

00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:42.360
Smoke goes through
the distillate,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.430
makes it a smoky drink.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.259
So you have Mazcal,
Campari-- which you

00:38:46.259 --> 00:38:47.300
I'm sure you've all seen.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.265
This goes in Negronis
Italian liquor.

00:38:50.265 --> 00:38:52.390
DANIEL HANDLER: There are
two things about Campari.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.530
One is that they
always say it's made

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.120
from the hulls of dead insects,
which I don't think is true,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.420
and it's because
of the word dead.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.211
It's like the word
wrong, or the word real.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.760
People have said
to me, oh, you know

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.551
that's made from the
hulls of dead insects.

00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:05.660
And I think, like, why say dead?

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.740
They're definitely dead.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.700
So therefore, the
whole story is suspect.

00:39:13.979 --> 00:39:15.770
And the other is that
it rhymes in Italian,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.790
and I can't recite it.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.050
But Campari had an Italian--
well, it's an Italian liqueur,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.180
but it had an
Italian ad campaign

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.610
that said, "Like love, the
first six times you try it,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.940
it won't work out."

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.752
Isn't that amazing?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

Wow.

you gotta stay with it.

going to be negative.

DAN STONE: So, Dolin
dry vermouth, yeah.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.480
And then a pinch
of salt, which has

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.160
this nice effect with
any Campari drink.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.210
Also great in Negronis.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.030
It sort of takes the
edge off the bitterness,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.910
and it's strange.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.390
It actually brings the
sweetness of the drink out.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.536
So a little pinch of salt.

00:40:27.536 --> 00:40:29.910
You stir up in it, and yeah,
finish it with a lemon peel.

zest on yours,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.490
You can see his belt
buckle while you drink.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.815
DAN STONE: You can
taste the salt, though.

00:40:47.815 --> 00:40:49.670
DANIEL HANDLER: You're
like, it's a skull,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.400
but the skin isn't
all off the skull.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.733
What kind of belt buckle's that?

00:40:53.232 --> 00:40:55.450
I told you not to come in here.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.535
Don't come in here.

00:40:59.513 --> 00:41:00.179
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:00.730
There you have it.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.140
DANIEL HANDLER: All right.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.020
Let's put on the movie.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.220
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.900
Let's do that.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.620
So she has to perform
at a nightclub as part

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.191
of the white slavery ring.

[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:13.155 --> 00:41:15.119
[GONG RINGING]

00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:22.621
DANIEL HANDLER: It's an enormous
deep set for a nightclub, eh?

00:41:43.992 --> 00:41:45.990
I won't do too much
running commentary,

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.980
but I'll say that I love how the
offensive Arabian stereotypes

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.262
seem less offensive because
it's a Mexican movie.

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:54.754
Which is not true.

00:41:54.754 --> 00:41:56.045
It shouldn't be less offensive.

00:41:56.045 --> 00:41:56.832
But it is.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.680
There she is.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.460
Right?

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.456
Can't dance.

00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:27.372
Yeah.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.352
But everybody else can dance.

00:42:36.834 --> 00:42:39.324
And they must be
seethingly jealous.

00:42:51.276 --> 00:42:53.509
So you can imagine with
the different angles,

00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:55.550
you're having dinner about
half a mile from this.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.550
This is what's going on.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.756
No one can see it, because
the stage is so deep.

00:43:12.532 --> 00:43:14.300
That's a pretty
good gig, I think.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.580
Male extra in the dance show.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.676
That is a good gig.

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:19.920
DAN STONE: We could keep
it going and talk over it.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.340
DANIEL HANDLER:
Yeah, I think so.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.756
DAN STONE: Because we don't
have a whole lot of time left.

00:43:23.879 --> 00:43:26.295
DANIEL HANDLER: And yet, we
won't be able to talk over it,

00:43:26.295 --> 00:43:27.066
because it's so hypnotizing.

00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:27.732
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:43:27.732 --> 00:43:29.010
It's too good.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.440
I think the strange thing,
too, is that most of the film

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.149
is not like this.

00:43:32.149 --> 00:43:33.898
There's maybe three
or four dance numbers,

00:43:33.898 --> 00:43:35.730
and the rest of it's
kind of like a noir.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.640
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.700
Most of it is about
this white slavery ring.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.859
But it was difficult to choose
a scene, and I just thought,

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:42.775
this is a great scene.

00:43:42.775 --> 00:43:45.505
I think there's something so
gossamer about this movie,

00:43:45.505 --> 00:43:47.560
because you see that the
director loves, loves,

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.900
loves this actress.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.695
It's kind of like
"Annie Hall," right?

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:52.910
And this is great.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.490
Like, no one's above her.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.144
She's on the floor
in a dance thing,

00:43:56.144 --> 00:43:57.560
so the above view
is really wasted

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.010
on everyone but the director.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.815
This is terrible.

00:44:02.815 --> 00:44:03.811
Look at this.

00:44:03.811 --> 00:44:04.310
Awful.

00:44:06.334 --> 00:44:07.750
She's like, don't
buy me earrings,

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.580
because I was just taking
down my Christmas tree,

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.424
so I'm all set.

00:44:09.424 --> 00:44:10.840
DAN STONE: Yeah,
I love that move.

00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:19.744
The movie has a lot of
guys in an alley with a gun

00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:21.910
slowly coming up on somebody,
and then somebody else

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.820
throws a knife at them.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.730
There's a lot of dark
scenes like that.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.530
DANIEL HANDLER:
This is interesting,

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.946
because I know someone else
who edits a literary magazine,

00:44:32.946 --> 00:44:34.530
and I asked him,
what do you look for?

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.674
And he says, the
element of surprise.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.600
If I'm reading a
short story, I want

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.850
as many surprises as possible.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.528
If I'm reading a piece, I want
as many surprises as possible.

00:44:42.528 --> 00:44:45.870
And I thought about that about
looking at all kinds of stuff.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.434
And this is a movie where
about eight times while you're

00:44:48.434 --> 00:44:50.600
watching the movie, you
think, as God as my witness,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.694
I have no idea what's
going to happen next.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:59.550
Which-- you can't
say that-- oh my God.

00:45:06.826 --> 00:45:07.325
Yeah.

00:45:10.524 --> 00:45:12.690
If you're somebody who
dances in the mirror at home,

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.148
this is a great movie to make
you feel good about yourself.

00:45:18.089 --> 00:45:19.755
DAN STONE: So what
do you love about it?

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.820
Is it your favorite movie?

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.730
DANIEL HANDLER: I mean, I have
other movies that I love a lot.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.063
There's the nefarious boyfriend.

00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.860
You should stop it.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.080
Otherwise, I'm just going
to be hypnotized by it.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.807
I like a ridiculous plot.

00:45:35.807 --> 00:45:38.140
I mean, that's what "A Series
of Unfortunate Events" is.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.610
I like things that
keep happening.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.760
I like a lot of surprises
in a story, myself.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.600
And my parents were
big opera fans,

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.120
and so we would go out to
free operas in the park

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.780
when I was growing
up, and my mother

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.577
would act out the plot of the
opera with Fisher Price toys

00:45:55.577 --> 00:45:57.660
before we went so I would
know what was happening.

00:45:59.037 --> 00:46:00.870
And so I say this to
my mother all the time.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.900
I call it and say to
her-- because she acts out

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.780
the end of Carmen
where she says,

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.280
you said you'd be my girlfriend!

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:06.780
Pow!

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.650
Which is basically
the end of Carmen.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.500
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.880
DANIEL HANDLER: And
so I like a story

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.370
in which a lot is happening.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.210
And I like the point at
which melodrama becomes

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:20.510
moving, which I think happens
with this movie is that there's

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.300
some real loyalty, and
there's some real--

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.570
and I think that that's amazing,
when something ridiculous can

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.570
become something moving.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.570
And that's something that I try
to do with the Lemony Snicket

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:28.800
books.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.070
That's something I try
to do with all my work,

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.710
really, is have something
where something is really

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:33.350
happening all the
time, but still

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.140
try to find that
moving through line.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.600
Because to me, that's life.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.750
Life is ridiculous.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.806
Which doesn't mean that
it isn't incredibly

00:46:39.806 --> 00:46:40.680
moving and beautiful.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.956
DAN STONE: Convincing.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.445
DANIEL HANDLER:
This is powerful.

00:46:48.304 --> 00:46:48.970
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.990
Yeah, this is.

00:46:50.462 --> 00:46:52.170
DANIEL HANDLER: The
disreputable brother.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.378
I can't stop thinking about
the disreputable brother.

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:55.470
DAN STONE: I know, I know.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.011
But there's something
feminine to it,

00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:58.715
with the Campari
in there, you know?

00:46:58.715 --> 00:46:59.590
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah?

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:00.410
I guess so.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.326
DAN STONE: I mean, at
least to the look of it.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.392
But it reminded
me this character.

00:47:05.392 --> 00:47:06.725
DANIEL HANDLER: That's for sure.

00:47:06.725 --> 00:47:08.830
DAN STONE: The character
who was up there.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.407
Yeah.

00:47:09.407 --> 00:47:10.740
DANIEL HANDLER: What's her name?

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.239
Nina?

00:47:12.414 --> 00:47:13.080
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.432
She was a Cuban actress.

00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:15.015
Ninon Sevilla.

00:47:18.509 --> 00:47:20.550
DANIEL HANDLER: And the
whole movie's on YouTube,

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.310
so you can watch it.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:21.930
DAN STONE: Oh, I didn't know.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:22.290
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:22.820
DAN STONE: Oh good.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.720
Yeah, you can watch it.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.260
DANIEL HANDLER:
Because they were

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.290
trying to figure out if
there was permission.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:29.970
We still don't know if they can
show this part on the Google

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:33.512
Play movie of the event,
or however it works.

00:47:33.512 --> 00:47:35.220
The person who's
putting it together is--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.505

Could he just say

00:47:37.505 --> 00:47:39.510
what it is instead of
drunkenly saying the word

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.035
Google three times in a row?

00:47:42.297 --> 00:47:43.880
But there's a whole
permissions thing,

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.540
and the point was made that
the whole movie's on YouTube.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.372
How can we not show
a little bit of it?

00:47:48.372 --> 00:47:49.330
DAN STONE: Right, yeah.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.920
And that's fair use, right?

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.040
Gotta be.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.581
DANIEL HANDLER: I
think all the time.

00:47:53.581 --> 00:47:54.885
I think everything is fair use.

00:47:54.885 --> 00:47:55.551
DAN STONE: Yeah.

00:47:55.551 --> 00:47:57.570
They probably don't want
us to talk about it,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.260
but yeah. you can
watch it anyway.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:47:59.450
DANIEL HANDLER: Right.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:00.270
DAN STONE: I think we
have a little bit of time

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.780
for questions.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.050
DANIEL HANDLER: Sure.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.952
DAN STONE: You can ask about the
film, ask about Daniel's books,

00:48:02.952 --> 00:48:03.310
whatever you want.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.560
DANIEL HANDLER: I wonder
what the question would be.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.360
I'm so fascinated.

00:48:06.352 --> 00:48:08.810
AUDIENCE: I wanted to pick up
on your point about surprise,

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:10.935
because I feel like there's
this tension in fiction

00:48:10.935 --> 00:48:14.952
between a surprise that's sort
of like a cheaper plot point,

00:48:14.952 --> 00:48:16.910
and something that is
surprising to the reader,

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.680
but actually ultimately makes
sense with the character.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.560
So it's not like
jumping the shark,

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.185
but it's actually something that
sort of advances the character

00:48:24.185 --> 00:48:24.685
arc.

00:48:24.685 --> 00:48:27.430
So I was wondering if you
could speak to that tension.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.996
DANIEL HANDLER: Well,
Hitchcock has a thing about it

00:48:28.996 --> 00:48:30.412
that I always like,
where he says,

00:48:30.412 --> 00:48:32.750
if you have a bomb
go off in the movie,

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.880
people are scared
for 30 seconds.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.050
If there's a bomb
ticking, they're

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:39.223
scared for the whole movie.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.840
Which, once you know
that about Hitchcock,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.340
and you watch a
Hitchcock movie, you

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.940
see that it's always
ticking for him.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.290
And I think that you
want to shape a story so

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.860
that every surprise makes sense.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.730
And there's some great
surprises in the movie

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.480
here, which I won't give away.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.220
But you think, what?

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.610
And then you're like, oh my God!

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.660
It makes the movie
so much better!

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.620
And that's an adventure.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.360
And I think, yeah,
it's the difference

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.420
between a cheap surprise and
a kind [INAUDIBLE] surprise.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.850
And so, Raymond Chandler
always said, when in doubt,

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.670
have a guy come in
the door with a gun.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.450
DAN STONE: Right.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.660
DANIEL HANDLER: And when
you read his lesser work,

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.975
it totally works that way.

00:49:25.975 --> 00:49:28.600
You read for like 20 pages, and
you're like, I'm kind of bored.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.260
And then, dun dun dun!

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.380
And it doesn't really
make any sense.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.070
In fact, sometimes that'll
be the end of a chapter,

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.361
and the next chapter, he'll
be like, put that gun away.

00:49:38.361 --> 00:49:40.205
And the guy's like,
oh, sorry, because it

00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:41.670
didn't make any sense.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:46.340
And in his best work,
when he was drinking less,

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.600
all the surprises get thicker
and thicker and thicker,

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.872
which is what happens
with "The Long Goodbye."

00:49:51.872 --> 00:49:53.330
DAN STONE: Which
is not necessarily

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:54.850
what happens with
this film, though.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.000
There are a few
surprises in there

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.530
that are so outlandish that
when they happen, you're like,

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.155
I kind of love that
they just did that,

00:50:00.155 --> 00:50:03.169
because that couldn't
be more ridiculous.

00:50:03.169 --> 00:50:04.710
And I don't think
we should say them,

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.390
because people should
watch this film, but--

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.181
DANIEL HANDLER: No.

00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:10.670
But I mean, sometime we'll drink
and watch the movie together.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.520
DAN STONE: Oh yeah,
let's do that.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.410
DANIEL HANDLER: But I think
that when things are the most

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.440
outsized is when you
can look at them better.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.050
It's kind of like
an exploded view,

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:25.360
like what they do with LEGOs
or with Ikea furniture, where

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.520
they have the exploded view,
which just automatically

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.100
is gorgeous.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.516
Because you think, that isn't
really how it would explode.

00:50:31.516 --> 00:50:33.720
It wouldn't explode
neatly for me to see.

00:50:34.925 --> 00:50:36.800
And that's when you're
able to figure it out.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.160
And I often think that
outsized melodramatic stories

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.040
are that way.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.200
If you really want to think
about how your loyalty is

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.430
if you're in love, or
you've been betrayed,

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:50.260
or you're marrying into a family
who's doing things that are not

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.690
the things you
would do, these are

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.110
questions that are
asked by this movie.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.440
But they're asked ridiculously.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.440
They're not asked
like an indie movie

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.660
with Susan Sarandon
as a depressed mother.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.680
They're in this context of
a terrible dance number.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.610
And to me, that's interesting,
when the story gets large.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.240
It's so ridiculous
that you actually

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.989
begin to find this emotional
center to it, for me.

00:51:11.989 --> 00:51:13.530
DAN STONE: We have
time for one more.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:14.160
Let's see.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.660
Oh, yeah.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.250
One more question.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:15.540
One last.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.810
DANIEL HANDLER: Oh, I thought
you meant one more drink.

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.143
I'm like, I gotta actually stop.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.590
Yes ma'am.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.902
Take the mic.

00:51:21.902 --> 00:51:23.010
Ask question, drop mic.

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:25.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.290
So thank you so much
for coming today.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:28.330
DANIEL HANDLER:
Thanks for coming out.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.930
AUDIENCE: I grew up with your
"Series of Unfortunate Events"

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.430
books.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.466
I'm sure many of
you did here today.

00:51:33.466 --> 00:51:35.340
And I was just wondering--
when writing them,

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.370
they're obviously somewhat dark.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.090
And I think they
actually probably

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.635
shaped my worldview, in a sense.

00:51:40.635 --> 00:51:41.720
And so I'm curious as to--

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.700
DANIEL HANDLER: And
you ended up at Google.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.540
Interesting.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.206
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.160
Very interesting.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.576
DANIEL HANDLER:
You got interested

00:51:48.576 --> 00:51:51.760
in a shadowy conspiracy,
and here you are.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.050
AUDIENCE: Here I am.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.130
So I was just wondering, when
you're writing for children,

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.296
so you knew what
your audience was,

00:51:58.296 --> 00:51:59.670
did you ever think
about what you

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.336
wanted them to take
away from the books?

00:52:01.336 --> 00:52:04.800
Or did you have any
ulterior motive or anything

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.440
in writing them,
that you were trying

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.900
to send a certain
message to children?

00:52:13.054 --> 00:52:14.565
Did you ever think about it?

00:52:14.565 --> 00:52:15.940
DANIEL HANDLER:
I don't think so.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.315
I mean, sometimes I was kind
of forced to think about it.

00:52:18.315 --> 00:52:23.110
But I think a greatly crafted
story has a great message,

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:27.190
and that anything that's well
made is wonderful in the way

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:31.632
that going and viewing someone
who does something well

00:52:31.632 --> 00:52:32.590
is always an education.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:33.920
You know?

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.970
That if you all took
a day off from Google

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:39.140
and went to watch
the best guy making

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.690
stained glass in
the world, you would

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.640
learn something from that,
even though, probably,

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.820
you're not engaged in the
making of stained glass a lot

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:45.445
here at Google.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.020
And I think that
in the same way,

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.310
a story that's well
crafted that makes sense

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.300
can bring a lesson home.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.870
But I didn't think
to myself, what's

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.990
a great thing to
teach 10-year-olds?

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.650
Because there's a lot of
books for 10-year-olds

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.110
that you can read that you can
tell start with that, you know?

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.410
That's like, I just want
to teach about diversity,

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.970
but I don't have an idea.

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:10.172
But diversity's great!

00:53:10.172 --> 00:53:11.380
And those books are terrible.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.046
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:12.046 --> 00:53:13.027
And yours weren't.

00:53:13.027 --> 00:53:14.110
DANIEL HANDLER: Thank you.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:14.800
AUDIENCE: Subtle.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.370
DANIEL HANDLER: Well, I don't
know if I was subtle as much as

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:19.364
that I was not interested--
I didn't think to myself,

00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:20.780
what a wonderful
platform you have

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.300
to teach third
graders or something.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.825
I thought, wouldn't it be funny
if a family was thrown down

00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:26.050
an elevator shaft?

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:28.451
And then I went from there.

00:53:28.451 --> 00:53:31.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:33.861
AUDIENCE: Well, on that
note, thank you [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:33.861 --> 00:53:34.330
DANIEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.010
Bye, everybody.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.280
Thanks for coming.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.940
DAN STONE: So everybody,
thank you for being here.

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.480
And let's thank Daniel Handler.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.896
DANIEL HANDLER: Thanks to Dan
Stone for making the drinks.

00:53:39.896 --> 00:53:43.230
[APPLAUSE]
