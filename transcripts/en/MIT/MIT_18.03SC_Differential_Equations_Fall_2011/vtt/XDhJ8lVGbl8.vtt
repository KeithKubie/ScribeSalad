00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.860
OK, let's get started. Now... I'm assuming that,
A, you went recitation yesterday,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.660
B, that even if you didn't, you know how to separate
variables, and you know how to construct simple

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.310
models, solve physical problems with differential
equations, and possibly even solve them.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:39.140
So, you should have learned that either in high
school, or 18.01 here, or... yeah.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.380
So, I'm going to start from that point, assume you know
that. I'm not going to tell you what differential

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.609
equations are, or what modeling is. If you
still are uncertain about those things, the

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:57.360
book has a very long and good explanation
of it. Just read that stuff. So, 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.360
we are talking about first order ODEs.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.860
ODE: I'll only use three ... two acronyms. ODE is ordinary
differential equations. I think all of MIT

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.520
knows that, whether they've been taking the
course or not. So, we are talking about first-order ODEs.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.320
which in standard form, are written,
you isolate the derivative of y with respect

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.830
to, x, let's say, on the left-hand side, and
on the right-hand side you write everything

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.070
else. You can't always do this very well,
but for today, I'm going to assume that it

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.320
has been done and it's doable. So, for example,
some of the ones that will be considered either

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.320
today or in the problem set are things like

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.700
oh... y' = x / y

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.390
That's pretty simple. The problem set has
y' = ...let's see...

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.680
x - y^2.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.240
 And, it also has y' = y - x^2.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.030
There are others, too. Now, when you look
at this, this, of course, you can solve by

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.000
separating variables. So, this is solvable.
This one is-- and neither of these can you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
separate variables. And they look extremely
similar. But they are extremely dissimilar.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.840
The most dissimilar about them is that this
one is easily solvable. And you will learn,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.060
if you don't know already, next time next
Friday how to solve this one

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.390
This one, which looks almost the same, is
unsolvable in a certain sense. Namely, there

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.590
are no elementary functions which you can
write down, which will give a solution of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.790
that differential equation. So, right away,
one confronts the most significant fact that

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.959
even for the simplest possible differential
equations, those which only involve the first

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.870
derivative, it's possible to write down extremely
looking simple guys.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:41.910
I'll put this one up in blue to indicate that
it's bad. Whoops, sorry, I mean, not really

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.510
bad, but recalcitrant. It's not solvable in
the ordinary sense in which you think of an

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.209
equation is solvable. And, since those equations
are the rule rather than the exception, I'm

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.080
going about this first day to not solving
a single differential equation, but indicating

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.450
to you what you do when you meet a blue equation
like that.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.989
What do you do with it? So, this first day
is going to be devoted to geometric ways of

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.549
looking at differential equations and numerical.
At the very end, I'll talk a little bit about

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.060
numerical ways. And you'll work on both of
those for the first problem set. So,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.240
what's our geometric view of differential equations?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.860
Well, it's something that's contrasted with

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.900
the usual procedures, by which you solve things
and find elementary functions which solve

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.680
them. I'll call that the analytic method.
So, on the one hand, we have the analytic

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.820
ideas, in which you write down explicitly
the equation, y' = f(x,y).

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.229
And, you look for certain functions, which
are called its solutions. Now, so there's

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.289
the ODE. And, y1 of x, notice I don't use
a separate letter. I don't use g or h or something

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.340
like that for the solution because the letters
multiply so quickly, that is, multiply in

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.470
the sense of rabbits, that after a while,
if you keep using different letters for each

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.630
new idea, you can't figure out what you're
talking about.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:38.229
So, I'll use y1 means, it's a solution of
this differential equation. Of course, the

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.949
differential equation has many solutions containing
an arbitrary constant. So, we'll call this

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:50.933
the solution. Now, the geometric view,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.400
the geometric guy that corresponds to this version

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.600
of writing the equation, is something called
a direction field.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.540
And, the solution is, from

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.540
the geometric point of view, something called
an integral curve.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.580
So, let me explain if you

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.250
don't know what the direction field is. I
know for some of you, I'm reviewing what you

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.560
learned in high school. Those of you who had
the BC syllabus in high school should know

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.540
these things. But, it never hurts to get a
little more practice. And, in any event, I

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:40.220
think the computer stuff that you will be
doing on the problem set, a certain amount

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.699
of it should be novel to you.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:48.560
It was novel to me, so why not to you? So,
what's a direction field? Well, the direction

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.840
field is, you take the plane, and in each
point of the plane-- of course, that's an

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.410
impossibility. But, you pick some points of
the plane. You draw what's called a little

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.970
line element. So, there is a point. It's a
little line, and the only thing which distinguishes

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.560
it outside of its position in the plane, so
here's the point, (x,y), at which we are drawing

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:22.680
this line element, is its slope. And, what
is its slope? Its slope is to be f(x,y).

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.360
 And now, You fill up the plane with these things
until you're tired of putting then in. So,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.080
I'm going to get tired pretty quickly.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.699
So, I don't know, let's not make them all
go the same way. That sort of seems cheating.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:45.630
How about here? Here's a few randomly chosen
line elements that I put in, and I putted

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.210
the slopes at random since I didn't have any
particular differential equation in mind.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.430
Now, the integral curve, so those are the
line elements. The integral curve is a curve,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:05.420
which goes through the plane, and at every
point is tangent to the line element there.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.639
So, this is the integral curve. Hey, wait
a minute, I thought tangents were the line

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:17.250
element there didn't even touch it. Well,
I can't fill up the plane with line elements.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.259
Here, at this point, there was a line element,
which I didn't bother drawing in. And, it

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:28.710
was tangent to that. Same thing over here:
if I drew the line element here, I would find

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.289
that the curve had exactly the right slope
there.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:43.800
So, the point is the integral, what distinguishes
the integral curve is that everywhere it has

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.580
the direction, that's the way I'll indicate
that it's tangent, has the direction of the

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:59.980
field everywhere at all points on the curve,
of course, where it doesn't go. It doesn't

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:10.700
have any mission to fulfill. Now, I say that
this integral curve is the graph of the solution

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.540
to the differential equation. In other words,
writing down analytically the differential

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:23.000
equation is the same geometrically as drawing
this direction field, and solving analytically

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.320
for a solution of the differential equation
is the same thing as geometrically drawing

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.000
an integral curve. So, what am I saying?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I say that an integral curve,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.380
all right, let me write it this way. I'll make a little theorem

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:51.740
out of it, that y1(x) is a solution to the
differential equation 

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.380
if, and only if,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:11.660
the graph, the curve associated with this, the
graph of y1 of x is an integral curve.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.300
Integral curve of what? Well, of the direction field
associated with that equation. But there isn't

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.550
quite enough room to write that on the board.
But, you could put it in your notes, if you

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:30.500
take notes. So, this is the relation between
the two, the integral curves of the graphs

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.430
or solutions.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:37.690
Now, why is that so? Well, in fact, all I
have to do to prove this, if you can call

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:44.820
it a proof at all, is simply to translate
what each side really means. What does it

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.180
really mean to say that a given function is
a solution to the differential equation? Well,

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.940
it means that if you plug it into the differential
equation, it satisfies it. Okay, what is that?

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.880
So, how do I plug it into the differential
equation and check that it satisfies it?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:08.380
Well, doing it in the abstract, I first calculate
its derivative. And then, how will it look

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.170
after I plugged it into the differential equation?
Well, I don't do anything to the x, but wherever

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:19.160
I see y, I plug in this particular function.
So, in notation, that would be written this

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:26.160
way. So, for this to be a solution means this,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.460
that that equation is satisfied. Okay, what

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:39.640
does it mean for the graph to be an integral
curve? Well, it means that at each point,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:50.320
the slope of this curve, it means that the
slope of y1 of x should be, at each point,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:12:04.580
(x1,y1). It should be equal to the slope of
the direction field at that point.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:10.100
And then, what is the slope of the direction
field at that point? Well, it is f of that

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:22.510
particular, well, at the point, (x,y1). If
you like, you can put a subscript, one, on

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.019
there, send a one here or a zero there, to
indicate that you mean a particular point.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:33.060
But, it looks better if you don't. But, there's
some possibility of confusion. I admit to

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.730
that. So, the slope of the direction field,
what is that slope? Well, by the way, I calculated

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:44.350
the direction field. Its slope at the point
was to be x, whatever the value of x was,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:52.520
and whatever the value of y1(x) was, substituted
into the right-hand side of the equation.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.680
So, what the slope of this function of that
curve of the graph should be equal to the

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.490
slope of the direction field. Now, what does
this say?

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:08.490
Well, what's the slope of y1(x)? That's y1'(x).
That's from the first day of 18.01, calculus.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.920
What's the slope of the direction field? This?
Well, it's this. And, that's with the right

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:21.230
hand side. So, saying these two guys are the
same or equal, is exactly, analytically, the

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:27.390
same as saying these two guys are equal. So,
in other words, the proof consists of, what

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.260
does this really mean? What does this really
mean? And after you see what both really mean,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.200
you say, yeah, they're the same.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:50.440
So, I don't how to write that. It's okay:
same, same, how's that? This is the same as that.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.019
Okay, well, this leaves us the interesting
question of how do you draw a direction from

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:05.259
the, well, this being 2003, mostly computers
draw them for you. Nonetheless, you do have

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.560
to know a certain amount. I've given you a
couple of exercises where you have to draw

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.700
the direction field yourself. This is so you
get a feeling for it, and also because humans

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:22.700
don't draw direction fields the same way computers
do. So, let's first of all, how did computers

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:30.480
do it? They are very stupid. There's no problem.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:38.610
Since they go very fast and have unlimited
amounts of energy to waste, the computer method

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:49.790
is the naive one. You pick the point. You
pick a point, and generally, they are usually

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.680
equally spaced. You determine some spacing,
that one: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:11.680
blah, equally spaced. And, at each point,
it computes f(x, y) at the point, finds, meets,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.040
and computes the value of f of (x, y), that
function, and the next thing is, on the screen,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:30.920
it draws, at (x, y), the little line element
having slope f(x, y). In other words, it does

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.550
what the differential equation tells it to
do.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.910
And the only thing that it does is you can,
if you are telling the thing to draw the direction

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:46.209
field, about the only option you have is telling
what the spacing should be, and sometimes

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:50.019
people don't like to see a whole line. They
only like to see a little bit of a half line.

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:54.500
And, you can sometimes tell, according to
the program, tell the computer how long you

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.850
want that line to be, if you want it teeny
or a little bigger. Once in awhile you want

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.600
you want it narrower on it, but not right
now.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:10.340
Okay, that's what a computer does. What does
a human do? This is what it means to be human.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:17.610
You use your intelligence. From a human point
of view, this stuff has been done in the wrong

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.430
order. And the reason it's been done in the
wrong order: because for each new point, it

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:28.699
requires a recalculation of f(x, y). That
is horrible. The computer doesn't mind, but

00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:36.039
a human does. So, for a human, the way to
do it is not to begin by picking the point,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.889
but to begin by picking the slope that you
would like to see. So, you begin by taking

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:49.800
the slope. Let's call it the value of the
slope, C. So, you pick a number. C is two.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:56.440
I want to see where are all the points in
the plane where the slope of that line element

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.470
would be two? Well, they will satisfy an equation.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:12.949
The equation is f(x,y) = C, in general. So,
what you do is plot this, plot the equation,

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:18.379
plot this equation. Notice, it's not the differential
equation. You can't exactly plot a differential

00:17:18.379 --> 00:17:25.759
equation. It's a curve, an ordinary curve.
But which curve will depend; it's, in fact,

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:35.759
from the 18.02 point of view, the level curve
of C, sorry, it's a level curve of f of (x,

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:39.779
y), the function f of x and y corresponding
to the level of value C

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:44.539
But we are not going to call it that because
this is not 18.02. Instead, we're going to

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:59.479
call it an isocline. And then, you plot, well,
you've done it. So, you've got this isocline,

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:07.419
except I'm going to use a solution curve,
solid lines, only for integral curves. When

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:12.979
we do plot isoclines, to indicate that they
are not solutions, we'll use dashed lines

00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:20.819
for doing them. One of the computer things
does and the other one doesn't. But they use

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.149
different colors, also. There are different
ways of telling you what's an isocline and

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:29.720
what's the solution curve. So, and what do
you do? So, these are all the points where

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.529
the slope is going to be C.

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:38.529
And now, what you do is draw in as many as
you want of line elements having slope C.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.840
Notice how efficient that is. If you want
50 million of them and have the time, draw

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.359
in 50 million. If two or three are enough,
draw in two or three. You will be looking

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:52.629
at the picture. You will see what the curve
looks like, and that will give you your judgment

00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:58.499
as to how you are to do that. So, in general,
a picture drawn that way, so let's say, an

00:18:58.499 --> 00:19:02.559
isocline corresponding to C equals zero.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:07.720
The line elements, and I think for an isocline,
for the purposes of this lecture, it would

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.359
be a good idea to put isoclines. Okay, so
I'm going to put solution curves in pink,

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:24.059
or whatever this color is, and isoclines are
going to be in orange, I guess. So, isocline,

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.649
represented by a dashed line, and now you
will put in the line elements of, we'll need

00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:33.710
lots of chalk for that. So, I'll use white
chalk.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.720
Y horizontal? Because according to this the
slope is supposed to be zero there. And at

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.899
the same way, how about an isocline where
the slope is negative one? Let's suppose here

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:49.419
C is equal to negative one. Okay, then it
will look like this. These are supposed to

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:56.579
be lines of slope negative one. Don't shoot
me if they are not. So, that's the principle.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.009
So, this is how you will fill up the plane
to draw a direction field: by plotting the

00:20:01.009 --> 00:20:04.190
isoclines first.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:09.359
And then, once you have the isoclines there,
you will have line elements. And you can draw

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:13.580
a direction field. Okay, so, for the next
few minutes, I'd like to work a couple of

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:19.260
examples for you to show how this works out
in practice.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.840
So, the first equation is going

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:43.840
to be y' = -x / y.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:55.920
Okay, first thing, what
are the isoclines? Well, the isoclines

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.400
the isoclines are going to be y.

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:15.720
Well, -x / y = C. Maybe I better make two
steps out of this. Minus x over y is equal

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:21.669
to C. But, of course, nobody draws a curve
in that form. You'll want it in the form y

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:36.379
= -1 / C * x. So, there's our isocline. Why
don't I put that up in orange since it's going

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:44.699
to be, that's the color I'll draw it in. In
other words, for different values of C, now

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.559
this thing is aligned. It's aligned, in fact,
through the origin. This looks pretty simple.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:57.719
Okay, so here's our plane. The isoclines are
going to be lines through the origin. And

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.679
now, let's put them in, suppose, for example,
C is equal to one.

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:11.679
Well, if C is equal to one, then it's the
line, y equals minus x. So, this is the isocline.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.680
I'll put, down here, C equals minus one. And,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.740
and along it, the

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.820
no, something's wrong.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.880
I'm sorry?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:52.139
C is one, not negative one, right, thanks.
Thanks. So, C equals one. So, it should be

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:57.349
little line segments of slope one will be
the line elements, things of slope one. OK,

00:22:57.349 --> 00:22:59.999
now how about C equals negative one?

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:07.619
If C equals negative one, then it's the line,
y = x. And so, that's the isocline. Notice,

00:23:07.629 --> 00:23:15.059
still dash because these are isoclines. Here,
C is negative one. And so, the slope elements

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:22.739
look like this. Notice, they are perpendicular.
Now, notice that they are always going to

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:32.279
be perpendicular to the line because the slope
of this line is minus one over C. But, the

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:39.319
slope of the line element is going to be C.
Those numbers, minus one over C and C, are

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.239
negative reciprocals. And, you know that two
lines whose slopes are negative reciprocals

00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:52.099
are perpendicular. So, the line elements are
going to be perpendicular to these. And therefore,

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:57.450
I hardly even have to bother calculating,
doing any more calculation. Here's going to

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.509
be a, well, how about this one?

00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:07.409
Here's a controversial isocline. Is that an
isocline? Well, wait a minute. That doesn't

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:17.009
correspond to anything looking like this.
Ah-ha, but it would if I put C multiplied

00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:23.429
through by C. And then, it would correspond
to C being zero. In other words, don't write

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:30.709
it like this. Multiply through by C. It will
read C y = - x. And then, when C is zero,

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.609
I have x equals zero, which is exactly the
y-axis.

00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:44.369
So, that really is included. How about the
x-axis? Well, the x-axis is not included.

00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:49.899
However, most people include it anyway. This
is very common to be a sort of sloppy and

00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:55.279
bending the edges of corners a little bit,
and hoping nobody will notice. We'll say that

00:24:55.279 --> 00:25:00.399
corresponds to C equals infinity. I hope nobody
wants to fight about that. If you do, go fight

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:06.159
with somebody else. So, if C is infinity,
that means the little line segment should

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:11.539
have infinite slope, and by common consent,
that means it should be vertical. And so,

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:18.759
we can even count this as sort of an isocline.
And, I'll make the dashes smaller, indicate

00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:28.559
it has a lower status than the others. And,
I'll put this in, do this weaselly thing of

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:33.729
putting it in quotation marks to indicate
that I'm not responsible for it.

00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:40.440
Okay, now, we now have to put it the integral
curves. Well, nothing could be easier. I'm

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:47.599
looking for curves which are everywhere perpendicular
to these rays. Well, you know from geometry

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.360
that those are circles. So, the integral curves
are circles.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.820
And, it's an elementary exercise,

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:13.369
which I would not deprive you of the pleasure
of. Solve the ODE by separation of variables.

00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:20.159
In other words, we've gotten the, so the circles
are ones with a center at the origin, of course,

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:27.399
equal some constant. I'll call it C1, so it's
not confused with this C. They look like that,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.160
and now you should solve this by separating
variables, and just confirm that the solutions

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:36.200
are, in fact, those circles.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:42.330
One interesting thing, and so I confirm this,
I won't do it because I want to do geometric

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:47.409
and numerical things today. So, if you solve
it by separating variables, one interesting

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:57.369
thing to note is that if I write the solution
as y = y1(x), well, it'll look something like

00:26:57.369 --> 00:27:04.229
the sqrt (C1 - x^2). We'll make the x squared
because that's the way people usually put the radius.

00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:06.249
Minus x squared.

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:13.519
And so, a solution, a typical solution looks
like this. Well, what's the solution over

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:22.079
here? Well, that one solution will be goes
from here to here. If you like, it has a negative

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:27.320
side to it. So, I'll make, let's say, plus.
There's another solution, which has a negative

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.589
value. But let's use the one with the positive
value of the square root. My point is this,

00:27:32.589 --> 00:27:40.589
that that solution, the domain of that solution,
really only goes from here to here. It's not

00:27:40.589 --> 00:27:45.869
the whole x-axis. It's just a limited piece
of the x-axis where that solution is defined.

00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:52.629
There's no way of extending it further. And,
there's no way of predicting, by looking at

00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:57.529
the differential equation, that a typical
solution was going to have a limited domain

00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:59.949
like that.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.259
In other words, you could find a solution,
but how far out is it going to go? Sometimes,

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:13.509
it's impossible to tell, except by either
finding it explicitly, or by asking a computer

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:17.409
to draw a picture of it, and seeing if that
gives you some insight. It's one of the many

00:28:17.409 --> 00:28:22.200
difficulties in handling differential equations.
You don't know what the domain of a solution

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.109
is going to be until you've actually calculated
it.

00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:48.599
Now, a slightly more complicated example is
going to be, let's see, y' = 1 + x - y. It's

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:55.089
not a lot more complicated, and as a computer
exercise, you will work with, still, more

00:28:55.089 --> 00:29:00.929
complicated ones. But here, the isoclines
would be what? Well, I set that equal to C.

00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:07.809
Can you do the algebra in your head? An isocline
will have the equation: this equals C. So,

00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:13.419
I'm going to put the y on the right hand side,
and that C on the left hand side. So, it will

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:25.859
have the equation y = 1 + x - C, or a nicer
way to write it would be y = x + 1 - C. I

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:30.440
guess it really doesn't matter.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.029
So there's the equation of the isocline. Let's
quickly draw the direction field. And notice,

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:41.059
by the way, it's a simple equation, but you
cannot separate variables. So, I will not,

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:48.059
today at any rate, be able to check the answer.
I will not be able to get an analytic answer.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:55.200
All we'll be able to do now is get a geometric
answer. But notice how quickly, relatively

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.489
quickly, one can get it. So, I'm feeling for
how the solutions behave to this equation.

00:30:01.489 --> 00:30:10.209
All right, let's see, what should we plot
first? I like C equals one, no, don't do C

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:19.400
equals one. Let's do C equals zero, first.
C equals zero. That's the line. y = x + 1.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.160
Okay, let me run and get that chalk.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.999
So, I'll isoclines are in orange. If so, when C equals

00:30:29.999 --> 00:30:36.179
zero, y equals x plus one. So, let's say it's
this curve.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.480
C equals zero.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.780
How about C equals

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:49.409
negative one? Then it's y = x + 2. It's this
curve.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.739
Well, let's label it down here.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:07.159
So, this is C equals negative one. C equals negative
two would be y equals x, no, what am I doing?

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:14.159
C equals negative one is y = x + 2. That's
right. Well, how about the other side?

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:22.340
If C equals plus one, well, then it's going to
go through the origin.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:32.420
It looks like a little more room down here. How about, so if this
is going to be C equals one, then I sort of

00:31:32.429 --> 00:31:38.649
get the idea. C equals two will look like
this. They're all going to be parallel lines

00:31:38.649 --> 00:31:45.320
because all that's changing is the y-intercept,
as I do this thing. So, here, it's C equals

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:54.360
two. That's probably enough. All right, let's
put it in the line elements. All right,

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:01.860
C equals negative one. These will be perpendicular.
C equals zero, like this.

00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:10.529
C equals one. Oh, this is interesting. I can't
even draw in the line elements because they

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:17.529
seem to coincide with the curve itself, with
the line itself. They write y along the line,

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:23.919
and that makes it hard to draw them in. How
about C equals two? Well, here, the line elements

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:30.359
will be slanty. They'll have slope two, so
a pretty slanty up. And, I can see if a C

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:34.899
equals three in the same way. There are going
to be even more slantier up. And here, they're

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:41.779
going to be even more slanty down. This is
not very scientific terminology or mathematical,

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:47.229
but you get the idea. Okay, so there's our
quick version of the direction field. All

00:32:47.229 --> 00:32:52.389
we have to do is put in some integral curves
now. Well, it looks like it's doing this.

00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:57.999
It gets less slanty here. It levels out, has
slope zero.

00:32:57.999 --> 00:33:02.469
And now, in this part of the plain, the slope
seems to be rising. So, it must do something

00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:09.519
like that. This guy must do something like
this. I'm a little doubtful of what I should

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:18.799
be doing here. Or, how about going from the
other side? Well, it rises, gets a little,

00:33:18.809 --> 00:33:26.069
should it cross this? What should I do? Well,
there's one integral curve, which is easy

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:33.139
to see. It's this one. This line is both an
isocline and an integral curve.

00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:44.199
It's everything, except drawable, [LAUGHTER]
so, you understand this is the same line.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.070
It's both orange and pink at the same time.
But I don't know what combination color that

00:33:49.070 --> 00:34:02.109
would make. It doesn't look like a line, but
be sympathetic. Now, the question is, what's

00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:11.020
happening in this corridor? In the corridor,
that's not a mathematical word either, between

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:16.519
the isoclines for, well, what are they? They
are the isoclines for C equals two, and C

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.500
equals zero.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.740
How does that corridor look?
Well: something like this. Over here, the

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.950
lines all look like that. And here, they all
look like this.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:46.760
The slope is two. And, a hapless solution
gets in there. What's it to do? Well, do you

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.169
see that if a solution gets in that corridor,
an integral curve gets in that corridor, no

00:34:52.169 --> 00:35:00.960
escape is possible. It's like a lobster trap.
The lobster can walk in. But it cannot walk

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:08.440
out because things are always going in. How
could it escape? Well, it would have to double

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:14.730
back, somehow, and remember, to escape, it
has to be, to escape on the left side, it

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.660
must be going horizontally.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:24.660
But, how could it do that without doubling
back first and having the wrong slope? The

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:30.220
slope of everything in this corridor is positive,
and to double back and escape, it would at

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:34.769
some point have to have negative slope. It
can't do that. Well, could it escape on the

00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:40.549
right-hand side? No, because at the moment
when it wants to cross, it will have to have

00:35:40.549 --> 00:35:49.059
a slope less than this line. But all these
spiky guys are pointing; it can't escape that

00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:55.200
way either. So, no escape is possible. It
has to continue on, there. But, more than

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.109
that is true. So, a solution can't escape.

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:11.420
Once it's in there, it can't escape. It's
like, what do they call those plants, I forget,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:17.480
pitcher plants. You know, all their hairs are
going down. So, it looks like that. And so,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:23.220
the poor little insect falls in. They could
climb up the walls except that all the hairs

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:28.859
are going the wrong direction, and it can't
get over them. Well, let's think of it that

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:34.039
way: this poor trap solution. So, it does
what it has to do. Now, there's more to it

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:41.039
than that. Because there are two principles
involved here that you should know, that help

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:50.220
a lot in drawing these pictures. Principle
number one is that two integral curves cannot

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:57.819
cross at an angle. Two integral curves can't
cross, I mean, by crossing at an angle like

00:36:57.819 --> 00:37:02.640
that. I'll indicate what I mean by a picture
like that.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:11.319
Now, why not? This is an important principle.
Let's put that up in the white box. They can't

00:37:11.319 --> 00:37:19.139
cross because if two integral curves, are
trying to cross, well, one will look like

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:25.849
this. It's an integral curve because it has
this slope. And, the other integral curve

00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:32.240
has this slope. And now, they fight with each
other. What is the true slope at that point?

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.220
Well, the direction field only allows you
to have one slope. If there's a line element

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.670
at that point, it has a definite slope. And
therefore, it cannot have both the slope and

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:51.720
that one. It's as simple as that. So, the
reason is you can't have two slopes. The direction

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:58.720
field doesn't allow it. Well, that's a big,
big help because if I know, here's an integral

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.440
curve, and if I know that none of these other
pink integral curves are allowed to cross

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.769
it, how else can I do it?

00:38:05.769 --> 00:38:11.740
Well, they can't escape. They can't cross.
It's sort of clear that they must get closer

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:19.079
and closer to it. You know, I'd have to work
a little to justify that. But I think that

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:25.069
nobody would have any doubt of it who did
a little experimentation. In other words,

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:34.169
all these curves joined that little tube and
get closer and closer to this line, y = x.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:42.990
And there, without solving the differential
equation, it's clear that all of these solutions,

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:51.619
how do they behave? As x goes to infinity,
they become asymptotic to, they become closer

00:38:51.619 --> 00:39:02.139
and closer to the solution, x. Is x a solution?
Yeah, because y equals x is an integral curve.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:08.410
Is x a solution? Yeah, because if I plug in
y equals x, I get what? On the right-hand

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:20.069
side, I get one. And on the left-hand side,
I get one. One equals one. So, this is a solution.

00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:29.629
Let's indicate that it's a solution. So, analytically,
we've discovered an analytic solution to the

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:37.799
differential equation, namely, Y equals X,
just by this geometric process. Now, there's

00:39:37.799 --> 00:39:47.759
one more principle like that, which is less
obvious. But you do have to know it. So, you

00:39:47.769 --> 00:39:54.609
are not allowed to cross. That's clear. But
it's much, much, much, much, much less obvious

00:39:54.609 --> 00:40:01.049
that two integral curves cannot touch. That
is, they cannot even be tangent. Two integral

00:40:01.049 --> 00:40:05.089
curves cannot be tangent.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:17.119
I'll indicate that by the word touch, which
is what a lot of people say. In other words,

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:22.519
if this is illegal, so is this.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.580
Can't have it.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.400
You know, without that for example, it might

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:42.710
be, I might feel that there would be nothing
in this to prevent those curves from joining.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:49.880
Why couldn't these pink curves join the line,
y equals x? You know, it's a solution. They

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:56.200
just pitch a ride, as it were. The answer
is they cannot do that because they have to

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:02.420
just get asymptotic to it, ever, ever closer.
They can't join y equals x because at the

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.390
point where they join, you have that situation.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:11.240
Now, why can't you to have this? That's much
more sophisticated than this, and the reason

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.620
is because of something called the Existence
and Uniqueness Theorem,

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.300
Existence and Uniqueness Theorem

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.660
which says

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.160
which says

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:39.040
which says that there is through a point, (x0, y0),

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:52.340
 that y prime equals y' = f(x, y) has only
one, and only one solution. One has one solution.

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:56.359
In mathematics speak, that means at least
one solution. It doesn't mean it has just

00:41:56.359 --> 00:42:02.799
one solution. That's mathematical convention.
It has one solution, at least one solution.

00:42:02.799 --> 00:42:07.240
But, the killer is, only one solution.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:13.009
That's what you have to say in mathematics
if you want just one, one, and only one solution

00:42:13.009 --> 00:42:24.349
through the point (x0, y0). So, the fact that
it has one, that is the existence part. The

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:30.880
fact that it has only one is the uniqueness
part of the theorem. Now, like all good mathematical

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:40.160
theorems, this one does have hypotheses. So,
this is not going to be a course, I warn you,

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:45.829
those of you who are theoretically inclined,
very rich in hypotheses. But, hypotheses for

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:54.349
those one or that f(x, y) should be a continuous
function. Now, like polynomial, signs, should

00:42:54.349 --> 00:43:01.349
be continuous near, in the vicinity of that
point.

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:08.480
That guarantees existence, and what guarantees
uniqueness is the hypothesis that you would

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:16.540
not guess by yourself. Neither would I. What
guarantees the uniqueness is that also, it's

00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:23.549
partial derivative with respect to y should
be continuous, 

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.200
should be continuous near (x0, y0).

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.200
Well,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:50.560
I have to make a decision. I don't
have time to talk about Euler's method. Let me

00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:55.859
refer you to the, there's one page of notes,
and I couldn't do any more than just repeat

00:43:55.859 --> 00:44:00.150
what's on those notes. So, I'll trust you
to read that.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:05.170
And instead, let me give you an example which
will solidify these things in your mind a

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:11.430
little bit. I think that's a better course.
The example is not in your notes, and therefore,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:18.430
remember, you heard it here first. Okay, so
what's the example? It's...

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840
So,

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.020
there's our differential equation.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:44.140
Now, let's just solve it by separating
variables. dy. Can you do it in your head? dy

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:51.300
over dx, put all the y's on the left. It will
look like dy / (1 - y). Put all the dx's on

00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:57.549
the left. So, the dx here goes on the right,
rather. That will be dx. And then, the x goes

00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:01.119
down into the denominator. So now, it looks
like that.

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:12.259
And, if I integrate both sides, I get the
log of one minus y, I guess, maybe with a,

00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:19.739
I never bothered with that, but you can. It
should be absolute values. All right, put

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:27.900
an absolute value, plus a constant. And now,
if I exponentiate both sides, the constant

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:37.520
is positive. So, this is going to look like
y. (1 - y) = x. And, the constant will be

00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:45.709
e^C1. And, I'll just make that a new constant,
Cx. And now, by letting C be negative, that's

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.950
why you can get rid of the absolute values,
if you allow C to have negative values as

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:56.619
well as positive values. Let's write this
in a more human form. So, y = 1 - Cx. Good,

00:45:56.619 --> 00:45:59.109
all right, let's just plot those. So, these
are the solutions.

00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:05.029
It's a pretty easy equation, pretty easy solution
method, just separation of variables. What

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:16.129
do they look like? Well, these are all lines
whose intercept is at one. And, they have

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:28.369
any slope whatsoever. So, these are the lines
that look like that. Okay, now let me ask,

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:35.079
existence and uniqueness. Existence: through
which points of the plane does the solution

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:42.059
go? Answer: through every point of the plane,
through any point here, I can find one and

00:46:42.059 --> 00:46:50.639
only one of those lines, except for these
stupid guys here on the stalk of the flower.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:59.410
Here, for each of these points, there is no
existence. There is no solution to this differential

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:07.579
equation, which goes through any of these
wiggly points on the y-axis, with one exception.

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:15.219
This point is oversupplied. At this point,
it's not existence that fails. It's uniqueness

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:25.140
that fails: no uniqueness. There are lots
of things which go through here. Now, is that

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.480
a violation of the existence and uniqueness
theorem? It cannot be a violation because

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:35.749
the theorem has no exceptions. Otherwise,
it wouldn't be a theorem. So, let's take a

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:40.690
look. What's wrong? We thought we solved it
modulo, putting the absolute value signs on

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:47.029
the log. What's wrong? The answer: what's
wrong is to use the theorem you must write

00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:53.269
the differential equation in standard form,
in the green form I gave you. Let's write

00:47:53.269 --> 00:48:01.740
the differential equation the way we were
supposed to. It says dy / dx = (1 - y) / x.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:09.900
And now, I see, the right-hand side is not
continuous, in fact, not even defined when

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:16.529
x equals zero, when along the y-axis. And
therefore, the existence and uniqueness is

00:48:16.529 --> 00:48:23.200
not guaranteed along the line, x equals zero
of the y-axis. And, in fact, we see that it

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:30.579
failed. Now, as a practical matter, it's the
way existence and uniqueness fails in all

00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:35.490
ordinary life work with differential equations
is not through sophisticated examples that

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.549
mathematicians can construct.

00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:42.769
But normally, because f(x, y) will fail to
be defined somewhere, and those will be the

00:48:42.769 --> 00:48:45.799
bad points. Thanks.
