00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.450
&gt;&gt; It's my honor and pleasure
today to introduce our next author,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.130
one of the world's best known

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.740
and most successful writers who's
earned a tremendous reputation

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.450
for his writing especially
in the area of crime novels.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.400
But before I do that,
we need to attend

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.020
to a few housekeeping details.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.440
First, we want to thank the
cochairman of the festival,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200
David Rubenstein and the many
National Book Festival sponsors

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.550
who have made this year's
event possible and those

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.430
who supported us for
the last 17 years.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.490
You too can support the
National Book Festival

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.790
with the gift of a donation.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.370
We welcome your help in making
the festival possible next year

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.910
and every year, and it would not
be possible to have this even event

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.540
without sponsors like you.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.420
A question and answer period
will follow the presentation,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.140
so save your questions for then
and also be aware that anyone

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.190
who does ask a question will be
recorded for what will become part

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.470
of the library's collection.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.010
So, please silence your mobile
phones and now for our closer.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.770
David Baldacci is the bestselling
author of more than 30 novels

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.000
which are print to the tune of over
a 110 million copies worldwide.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.910
Several of his books
have been turned

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.950 position:56%
into motion pictures and television.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.660
David is a good friend of
the Library of Congress

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.210
and has played a role in
previous National Book Festivals.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.530
And this year, he's playing
in a festival doubleheader.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.030
Earlier today at the Teen Stage
he talked about his latest book

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.730
for young adults which entitled,
"The Width of the World."

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.900
And now we welcome back here
to the Main Stage to talk

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.640
about another of his new books.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.740
Needless to say, David's
work is well-represented

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.120
in the library's collection.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.250
Checking our online catalog this
morning, I saw that 81 examples

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.590
of his works are represented;
included all of his printed works,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.410
but also related audiobooks
and one major motion picture.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.650 position:56%
Neatly enough, his books in our
collection run from A to Z. That is,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.640
from "Absolute Power" to "Zero
Day" with all the rest in between,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.380
including his latest book
"The Fix", which features one

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.420
of his most unique protagonists
FBI Agent, Amos Decker,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.620
the man who is unable
to forget anything.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.120
As is well-known by David's
fans who live and work in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.930 position:56%
and around the District of
Columbia, one of the great pleasures

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.560
of his books is the direct way
he works the local landscape

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.610
and institutions into his stories.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.420 position:56%
For example, his newest book started
out just a short distance from here

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.880
in front of the FBI Building.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.820
And another example, which is
even closer to home for me,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.620
is the use of the Library of
Congress as a main setting

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.500
for his 2009 novel,
"The Collectors."

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.070
What's more, one of the
books victims is the chief

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.520
of our rare book and special
collections [inaudible].

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.600
So, by the way, in real
life he's a great guy

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.330
and a special colleague of mine.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.320
I just have one more point
before calling David up here.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.060
While I'm certainly no infallible
memory man like Amos Decker,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.920
I always remember the tremendous
efficacy for literacy that David

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.060
and his wife Michelle have
provided through the establishment

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.920
of their nonprofit Wish
You Well Foundation.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.700
The foundation supports adult and
family literacy across the country

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.610
by fostering and promoting literacy
and other educational programs.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.370
So, please join me in welcoming
David Baldacci, a great writer,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
a good friend of the library,
and a great humanitarian.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:12.460
[ Applause ]

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.890
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: I was marveled
by how many people were here.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.090 position:56%
If it would have been me, I would
have already left, 6:30 on Saturday,

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.260
where is the why, you know so.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.560
I appreciate you for hanging
around for the closing act.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.860
It's great.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.380
I spoke earlier on the Teen Stage

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.340
and seeing all these young
readers here is just, oh my gosh,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.150
it's so energizing for me.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.340
It's such great news
and I just loved it.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.640
It's great to be back.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.650
I think this is probably
my 6th or 7th visit

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.700
to the National Book Festival.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.670
I think at some point I told
them to stop inviting me,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.520
but I'm kind of the local guy right
across the river in Virginia, so.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.520 position:56%
Whenever I go to places that have
festivals, I always make this remark

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.510
which I think is a good one,
"Never take them for granted."

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.340
Because once you start
taking great things like this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.560
for granted, they tend to go away.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.440 position:56%
You know? So, always come, encourage
your friends and family to come.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.070
Bring new people in.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.370
They'll have a great time.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.240
I signed for about an hour
today and everybody who came

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.540
through had a smile on their face.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.880
They were just happy about
being here surrounded by people

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.250
who are book lovers as well,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.040
so always support the
National Book Festival.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.700
It's a great thing.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.070
You know, the bestseller's life
when I'm out on tour I get a lot

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.370
of questions from people "What is

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.720
like to be you know this
worldwide bestselling novelist?"

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.170
And I know the way they ask
question they want me to give like,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.210
you know, a Kardashian answer.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.290
My life is not like the
Kardashians trust me.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.430
Even when I go to a cool event and
I come home and tell my mother,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.150
my wife about it, and she
stops me halfway through

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.450
and she goes "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.750
You know, it's trash night.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.740
Get on it."

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.040
People always ask, you know,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.450
"all of your books you always
have strong independent women.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.750
Why is that?"

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.050
I said, "I sleep with one."

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.040
So, an answer to that
question "What is

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.870 position:56%
like to be a bestselling
novelist", I tell the people a story

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.170 position:56%
about my kids when they were little.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.800 position:56%
My kids are grown now, but when they
were little like I took my daughter,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.160
she was around 5 or 6 to a book
signing that I was going to do

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.260
for the first time; took her with
me at this great little bookstore.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.380
We walked in, the lady who owned
it came over and greeted us

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.820
and asked my daughter, you know,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.350
"Do you know why all
these people are here?"

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.960
And my daughter said,
"Yes, yes I do know."

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.270
"Why are they here?"

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.540
"They want my dad to
sign their book."

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.940
"And why do they want your
dad to sign their book?"

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.330
"Because my dad has the
nicest handwriting."

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.420
[Brief laughter].

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.070
My son is my little entrepreneur,
you know, he's in his 20s now,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.110
but when he was like 3,I
took him to a bookstore just

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.830
to go buy some books and he
walked into the bookstore

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.080
and he saw all the people reading
all the books on the shelf,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.410
his eyes got huge and all of
a sudden he started running

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.550
across the bookstore screaming
at the top of his lungs,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.510
"My daddy will sign any book
you've got for 2 dollars."

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.050
[ Laughter ]

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.690
So, that's what it's like to
be a bestselling novelist.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.670
You'll be pleased to know, because
I love the National Book Festival,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.830
in my earlier signing I
waived my 2 dollar fee

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.160 position:56%
and I signed all the books for free.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.690
Amos Decker, it's interesting
when I decided to create a series

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.100
around him, I thought okay,
I want to do a new series.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.750
I wonder what kind of a
character I should create?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.510
Okay, I'll create a guy
who has no social skills,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.820
rubs everybody the wrong way.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.080
He's sort of like this
obese, big you know,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.440
flabby guy who can't
get along with anyone.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.820
He'll be very popular I'm sure
and he has been incredibly popular

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.000
and I think it's because he's
unlike any character I've ever

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.300
created before.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.140
And I've been interested in
the brain for a longtime,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.940
obviously it's what makes us us.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.190
And when something happens to the
brain, you know, you read a lot

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.250
about football these days with
TBIs and CTE and all that.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.810
The brain is a unique, you know,
ability to sort of heal itself

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.080
in some ways, so if one part of
it is damaged it rewires itself;

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.270
rewires itself around the damaged
part and tries to keep going

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.610
as much as it possibly can.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.200
So, I thought I'm going to
create a character who has,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.480
is going to have a TBI and
he's going to come out of it

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.390 position:56%
with perfect recall, perfect memory,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.290
hyperthymesia which
is a real condition.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.500
You're either born with it or
you can get it through a TBI.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.820
And let's see how that
goes with him.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.150
And when most people, when
I went on a book tour with

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.920
"Memory Man" the first time, I
asked people "Raise your hand

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.220 position:56%
if you think it would be really cool

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.730
to never be able to
forget anything."

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.300
A lot of people raised their hand.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.600
Okay, "Raise your hand
if you have something

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.940
in your life you'd rather forget."

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.240
Everybody raised their hand,
and those who didn't were lying

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.740
to themselves by the way.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.350
So that's the albatross
around Amos's neck.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.650
That's what makes him human.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.210
That's what makes us sort of root
and care for him, because we know

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.100 position:56%
that he's in the same body, but he's
not the same person he used to be.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.770 position:56%
Can you imagine that, that you were;

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.110
you're a totally different
person now

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.550
because something happened here
changed your personality instead

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.040
of being outgoing and you
know friendly and gregarious,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.730
and you can't relate to people?

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.640
You can't understand
the social cues anymore,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.490
you're on a different spectrum
even though you're in the same body

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.610
and you know you're never going
to be who that person used to be.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.570
So, I thought that would be
a unique way to sort of try

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.020
to present this character.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.070
It allowed me over many
books, to sort of deepen

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.100
and enrich and change who he is.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.580
So, book to book, day-to-day his
brain may rewire itself again.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.310
You never know and he might
become something else.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.140
So, when I write I try to write
about things that interest me.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.410
The old adage is write
what you know.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.160
I would modify that and say, write
what you would like to know about

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.230
and then go and find out
about stuff and feel if;

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.690
find out if your passion
about something

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.220 position:56%
that will keep the fires burning for
whatever length of time it takes you

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.600
to write what you want to write.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.760
You know, what you don't want to
do is halfway through a book run

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.790
out of gas because you
figured out, oh you know,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.090
I'm not really interested in this.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.690
I was trying to write the
other, the next Jurassic Park.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.130
You know? When Jurassic Park first
came out, I can guarantee you

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.930
that every book proposal and every
screenplay proposal, you know,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.240
had something to do with Jurassic
Park even it was a romantic comedy,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.410
you were going to have
a T-rex in it.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.710
You know, they're going
to be kissing,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.720
it's going to be very romantic
and the T-rex is going to come in

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.700
and kill one of them, you know?

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.920
Or when the Da Vinci Code
came out everybody was trying

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.150
to write the next code book,
because what are they doing?

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.500
They were chasing a trend and most
of them didn't finish the book

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.500
because they weren't really
interested in dinosaurs or code.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.400
They just thought, oh this
is the next hot trend.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.390
What you need to find is
something you really care about

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.000
and guess what the passion
all of a sudden will start

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.440
to infect the sentences
and the paragraphs

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.440
and the chapters and
the storytelling.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.740
It will come through.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.660
I will make it all better
and all stronger and all

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.560
of a sudden what you're
writing it sort of gets lifted

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.540
out of the sludge piles, it sits
on an editor's desk in New York.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.040
The book I just finished
and it will be

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.810
out in November, it's
called "End Game."

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.930 position:56%
It's Will Robie and Jessica Reel my
two assassins back and it takes them

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.640 position:56%
to an interesting place, the United
States that will be out in November.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.640 position:56%
They're filming "The Christmas
Train" movie right now in Vancouver.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.390
So they're going to replicate
Christmas in Canada in August.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.450
They've got the snowmaking
machines fired up and ready to go.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.580
It's interesting, I
read a story recently

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.120 position:56%
that said the Hallmark ratings, this
is a Hallmark movie so it will be

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.020
on Thanksgiving weekend, Hallmark
ratings are through the roof

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.490
like tripled what they were ever
since January [brief laughter].

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:45.630
Pregnant pause there and;
and the article talked

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.180
about people are watching
Hallmark because they just want

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.420
to feel good again and happy and
all that, so it's a good time

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.220
if you're Hallmark and Hallmark
is very happy about that too.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.810
So, it will be; they've been
sending me the dailies every day.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.690
It used to be when you shot on
film you'd have to wait a longtime

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.580
to get dailies, so now it's all
video and they just email it to me

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.340
and I get to watch what's going on.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.600
They got a great cast and it
looks like it will be pretty good.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.320
The John Puller, I just
signed a deal with Sony TV

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.170
to option John Puller
for a television series

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.090
for Network Television, so
they're working on that too.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.950
When I was 7 or 8 years
old, I was one of those kids

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.990
that never shut up,
you know, I just,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.720
and I just couldn't stop talking.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.390
I would either be arguing with
people or making up tall tales

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.110
to get myself out of trouble with
parents, assorted school officials,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.330
people like that, truancy officers.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.070
And when I was around 8,
my mom bought me a journal,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.530
a blank page journal and gave it
to me and said, "You know son,

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.440
some of these stories you've been
writing are or talking about,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.910 position:56%
why don't you try writing them down?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.670
Why don't you try to do that?"

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.970
So, I said, "Okay."

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.270
I love to read.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.040
I'm a writer today because
I was a reader as a kid.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.610
I love books.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.440
So, my pen hit the paper
and all of a sudden it was

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.220
like oh my god this a epiphany.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.920
I can create a story on paper
that other people could read.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.350
I can do for other people what
writers I love have done for me.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.550
You know? They can enthrall me.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.420
Allow me to lost in a world, they
created a world that didn't exist

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.720
until they thought of it.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.110
How powerful is that?

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.000
So, I put pen to paper and
never really looked back.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.930
I just started to write
and haven't stopped since.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.450
And I went back to my mom
later and I said, "My god mom.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.750
Thank you so much.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.110
What a gift you gave me."

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.170
And she said, "Honey I'm so
glad it's worked out for you,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:42.050
but quite frankly I just wanted
to shut you the hell up."

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.920
She said, "I'm your mom.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.240 position:56%
I will always love you, but even
moms need a little peace and quiet."

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.540
I totally get that mom.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.840
Thank you.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.780
Over the years you collect quite
a bit of experiences and stories

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.970
and stuff and I wrote a book years
ago called, "The Winner" and in

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:07.290 position:56%
that book, it was 1998 I think, my
villain figured out a full-proof way

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.460
to fix the United States
National Lottery,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.320
such that he could
actually pick the winners.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320
He didn't do it with a conspiracy.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.390
He didn't do it with
an inside of knowledge,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.660
he did it based on science.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.380
And science in interesting because
unlike anything sort of touched

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:30.100
by human hand, which can fail,
science if you take A and you add B

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.930
to it you get C as a result not
60% of the time or 90% of the time,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.900
you get it a 100% of the time.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.200
It's full-proof.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.780
That's what interesting
and so cool about science.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:47.090 position:56%
Well after the book came out it very
popular and maybe two years went by.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.440
And I got a call from a
reporter from la Repubblica

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.790
which is the largest
daily newspaper in Rome.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.290
And he said, "Mr. Baldacci
I don't know

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.540
if you've been following the
Italian lottery scandal."

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.480
I said, "Why no.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.880
I must have missed that.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.180
Was it on NPR?"

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.040
And he said, "Well, someone
apparently figured out how

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.280
to fix the Italian National Lottery
and they used a method very similar

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.220
to the one that you wrote
about in The Winner.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.630
Would you like to commit
on that sir?"

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:27.850
I said well, "First
of all that's bad.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.150
That's very bad.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.450
That's a felony.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.790
I would never encourage
anyone to fix the lottery."

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.740
And second point, "That's like the
coolest frigging thing anybody's

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:43.050
every told me in my whole life."

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.680
But still don't try
to do it, you know.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.770 position:56%
But if you do it don't tell anybody,
because you know, it's just bad.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.510
That's coconspirators;
if you're going

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.020 position:56%
to commit a conspiracy even though I
know a conspiracy is sort of defined

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.840
as more than one person,
don't tell anybody.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.560
You know, it's always
the coconspirators

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.070
that take you down, you know?

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.640
We're going to be finding
out about that soon.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.440
Anyway.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:12.040
[ Laughter/Applause ]

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.970
My wife, she went to my
talk today on the Teen Stage

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.320 position:56%
so she sent me a text with advice on
things that I should avoid saying.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.940
First of all, she said "For
next talk more appropriate

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.420
to talk politics, not with
kids, but not more or too much.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.360
With questions, keep them shorter.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.760
So many people want to ask,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.000
but can't because you're
answers are always far too long."

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.300
I'll just stop there.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.820
Anyway, I did mention the
strong independent women, right?

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.450
And that's, that's her.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.730
Now, I'm Italian-American
second generation.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.340
My father was first born
in the United States

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.730
and his grandfather immigrated
to the United States around turn

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.210 position:56%
of the last century, and he was born
in a little village called Barga,

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:03.220
Italy which is about an hour
north of Pisa in Tuscany.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.600
And my father has always
tried to go to Barga to see

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.810
where his father was born.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.790
The closest he made it was Egypt
when he was in World War II.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.680
But the Unites States Navy wouldn't
let him go any farther than that,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.700
so he never made it back to Italy.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.700
So, the year that my dad
unfortunately passed away,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:28.210
we had made plans to go Barga and I
wanted to go there both for myself

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.050
and bring my family so I could
come back and tell my dad.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.610
Unfortunately, I never
got a chance to do that.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.760
But before we went to Barga, I got
an email from the mayor of Barga

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.260
and he said, "I read
it in a travel magazine

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.280
that you were spending
your holiday in Italy."

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.710
Which is kind of creepy right?

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.180
And he said, "I would love for
you to come to Barga and I'd love

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.990
to take you to lunch and you
can see the city and town

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.890
where your grandfather was born."

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.510
And I wrote back and
said, "This is fantastic.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.040
I was going to bring
my family anyways."

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.850
So we set a date, we flew
over, place where we staying

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.730
and then the time came
for us to go to Barga.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.180
We were there, we were
traveling with two other families

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.580
and our kids were younger back
then, so we loaded into two cars.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.170
If you've ever driven in
Italy, unless you're like one

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:18.100 position:56%
of the autobahn, autostradale
places, you can't get anywhere fast.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.860
You probably can't
get anywhere at all.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.500
I mean it's just a lot
of back roads and stuff,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.070
and even though we had a rental
car that we paid for, you know,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.060
like the Hertz NeverLost?

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.350
They have the same system in
Italy; slightly different name.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.880
It's called Hertz AwaysLost.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.500
I have yet to drive overseas where
the GPS did not breakdown exactly

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.210
when I needed it to work.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.110
So, about 30 minutes outside of
Barga our GPS went on holiday.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.520
And I'm a very punctual person.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.310
I was a trial lawyer for 10 years
and you learn not to be late,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.490
because judges don't like that and
we were already late to this lunch.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.400
So my wife is trying to
navigate using paper maps

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.940
and we're driving along and finally
I just stopped at his crossroads;

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.610
this intersection that looked
like there was something there

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.460
and I said, "Do you
think this is it?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.210
Do you think this is Barga?"

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.910
And so she looked out the
window and said, "Well,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.060
considering that there's a 12-foot
tall poster of you on the wall

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:19.860
over there [brief laughter] it's
a pretty good bet we're in Barga."

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.330
And then we notice al the traffic
and policemen directing traffic

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.630
and I was like "What is going on?"

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.440
So, I rolled down the window,
I got the attention of one

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.540
of the police officers,
in broken Italian

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.660
and his broken English
I asked him, I said "So,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.590
you know what's going on?"

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.950
He says, "Oh, it's David
Baldacci Day in Barga.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.750
Park over there."

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:46.100
[ Laughter ]

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.980
So, I slowly rolled the window
back and up and I looked

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.320
over at my strong, independent
wife and she was looking

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.420
at me just incredulous, she said

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.010
"David Baldacci Day are
you frigging kidding me?"

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.870
And I said, "Honey I had no idea."

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.170
And she was like, "Liar!

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.800
Look how we're dressed."

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.710
And it was August.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.130
Were in shorts and, you know,
I mean we were not dressed up.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.620
So we got out and Barga
like Lucca is a walled city.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.000
So, the gates of the city open
and out marches the mayor.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.810
He's draped in the American
and the Italian flags.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.630
The American flag is
flying over the city

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.480
for the first time
since World War II.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.310 position:56%
Behind the mayor is a marching band.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.080
I swear to god, a marching band.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.890
Behind him where these
videographers and journalists

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.920
and behind them were apparently
everybody who lives in Barga.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.230 position:56%
So, the greeted me and like you know
lots of hugs, lots of kisses, blah,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.300
blah, blah and so they
escorted me in and we went

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.600
on a tour of the whole city.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.940
I visited everything, you know,
from the Duomo to the City Hall

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.930
to the Courthouse whatever,
and I did a book signing

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.300
at the local bookstore and
then we had a fabulous lunch.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.820
It was me, my family and friends,
the mayor, 1100 new friends

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.920
and time goes on, you know,
and we had a long drive back.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.900
We were staying a villa
on the side of the hill

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.200
with a one lane road going
up, switchbacks all the way.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.230
I mean if you meet
another car going there,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.780
that's why in Italy all the side
view mirrors are all beat to crap,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.930 position:56%
because as you're going along if
you're on the side with no guardrail

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.930
and a 2000 foot drop, you're
like hugging and I don't care

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.130
if you hit my car,
I'm not going over.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.430
So, we wanted to get back to
our villa before nightfall.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.840
I did not want to drive
up there at night.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.140
I just didn't.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.770 position:56%
And so, Michelle my wife, Michelle
said "You know, this has been great.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.070
It's getting late.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.660
Go tell the mayor thanks,
we're out of here."

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.460 position:56%
So, I went over to the mayor and I
said, "Well this has been fantastic.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.430
I got to see where my grandfather
was born and walk the streets

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.170
that he walked, but we have to."

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.500
And then he goes, "And now, it
is time to give your grand speech

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.000
in the center courtyard
of the city."

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:08.400
I was like, "Okay."

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.580
So, we marched to the grand
center courtyard of the city

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.420
which is lovely, and the
band does one more song

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.260
and then they stop playing
and the mayor gets up

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.600
and they have two translators

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.650
because I don't speak
Italian well enough

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.550
to give a grand speech
in the language.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.480
And the mayor gets up and
starts giving us presents.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.930
You know, he gave me a
lifetime supply of olive oil.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.530
That was a lot of fun getting
back on the plane; an oil painting

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:41.750
by a local Barga artist; a
genealogical chart framed

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.420
that they had put together
from their archives

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.950
from the Baldacci family in
Barga from the 11th century

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.540
to my grandfather's generation.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.550
So I saw siblings of my grandfather
I never even knew existed,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.680
because they didn't immigrate
to the United States.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.070
I never even heard of these people.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.950
My grandfather dies unfortunately
long before I was even born.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.020
I never even met him.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.610
He moved to Richmond, Virginia
after coming immigrating

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.470
through Ellis Island in New
York, met my grandmother

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.720
at a boarding house that
her mother ran in Richmond.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:20.130
My grandfather's name was
Amedeo Batorio Giovanni Baldacci

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.430
[assumed spelling].

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.180
Having grown in the
South, I can tell you

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.590
that southern tongues do
not wrap themselves easily

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.920
around foreign sounding
names like that.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.850
So, instead of calling him
Amedeo Batorio Giovanni everybody

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.510
in Richmond called
my grandfather Mike.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:44.480
[ Laughter ]

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.490
So, we got the genealogical chart
and then they gave me a book

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.140
and the book was came from the
town archive it was journal

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.130
that my ancestor Peatre Baldacci
[assumed spelling] started writing

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.820
in in the 1630s.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.840
And because paper was scarce
back then if you passed away

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.560
and there was paper left, it was
just handed to the next generation.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.420
So, the last entry in that
journal is from the 1880s.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.200
It covers almost 250
years of my family.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.950
That was a pretty special thing.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.930
So that was with me and
then the mayor says,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.390
"Okay the Baldacci
bambinos, venga" my kids.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.690
"Come on up."

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:21.530
So back then my daughter
was 14-15; my son was 12.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.600
So teenage girl.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.970
So the seas of people part and
my daughter is having to walk

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.460 position:56%
up between this gauntlet of people
all eye on her and she's walking up,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.170
she's not looking at the mayor.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.450
She's not looking at
anybody other than me.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.670
And she's looking at me and all
you dads out there with daughters,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:47.940
she's looking at me with a look
that says, you've ruined my life.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.620
And I'm so going to get you.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.500
Now, to complete the Mars/Venus
story, here is my 12-year-old son

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.510
and it's turn to come
up, here's what he does.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:10.040
[ Laughter ]

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.730 position:56%
The brain wiring I'm sticking to it.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.210
I mean, grew up in the same house,

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.800
same set of rules,
totally different kids.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.510
My gosh. So then I
gave my grand speech.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.020
Obviously I had nothing prepared.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.910 position:56%
But I said, "You know, even though
it's August if feels like Christmas.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:31.660
Because this outpouring of family,
friendship and just my own history

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.420
that I didn't know existed
until I arrived here,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.910
it's been so overwhelming
and probably one

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.490
of the greatest gifts
I've ever received."

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.120
And after my speech was
done and we were leaving,

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.240
one of the people we had traveled
there with said, "David you have

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.540
to come over and meet
these gentlemen."

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.410
There were 4 very elderly men on
this bench and they all had canes

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.920 position:56%
and felt caps and they were all
holding one copy of one of my books.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.870
And I went over to my friend
and said, "Oh who are they?"

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.910
And I think the youngest
was in his middle 80s,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.540
the oldest was close to 100.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.840
And I asked our friend,
"Who are they?"

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.620
And he said, "They're
all Baldacci's.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.180
They all came from other
countries today to meet you."

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.650
So these 4 elderly men stood
up, took their caps off

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.460
and bowed in respect to me.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:23.900
And all being Italians, we
just started sobbing; sobbing

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.580
and hugging, hugging and sobbing.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.090
But it really was one of the most
perfect days of my life, you know,

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.140
and we've never have had the
opportunity to go over there

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.910
if hadn't been a writer and been
interested in my family history,

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.360
but it was just an amazing day.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.120
And I memorialized that story
that I just told you, all true,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.410
in a travel story that I wrote for
"Lonely Planet" their travel guide.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.710
They asked a bunch
of writers to write

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.160
about your favorite travel
story and they called me up

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.600
and said, "Do you have one?"

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.900
And I said, "Yeah.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.280
I think I have a favorite
travel story."

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.750
So the title of the
story is entitled,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.470
"Coming Home" even
though I had never been

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.960
to Barga before in my whole life.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.270
It really felt like
I was coming home.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.250
A couple more stories
and I'll take questions.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.090 position:56%
I do a lot of research for my books.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.230
Hopefully if you've
read them you can tell.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.770
The most important
thing about research

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.260
for a novel is to leave
most of it out.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.300
You know, you could spend months
and months and months for a line

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.090
of dialogue, a few sentences
here or there, description

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.870
but you're not writing a
textbook and you have to fight

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.110
against the compulsion to cram
all your research in there,

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.640
because you're so proud
of what you did

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.230
and you don't want
to waste it, right?

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.510
If you try to do that,
most authors instead

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.490
of integrating it throughout
they just get oh I know

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.280
and they just stick in one spot.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.170
And I call those books flip books.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.480
We've all read them.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.080 position:56%
And a flip book is a writer has done
that and you're reading as a reader

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.380
and you're enjoying
the story and all

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.910
of a sudden you're like "Oh my god.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.210
What's this?"

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.820
Flip, flip, flip, flip,
flip, flip, flip, flip, flip,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.600
flip past all the research
that they crammed in there

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600
because it really has nothing to do
with propelling the story forward

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.450
and then you get back to the
story and you're enjoying it.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.110
So, you got to leave
most of the research out.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.420
But I still do a lot of
research, one, because I enjoy it.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.270
I like learning about
things, you know,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.850
I like meeting fascinating people.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.230
I just love that.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.330
But research can get you into
an enormous amount of trouble.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.570
And it happened to me
on one faithful day.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.660
I was leaving not too far from
here, I was at Union Station.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.310 position:56%
I was on an Amtrak Acela train, this
other train going up to New York

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.330
and I'm sitting at table that
I'm sharing with two other guys;

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.100
I don't know them, you
know, you just share tables.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.320 position:56%
And I assumed they were businessmen,
because they were in suits

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.930
and they had Blackberries and cell
phones and Smartphones and laptops,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.440
a miniature satellite
towers you know?

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.480
These guys were like doing
deals and it was cool and I was

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.370
on my cellphone calling a friend
of mine who was a medical examiner

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.420
in the Bronx Medical Examiner's
Office in New York and all I wanted

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.480
to do was setup an appointment,

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.050
so when I got to New York
I could meet with her.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.820
She was sort of a recognized expert
on this field of forensic science.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.160
I needed to know more about to
write a book called "Split Second."

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.890
It was the first novel in
the King and Maxwell series;

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.760
just wanted to set
an appointment up.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.330
I like to do my interviews
face-to-face.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.020
Unfortunately, she told
that she was leaving

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.580
to go overseas on special
assignment.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.200 position:56%
She was going to be leaving to go to
JFK before I even got to New York.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.610
She was helping in a homicide
investigation overseas as part

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.070
of an effort with the
State Department.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.910
She had the special
set of forensic skills.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.010
She was going to be
gone for about 3 weeks.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.540
It was a sort of a
confidential investigation.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.840
No communication was going

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.580
to be allowed stateside
while they were there,

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.990
so I could either ask the questions
now or wait until she got back.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.000
I really didn't want to wait,
so I said "Look I don't normally

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.110
like to do it this way,
so let's just do it."

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.300
So, I had my questions
and I said, "Okay,

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.510
doc here's basically how
I want to murder the guy."

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:57.080
[ Laughter ]

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.940
I know. I know.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.020
So I went through my really
elaborate poisoning technique

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.610
that I had given a
lot of thought to.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.910
And I said, "Look doc you have
to understand you know I need

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.560
to make sure that the
police when they come

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.500
to investigate this homicide they
won't even know this person's

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.640
been murdered."

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.580
And she said, "David, what you
just described really is the

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.880
perfect crime.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.200 position:56%
You know, the police
investigation will not you know show

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.500
that this was a murder."

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.890
I said, "Okay, but there's going to
be a postmortem done on the body.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.780
I need to be able to
fool a medical examiner.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.100
They won't know the
person's been murdered."

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.460
She said, "David, trust me.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.690
I've often thought about
murdering people [brief laughter].

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:43.410
If you do it the way
you described to me,

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.390
there's no postmortem
protocols that I know

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.590
of that would detect this
person has been murdered."

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.150
So, I asked a few more questions
and I ended by saying "I got

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:57.460 position:56%
to tell you doc, if I ever need to
kill anybody else, I'm calling you."

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.320
So, I clicked off,
put my phone down,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.480
I finished writing my
notes, and I looked up.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:15.560
The guy over here has spilled his
coffee from his neck to his crotch.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.110
He was like one big brown stain
and incredibly pissed off.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.720
I will never forget the guy
right across from me for the rest

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.470
of my life I'll never;
he never said a word.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.510
This is what he was doing.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:40.070
[ Laughter ]

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:45.270
And over his shoulder here
come the Amtrak police.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:50.010
No lie. Amtrak has
its own police force.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:56.860
I did not make it to
New York that day.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:04.010
I was detained as a person of
interest by the Amtrak police

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.510
who apparently don't
read a whole lot.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:15.040
[ Laughter ]

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.780
So, if you read "Split
Second" you'll see

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.100
in the acknowledgement section
which is in the back of the book,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.750
this is the place where
authors thank people

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.330
who help them with the book.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.990
The very last acknowledgement in
"Split Second" reads something

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:31.090
like this; to any all passengers
on the Amtrak Acela train

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.340
who might have overheard
me discussing

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.050
with an expert poisoning techniques
for purposes of researching

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.450
and writing a novel that were
probably scared out of their wits

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:45.350
at my seemingly diabolical
intent, I apologize.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.290
I thought it was actually
pretty fair of the judge

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.510
to let me do it that way.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.160
[ Laughter ]

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.930
Okay, the last story is,
again, completely true.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.070
The other question
I get from people is

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.950
"Well you're a famous writer
you must get recognized

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.100
in public all the time."

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.400
Almost never.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.450
It's we're not like real
celebrities,, you know,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.910
in America writers
are not celebrities.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:16.600 position:56%
We're not like musicians or actors
or athletes, it just doesn't happen,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.900
which is not a bad thing.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.280
I wouldn't want to walk out
of my house and get mobbed,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.800
it's just crazy but even
when you are recognized

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.310
in public it's not the ego stroke

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.340
that you think it might
otherwise be.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.400 position:56%
So, my wife and I were having lunch,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.780
so I don't even remember
which city we were in.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.050
We were in a booth having a nice
lunch and, you know, you look up

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.540 position:56%
and I was looking around the
restaurant and over on this side far

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.380
across the restaurant
there was a man and a woman

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.010
at a table eating lunch, and the
woman was like laser locked on me.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.680
I looked over and it's
like my god you know.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.330
She's like staring a hole right
through me and I waited a minute

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.750
and I thought well I must have
totally misinterpreted that.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.490
So, I you know, I kind of gradually
looked over again, laser lock.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.120
You know, it was like I had
a sniper dot on my forehead.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.420
It was just freaky.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.860
So, I just stopped looking
and I'm just eating my lunch,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.580 position:56%
eating my lunch and a few minutes go
by and then I sense a presence next

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.580
to me and I thought
it was our waitress

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.470
and I looked up, it's the woman.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.410
And she pushes me over in the
booth and sits down next to me.

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:20.190
And then she looks at me and says,

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:24.700
"You are who I think
you are aren't you?"

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.470
Any English teachers want to
try diagram that sentence?

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.540
It's actually got a
lot going on, you know.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.760
And I didn't know who she was.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.060
I didn't know if she was psychotic.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.860
I didn't know if she had a gun, you
know, I was trying to eat my lunch.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.890
And I said, "Well" I'm
trying to keep it calm.

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.010
"A-- do you read a lot of fiction?"

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.320
She said, "Oh yes I do."

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:55.350
I said, "Well um than I guess
I am who you think I am."

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.700
And then she just lost it
and she said, "Oh my god,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.950
never in my wildest dreams did
I think I would ever have the

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.570
opportunity to meet you.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:08.050
This is so mindboggling, I can't
even process what's happening.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:12.050
This is the most magical
moment of my entire life."

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.910
And she turns and screams
across the restaurant

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:20.610
to I guess her husband,
"I was right Joe!

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.510
It is John Grisham!"

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:33.730
[ Laughter ]

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.140
Yeah. Yep.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.160
Now, I've known John a
longtime and great guy.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.590
You know, every time I've asked to
help out with a charitable event

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.890
or something he always steps up.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.270
He's just a wonderful guy.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.790
That moment in my life I really
wasn't feeling the love for John.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.890
You know, my poor wife.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.610
She blew ice tea out of her nose.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.980
Literally.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:09.790
And said very politely
to the woman, you know,

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:14.720
she goes "That's the right genre,
but you got the wrong author."

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.190 position:56%
And the woman did look mortified and
she looked at me again and she said,

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.510
"Oh my god are you Baldacci?"

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:25.150
[ Laughter ]

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.740
I really can't make this up folks.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.060
I really can't.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.770
And I said, "Yeah I am."

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.980
So, obviously terribly she grinned
that I was not messier Grisham.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.760
She turns and screams across
the frigging restaurant again,

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.220
"You were right Joe,
it is the Italian."

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.510
Thank you very much.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:37:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.740
Anybody have any questions?

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.040
Yes.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.220
&gt;&gt; Hi, you're a great storyteller
even the stories tonight.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.430
So, with legal thrillers I've
been reading a lot of them.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.220
I'm writing one actually.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.520
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Right.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.820
&gt;&gt; And a lot of them
have a lot of bodies.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.410
Can you write a legal thriller
that doesn't have a lot

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.720
of people dying all over the place?

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.030
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: A lot of bodies?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.630
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci:
All over the place?

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.380
Yes. I have written thrillers that
don't have a lot of bodies all

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.920
over the place and quite frankly
you know, the a lot of the violence

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.390
and graphic and gore and stuff, I
leave to the people's imagination.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.940
I don't really need to write all
of that, only if it's important

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.300
to move the story along; only
because it's a red herring;

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.370
only because it's a clue later on.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.680
I find that it dilutes the power
of what you're trying to do.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.710
Some of the best crime novels

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.980
out there have only
involved one killing.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.200
It makes, you know,
solving that crime paramount

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.260
and also makes the life
of that person really,

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.670
really incredibly valuable
and important and significant.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.750
If you have somebody who's,
look if you have a serial killer

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.790
and they're killing multiple
people and that's important

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.930
for the story, than absolutely.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.080
But, you know, to kill 30
or 40 or 50 people just

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.490
because you think the
body count is going

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.740
to help book sales, probably not.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.820
It's got to be; everything has
to really be faithful and true

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.070
and make sense for the
story you're trying to tell.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:23.450
So, the body count should
not be a body count just

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.410
to [inaudible] you know bodies.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.500
It's got to be integral to the
part and you have to be respect

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.790 position:56%
and have the integrity of the story.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.300
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm sure you've been
asked this all the time,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.870
I'll just ask it again.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.610
Talk a little bit about the
writing process for you.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:45.780
Do you block off an entire
day, go out for lunch, write,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.300
than go out for dinner or do
you try to just put as much

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.380
as you can intensively in that day?

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.250
And also, do you get together with
some of your writing colleagues

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:02.180
and trade craft or
challenges and share moments

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.470 position:56%
that worked and moments that didn't?

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Okay, the writing
process and what is my typical day

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.240
like and do I hangout
with John Grisham?

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.540
Anyway.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.020
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: My days are
typical for being atypical.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.190 position:56%
You know, I know a lot of writers
will have a, you know, 4-page a day,

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.590
5-page a day, 2000 words a day;
that's never worked for me.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.490
One, because I may not have 2000
words that I'm going to be able

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:31.030
to write that day, or I may have
10,000 and why should I stop?

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.880 position:56%
I tend to write until the tank is
empty and however many words it ends

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.350
up or pages it doesn't
matter to me so long as I get

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.670 position:56%
out that day what I want to get out.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.160
Some days I don't write anything.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.690
Some days it's just not
there, it's not crystalized.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.550 position:56%
I haven't thought it through enough.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.190
I don't outline everything.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.490
You know, I've written
over 40 books.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.470
I've never known the ending
of any of my books until I,

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.340
you know, get to the end.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.500
When I sit down to start a book, I
have no idea how it's going to end.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.320
You know, I work my way there.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.280
I use many, many outlines.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.160
You know, miniature
outlines when I need to,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.270
but I really like immerse
myself in the story

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.910
and therefore I don't really feel
like I need to map everything out.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:12.110
Plus, it could work really
well when you write an outline.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:16.610 position:56%
It's almost like practicing you know
you're a practice player in the NFL

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.770
and then game day comes and you're
actually playing for real with,

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.270
you know, the best in the NFL.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.570
It's different.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.740
So, it might have sounded brilliant
in the outline and then you sit

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.020
down to write an implemented
outline on a printed page,

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.510
and all of a sudden you realize
this doesn't work at all.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.520
You know, because I
had the note over here,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.390
it said "Come up with
something brilliant",

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.020
it's just not working, you know?

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.320
The outline says, "brilliant."

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.230
I can't make it, you
know, what's brilliant?

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.270
You have to be true to the story.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.080
And like in Amos Decker the
very first name was Decker

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.380
or "Memory Man."

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.680
I didn't even know the guy.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.670
So how could I write an
outline of the entire book

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.330
when I had never even spent
time on a page with him?

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.930
I had to get a feel for him, his
voice, how he walked, you know,

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.820
how he dealt with people, what
his thought process were like.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.660
In order to do that, you
got to write the stuff

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.780
and it may not work the first time,
or the second, or the tenth time.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.230
So for me, every day is different
which I think is a good thing.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.710
I don't want to drop into a routine

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.200
because I think my writing
will become routine, you know,

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.810
and instead of trying to
treat every novel I write

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.620
as the very first novel that I have
written, scared you know to death

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.230
that I can't do it again,
not sure of what I'm doing.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.020
I always thought that fear
gave me an edge to explore

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.770
and to exploit things that if
I were in a routine and I felt

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.680
like I had a template that I felt
like I knew what I was doing,

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.480
all of sudden as Truman
Capote once said,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.740 position:56%
"That's now writing, that's typing."

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.700
&gt;&gt; What's the hardest character
that you've ever written

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.290
and why were they hard to write?

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.060
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: The hardest
characters that I've ever written

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.250
and why were they hard to write?

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:59.500
I have a series that I've
written a number of books about

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.670
and I probably get this
more than anything else,

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.700
"When is the Camel Club
going to come back?

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.120
When is the Camel Club
going to come back?"

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.000
[Applause] I know, I know.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.540
So, these were you know a handful
of distinctly different characters,

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.270 position:56%
you know, none of them were anything

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.390
that I had remotely
anything in common with.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.950
They were older than I was

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:26.380
and I really wasn't sure what I
wanted them to be or to represent,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.220
but I knew that I wanted them
to have sort of this anchor

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.270
in Oliver Stone, not the film
director, the other Oliver Stone.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.840
And then this sort of
entourage, this ensemble cast

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.140
of characters around them.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.230
It took me a longtime to really
craft each of those characters

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.650
in a way that make them
individualistic and memorable.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:49.580
You know, the hardest
thing about ensemble casts,

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.050
is that some of them start
to blur together, you know,

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.870
and they don't have
their distinct identity.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.790
So, the Camel Club probably,
but once I got going with them,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.790
subsequent books were a lot easier,

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.640
but that first one was
really, really hard.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.940
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.430
&gt;&gt; First I want to
say thank you so much

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.140
for being here for all of us today.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.570
You're very first book
that you wrote, what,

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:15.670
I mean you said you
were an attorney.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.080
What propelled you into writing?

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.200
What was that like when you
first sat down to write it?

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.140
And how did you do your
character development?

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: What propelled me
to write my first novel and you know

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.780
when I sat down to write it with
the character development and?

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.210
I started out writing short stories
when I was in high school, college,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.750
law school and practicing law.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.540
I moved onto screenplay writing.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.490
A friend of mine went to
L.A. to break into film.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:42.930
He's a producer, he
brought a script back.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.230 position:56%
I've never read a script in my life.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.180
I read it and I though this is an
interesting way to tell a story.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.590
It's not going end up on a
printed page; it's going to be

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.710
on a wall with you know sound.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:55.830 position:56%
So, over the course of 4 or 5 years
while I was practicing law I wrote 5

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.130
original screenplays.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.230
I got an agent in L.A.
based on that.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:03.620 position:56%
I came really close; in 1991 I wrote
a script called "Reverse Order."

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.910
It was "Die Hard" in
the White House.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:10.710 position:56%
You probably saw it on film like 14
years later written by somebody else

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.440
and that I though was
going to be my big break.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.180
My agent said everybody
loves the script.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.010
Warner Brothers is
mad over the script;

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.880
Paramount Pictures it's going to
be bidding war, blah, blah, blah,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.620
ended up not selling at all.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.920
You know, all of the studios

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.870
for whatever reason
found a problem with it.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.330
I found in Hollywood
over these years,

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.760 position:56%
I worked on many film projects,
movies and television that it's far;

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.690
nobody out in Hollywood
ever got fired

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.200
for saying no to a
project, you know.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.400
So, that's when I started
thinking about a novel.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.600
And my law office was very near
the White House and I would go out

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.750
and you know walk around.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.110
I'd see the secret service,

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.060
occasionally see the
presidential motorcade.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.230
And I thought you know, I'm going
to write a book that's going

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.530
to flip all the stereotypes.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.380
I'm going to make the good people
bad and the bad people good,

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.790
so I wrote a story about the
president, a twist with a mistress,

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.220
a cover-up, the secret service
was part of the cover-up

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.070
and a burglar this bad guy,

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:06.060
had the highest morals
of anyone in the story.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.710
So, I spent 3 years of my
life writing that novel.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.410
No, you know, no thought

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.050
that anybody was actually
going to buy it.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.270
I just thought it was a cool story.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.290
So, I just wrote every
day a little bit.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.080
I'd get home from work, write
in the middle of the night.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.960 position:56%
I just wrote a little bit every day
for 3 years and it was finally done.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.690
And some of it, there was a young
lawyer in the book "Jack Graham"

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.200
and that was somewhat based on me

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.600
because I was a young lawyer
back then, but it was sort

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.650 position:56%
of dynamics of Washington, you know?

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:36.210
Because I had worked a lot you
know with you know organizations

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.120
in D.C. I thought I knew
the city pretty well,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.660
so a lot of it was just
experiences that I had

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.260
and just using my imagination
to fill-in everything else.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.270
It was so funny after the; the book
was published; I wrote the book

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.140
in like 1993 it was done.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.090
It was published in 1996.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:46:00.700
So, in 19, probably 1999 I got
a; I get a lot of fan letters.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.300
Back then it was real
fan letters, tons.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.580
Now it's all emails, but a lady
wrote me, she was very upset.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.930
She said, "I read Absolute Power."

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.320
I can't believe you took a
national tragedy and turned it

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.510
into a bestselling novel.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:20.470
And she was referring to the
Clinton/Monica Lewinsky stuff.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:25.800
And I wrote her back and I was like
"Oh, you know, just to let you know

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.020
if you see the copyright
page where it says

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:34.590 position:56%
where the book was published, the
book was published in 1996, January,

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.970
2-and-a-half years before anyone
ever heard of Monica Lewinsky.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.520
And I thought, you know,
she just made a mistake.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.980
That's no problem and that
would be the end of it.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.210
Like in 2 days later I get
a letter back from her.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:50.230
It was just one line that
said, "That proves nothing!"

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:58.640
[ Laughter ]

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.870
I've still got that letter.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.030
And it just goes to show, you know,

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.670
once people believe
something it's really hard.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.970
Yes, ma'am.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:14.270
&gt;&gt; Two or 3 years ago I read a
biography of Louisa May Alcott

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.940
and one of the things
that is memorable

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.340
for me was how rapidly
she wrote "Little Women."

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.470
I think I read she wrote
it in 3 or 4 weeks,

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.400
something like that very brief.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.630
So, 2 questions in that regard.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.660
Which book did you write most
rapidly, and a 150 years from now,

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.040
which of your books will people
still be giving to one another

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.760
and reading if you had to pick one?

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.660
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: What
was the second one again?

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.540
&gt;&gt; A 150 years from now, like
Little Women is still read;

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.940 position:56%
which of your books 150 years from
now do you think will still be read?

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.240
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Okay.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.260
&gt;&gt; And then one final follow-up
question since you're local

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.460
and I think from Fairfax
County, can you tell a little bit

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.500 position:56%
about your foundation and how you're
involved with the local youth?

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.500
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Absolutely, yep.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.620
So, remind me the first
question was?

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.160
&gt;&gt; Which of your books did
you write most rapidly?

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.460
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Right, okay.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.760
&gt;&gt; Any in 3 weeks?

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.060
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: The book

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.360
that I wrote the fastest
was not a thriller.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.960
It was called, "One Summer."

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.480
And it was a sort of
a family tragedy.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.190
And the only reason that
book was written was

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:22.490
because my son was receiving
Confirmation in the Catholic Church

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.590
and my wife told me to go to
the church early to save seats,

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.140
because it was going to
fill up and we had family

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.570
and friends flying
in from out of town.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.870
So I went there to save seats.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.410
And it was just me and the
priest who I knew very well,

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:38.590
so we were just sitting there,
but I had like 2 hours to kill

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:42.930
and my dad had just passed
away, my mom was very ill,

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:47.850
my son was receiving, my last child
was receiving his last major step

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.190
in the Catholic Church.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.390
The next after Confirmation
is last rights basically.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.690
So it was almost like, you
know, I felt myself coming

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.660
up to the turnstile too, you know?

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.050
And the years were going on,

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.690
and while I was sitting
there 2 hours the story

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:07.250
for "One Summer" just unspooled
in my head totally from A to Z.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.090
That almost never happens.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.390
So, I went back and I wrote it.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.750
I probably wrote that book in maybe
2 months, while I was writing,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.830
you know, my other
thrillers as well.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.130
And nobody knew I was writing it.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:24.050 position:56%
When I sent it up to my agent he was
astounded and, but it was a story

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.670
that resonated deeply with me

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.310
and the premise is a
very simple premise.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.890
It's the family, they have3 kids.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.390
The dad is terminally ill
with an incurable disease.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.900
He's in Hospice, Home Hospice
and he's preparing himself

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.740
and his family for he won't
be there and the mom is going

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.290
to be the surviving parent and the
family is trying to deal with that.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:50.500
And because of sort of a
twist of fate, the father ends

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:56.020
up being the surviving parent
and he has to deal with that.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.030
I don't know why it hit me
so completely, but it did.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.400
It's just one of those
things that happens in life.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.940
The book that I will; that
people will be reading

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:11.690
about of mine a 150 years from
now, I'll reserve the right to say

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.340
that it might be one that
I haven't written yet.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:21.300 position:56%
I wrote a book years ago it was made
into a film called "Wish You Well."

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.540
And that was a film very; a book
very near and dear to my heart

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.230
and it was totally different, it
was like my, if I'm going to have a

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.330
"To Kill a Mocking Bird"
experience it would that.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.250
I'm very much into
intimately involved

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.830 position:56%
with my own family's history in
Southwest Virginia on top of a ridge

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:41.200
in one of the most isolated
parts of the United States.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.880
I remember, I still remember
to this day a 2004 article

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.210
in the Washington Post in 2004,
they finally pulled running water

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.860
and electricity up to
Ramsey's Ridge in 2004.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.610
Up until that time, it was
all well water and coal fire

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:01.180
or oil lanterns if
you can imagine that.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.280
It's always been a
huge part of my life.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.520
If you think of the name
like Baldacci, you know,

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.900
I definitely have that
ethnicity as well.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.110
My mother's maiden name was Rose.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.750
So they had been in Virginia in
the south for a long, longtime.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.060
So it was really sort of a
mash of 2 cultures for me.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.430
And growing up in Richmond with a
name that no one could pronounce,

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.720
you know, I ended up answering
mostly to David Baldwin.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.850
So, I felt you know sort of
like an outsider as well.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.020
I love, I'm sort of
the anti-narcissist.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.540
I know I'm up here
speaking before all of you,

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.720 position:56%
but I'm the anti-narcissist: I would
much rather be out there looking

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.180
and listening in on all of you.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.750
That's what I would
much rather be doing.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.840
The Wish You Well Foundation my
wife and I started it 16 years ago.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.240
We fund literacy programs
across the United States.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.880
The ability to read is the most
important tool you'll ever have

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.650
in your life, because it
allows you to unleash this.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:52:00.620
You know, the verbs to read
and to think are synonymous.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.690
You can't do one without the other.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.230
It's almost impossible.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.880
And today, you see a
very divided country.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.530
I went to UVA Law School.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.250
I lived in Charlottesville
for 3 years.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.730
I saw what happened there.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.970
I saw some of the responses
of people

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.380
that should know better
of what happened there.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.210
Ignorance and intolerance are
like parentheses or comas,

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:22.650
you always find them together.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.340
You never find one
without the other.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.800
The only way to defeat
ignorance is through education

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.830
and reading is the mainstay
of education, and you get rid

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.740
of ignorance than tolerance
will fall by the wayside.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.720
If you don't, it never will.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.190
So, for us, literacy is
the most important tool

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.000
and we have funded programs
virtually in all 50 states

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.500
and counting, millions of dollars
to the Wish You Well Foundation.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.030 position:56%
We also have a book collection
program called Feeding Body and Mind

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.150
when I do local book events;
we send these big boxes.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.600
We partnered with Feeding
America which is all

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.160
of the nation's foodbanks.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.510
People come and donate books and we
ship those books to foodbanks all

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.420
over the country and over the
last 6 or 7 years we've shipped

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.020
over 2 million books to foodbanks.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.020
People need food to survive,
but alone it can't break them

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.600
out that cycle of poverty.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.890
Illiteracy and poverty
go hand-in-hand.

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.890
It's also most like parentheses;

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.850
most people seeking food
systems have low literacy skills,

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.820
low job skills, that's why
they are not self-sustaining.

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.470
Breaking them out of
that cycle of poverty,

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.160
putting books in their hands
and the hands of their kids,

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.840
I have never seen a bad result
from a book being at home.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.810
I have seen many bad results
from no books being at home.

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.830
In the United States of America,

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.510
that should never be
happening today.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:45.100
[ Applause ]

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:52.200
&gt;&gt; Hi. Well, my the early one
she asked one of my questions

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.850
and you answered another one of
my questions, but I still I would

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.130
like to take this opportunity
to give some comments.

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:03.870
First of all, I thank you
for being here and would

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:09.160
like to ask the Library
of Congress not

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.340
to answer your call
to stop inviting you.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.670
[ Applause ]

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.970
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Thank you.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:19.240
Thank you.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:27.700
&gt;&gt; And obviously you wear so many
extraordinary hats; writer, lawyer,

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.750
storytelling, storyteller,

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:34.200
and my 12-year-old son
the earlier comments.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:40.280
You look like a very much
politician and actor.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.580
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Yeah.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.110
&gt;&gt; But I'm most impressed
and interested

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:50.040
in your role as a humanitarian.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.810
So, I wanted to say my questions as
a proof that I came with questions.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:55:01.220
That's how and why
you coined your name

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.220 position:56%
of your foundation We Wish You Well?

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:11.890
And what's the most that you're
proudest accomplishment so far?

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.900
But, I think you already answered.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.200
Thank you.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.500
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Okay.

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.800
Thank you.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.100
Great question.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.400
Great question.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.700
You know, my wife and I
thought long and hard about it.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.860
The novel "Wish You Well"
came before the foundation,

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.440
but not that long before it.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.100
And we sat and talked about it
and we came to the conclusion

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.740
that the best way we could
wish someone well was

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.530
to help them to learn to read.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:38.590
And once you've had
that skill, I mean,

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.320
everybody in this room
you're all readers,

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.930
you all love books
that's why you're here.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.520
When I'm out talking about it
doing fundraisers and trying

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.330
to impress upon people, in an
area like this in Washington,

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:54.160 position:56%
D.C. where everybody has 3 PhDs, you
know, it's hard for them to fathom

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.740
that there are, you know,
over a 100 million Americans

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:04.340
who lack basic literacy
skills, so wishing someone well

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.260
in our mind means helping
them to learn how to read.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:13.750
If they can have that one skill
they can rise to opportunities

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:15.090
to the occasion,

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.990
to self-empowerment,
and self-sustaining.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:22.910
You know, I think one of the
best things that we've done,

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:29.810
we do a lot of programs
with prison populations.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:33.390
Recidivism rates are
through the roof.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.460 position:56%
This country went through, you know,
probably a 15 to 20 year period

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.360
where they really emphasized
rehabilitation

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.750
and then you know the hammer came
down and it was like, you know,

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.670
you're getting locked up and
you're going to be treated

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:49.050
like you're bad people and then
they wonder why when they come out,

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:52.250
one they commit crimes again
or two they go right back in.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.780
So, we do a lot of program;
we fund a lot of programs

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.940
with prison populations
where they have peer review

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:04.070 position:56%
where fellow prisoners are taught to
be tutors of their fellow prisoners.

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:06.750
They have credibility,
people can relate to them.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:09.310
They understand, they also see
that person as a role model.

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:13.490
So, we funded a lot of programs
across a number of states that deal

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.710
with that very issue, because
that is a neglected population.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:20.910 position:56%
And I have to say that, the Wish You
Well's mission statement has grown

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.210
over the years.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:24.070
We call ourselves a
family foundation,

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.540
but we really we're mostly
focused on adult illiteracy

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.470
because there's very little
government funding for that

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:32.010
and it comes mostly
through private foundations.

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.320
But we've come to learn that
our mission statement needed

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:42.360
to be broadened to include; kids,
children, and neglected populations

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.040 position:56%
that may not fit precisely with what
we're trying to do, but at the end

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.930
of the day it lifts up everyone.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.340
So I think, you know, probably one

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.840 position:56%
of the proudest things we've done is
trying to help neglected populations

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:58.600
that without that support,
will never be able

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.060
to find their footing
in mainstream society.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:05.910 position:56%
So, by doing that, you know, we
help everybody at the end of the day

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.170
and so that's probably you know one

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:11.000
of the proudest accomplishments
we've had.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.300
[Inaudible] thank you.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.400
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Thank you.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.050
[ Applause ]

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:33.260
&gt;&gt; Hi. You spoke of
your son's Confirmation

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.410
so I assume you're Catholic.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:42.840
I actually go to Catholic
University of America

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:49.330 position:56%
and I was wondering how much your
fate influences your writing if any,

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:53.470
and if it affects you at any point?

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.730
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: How
much does my faith,

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.390
you know, impact on my writing.

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:05.300 position:56%
I will tell a little secret even
though my grandparents were Catholic

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.150
when they were in Italy.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:14.780
When they came to the United
States they both left the church.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.940
So, David Baldacci in Richmond,
I was raised as a Baptist.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.540
Can you believe that?

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:26.230
But my wife, wife's family is
Catholic and I like to tell people

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:31.950
as a Baptist I over the last 20
years I've attended far more masses

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.300
as a Baptist than most Catholics do
in their entire life, every Sunday

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.780 position:56%
and sometimes more than once a week.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.600
But over the years, I have
become a lot more involved

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.770
in the Catholic Church
and both of our kids

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.340
when through parochial education

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.340
and I got a really
great grounding in that.

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:54.090
And I do have to say that
it does impact my writing

00:59:54.090 --> 01:00:00.270
in how my characters are built, how
they respond in certain situations,

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:04.510
the sorts of things that they say
and what is meaningful to them.

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:09.300
And I will continue to do that.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:15.550
I'm not going to get a box,
soapbox and try to pound something.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.540
That doesn't work.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.980
That just turns people off.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:28.420
If you can say things subtly, lay
it out there and let people arrive

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.610
with their own conclusions,
that's far better than trying

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:36.470
to drive a nail through their head,

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:42.370
because it's just going
to work that way.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:45.520
You know, earlier on in my
career I used to do that

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.660
and which is counterproductive
and really interfere with the flow

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.520
of the story and it just
wasn't the proper place.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.130
I have other ways where
I can do that.

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.430
So I will always, you know,

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:54.730
profoundly impact what
I write about.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.030
We'll take one last question.

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:57.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:58.630
Amazing. Thank you for being here.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:59.930
Considering your comments
on politics, you're,

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.230
the fact that you're a lawyer,
you live around the D.C. area

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:02.530
and you mentioned politics and
the intrigue that's taking place,

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:03.830
is there sufficient set of
ingredients for you to get inspired

01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.130
to write something in the
future regarding what's going

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.430
on using this as a foundation?

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:07.730
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: I don't think
I need to repeat that question.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.030
You would not believe, if you go
on my Twitter feed, every day,

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.330
you know, I get comments from
like "Baldacci must have plotted

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.630
out his next 12 books
based on current events."

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:12.930
You know, or "What happened today
in the New York Times reported,

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.230
I think that was in a
Baldacci book 4 years ago."

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.530
It can't help but impact what I
write about and it's a balance.

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:16.830
Again, you know, I'm
writing a novel.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.130
But I have to say, as a
novelist I've always felt,

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:19.930
and I feel this strongly, I am only
bound by plausibility, but I am.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:23.190
[ Laughter ]

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.150
And I can't tell you
how liberated I feel.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.010
Thank you very much.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.500
