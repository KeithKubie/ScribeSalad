00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:02.939
- Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder
of the Khan Academy.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.050
I just wanted to let you know

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.091
about our India talent search.

00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:07.591
As you might know, Khan Academy,

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.422
we're a not-for-profit with a mission

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:11.243
of providing a free, world-class education

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.061
for anyone, anywhere.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:16.032
And to us that means that if
you are a villager someplace

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:17.991
and you don't have access
to a formal school,

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:20.241
then you might be able to
access a low-cost smart phone,

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.052
and then be able to self-educate yourself

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:23.271
and one day prove what you know,

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:24.191
so that you could get a job,

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.523
or go into higher education.

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:28.054
But ideally, you're using Khan Academy

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:29.892
in conjunction with a classroom.

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:32.452
Where the classroom can
allow students to learn

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:35.029
and work at their own pace,
give data to teachers,

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:38.079
free up class time for
more open-ended projects

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.818
or peer-to-peer learning
or Socratic dialog.

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:43.748
So we have a call out for the talent,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:47.373
the teaching talent in
India to work with us.

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:49.439
By being part of this talent search,

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.705
for one, you'll get a chance

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.632
to practice making videos yourself,

00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:56.241
and we're looking for folks
in math and science initially,

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:57.883
but eventually all subjects.

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.352
It's a way for us to find talent.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.668
Talent that can help us create content

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:06.243
that will educate tens of millions

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:08.561
of learners throughout India.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:11.542
So the opportunity here is,
I think, pretty exciting.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.008
There will be prizes,

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:14.718
but maybe the biggest prize of all

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:16.462
is the opportunity to contribute

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:18.743
and help to your fellow citizens.

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:23.282
If you want to participate,
participate by December 12th.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.941
And now, I'm going to
hand it off to Aanand,

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:28.313
who is our head of content in India.

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:30.430
- I had a great math
teacher where I grew up,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.523
and I used to keep wondering,

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:33.732
what would it be like if way more students

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:36.114
could learn from someone like him?

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:36.947
And also got me thinking,

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:38.672
how many other such great teachers exist

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:40.872
whom I'm not able to learn from,

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.356
just because they're not able to teach me?

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:46.163
So I know that as a teacher,
what's the biggest dream?

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:48.923
It's to be able to reach as
many learners as possible.

00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:51.969
And in India that could
be tens of millions,

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.126
maybe hundreds of millions

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.622
of learners who could
learn greatly from us.

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:58.432
So it's been a dream to
conduct a talent search

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:01.242
which would bring together
these great content creators

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:03.163
and create content for math and science,

00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:05.812
and maybe many more subjects.

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:07.743
So this year, we're finally able to do it,

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.203
and in this talent search

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:10.683
we're looking for math and science

00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:13.461
to begin with, for standards six to 12.

00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.239
In English and Hindi, again to begin with,

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.812
and who knows, next year we might do

00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:20.073
a much larger project than this.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.736
So send your entries.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:24.164
Here's Grant who won last
year's U.S. talent search

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:27.440
and who's currently a
fellow, to say a few words.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.073
- Hey everyone, my name
is Grant Sanderson.

00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:30.990
I had the good fortune of last year being

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.139
one of the United States
talent search winners.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.788
After that there was a kind of

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.052
a whirlwind of experiences.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:38.838
I ended up being a content fellow here.

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:40.885
I've been working on
multivariable calc content

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.475
and a little bit in other math areas.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.166
Probably this goes without saying,

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.121
but one of the biggest benefits
of being here is the reach.

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.515
And I mean the global reach.

00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:50.969
Knowing that the stuff
that you're going to make

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.559
actually influences a lot
of students lives out there.

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.864
For example, in India, I'm really excited

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.530
that they're doing an India talent search

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.129
for India-specific content.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.377
Because this means people
can create math content,

00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:04.535
or whatever else, much
better than I ever could,

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.210
or much better than anyone here ever could

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.767
just because it is
localized in that sense.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:10.799
So I'm excited to see
what you have to make

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.206
and have fun.

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.991
- One thing to keep in mind
when you make your submissions

00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.177
is we care a lot more about the content

00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:19.347
and the substance of your video
than the production value.

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:21.852
You should also let everyone you know,

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:24.838
know about this talent search.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.537
I'm sure you might know some
really good teachers out there.

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:31.704
And try to get your submissions
in by December 12th.
