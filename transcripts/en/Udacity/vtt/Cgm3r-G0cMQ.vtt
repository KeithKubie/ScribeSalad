Hi, and welcome to Introduction to Data Science. My name's

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.590
Dave, and I'll be the instructor for this course. I've

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.200
worked as a data scientist in Silicon Valley, most recently

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.590
at a small company called Yub and before that at

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.530
a company called TrialPay. I'm formally trained as a physicist,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.970
and I originally became interested in data scientist because I

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.100
love the idea of improving the quality of people's lives

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.560
or. Building really cool products by using data and mathematics.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.480
In this lesson, we'll discuss data science at a high level.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.750
Together we'll find out what data science is and discuss what skills

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.260
are required to be a data scientist. We'll also hear from a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.000
bunch of other data scientists about interesting projects they worked on. And

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.180
discuss how data science is being used to solve a bunch

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440
of different problems. This lesson in particular is going to be a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.910
little bit different than the others. We're not going to build as

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.680
much. I think it's important to understand data science at high level

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.940
before we dive into the details. Alright, well I'm really

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.970
excited about this course, so why don't we get started.
