00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At this high school in a
suburb north of Chicago, the sights

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:16.166
and sounds of youngsters
having fun fill the halls.

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:17.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Are you ready?

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.696
Okay, go, shake, shake, shake.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this unique
program, high school students learn

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:25.636
about early childhood development
by teaching lessons for little ones.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:28.236
&gt;&gt;Student: So let's all count how
many stuffed animals we've got, okay?

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.966
So throw yours in first,
and that's one, two, three--

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.196
&gt;&gt;Karen: This is one of
our large motor activities.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:37.156
It's an opportunity for
listening and following directions

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:40.386
for the children, but also just
moving your body, because you know,

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:42.276
we need to move our body
a lot during the day.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.296
We get a little wiggly.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:47.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Deer Park Teaching
And Learning Center was launched

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:52.026
in 1992, when Deerfield High
teachers urged the school

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:54.266
to provide child care
for their children.

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:58.136
The center now offers seven
child development classes

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:02.546
for high school students, with child
care tuition covering the salaries

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:06.456
of the child development class
teachers, and staff at the center.

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.406
&gt;&gt;Karen: We are really
a full time lab school

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:10.846
for the child development students.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:14.736
It's a great experience for
our children, because they get

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:16.666
to have more one-on-one time

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.656
with their high school
friends, as they call them.

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:19.836
&gt;&gt;Student: What color is that?

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:20.116
Yellow?

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:23.906
&gt;&gt;Karen: It's also a great experience
for the high school students,

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:28.386
because they get to try on a
career, apply some of these skills,

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:31.306
either at a part time job
babysitting, working at a camp.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.906
It's also a great experience
for them to say, wow,

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:36.056
children are a huge responsibility

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:38.126
that maybe I'm not quite
ready for right now.

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:39.266
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you want to go there?

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.856
I'll go, like that.

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:43.686
&gt;&gt;Karen: But, for the most part, we
do have a lot of high school students

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:46.586
that get started in our program,
just as an elective class,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.286
and find their path, saying, I
really would like to be a teacher.

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:51.176
&gt;&gt;Child: Oh no, look.

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:54.976
&gt;&gt;Jenn: We're taking observations
on how the kids develop over time.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:02:00.276
We write down how they interact with
each other, their large motor skills,

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:03.136
their small motor skills, and
their intellectual development.

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Child development
classes meet four days each week.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:06.896
&gt;&gt;That's good, okay.

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:11.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students spend one day
studying child development theory,

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.586
and three periods each week, getting
hands on experience by planning,

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:15.766
observing and teaching lessons.

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:17.376
&gt;&gt;Student: We could
like, make fireworks

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:18.996
and have a little bouncy
balls and shake

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:20.486
around bouncy balls or something.

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:23.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, what
colors do you want to use?

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:23.786
&gt;&gt;Student: Bright colors.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:26.436
&gt;&gt;Jenn: I love this class, because
I want to be a preschool teacher

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:29.576
when I'm older, so it's really
great to learn all this now, like,

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:32.326
being this young, get to work hands
on with them, because you really get

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:33.836
to see if it's something
you want to work with.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.186
&gt;&gt;Good night nobody, good night mush.

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:40.496
&gt;&gt;Karen: I think everybody gets
to benefit, whether it's teachers

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:43.666
in the high school, who get to come
to work with their child every day,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.736
get to stop in at lunchtime,
it's a great benefit for them,

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:48.336
teaching in the building.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.946
It's a great experience for the
high school student, to have a class

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:55.326
where they get to be actively
involved, a lab experience.

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:58.326
It's also wonderful
for our preschoolers--

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.126
&gt;&gt;Jenn: So who liked the old
lady with Spring Hush, the best?

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:03.816
&gt;&gt;Karen: Really, it is a
program that anybody could do,

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.126
and what a wonderful
experience for everybody.

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:07.056
Everybody wins.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:07.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Keep turning.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:09.456
What are they doing?

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:13.636
