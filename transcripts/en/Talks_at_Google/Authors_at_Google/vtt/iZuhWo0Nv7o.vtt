00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.660
&gt;&gt;Male speaker: It is my pleasure today to
introduce Allen Downey.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.610
He's a professor of Computer Science at Olin
College, and a lot of us, he's also the author

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.440
of at least three books
for O'Reilly: Think Python, Think Stats, and

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.759
Think Complexity.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.490
Looking at an intersecting world of ideas
around, using software to explore other concepts.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.140
And he's a professor
at Olin College of Computer Science.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.970
A lot of us here at Google,
know him from his stint as a visiting scientist,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.920
and Nathan Glasgow's
group Under Hiatus.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.070
And just a quick personal anecdote.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.210
I took
this book home on Tuesday, by Wednesday afternoon,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.210
there was already
an iterated prisoner's dilemma tournament

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.930
going on in my house when I got home, so,
it's interesting, so thank you very much Allen.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.869
&gt;&gt;Allen: Thank you very much David.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.610
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.259
it's a lot of fun for me to be back.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.659
I was just pointing out
the part in the book that's about you.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.430
So enjoy that.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.360
If you want to follow along, that's the URL
for the slides I'm using.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.320
There are a few links in the slides, so if
you go to that, you'll be

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.600
able to follow those links.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.500
So as David mentioned,
when we were talking about this book, Think

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.140
Complexity,
I want to start out by telling you a little

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.409
bit of the history
of how this book came around.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.670
I teach at Olin College, which
is a small engineering college in Needham.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.080
It's relatively new,
it's only been operating for about ten years.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.190
The mission of the college
is to create an innovative engineering program.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.330
And specifically for Computer Science,
we needed to create a curriculum

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.060
that made sense for engineers.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.850
We don't offer a degree in Computer Science,
we offer degrees in engineering.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.229
Students can concentrate in Computer Science,
which is kind of like doing a minor,

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.530
but we didn't want to just do an Engineering
major

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.530
with a C.S. minor.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.780
We thought that was an opportunity
to do something richer than that.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.340
So what we weren't looking for is a Department
of Computer Science.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.239
What we ended up doing is, taking the ideas
in Computer Science,

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.991
took the whole curriculum,
and you can imagine if each class is a box,

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:27.030
full of stuff, we just took all the stuff
and dumped it out on the table,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.379
threw away the boxes, and started rearranging
the stuff.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.180
'Cause a lot of the groupings of ideas are
historical,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.879
and might not be the best choices for a current
curriculum.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.620
So, for example,
if you have the luxury of offering lots of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.650
classes,
you'll have an Operating Systems class, a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.239
Networking class,
and a Databases class,

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.590
and there might not be explicit connections
between those.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.110
But if you now take all those pieces,
and dump them on the table,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
and say I'm going to teach one class that
covers those three topics,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.900
well, you lose something,
because you're not going to be able

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.019
to cover everything that you did before.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.459
But you gain something because if you take
Operating Systems

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.040
and Networks together, you're naturally talking
about Distributed Systems.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.480
If you take File Systems and Databases together,
you're naturally

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.489
looking at a File System as a kind of Database,
or a Database as a kind of File System,

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.900
and I think there are ideas that come out
of that.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.439
So we wrote about it, and we called it
"The Small Footprint Curriculum in Computer

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.279
Science."

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.459
The one problem that we found ourselves with
is

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.719
that there was no natural place
to teach Data Structures.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.939
Now, this is a picture of my Ph.D. advisor,
Paul Hilfinger,

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.629
who's been teaching Data Structures at Berkley,
for quite a long time,

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.010
and I think he would be disappointed looking
at my curriculum

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.040
to see we weren't doing justice to Data Structures.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.209
The problem that we ran into, was that
most of the way Data Structures gets taught

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.859
is out its context.

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.930
Kind of one Data Structure after another.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.890
Lots of pros and cons of this implementation
versus that implementation,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.870
but mostly unmotivated.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.900
So that was stuck in my head,
okay, how are we going to get Data Structures

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.760
back
into the curriculum.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.590
At the same time, historically,
we had Complexity Science happening, and it's

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.150
a little hard to characterize exactly what
was happening,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.150
and when.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.201
This is a time line from the Wikipedia page
on Complexity Science, that gives some of

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.620
the timing
of the major events.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.750
The thing about this that was exciting
to me is that it's all relatively new.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.620
You can study a whole lot of Math and Science
at the undergraduate level before you get

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.440
past,
say, the nineteenth century.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.060
There's very little twentieth century math
and science

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.400
that you get to, until you get to grad school.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.660
But I thought there was an opportunity there
because Complexity Science, in addition to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.690
being new,
is also very accessible.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.700
I'll talk in a minute
about ways that is accessible.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.530
One of them is, there were lots of
popular nonfiction books written about Complexity.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.900
So I started building a class around that.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.400
Version one of this class was in 2005.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.190
And I started by just grabbing all the books
about this stuff, and trying to figure out

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.810
if we could find out what's there.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.120
You know, there's a certain amount of hype,
is there some substance behind it?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.590
And the other thing that I wanted to do was
start with the, start with the popular nonfiction,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.870
which usually doesn't have the technical details
in it.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.870
There's no code.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.400
There's very little mathematics.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.800
But what you can do, in the context of a class,
is start with that, and dive in deeper.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.090
So we found a number of the papers, the original
papers

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.420
on these topics.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.330
Student re-implemented
a lot of the models that were described in

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.920
those papers.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.640
So that was the first version of the class.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.990
At the end of the class,
I tried to summarize the whole thing

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.060
with what I call "the ultra-secret point of
the class."

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.310
Because for the whole semester,
we didn't really know yet

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.240
what the class was about.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.770
I kind of did the same thing
the second time around.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.490
I felt like I was playing "hide the football"
with the class for the whole semester.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.470
Because I hadn't, in my own head,
got to the point where I could explain

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.590
a coherent big picture of it was about.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.560
So I think we were having a good time,
we learned some more Python,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.380
we got some more Data Structures.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.090
We found ourselves talking
about philosophy of science quite a lot,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.530
because the models that were coming up in
Complexity Science

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.200
raised a lot of questions about
what exactly are we doing with these models?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.680
What kind of science is this?" [phone rings]
That was the second iteration of the class.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.550
The third iteration was just this past fall,
and I got to do a couple of things.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.420
One of them is, I wrote this book.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.710
I had drafted parts of it,
but I finally sat down and wrote everything

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.590
except chapter one.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.620
We used that for the class,
and what the students did over the course

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.080
of the semester was, a set of case studies,
where they worked in teams of three or four.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.550
And each of them chose a topic
that could have been a chapter in the book,

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.139
but wasn't.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.350
And they wrote the missing chapters of the
book

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.970
in the form of these case studies.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.700
And some of them are now included in the book
that you've got.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.389
So this, I thought, was a nice opportunity
to give the students a chance to do some authentic

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.020
work
and get published.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.990
In fact, I recruited a program committee to
get

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.220
other members of the faculty to do my grading
for me.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.870
So the students turned in their case studies,
I pretended I was the program chair,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.000
and sent out all the papers.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.530
The other faculty wrote reviews,
we decided which ones would be included;

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.670
which ones weren't quite ready.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.050
And then I edited in January,
and sent it to the publisher,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.040
and O'Reilly I think does a really good job
of turning books around quickly.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.180
I turned in the manuscript in January,
and I think it was available in March.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.110
Which if you've worked with other publishers,
that's pretty remarkable.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.490
And [claps hands softly]
in January, I finally sat down and wrote

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.650
what I think is the "ultra secret point of
the book",

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.770
which is the "ultra secret point of the class."

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.780
And I will now tell you what it is.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.230
Which is, I think,
the development of Complexity Science

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.060
has caused a quiet revolution in science.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.770
What I mean by that is,
what kind of activities do we mean when we

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.490
say "science."

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.790
What do we think is a good theory?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.389
If you propose an explanation for something,
what's a satisfying explanation?

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:40.300
And maybe hand in hand with that,
what's a good model of a physical system?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.620
I am going to talk about some of the
axes that I think we are moving along.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.249
And I don't mean to say
that this is black and white.

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:51.449
That it used to be a hundred percent this,
and now it's a hundred percent that,

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:55.379
but that I think the center of mass
of scientific activity is gradually shifting

00:08:55.379 --> 00:09:00.420
from your point of view, from left to right,
on each of these axes.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.079
From models of physical systems that tend
to be

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:05.990
in the form of equations,
toward things that tend to be

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.920
in the form of simulation.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.120
Away from mathematical analysis,
like symbolic computation,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.329
and toward discrete computation.

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:22.360
Continuous mathematics toward discrete mathematics;
linear models, linear systems, toward non-linear

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360
models.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.800
I'll give an example of some of these in a
minute,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.820
I don't want to go too much into details,
but I talk about it more in the book.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.259
Deterministic to stochastic,
I've also mentioned abstract and detailed

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:35.730
in the context of modeling.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:41.490
What I mean by that is a detailed model
is a realistic description of a physical system.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.279
Where I can look at the physical system,
and the elements of my model,

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.889
and there are clear analogs between them.

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:51.790
I can match them up one to one,
and I can say "yep, that's a realistic description

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.220
of the system."

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.529
And when I say abstract, I mean mostly the
opposite of that.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:02.009
It’s a more, abstracted; it's a more, less
detailed description,

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:04.209
less realistic.

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:08.250
Some of the other axes,
if you are doing analysis, if you're doing

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.279
mathematical computation,
you tend to have to limit yourself to simple

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.410
systems
that have a small number of components,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.439
and those components are usually identical.

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:19.399
With computational models,
you can often move

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:25.379
toward large numbers of components,
that can be different, heterogeneous.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:28.040
Okay, that was pretty abstract.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.579
Let me give a more concrete example.

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:36.600
So, celestial mechanics might be
the canonical example of classical science.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.459
Which I'll just use the term of classical
science,

00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:40.949
just to contrast it with, whatever the new
thing is,

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:43.129
maybe complexity science.

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:46.470
So the question is, why are planetary orbits
elliptical?

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.449
It's a natural kind of question to ask,
we'd like an explanation of that behavior.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:55.230
It turns out, if you know the law of Universal
Gravitation,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.000
you can write down a set of differential equations
that describes the motions of planets,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.700
at least for a simplified solar model, solar
system model.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:09.430
And if you now solve those differential equations,
you get ellipses, and you've explained

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.019
why those orbits are ellipses.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:16.399
And I think there's something very satisfying
about that kind of explanation.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.300
I think at least
most people find it satisfying.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:25.889
I want to offer, as a point of comparison,
this is Thomas Schelling's model of racial

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:26.889
segregation.

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:29.800
Similarly, it is motivated by a "why" question.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.060
If you look at a lot of cities,
people are segregated by race, so you might

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.420
ask "why?"

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.399
What he proposed is a model
where the people in your city have two kinds,

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:45.529
in this case, red and green,
and they all live on a two dimensional grid,

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:50.680
so that each of them has eight neighbors,
and the model of their behavior

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.569
is that they are happy
if at least a few of their neighbors are like

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:56.569
themselves.

00:11:56.569 --> 00:12:00.399
So, if two or three out of the eight are the
same color,

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.339
they're happy, and they stay put.

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:08.670
If they have fewer neighbors like themselves,
they start to feel unhappy, and they move,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:15.639
and moving in this case means just picking
a random, unoccupied cell in the grid,

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.100
and moving to it, right?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.089
So, you can characterize the agents,
in this model,

00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:25.610
as being mildly xenophobic.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.149
They don't like
to be completely surrounded by people who

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:32.339
are
not like themselves, but you probably wouldn't

00:12:32.339 --> 00:12:34.649
describe them as rabid racists.

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:39.290
Nevertheless, the outcome of system tends
to look like what's happening on the right

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:45.079
there,
where things get almost completely segregated

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:46.879
by color, in this case.

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:50.379
And in fact, this is an intermediate step
in the process.

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:54.889
If you keep running that,
it almost just becomes two great big blobs,

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:58.600
with one boundary between them,
depending on the parameters

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.199
that you tweak in the system.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:06.699
The red and green,
anybody colorblind?

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:08.689
Oh alright,
I just, I thought it funny that

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:18.329
the people who made that particular,
graph, made it as inaccessible as possible.

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:21.749
So the question is,
do you find the Newtonian explanation

00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:28.720
of elliptical orbits more satisfying
than the Schelling explanation of racial segregation?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.459
I think most people do,
but I want to poke a little bit at why.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:36.499
There are a few characteristics of classical
science

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:41.350
that make us feel good about it,
but it's not obvious that we are justified

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.670
in feeling good.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.459
So one of them is the appeal to a Universal
Law,

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:49.310
in that case we were able to invoke
Universal Gravitation and I think there's

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.569
something
about the fact that the same law

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:58.149
applies to things moving on the Earth's surface,
and also to planets moving in solar systems,

00:13:58.149 --> 00:14:05.730
that makes us feel like that law has validity,
as opposed to a law that has very narrow scope.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.079
Okay.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.959
There's a certain amount of mathematical virtuosity
that I think impresses us,

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:13.749
and makes the work seem more real.

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:16.220
I have a colleague in Physics that commonly
refers

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.930
to the sort of thing I do as
"playing with computers."

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:25.059
So, mathematics is real, playing with computers
is fun and games.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:29.329
On the other hand I don't want to bias this
too much,

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:31.199
I think that one might have been a little
bit edgy.

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:37.269
But legitimately, predictive power is something
we would like to see in a model or a theory,

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:43.410
and that was, is the great selling point
of Newton's explanation of Celestial Mechanics.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.060
We can predict solar eclipses, we can predict
all sort of things that are going to happen.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.939
That's not as true of Schelling's model.

00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:54.019
and "proofiness."

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:57.040
It feels like we've just done
a mathematical proof.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.869
Now, I would say, it's not a proof.

00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:03.329
We can't prove
a thing about actual physical systems.

00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:08.920
We can proove things about mathematical abstractions,
and we might hope that the proof

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.040
about mathematical abstractions is analogous
to something in the real world, but that part's

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.870
just a hope.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.740
On the flip side, thinking about Schelling's
model,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.170
the obvious characteristic of Schelling's
model

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.519
is that you've just described human beings
by a set of rules,

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:29.860
that says "I'm going to count the number
of my neighbors and be happy

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.309
or unhappy depending on that count."

00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:36.579
Most sociologists would not be happy
with the reduction that you just made

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:38.279
of human behavior.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.489
The other,
as I mentioned, is that you're just

00:15:40.489 --> 00:15:42.769
playing with computers.

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:48.369
And the last is, if models like this
can't make detailed predictions,

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:51.699
that allow us to validate whether
the model is correct or not,

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:55.929
then what kind of work can they do?

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:58.989
So this is the framework that I use
when I teach the class,

00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:02.839
and it appears in the book as well,
I think this is a general model

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:07.049
of a lot of what we do when we
model the world, which describes

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.889
scientific activity,
but I would also argue

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:12.269
it describes how we think.

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:17.449
Most of our thinking of the world
is in models like this where we have

00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:22.889
some physical system that we can observe,
we have either direct or indirect sensory

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:24.869
data.

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:30.079
We then construct a model,
sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly,

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:35.209
that is an abstraction of the real thing,
meaning that we've left out details.

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:38.619
The nice thing about the model though,
is that, unlike the real world,

00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:43.790
we can write proofs in models,
we can do analysis of models,

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.989
we can run simulations of models.

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:50.009
What you get out of that are predictions
and explanations that you can

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:55.680
then compare to whatever it was that you saw
in the physical system, and get some

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.149
kind of validation out of that.

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:06.900
This is the framework
at least that I propose to my students.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.000
And then we can ask, what kind of work
does Schelling's model do?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.120
It's not a proof.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.670
It has very little predictive power.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.300
I can't tell you, I can't use Schelling's
model

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.170
to tell you how segregated Boston
will be in the future.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.020
But what it does provide is,
kind of a logical argument.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.450
It's an existence proof,
or a kind of counter example

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.650
to the assumption
that if you see segregation in a city,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.630
that the people who live there
must be racist.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.310
That the only explanation of segregation
is racist agents.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.010
So the claim, I think,
that Schelling would make is that this

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.480
might be sufficient to cause segregation,
but it's not necessary.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.810
You don't have to actually have people behaving
like this in order to see

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.620
segregation as the outcome.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.830
And what that means is that
that segregation,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:07.840
the fact that city seems to be racist,
could be an emergent property.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.160
Meaning that the system as a whole has that
property,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.210
but the components do not.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:19.530
The individual agents might not be racist.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.010
I want to give one other example
of this kind of model, because I think

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.190
a couple of examples will help
us think about it.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.400
I'm going to talk about
the Six Degrees experiment

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.530
that Stanley Milgram ran.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.790
How many people are familiar with Stanley
Milgram?

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.400
Okay, if you're not,
I highly encourage you to find out more about

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400
him.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.930
I think he's fascinating in part
because he ran two out of the three

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.270
most infamous experiments in all of social
science.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.370
One of them, that I just think you have to
read about

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.140
if you haven't, is his study
of obedience to authority.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.500
This is the original, one of the original
deceptive, social behavior experiments

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.180
where he brought people in,
and told them they were participating

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.760
in a teaching and learning experiment,
where they would act as a teacher,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.570
and the "learner" on the other side of the
glass

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.980
was actually an actor.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.730
And the subjects were told to administer
electric shocks whenever the "learner"

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.860
got the answer wrong.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.930
And they would start out
by giving a fifteen volt shock,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.990
and work their way up a board,
to four hundred fifty volts.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.950
And what would happen,
as you went from fifteen to four hundred fifty;

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.310
two things would happen:
one, the warning labels on the board,

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.640
would say things like mild shock,
severe shock, hazard, warning, danger,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.580
I don't remember exactly what it was,
but it was increasingly dramatic.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.000
Yellow and black, diamond and stripes,
everything.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.360
Also, the actor on the other side
of the glass, would go from saying things

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.680
like "ow",
or "hey stop that" to "I'm having a heart

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:03.040
attack, please stop!"
to silence [hesitant chuckles] at one point.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.540
The nature of the experiment was
to how far up the board people would be willing

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.660
to go under different circumstances.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:16.070
And, some of the circumstances, for example,
would be the "investigator" in a lab coat,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:21.520
also an actor, standing behind the subject
and saying things like "You must continue,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.250
the experiment requires you to continue."

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.350
And you probably see where the punch line
of this is going, which is that many people

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.240
will go much farther up the board
than you would like to believe about human

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240
nature.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.640
In fact, something like six--in some conditions,
I forget the exact details, something

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.760
like sixty percent of the subjects
went all the way to four hundred and fifty

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.200
volts,
and were asking for more.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
And--

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.080
&gt;&gt; Male speaker 2: I think it was when
the authority assumed, said that they were

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.670
assuming all responsibility.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.011
&gt;&gt;Allen: Yeah, you're right.

00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:54.740
And there were
different scripts and different layouts

00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:00.090
of whether they could see the authority,
or whether they could see the learner, and

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.330
so on.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.760
Fascinating stuff, especially because no one
will ever be allowed to run that experiment

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760
again.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760
[laughter]

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.550
&gt;&gt;Allen: Institutional review boards
were pretty much created,

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.260
they should be called
the Stanley Milgram Memorial Institutional

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.770
Review Boards.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.770
[laughter]

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.540
&gt;&gt;Allen: Anyway, fascinating stuff.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.140
Read
more about it if you're not already familiar

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.140
with it.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.900
The other experiment that he did, that is
the one that I'm

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.300
going to talk a little bit about is
"The Small World" experiment, where he wanted

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.930
to investigate the structure of social networks
by seeing whether he could get a package delivered

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.150
across the country, following only social
hops.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:41.570
So, I think he, they started in Wichita, Kansas,
and they had a couple of different targets,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.830
one of them was a stockbroker in Sharon, Massachusetts.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.540
My father was a stockbroker in Sharon, Massachusetts,
but not the target of the Milgram experiment.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.540
[laughter]

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.130
&gt;&gt; Allen: The idea was that
Milgram, or one of his associates

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.030
would give a package to someone and say, "I
want you to deliver this to

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.980
this person" and they would be given
the name, occupation, and where they lived,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.820
but the rules are you can only give this
to someone that you know personally.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.220
So, if you know the target personally,
you can just go give it to them, and you're

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.030
done,
and otherwise you have to give it to someone

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.340
that you know personally.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.430
What he wanted to know was,
how many hops it would take to get from Wichita

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.600
to Sharon, Massachusetts.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.730
And this graph shows the distribution
of hops for the packages that were delivered.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.000
Now, not all of the packages were delivered,
so there's a bias behind this, and that's

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.660
been the subject of a lot of discussion
but the interesting thing about this is

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.040
that the mode is at six.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.360
It took six hops
most often to get from source to destination,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.340
and that's where the six degrees of separation
term

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.310
comes from, alright?

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.730
So at the time, very little was known
about the structure of social networks,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.700
since then, it's been the subject of a lot
of study,

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:10.830
and we have several good explanations
of why the diameter of these social graphs

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.740
seems to be so much shorter than you would
expect.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.960
So that's the good thing that we have lots
of explanations.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.880
The bad thing is
we have too many explanations,

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.930
and they're incompatible.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.510
So, there are two models
that people have proposed

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:30.740
simplified topologies that capture
important elements of social networks.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.580
Watts and Strogatz had what they
call a Small World Graph, which is a parameterized

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.890
graph
between a completely regular graph on one

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.400
end,
and a completely random graph on the other,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.310
and what they find is a sweet spot in the
middle

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:50.080
that behaves like social networks,
in the sense that it is highly clustered,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.660
meaning that your friends tend to know each
other,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.700
but also has a small diameter,
meaning that it has this small world behavior.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.950
So that's one possible explanation.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.220
The other is Barabasi and Albert's model,
which is a scale free network.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.130
The way you build one of these is
by growing it.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.200
So if you start out with one,
or a small number of nodes,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.850
and gradually add nodes,
with the property of preferential attachment,

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:19.120
meaning the rich get richer,
and/or don't go as fast,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.350
what you get is a high,
a long tailed distribution of degree

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.130
in the network.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.520
Most people have
a small number of friends,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.270
but there are a few people
who have a very large number of friends.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.330
That graph also has the Small World Property,
and so now, if you're trying to explain

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:44.580
the Small World Property,
you don't know which explanation is right.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.730
This is part of the reason
in my class that I found myself inevitably

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.900
talking
about philosophy of science,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.890
because we just left the world of doing science,
building models,

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.390
and using them to predict, explain and design.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.350
What we're now talking about is
theory choice.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.940
Why should I
prefer one model, or theory,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.360
over another?

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:12.150
And so that led us to Thomas Kuhn,
who wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.380
which is probably his most famous book.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.930
If you're not familiar with that book in particular,
you're almost certainly familiar with

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.060
Paradigm Shifts.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.090
That book introduced
that term.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.290
So all the bad jokes
about paradigm shifts that we've had

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:30.650
for the last, let's see,
since 1963 or 4.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.220
You can
blame Thomas Kuhn for that

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.910
particular piece of vocabulary.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.960
He also wrote an essay called
"Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice"

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.470
which is explicitly about the situation
we were just talking about.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.640
Two competing models,
in some sense they both explain the data,

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.810
so you can't choose one over the other
purely in terms of how well it fits data.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.780
There have to be other criteria,
and that's exactly what he explains.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.580
Well, what are those other criteria?

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.270
Both descriptively,
like if we watch scientists

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.430
and listen to what they say,
what are the criteria that they seem

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.070
to be applying?

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.290
And also normatively, which is,
which of those criteria do we think

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.090
are justified?

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.690
And which might be biased?

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.660
One of the reasons that the class
inevitably ends up in philosophy was...

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:28.030
explained nicely by xkcd, which found
that the structure of information,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:33.520
at least as represented by Wikipedia,
has a tendency to lead inevitably to philosophy.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.830
And this came out by the experiment
that if you take any article,

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.810
and click on the first link,
and repeat that process,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.620
you will eventually end up at "Philosophy."
if you haven't read that cartoon,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:50.410
I recommend it to you.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.560
so I took some of the things
that we were talking about in the class,

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.440
and made them into a running theme throughout
the book.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.990
So each chapter tends to raise a different
issue

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.650
in philosophy of science, and then I tried
to

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.320
write a little bit about it, just enough
to introduce what I thought were interesting

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.470
questions
and hopefully point you to toward more reading.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.680
I mentioned Theory Choice as one of the first
topics

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.730
that comes up.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.400
The Demarcation problem is one of the others.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.950
The Demarcation problem is, is there a justified
definition

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.160
of science that lets us distinguish between
things

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.660
that are real science, good science,
and other things like pseudo-science, or,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.850
that
seem that like they might be sciencey, but

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.010
they're not?

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.770
Or say, religion, things that are not science
at all,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:42.080
but how do we clearly, justify that definition?

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.740
Realism and instrumentalism comes up quite
a lot.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:50.110
This is, this pertains to how we interpret
the theories and models that we're using

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.460
to describe physical systems.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.370
I won't say too much
about that now, I'm going to come back to

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.080
it
just a little bit later.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.460
Holism and reductionism was one of the other
topics

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.460
that comes up.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.400
Again I won't say too much about that
right now.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.880
But I will come back to as I said,
the ultra secret point of this book.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:15.070
I started with this set of axes,
at the beginning,

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:21.530
and I speculate, or at least my thesis
that we are living through a transition

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.580
toward a new kind of science.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.060
I'm kind of borrowing that phrase
from Steven Wolfram,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.650
but I mean it in a different sense then he
does.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.650
So, I'm going to have to violate
his trademark on that phrase.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:38.920
He is primarily talking about, well,
actually tell you what, if you want

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.780
to know what Wolfram is saying
when he says new kind of science,

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.340
ask me after, let's not go down that.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.890
What I mean by it is just
what I was saying before,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.410
the shift along these axes
in what we think is science; what we think

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:55.260
is a good model; what we think
is a satisfying kind of explanation; what

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.780
we think is good work for a scientist to do.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.570
I think there are some other shifts going
on at the same time

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.850
that are related.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:10.840
One of them is what kind of work
do we want models to do?

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.200
With the Newton example,
and the Schelling example, I wanted to show

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.250
what I think is a shift for models that are
primarily meant to be predictive.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.260
They were often
tools that we would use as computational devices,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.490
for making predictions that had practical
consequences.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.620
I think there's a shift toward models
that may be explanatory without necessarily

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.970
having predictive property.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.400
I mentioned realism and instrumentalism,
alright, let me finally say what I mean by

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400
that.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.440
Let me throw out an idea.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.760
Are electrons real?

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.400
By a common language use of the word real?

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.120
Alright, so I think we would all buy, or at
least

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.400
I'll ask you to accept, that chair is real.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.400
Okay?

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.510
Unicorns are not real.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:03.380
So on that axis of real/not real,
[laughter] what's your feeling about electrons?

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:08.000
&gt;&gt;male speaker 2: Not real.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
[muffled laughter]

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.270
&gt;&gt;Allen: Not real?

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.645
&gt;&gt;male speaker 2: They are merely an abstraction.

00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:14.820
&gt;&gt;Allen: They might be a useful abstraction,
and you can

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.090
certainly take that view.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.460
That would be an instrumentalist
interpretation of a theory involving electrons.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.170
Now, here's a trivial thing that you can do
with that theory,

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.880
electrons, for historical reasons,
have negative charge.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.750
You could imagine a whole new
physics of the world where you just flip the

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.400
science
of everything.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.440
Okay?

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.630
That new physics would be just
as good as the old physics, except that electrons,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.780
in some sense would be different.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.880
They would have positive charge.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.840
And it's clear that you haven't done any work
by doing that transition,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.840
but it does suggest that the entities that
make up your model

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.780
are in, some sense, arbitrary.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.370
I could have...

00:30:54.370 --> 00:31:00.260
&gt;&gt;male speaker 2: The charge is arbitrary,
the numbers arbitrary [unintelligible]

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.260
&gt;&gt;Allen: Yeah.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.610
Right, so in that case,
I haven't really done much,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.590
but I could imagine another physics
that postulated a different

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.770
set of entities.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.330
More different
than just positive and negative charge.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.550
And that other physics might be
just as good as what we currently call physics.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.660
It's not easy to make one up as a good example
but it's at least imaginable.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.390
Anyway, that discussion would take
you down the road toward talking about

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.550
realism and instrumentalism.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.780
the other one is reductionism and holism.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.000
I'm torn about how far to get into that one.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.320
Hofstadter talks about this in Gödel, Escher
and Bach.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.730
This is one of his figures
that I kind of like because it's a nice

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:47.710
way to think of things that you would interpret
differently at different scales.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.050
And that's
related to reductionism and holism.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.680
I think
I'm going to punt on that for now, but we'll

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.380
give you chance to talk about it later if
you want to.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.940
If there's a new kind of science going on
here,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.630
one could imagine there'd be a new kind of
engineering

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.630
that goes with it.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.110
And I think there is.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.940
These, again, are some of the axes where I
think

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.820
we're shifting over time.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.860
Away from engineered systems
that tended to be centralized toward decentralized

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.910
systems.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:21.650
Isolation, interaction what I mean by that
is, that in a lot

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.990
of engineering design, if you want to build
something complex,

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.950
that involves many subsystems, you want to
be able

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:33.700
to design each subsystem in isolation
without having to worry about all the others

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.490
at the same time.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.430
In the context of, software, this is often
described in terms

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:43.610
of abstraction and encapsulation, but it's
a fundamental idea through all of engineering,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.320
that if every component of your system depends
on every other component, you very quickly

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.330
won't
be able to design anything.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.440
It will collapse
under the weight of its own complexity.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:00.570
But that's increasingly, I won't say not true,
I'll say less true that we now have more

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.910
tools for dealing with complexity, and that
allows us to relax a little bit the requirement

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.559
that everything be very carefully isolated.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:13.870
We can design things that have more interacting
components now, and still be able to manage

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.460
that.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:22.100
One of the ways of managing that is to replace
classical analysis with computation.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.320
You can design
more complicated things if you throw

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.410
more computational power at it.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.980
One example of that,
does anybody know what that building is?

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.211
&gt;&gt;male speaker 2: The Guggenheim Museum...

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:34.211
&gt;&gt;Allen: The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain.

00:33:34.211 --> 00:33:35.211
Who designed it?

00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:36.390
&gt;&gt; male speaker 2: Frank Gehry

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.870
&gt;&gt;Allen: Anything else around here also designed
by Frank Gehry?

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.870
[laughter]

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.350
&gt;&gt;Allen: Stata center.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.350
Is it Stah-ta or state-a?

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.350
&gt;&gt;Male speaker 3: Stahta

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.350
&gt;&gt;Male speaker 4: State-a, I think.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.350
&gt;&gt;Allen: Okay.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.190
&gt;&gt;Male speaker 4: The guy's name is State-a,
but the people who work there call it

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.450
Stah-ta Center.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.710
&gt;&gt;Allen: Interesting.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.710
Okay.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.710
[Laughter]

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.070
&gt;&gt;Allen: So, one of the reasons they were
able to build

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.360
that thing is that they used CAD software
that had been

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.350
developed for designing boats, and Gehry's
innovation

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.310
was to apply it to buildings.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.670
It would not have been
possible or feasible to design or build that

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.540
prior to the
availability of that software, in the same

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.879
way it wasn't
feasible to design or build the Eiffel Tower

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:16.349
prior to
Eiffel's development of analytic techniques

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:20.650
for designing and analyzing those types of
structures.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.369
The other piece of this that I think
is interesting is that, I think, increasingly

00:34:24.369 --> 00:34:30.080
we will search for engineering solutions,
rather than design them.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.210
And maybe
I'll just leave it at that.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:38.220
One more piece of this, so I'm speculating
on a new kind of science, a new kind of modeling,

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.679
a new kind of engineering, and here's a new
kind

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.179
of thinking.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:47.540
Which is, I think, our fascination with
Aristotelian logic will gradually fade, and

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.460
be
replaced by some kind of multi-valued logic.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.720
Being kind of a Bayesian myself, I'm
biased toward Bayesianism as my favorite

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.250
multi-valued logic.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.150
But that inevitably
takes you on the road from imagining that

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:07.840
your scientific theories are objective,
or that your beliefs about the world are objective,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:14.510
toward acknowledging that they're subjective,
and if they are, then what?

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:19.830
Subjectivity seems like a dangerous slope
toward pure relativism, you know,

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.520
what's true is true for me, what's true for
you

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.760
is true for you, and we can't talk to each
other.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:31.670
That, doesn't seem to be the case, so it raises
the question can we have subjectivity without

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.050
complete collapse?

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:36.080
A couple of other shifts that I think are
going on,

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.920
away from thinking of scientific theories
in terms

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:44.310
of Universal Physical Laws, more toward theories
and models.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:50.130
I would argue that there's no meaningful difference
between a theory and a model, that when you

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.550
tell me that you're,
that you have a theory, what you're really

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:57.450
doing
is recommending a model to me.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.690
And the language that
we would use for choosing one of those models

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.920
again goes back to subjectivity and theory
choice.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.600
The discussion that Kuhn brings up.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.619
And the last is away from determinism and
into indeterminism.

00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:16.990
So, I kinda blew through
a lot of this, in part, because, me standing

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.900
up here,
and talking about it, is not the most effective

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.900
thing.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.810
I, part of the reason that I wrote this down,
is that I think it's better to read a careful

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.470
exposition
of it, than to get the thoughts off the top

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.430
of my head.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.400
But more importantly, what you really need
to do

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.020
is wrestle with the stuff.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.369
So just reading what I think
isn't going to get you very far,

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:41.310
what I really want you to do is is pick up
the book,

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.630
and do some of the exercises, and, as I'll
talk about in a minute,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.820
I wanna get you to write a, a case study.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.000
but just to finish off a couple of thoughts
here,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.030
I hope you'll read the book.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:59.050
I think the Complexity
Science stuff might be fun for you, and I

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.020
think
parts of it are probably familiar to each

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.200
i, each of you,
but it's unlikely that all of you are familiar

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.430
with all of it.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.430
So there might be some good stuff there.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.400
The philosophy of science might be new to
you,

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.680
unless that's a hobby of yours.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.070
The analysis
of algorithm stuff is probably not that new

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.060
to many of you, at least the software engineers.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.540
And similarly, intermediate Python; those
are two topics that suited my class that may,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.350
or may not
be the most important to you.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.960
Alright, the case studies!

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.050
So I mentioned that the students worked on
case studies,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.040
and we picked the best ones, and then we published
them.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.230
We're planning to do the same thing with the
next edition

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.290
of the book.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:43.170
So if you're familiar with the cookbook,
books, that O'Reilly does.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:47.120
So the Python cookbook, for example,
they collected a bunch of short articles,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.730
where someone would explain a recurring problem,
and give a solution to it, and explain the

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:53.730
alternatives.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.980
They published a bunch of them and then there's
a webpage

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.710
that collects submissions, and then every
once in a while,

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.190
they seem to collect all the good ones off
the webpage,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.500
and that becomes the next edition of the book.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500
[coughing]

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.940
So, we're thinking of something similar,
just because there's so much good stuff here,

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.400
and I didn't want to, and couldn't, cram it
all into the book,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.710
so I've left some for my students,
and they've left some for you.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:25.550
Some of the ones they've done so far,
this is an ant trail model, which is another

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.550
agent based model.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:31.490
We have a very simple model of ant behavior
here, their decisions

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.780
whether they will turn left or right, and
how they propagate out

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.210
from the nest.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:40.830
The interesting thing about that model is
that a very simple system reproduces trails

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:45.200
that are
at least qualitatively similar actual ant

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.620
trails,
but maybe more interestingly, different species

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.980
of ants,
have different foraging patterns, and if you

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.120
track them,
and look at the shape of those trails, they

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.490
have distinctive texture,
to them.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:05.970
You could look at them and visually identify
which species it was, by the structure of

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.340
those trails.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.890
This model has a few perimeters that you can
turn

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.120
that will make the trails look like species
one, or species two,

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.150
or species three, depending on how you tweak
it.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.890
So, it's a nice model.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:25.410
Slime molds are another classic,
agent based model where the emergent behavior

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.000
of the system,
is different in character from the behavior

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.250
of the individual agents,
and surprising.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:39.619
And the surprising-ness might be
an important characteristic of emergent properties.

00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:43.840
Another student project looked at the distribution
of wealth.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.240
It's common observation that in a lot
of economic systems, the distribution of wealth

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.510
quickly becomes long tailed.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:54.000
That seems to be hard
to avoid, and hard to fix.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.670
The system tends
to gravitate to those long tailed distributions,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.370
and you might wonder why.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:04.280
Sugarscape is, again,
a very abstract, very not realistic model

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.430
of an "economy" of a kind.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.220
A sugar economy.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.230
but it develops long tailed distributions
in ways, that I think, can be explanatory.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.600
A knot in Wikipedia, if you have a directed
graph,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.810
and you follow links through the graph, you
might

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:24.090
find that you've arrived in a neighborhood
that you can no longer get out of.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.690
[laughter]
And so the students were searching to see

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.960
whether
a directed graph created by Wikipedia

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.000
has knots in it.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.710
Norms game, is related to iterated prisoner's
dilemma.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.609
And then I had one student that took on a
very

00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:44.610
ambitious project that didn't quite get to
the finish line,

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.450
that's not in the book, but they did a lot
of very cool stuff,

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.600
with the evolution of virtual creatures.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:56.250
So the creatures
would have a genotype, that would describe

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:01.210
their phenotype
in a simulated three-dimensional environment.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:06.369
And so, you would
evolve them over time, by having them interact

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:09.330
in this simulated 3D world.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.990
Have some kind of fitness contest
to see who gets to be represented in the next

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:17.170
generation,
and then follow the gene pool over time.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.960
What they discovered,
and lots of people have built versions of

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.760
this, is that the animals
discover lots of innovative solutions to problems

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.950
like,
gathering food, and hitting each other,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.160
and locomotion and things like that.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.230
Including the ability
to exploit bugs in your simulation of the

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.230
3D world.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.230
[laughter]

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.740
&gt;&gt;male speaker 4: They discover magic.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.870
&gt;&gt;Allen: That's right, they discover magic.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.300
[laughter]
One of the things that they discovered was

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.950
that there was an error in the boundary condition
so that

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.770
if you were, if your critter was very close
to the boundary,

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:55.500
and kind of moving back and forth across the
boundary of the world,

00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.270
it would start translating along one of the
axes much faster than

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.850
anything else in the world could move, and
they kind of discovered

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.690
the transporter, and animals were exploiting
it.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.570
And when they were running away from something,
they would head

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.170
for the boundary, and then zip along.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.520
[laughter]

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:22.090
Okay, just a couple of thoughts about things
I'm currently working on.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:26.780
In seven days, I need to turn in the manuscript
of Think Python,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.090
and they're going to try and turn it around
and make it available by July, so we'll see

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.600
how all that goes.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.080
This is the second draft of the cover.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.230
I have to tell you a little bit of the story
of the cover.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.810
You might know that O'Reilly puts animals
on all the covers

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.560
and a lot of people have wondered, who gets
to choose

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.780
the animals.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:51.310
They actually have a person
who works full time; that’s her job; she

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:52.950
picks the animals.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.859
[laughter]
And they tell you, if you're an author,

00:42:54.859 --> 00:42:57.760
they tell you very explicitly don't try to
pick your animal.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.520
We don't want to hear it.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.470
The most input that you get is that if you
can give a few words

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.520
that describe the character of your book,
that will help

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.810
the animal chooser choose your animal.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:14.700
Although for my books, so far,
they haven't even asked me for adjectives,

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.140
they've just
given me an animal.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.590
Now, I've been happy so far.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.891
I've got
an Archerfish on the statistics book, which

00:43:20.891 --> 00:43:23.240
is a really cool,
I don't know if you know about the Archerfish,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.810
but it has
a little groove in its throat and it shoots

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:31.440
a jet of water,
out of the water, and it hits insects.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.240
So if an insect
is out on a branch, it will shoot this jet

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.840
of water, knock it
off the branch into the water,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.900
and then the Archerfish swims over and eats
it.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:44.090
And it turns out that it can shoot out of
the water hit things

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:48.630
about two meters away with high accuracy,
sorta, you know, insect size

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.120
precision, despite the fact that its eyes
are underwater

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.570
and it’s going out into air, so it’s got
the refraction at the surface of the water,

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.790
that throws off,
so it compensates for refraction and hits

00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:59.790
things.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.800
So cool animal,
really happy with that.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.820
This is, I believe, a Black Eagle,
now I forget, it's on the last page

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.720
of the book so if you want to look it up.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.680
So, okay, it doesn't shoot water or anything,
but [laughter] it's, it's cool enough.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.190
The Python book, the first draft of the cover
came back

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.540
with, all together now.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.950
&gt;&gt;[all together] A python!

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.210
&gt;&gt;Allen: A python.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:25.770
Just like almost every other Python book,
with a couple of exceptions, so I wrote back

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.410
and said,
"The Python's fine, and if you want to go

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.980
with that,
no problem, but Python, the programming language,

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.730
is named
after Monty Python.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:38.070
It's not named after the snake, so
every time someone puts a python on the cover

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.140
of a Python book,
you're basically saying, “we didn't get

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:49.250
the joke."[laughter]
So, so here's a suggestion, can we put a dead

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.320
parrot on the cover?"

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.320
[loud laughter]

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.250
&gt;&gt;male speaker 5: A Norwegian blue.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.330
&gt;&gt;Allen: A Norwegian blue, exactly right.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:00.590
So, and the only thing
I had to say was, the text at the end of the

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.619
book
that describes the animal that's on the cover,

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:06.000
I said, "Look, if you'll please put a parrot
on the cover,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.260
you could have a lot of fun with the text
at the end because

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.120
you could basically lift lines out of the
sketch, 'A Norwegian blue,

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.000
beautiful plumage isn't it?'

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.020
That kind of thing."

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.150
So they went along with it, I believe this
is not actually

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.100
a Norwegian Blue Parrot, because there's no
such thing.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.430
[laughter]
But as far as I'm concerned, that's a Norwegian

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.940
Blue Parrot.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.840
[laughter] I haven't yet, I haven't seen the
text that they've

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.460
written yet, but I'm going to try to convince
them

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:38.940
to actually say it's a Norwegian Blue Parrot
and see if people get it.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.150
Projects that are up next, is anybody familiar
with The Little Book of Semaphores?

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.720
I don't know if that's crossed
anybody's path.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:50.010
I wrote a book a number of years ago
where I took all the fun, synchronization

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:54.710
puzzles, like
readers/writers, but also the Santa Claus

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.540
problem, Dining Philosophers,
what are the other fun ones?

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.540
There's Dining Savages.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.880
If you took an operating systems class, you
might have done one of these.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.350
&gt;&gt;male speaker 6: The Banker?

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.350
&gt;&gt;Allen: Which one?

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.921
&gt;&gt;male speaker 6: The Banker?

00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:09.200
&gt;&gt;Allen: Oh yeah, now that's the deadlock
one, right?

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.340
&gt;&gt;male speaker 6: Yeah.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.470
&gt;&gt;Allen: Yeah, no, I didn't do a lot with
deadlock,

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.859
but anyway, collected a bunch of synchronization
puzzles,

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:20.220
and I'm thinking of turning that into a book
called

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.160
Think Synch, and I'm also thinking about linear
Algebra.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.190
So there might be a Think Linear, at some
point.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:31.910
If you want to follow the progress, [clears
throat]

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:34.630
Green Tea Press, is me.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:38.190
Green Tea Press is where
I publish the first drafts of all my books.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.640
And then see if I can find a publisher that
that wants to work with them.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.070
But while I am
developing them, they're all available under

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.190
free
licenses.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:50.550
For a while I was using Gnu Free Documentation
License, lately I've been using a lot of the

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.660
Creative
Commons licenses, but the nice thing is that

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.410
you can
modify these books; you can translate them

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.920
into other languages;
you can pull chapters out of several different

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.960
books and
and recombine them.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.270
So there a lot of cool projects
that I think come from making material available

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:08.680
like that.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.980
The Python book, that is the origin of the
Statistics book,

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.960
and the Complexity book was originally a Java
book,

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.540
that somebody else translated from Java into
Python, and sent

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:28.050
it back to me, and I actually learned Python
by reading my own book.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:31.820
[laughter] Which was very strange.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:37.910
[laughter] Because I recognized
my writing [laughter] but it was telling me

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:39.660
things I didn't know.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.500
[laughter] And it's kind of like those time
travel plots [xylophone sounds]

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.740
where you from the future comes and tells
you things.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.720
That's exactly [laughter]
So I've had that experience.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:54.640
So, yes, check out the free books,
read Think Complexity, write a case study.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.740
I think that's all I wanted to talk about
for now,

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:01.390
but I'm happy to take questions, or hear comments,
or.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:08.180
&gt;&gt;male speaker 7: My question is, that I have
to interview new candidates

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.040
at Google, often around, you know, algorithms
and complexity.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.750
Do you have good questions, because you know,
most of them are banned now.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.750
&gt;&gt;Allen: Right.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.730
[laughter] I'll have to think about that,
because this, we're taking a kind of different

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.490
approach
to it, and that might actually lend itself

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:30.230
to the next generation of algorithm design
questions.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.640
Cause, it used to be kind of a test of the
canon,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.599
there, how much of Corn, Mueller, Silver and
Ruest have you absorbed

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:42.430
and can deliver on request?

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.530
Usually applied in non-trivial
ways, so I mean, the thing I like about the

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.770
questions is
a lot of what you learn by memorizing the

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:51.930
data structures book,
you might not be able to apply in flexible

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.580
ways to a new problem.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.030
I think that is what interview questions are
really testing so

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.770
I think that's the good part.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:03.630
But, I'm kinda, I'm getting away from this
canonical idea that you have to know three

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:08.010
kinds leveling,
balancing, self-balancing treatise, or that

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:11.290
you have to know
five implementations of a queue and all the

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.800
pros and cons
of them.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.119
&gt;&gt;male speaker 8: That's because we design
by search now.

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:19.119
&gt;&gt;Allen: Because we design by search, yeah.

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:20.849
So, I mean,
I think there is a different tool kit now,

00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:22.730
and a different
set of knowledge.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:28.690
I think there are a number of sufficiently
solved problems that we kinda don't really

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.550
need to think much
about their implementations, at least a very

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.390
small number
of people will, the vast majority of us will

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:39.510
now work above
that level of abstraction, so let's put some

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:41.790
of that stuff aside
and thing about what are the interesting and

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:45.840
hard questions
now at that level.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.390
But I don't have any great ones
off the top of my head, but I love the question.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:54.849
&gt;&gt; David: You talked about moving from,
the predictive to the explanatory,

00:49:54.849 --> 00:49:56.070
&gt;&gt;Allen: Um hmm.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.650
&gt;&gt;David: But we still need predictions.

00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.820
&gt;&gt;Allen: Sure

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.120
&gt;&gt;David: Even in the complex worlds, in true
learning

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120
new things.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120
&gt;&gt;Allen: Sure.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.120
&gt;&gt;David: If it's true science is moving from
here to there,

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.790
but I take it you're saying, we're evil if
we move over here

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:14.691
to discover more new things per decade, than
if we just stayed where

00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:24.090
we were, where we kind of mind, the kind of
things that gave us [unintelligible] mechanics,

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.090
&gt;&gt;Allen: Yes.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.700
&gt;&gt;David: But in truth, you're giving us a
model of science,

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.540
you're saying we're likely to get more discoveries
per decade

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.270
if we move over here, but we need a prediction
about how many more?

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.950
For example, if I had one of these scale free
networks graphs,

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.510
and I build the largest social networks in
the world,

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:44.740
is that worth one hundred billion dollars?
[laughter]

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:50.160
&gt;&gt;Allen: So yes, we still need models that
are capable of prediction,

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.090
I think, when I'm describing that shift, I
think two things are going on.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:51:01.119
One of them is we are relaxing the requirement
that every model be predictive, and admitting

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:04.530
that there can be good science
at the other end of the spectrum.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:09.680
That, if, there's lots of good work
to be done there, even if we relax the requirement

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.109
to be predictive.
and the other is that we can be a little more

00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:20.310
fearless
about attacking large, complex, heterogeneous

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.110
systems that,
I think for a long time we would have avoided

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.760
because we knew we wouldn't be
able to make any progress on them, with the

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.830
tools that we had.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.110
Now, with a different set of tools, we can
start to attack

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.230
a bigger set of problems.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.230
Yeah?

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.369
&gt;&gt;male speaker 10: I had a question about
the trend towards instrumentalism.

00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:36.369
&gt;&gt;Allen: Mm hmm.

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:37.369
&gt;&gt;male speaker 10: When we talked about does
as electrons exist,

00:51:37.369 --> 00:51:40.550
I was kind of reminded of this Xeno School
of Paradoxes.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.660
One of the paradoxes was the millet paradox,
right?

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.290
&gt;&gt;Allen: I don't think I know that.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:51.720
&gt;&gt;male speaker 10: Why does a bag of millet
when dropped make a sound, when a single pellet

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.820
of millet when dropped, does not make a sound.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.920
You know, I think this talk both to their
summation

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.530
and their use of perception as a means of
determining

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:02.530
reality.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.520
All right, so the Greeks said "well, sound
doesn't exist

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.570
unless my ear can actually hear it."

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.260
Right, an electron,
in my understanding is, it's real in the sense

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.519
of you you can prove
what is it, the Thompson's experiment, the

00:52:15.519 --> 00:52:20.359
thing about the droplets moving
at these discrete velocities, and that there's

00:52:20.359 --> 00:52:21.859
a quantized charge.

00:52:21.859 --> 00:52:26.859
And so, one can assign quantification of that,
like are we moving

00:52:26.859 --> 00:52:31.070
towards a trend of other things being considered
like, rayified,

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:36.060
like traffic jam or some type of common phenomenon
as some sort of real, ya know,

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.810
as part of your paradigm shift?

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.190
&gt;&gt;Allen: Right, Okay.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.970
So I think, so the Xeno example
is one of those cases where

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:50.500
the two endpoints are clear, and, but something
must change in the middle, but we have a really

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.930
hard time saying where it changed in the middle,
and I think

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:57.160
realism and instrumentalism has that character
as well.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:02.550
There are some examples where the vast majority
of us feel entirely comfortable saying,

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.550
"Yup, that's real."

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.390
At the other end
of the spectrum, things that we all, at least

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:10.820
have a consensus,
that they're not, something in the middle,

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.920
there has
to be a transition somewhere in the middle.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.760
Where do we put it?

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:26.240
One way to resolve that is to say,
is to accept as real, any entity postulated

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.580
by a theory that we use.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.599
So if it's a good theory,
then the entities that it postulates are real.

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:37.020
In other words, you just expand the space
of what you're willing to call real,

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.000
to make the conflict go away.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.800
The other is
to go all the way to instrumentalism,

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:48.410
and say that all of our theories are tools
that we use to explain stuff, and we're not

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:51.980
obligated
to consider any of our hypostulated entities

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.460
as real.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:59.240
Even things that seem even obviously real,
like nice firm objects,

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.050
which at the Mezzo scale of physics, have
nice reality to them,

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:09.840
but if you go to very small scales, that starts
to get fuzzy.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.400
Now with nice solid objects, I think we have
a hard time with it.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.210
One of the examples I like to use is mushrooms.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:18.210
When when you look at a mushroom, what you're
actually

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:22.380
looking at is this fruiting body of a fungus.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.660
And that thing
that's discrete and we pick up and eat, seems

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.360
to have nice
realness to it.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:36.510
But that organism, that you just harvested,
is actually a very fine network of cells that

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:38.190
is mostly underground.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:41.400
The underground part might be hundreds or
thousands, or millions of times

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.750
more massive than the thing you just picked
up.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:49.859
So in the sense of being big,
and concrete, it's real, but it's also

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:52.450
really diffuse.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.630
It doesn't have borders that can track.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.690
You couldn't dig it up,
you would end up digging up an acre of land.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:03.190
And you couldn't separate it from the soil
that it's part of, so it has some of the characteristics

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:07.140
that we associate with nice, concrete, well
delineated objects,

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.530
but not all of them.

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:12.970
That's one of those
weird middle test cases, that I like to think

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.260
about.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.869
One of the other ones that's a little bit
fun is

00:55:15.869 --> 00:55:20.820
trying to figure out which atoms
do you consider to be you.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:26.170
[laughter]
Okay, one of them is, if you weigh

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:31.280
yourself, you get the total
mass of the stuff that you consider to be

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:36.780
you,
but that includes cells that have your DNA,

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.270
those seem like they're probably you.

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:43.220
But it also includes a lot of dead stuff,
that may or may not be you,

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.580
it includes a lot of other organisms,
like the bacteria that live in your gut,

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.820
and the mites that live in your eyebrows,
and all kinds of other things, that again,

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.180
you know, so are you a symbiotic colony of
all those things?

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.830
You could have a lot of fun with this.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.960
Sorry if I'm wondering around a little bit.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.960
Yes?

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.510
&gt;&gt;David: We have time for one more question
if anyone has one.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:04.510
&gt;&gt;Allen: Great, yes?

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.680
&gt;&gt;male speaker 11: One thing, this is going
to be a vague wandering question.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.790
&gt;&gt;Allen: I will give you a vague wandering
answer.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:12.940
&gt;&gt;Male speaker 11: The problems that human
brains seem to have

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.270
dealing with complexity, one of the main manifestations
of that

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.860
is very smart people make very stupid mistakes.

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.020
NASA's been pretty good at that with centimeters
versus

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:29.940
inches, things crashing and
and then the sort of recurrence of the number

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.810
a hundred and fifty, which is shortly the
size of a village,

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:39.470
and the number of social connections, are
there

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:45.020
do you think there are limitations to our
physical limitations even,

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:50.410
to our brain in dealing with increasing complexity?

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:56.230
Are there ways out of that?

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.170
&gt;&gt;Allen: Right.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.900
Umm, it does seem clear
that there are aspects

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.690
of human psychology that influence what we
consider

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.200
to be good theories and bad theories, and
also

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.740
our decisions about real and not real, and
all that.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.990
And that does seem to to be a consequence
of the environment that our brains evolved

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.990
in.

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:22.990
And it comes with a certain set of capabilities,
things that we're really good at,

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:30.500
and also as you said, certain types of lapses,
where things like engineering systems

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:38.690
tend to poke at the exactly spots in our brains
that are kind of soft.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:40.460
So I promised a vague and sort of wandering
answer,

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.860
and I think that might have been it.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.280
[quiet laughter]
So I think the challenge then for theory choice

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:50.320
is to distinguish between what are the preferences
we have,

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:56.280
just because that's how we are, versus preferences
that we can justify in terms of properties

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.030
such as being truth tropic.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:02.150
You know, I think this is more likely to lead
toward more truth,

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:05.100
you know, I think this theory is better than
that one,

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:08.310
not just because my monkey brain tells me
that it's better,

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:11.869
but because I've got a justified reason to
believe that it's

00:58:11.869 --> 00:58:16.109
more likely to lead to, lead toward a truth,
be good for prediction,

00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:18.410
whatever the other characteristics are that
we have for a model.

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:19.410
&gt;&gt;David: Alright.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:21.109
&gt;&gt;Allen: Thank you very much.

00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.880
[Loud applause]
