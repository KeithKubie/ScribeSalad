00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.737
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Going through the pretty typical steps to solving this equation gives us an

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:09.505
answer of x equals 5 over 12. Be sure to reduce your fraction. I initially ended

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:14.204
up with 15 over 36. But 15 and 36 share a common factor of 3. Dividing both the

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:17.903
numerator and the denominator by 3 gave me this final answer.
