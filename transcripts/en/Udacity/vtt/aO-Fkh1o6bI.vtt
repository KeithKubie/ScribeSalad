00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.446
So once this scripting data has been loaded, we can now move forward with our

00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:08.031
assets, images, maps, etc. Now typically you can load assets and scripts at the

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:12.566
same time, but I've been burned by that in HTML once or twice. Injected

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.433
JavaScript code can easily suggest more assets to be loaded, which would

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.332
require more kickoffs of async calls and tracks that follow. As such for

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:22.548
sanity, well, mainly my receding hairline, we let Grids' scripting code come in

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:25.284
first, define their systems and asset needs and then kick off all the

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:30.100
subsequent asset loads afterwards. In Grids instead of calling Windows Alert

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.980
this is where we actually kick off phase three where we parse our texture

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.672
packer outlets definition and load the map objects. Once that was done, we can

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:40.740
actually let the user play the game by turning off the UI and showing the

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.116
canvas elements. Once we've gone through our three phases of loading the menu,

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:48.014
descripting data and then the assets, finally we can allow the user to get to

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:52.834
the screen and play the game. It's only through the combination of all of these

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.398
together do we ensure a nice easy transition for the user that constantly shows

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:58.823
them a refreshing UI.
