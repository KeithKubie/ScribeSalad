use a different name space for the

00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:58.910
use a different name space for the
 

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.330
use a different name space for the
content provider in each app yeah the

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:01.340
content provider in each app yeah the
 

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.130

content provider twice on the device it
 

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.750
content provider twice on the device it
wouldn't make any sense so the content

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760
wouldn't make any sense so the content
 

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.300

the package name anyway into the same
 

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:34.830
the package name anyway into the same

too sure what's being asked so I think

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:25.840
too sure what's being asked so I think
 

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.230
too sure what's being asked so I think
it's basically asking well because us

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240
it's basically asking well because us
 

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.150
it's basically asking well because us

so that you know you can handle
 

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.520
so that you know you can handle
arbitrarily large data sets I think

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:38.530
arbitrarily large data sets I think
 

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.960
arbitrarily large data sets I think
that's your major problem he looks know

question is is it using a view pager or

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:23.860
question is is it using a view pager or

question is is it using a view pager or
if you just got five times in each one

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:25.270
if you just got five times in each one
 

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:31.710
if you just got five times in each one
pass each one has a fragmented it if

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720
pass each one has a fragmented it if
 

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.630
pass each one has a fragmented it if
that's the case then there isn't any

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640
that's the case then there isn't any
 

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.270
