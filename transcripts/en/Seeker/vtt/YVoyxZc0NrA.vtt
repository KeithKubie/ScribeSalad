00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.850
Researchers have figured
out how bad memories

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.190
are erased from the
brain, which is great,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.630
because I have to forget
this thing that happened

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.290
in the desert before
court tomorrow.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.770
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.730
And I think we've all
wondered just when we'll

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.880
be able to Eternal Sunshine
all the nasty stuff out

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.400
of our memories-- you know,
visit a doctor, pop a pill,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.900
and proof.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.440
Whatever traumatic stuff
is messing with you,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.902
it's just gone.

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.110
You know, the secret to
getting over a painful memory

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.800
lies in a process
called memory extension.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.930
Over time, it becomes
easier to walk by the place

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.370
where your break up happened
because the traumatic memory

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360
of that place is replaced
by all the more recent ones

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.860
where nothing happened
while you walked by there.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.610
But what physical process
causes memory extinction?

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.860
What makes those
painful memories fade?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.780
A new study
published by MIT says

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.280
it all lies in a gene
called Tet1, which

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.960
controls the expression of
other genes in your hippocampus

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.840
and cortex-- two
bits of your brain

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.107
that are important to
learning and memory.

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.440
Two groups of mice were studied.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.209
One had a normal level
of Tet1, one group

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.650
had its ability to
make Tet1 removed.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.600
And all of the mice
were put into a cage

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.840
and given an electric shock.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.800
And then over time, they
kept being put into the cage,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.930
but without ever
being shocked again.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.770
And the mice with
normal Tet1 levels

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.200
eventually were not
stressed out by the cage.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.400
But the mice without Tet1
never stopped being frightened.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.040
And it's not that
the mice without Tet1

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.210
couldn't make new memories.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.430
They seemed to learn and
remember new things just fine.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.700
But memory extinction
is not actually

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.000
about old memories
disappearing, it's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.390
about having both the old and
new memories and your brain

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.560
being able to phase
is the old one

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.300
out as it becomes less relevant.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.400
The mice without Tet1
couldn't do that.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.670
The two memories existed just
as powerfully at the same time.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.926
So no Tet1 means
bad memories never

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:52.300
lost their importance
or clarity.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.990
But what happens if you can
boost someone's levels of Tet1?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.540
The MIT researchers
believe it could

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.150
lead to new treatments for
things like addiction and PTSD,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.430
and maybe one day trickle
down into a pill that

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.250
helps take the sting out of
some of the other traumatic life

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.800
events that are
hard to get over.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.341
There are probably some other
things to figure out there too,

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.730
I'd imagine, like does Tet1
just wash away all old trauma?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.280
Can we really create
something that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.770
can just target one
specific memory?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.630
I love this idea as
a form of therapy

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.010
for people who have had
extremely traumatic events

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.520
in their life, but I hate to
see it become too widely used.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.320
I mean, imagine a future
where we have the ability

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.080
to decide how important
every event in our life

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.170
is and just ditch the ones that
we don't think are relevant.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.860
I feel like that's
kind of a recipe

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.694
for a society full of
overconfident dummies.

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:37.443
I don't know what.

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:38.000
Do you think?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.530
Would you use a
memory removal pill?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.247
