00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.509
Some of you will have seen Sean and me
going wild around Bletchley Park and will

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.910
deduce from that that we paid a visit to BP
as they call it in the trade.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.099
It's time now for me to move off from the
Enigma story which I've done

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.029
two or three videos on already, and tell a story
that in many ways is

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.250
even more relevant to the start of
computer science than

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.410
even Enigma was. We've all heard of
Alan Turing but

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.179
I would suspect that fewer of you
have heard about Bill Tutte,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.969
Max Newman, Tommy Flowers. But they're all
worthy of hero status because they're all

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.510
connected with a type of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.629
cipher traffic - mysterious cipher traffic -

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.840
that came to Bletchley Park's attention and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.680
at Bletchley was always called Tunny traffic.
They loved calling mysterious traffic by

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.770
the name of fish and there were things like

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.129
Sturgeon and Halibut as well as Tunny. But
this one is going to be

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.690
Tunny traffic. Tunny is the original
English word for what we nowadays call

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.480
Tuna - it's as simple as that.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.939
Even before the war the Metropolitan
Police

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.100
and the Foreign Office, jointly, used to
listen

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.140
to the airwaves to see what was happening
- you know, that shouldn't be happening

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.180
within the UK shores. Anything mysterious.
Now an awful lot of course of what they were

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.090
listening to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.530
was plain straightforward radio
broadcasts or,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.320
from the military point of view, it would
be Morse code. Some of that Morse code

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.439
might well be

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.250
encrypted Enigma traffic, but it
was in Morse. This one was weird

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
it wasn't in Morse it sounded almost
like

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.670
a touch-tone telephone on steroids or
something,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.840
It was "meeeooow", "meeeooow" all over the
place

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
And so what they did was they equipped

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.540
the listening stations, all over the
UK,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.750
because they all knew that war was
almost inevitable;

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.920
they had a whole load of joint listening
stations and these listened for Enigma

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.570
traffic.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.290
They also listened for anything unusual -

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.920
they were called Y stations - 
capital Y -

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.119
for reasons I don't understand, but there
again Bletchley Park was called Station X

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.920
and I don't understand that either. So
these Y stations started saying:

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.930
"Look there's some weird stuff here would you
like to see what it looks like?"

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.620
They were able to make a recording of
the trace of this,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.560
as if it was an oscilloscope but
actually on a piece of paper

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.270
If you look here it's like a waveform
and that is exactly what it is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.720
and they were able to record this as a
black

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.310
trace and when you look at it, it's like a
mixture between a sort of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.270
sine wave and a square wave. But once they got
the experts in looking at this --

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.950
you've  got to remember teleprinters were
very common

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.010
they were used in stock exchanges, they were
used in telegraphy. A

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.580
lot of traffic went over land-line

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.940
that was actually teleprinter code. This
was broadcast

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.230
because presumably the land line was too long
between

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.450
the far end of Greece and Germany,
let's say.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.830
So it had to be broadcast and the
experts said

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.040
"That's broadcast teleprinter traffic, 
that is!". Now you know why Sean and I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.670
have set

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.300
the scene by doing a video already on 5-hole
paper tape codes,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.790
the teleprinter alphabet and even
on exclusive-OR.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.970
The rule at the Police and the Foreign
Office was that anything mysterious like this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.989
gets sent to GC&amp;CS.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.299
We remember from the previous videos
GC&amp;CS

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.250
(Government Code and Cipher School) -  initially
based in Saint James's Park in London

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.250
but the great majority of it moved off to
Bletchley Park in the late Thirties.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.989
So Bletchley Park was accumulating this
stuff. Big debate:

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.090
"Is this a Vernam Cipher?"

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.910
In the late nineteen twenties an
American

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.549
employee of AT&amp;T had come up with the
idea

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.000
of doing secure, enciphered 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.090
teleprinter transmissions by doing
what we would now call

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.420
an exclusive-OR between two

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.830
five-bit patterns. Yeah?!  Great idea

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.870
because it would disguise the character you
wanted to send ...

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.739
There's only one problem that if you want to
apply that to a whole message

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.299
how would you arrange

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.460
to have, as it were, cipher key
characters - randomly chosen -

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.810
to mix in, via exclusive-OR, with
your plaintext that you wanted to send

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.150
and to send out the result? Well, what

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.370
Vernam proposed - and to my amazement

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.320
he patented it. And you think: "This is madness!

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.510
This is madness! This is secure! they
shouldn't be patenting this stuff - it gives the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.169
game away !"

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.900
This is AT&amp;T and we're not at war
yet!  We're not having the competition

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.680
coming up with this bright idea. This has got
commercial potential, you know, as well as

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.389
military.

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.500
We're gonna patent it. So Vernam
patented the idea.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.240
It would use two five-hole tapes and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.470
what you could do is have this one,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.660
which is the plaintext, running alongside
this one

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.080
which has somehow been generated and this
is the key.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.690
This is the thing that's going to be
exclusive-OR'd,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.789
character by character, with this to give
a cipher text.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.229
The problem is the enormous one - these
things are driven by sprocket holes.

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.960
You start trying to run two tapes
simultaneously

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.030
through a piece of bespoke electronics, which
they invented, which would do the merging

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.510
but you must keep them in exact sync. You
do not want differential stretching

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.960
between the two things. Worse still when
your supervisor says "This thing isn't going

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.190
fast enough, we need more speed!" and you
speed it up

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.260
you know what happens next -  the sprocket 
holes tear. And then you've got slippage

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.770
like you never dreamed of in your worst
nightmares.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.130
So, as a result all this problem of
tape

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.930
synchronization it never really got to
market.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.180
It was quietly abandoned,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.300
but the idea was good. But the people at
Bletchley Park started saying:

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.169
"Is this a Vernam cipher 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.919
that we were taught about at training
school before we started here at BP?"

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.560
But maybe the Germans have been smart
enough to say we're not going to use the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.470
second tape

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.699
because you've got to get it synchronized. We will
provide

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.720
the key characters from a machine. It'll
be like an

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.800
add-on to the teletype - the teleprinter.
You type in your plaintext character

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
this thing we'll invent and it's probably going
to have

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.380
wheels - rotor wheels - every good cipher
machine has rotor wheels on it - 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.830
will somehow generate a 5-bit

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.729
International Teletype letter and then
it'll automatically

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.759
exclusive-OR it and then we'll get an output

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.830
and that'll be our cipher and the good thing
is that it will be a lot less problem to

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.979
keep the machine

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.440
in sync with what we're doing when you've
only got one tape

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.219
to worry about. So in the end they
discovered that that's

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.919
exactly what was happening - looked at
more and more of this Tunny traffic:

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.650
How on earth are we ever, ever, going to get
into this stuff ?

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.409
At the start of this signal it goes up
high

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:19.710
but the rule in these intercepted
messages, that were put out on this

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.599
piece of kit called the Undulator, is that if
it's high it's a zero

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.690
and if it goes low it's a one and the
neutral point is somewhere in the middle.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.400
Let's just do a straightforward addition
of two 5-bit

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.110
codes to see what it would look like. The
letter A - capital A -

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.870
in the International Teleprinter code - 
the Baudot-Murray code -

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.199
is one one zero 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.030
zero

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.130
zero and let me remind you one of the
approved signals for

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.169
doing an exclusive-OR operation is a plus
in a circle.

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:55.580
I'm going to add that on via exclusive-
OR

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.870
to the letter X. Letter X is

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.440
one zero one one one

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.820
You all know how this works now
exclusive-OR

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.880
gives a 0 if they're the same

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.970
and a 1 if they are different. Look that up

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.780
in your table - what character is that? - its
the letter V.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.320
So there we are look. The plaintext
shall we say was A, the ciphering character given by

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.250
the randomizing device was X

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.430
and this particular character is V.
What we're going to have to do

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.419
on this, surely, is to get enough evidence

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:35.740
about that random key stream before we
can start working out how the heck it

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.440
works.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.550
Mathematicians were around, were
upon the scene,

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.010
arguably not as many as Bletchley Park
really needed in the early days,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.860
to say: "Look, this is an example of what we

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.200
in the Mathematics trade call an
Additive Ciphering system.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.670
It's doing arithmetic modulo a certain
number.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.070
This as I've said is arithmetic modulo two

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.070
it's binary addition, but without the
carries.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.170
And some wise soul said; "You know there
are weaknesses in all additive ciphers.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.240
Basically, at the end of the 19th century,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.480
a man called Kerckhoffs had published a
paper

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.470
about cryptography via additive ciphers
and said the problem with them

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.240
all is

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.720
if you accumulate enough captured

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.770
ciphertext, even when you don't know
the key, but

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.680
lots of different messages, if they're all done
with the same

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.329
key you can eventually accumulate so
much that via a

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:37.600
clever trick you can work out what the
messages are

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.899
without even

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:42.319
knowing the key, because it kind of cancels

00:09:42.319 --> 00:09:45.899
out.  Oh! that could be helpful!

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:49.649
So all we've got to look out for then

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:52.809
is are they using the same key for any of this
stuff?

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:57.119
Handy! Every single one of

00:09:57.119 --> 00:10:00.410
these transmissions, before it came through on
the Undulator -

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.759
they all came with an Indicator.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:06.839
Now this really puzzled them at
first. I've

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.860
copied one down, from my reference books.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.480
Those 12 characters would be sent out
and then there'd be a pause.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.480
And then this stuff, the Undulator
traffic would start.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.540
However there was sufficient of this 
sent out, to train the operators, that

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.290
again the game was given away.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.240
The cryptanalysts said: "I wonder if that's 
in code or cipher itself - oh! i dunno - 

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.119
but, you see, could this be like
Enigma?

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:35.439
They sent out blocks of three letters
to show

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:38.769
the settings - the initial settings. Could
it be like that ? "

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:42.470
Then somebody else would say: " Yeah but there's
twelve of them - that doesn't make

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.269
sense;

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:47.129
ten would make sense - two layers of encipherment
one after the other

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:50.499
First row of five, y'know, five bits

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:55.230
and then push it on again - do another one.
But these could be settings of

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.429
cipher wheels just like Enigma. But how
can we be sure that they aren't

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:04.179
in a code of their own. Do they really mean
what they say? As part of the training

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:05.309
scenario

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:08.740
obvious to the poor operators trying
to work this machine

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.809
there were some of the transmissions that said
`in clear'

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:15.990
"M ist Michael" 

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.569
"G ist Gerhard", Right?!  So by the time you got

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:22.920
"O ist Otto", "K ist Karl"

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.970
you can see this is training the operators:
"Yes, it's K for Karl, 

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.230
you see the K and you wind the cipher wheel round 
until you see  

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.670
letter K for Karl and by the fact
that they

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.920
had elaborated, in the training, all of
these as

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.189
boys' first names made

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:43.760
the listeners sure that these were what they
seemed.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.100
So the answer now is very clear, we have
to sit and wait patiently;

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.910
we have to ask our Y stations to
rigorously send us

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.620
exactly what the Indicator was, and if
we wait long enough

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.660
somebody will use the same Indicator
twice.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.840
Absolutely against standing orders but it
was known from Enigma this was a great

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.600
temptation in the heat of battle,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.210
with people shouting at you, to use the same
settings

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.670
twice. "It's alright - nobody will be
listening. Hmmm! Oh yes they are ... "

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.000
This did happen, I guess you could say,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.190
sooner rather than later. I think it was
August 1941

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.650
they finally got a message which had got
the same

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.300
indicator and they knew perfectly well
that with that and

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.090
with a lot of hard, patient, work - because there were
no computers to help you -

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.110
nevertheless we can probably disentangle
this message.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.450
Now, another thing, these messages seemed to
be going between headquarters

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.470
of the German High Command. These were not
between weather stations

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.140
they were not even between Luftwaffe
stations, this was

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.520
serious stuff.  This was going from
Athens HQ to Berlin HQ,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.200
shall we say. Clearly this stuff - and there
wasn't much of it initially -

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.230
was going to be used by the high-ups - the
German High Command.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.880
As we now know it really was Hitler's
favourite cipher machine.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.920
It's great advantage, unlike Enigma,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.910
was that it was user-friendly. You know what
Enigma's like:  you need a person to

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.890
punch the thing

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.500
a person to read the lamps, a person to send
the Morse code.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:23.410
Here you could connect two encrypted-type
teletypes back-to-back, across a

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.180
land-line

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.230
or even across the airwaves, although
that would be a bit

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.500
dicey to do with interference. But you
could in principle

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.950
have your operators never see the 
ciphertext It goes in one

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.570
end, ... enciphered ... across ... deciphered
out it comes. Therefore

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.660
because it's easy to use, and user-friendly,
people would send

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.889
longer messages and that's music to the
ears of the cryptanalyst brigade

00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:52.279
they loved that! By this stage the
listeners had decided that we needed

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:55.410
a new Y station, separately for this

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.079
Tunny traffic - remember the traffic was
called Tunny

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:02.480
the machine that was generating it was
called German Tunny - or just

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.129
Tunny. The machines that eventually they built at
Bletchley Park, once they understood how

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:08.000
it worked,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.829
to do the same job of deciphering, was
called British Tunny -

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:15.779
but it was all Tunny. So here
was this Tunny traffic

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:19.069
all stacking up, all waiting to be
decrypted,

00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:22.379
all waiting for two or more

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:27.290
to be sent out with the same key.  Now
at Bletchley, technically, that's called

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.420
a "depth". Getting a depth means you've got two
or more messages

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.079
all with the same key. Absolutely against
standing orders,

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:40.699
because the German cryptographers had warned
the military

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:44.689
that this one - this kind of XOR additive
cipher -

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:48.079
is even more sensitive to depths

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:52.110
probably even than Enigma. With Enigma you 
only got a short message out anyway

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.800
because

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.089
life's too short to send much more
than about 50 characters.

00:14:56.089 --> 00:15:01.370
This thing - in the end - they got 4000
characters-worth

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.149
and then, when the chap

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:11.130
phoned back "Sorry!  didn't
quite get that, could you send it again ?!"

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.800
My first thought was surely the sender
guy would have had the

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.199
sense to make a tape of it and send it
off-line in the first place?

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:23.410
No, he hadn't. He'd typed it in by hand without
making a copy.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.980
So when it was sent again you can
imagine the sender

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.380
muttering and cursing. He used
abbreviations; he made it shorter

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.940
and as we'll see, next time, that

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.639
made the deciphering job even easier
