00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.880
Thanks, Nathan.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.220
Hello, so I'm Eitan, and I lead
our developer engineering team

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.070
on Google's Project Tango.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.600
And at the beginning
of these talks,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.058
I always like to take just--
show of hands, how many of you

00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:24.931
have heard of
Project Tango before?

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.090
OK, so maybe 1/3
of the audience.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.070
So for those of you who have
heard of us before, hopefully

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.460
this will serve as an
update, and for those of you

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.290
who have never heard
of Project Tango,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.930
I want to introduce it to
you and tell you a little bit

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.636
about what we're doing.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.990
All right, so Project Tango
stems from this observation

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.700
that today interaction
with our phone

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.544
is fundamentally limited
by the area of the screen.

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:55.840
And whether you're
at home shopping

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.430
for an appliance online--
slides, OK-- or at work

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.890
planning for a project,
or out at dinner

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.650
socializing with your friends,
your phone is with you,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.440
but you're still just
interacting with your screen.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.100
Your phone doesn't
see or understand

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
the world or your environment.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.550
And on Project Tango, we
want to break this barrier.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.260
We want to teach your phone
to see and to understand

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.450
your environment and to augment
our own abilities to answer

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.130
questions about the
world around us.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.340
Now, those might be questions
like, how much paints do I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.170
need for this wall?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.250
Or will a couch that I'm about
to buy online fit in my room?

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.940
I recently made a very bad
decision with a sleeper sofa.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.380
Or how do I get from
where I am to the laundry

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.680
detergent in a store?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.050
And of course, and
most excitingly here,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.740
we can make games.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.630
And whether we're exploring a
landscape with Possible's Poco

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.479
Eco game in full six
degrees of freedom,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.210
or dodging meteors by moving
around our room with Danger

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.540
Dodgers from Uppercut
Games, or competing

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.060
with a friend in a multiplayer
Jenga experience, which

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.450
was a partnership between
Jenga and Schell Games,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.430
or even just placing
a cat on a surface

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.760
by you to have a
new virtual friends.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.526
I've made a lot of
progress with Mittens

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:37.775
over the last couple of weeks.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.390
Project Tango allows
us to build all of this

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.300
and to do even more, and we use
special cameras and inertial

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.650
sensors on the device
to allow your phone

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.760
to see the world much
like we do and to build

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090
a truly human scale
understanding of space

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.320
and motion.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.820
And we expose this understanding
to application developers

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.430
by adding three core
technologies to mobile phones,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.100
and I'll talk about each of them
briefly, motion tracking, area

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.290
learning, and depth perception.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.780
So motion tracking
allows Tango devices

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.830
to track both their position
and orientation in space.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.420
The device keeps a log
of the visual features

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.030
that it sees in the environment
and calculates its position

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.950
and orientation relative to
static features in the world.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.610
Area learning allows
Project Tango devices

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.100
to recognize spaces where
they've been before.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.800
When a distinctive visual
landmark-- think like a stop

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.460
sign, or something like that,
or a special painting-- is seen,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.120
the device stores
this in its memory.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.330
And the next time it or actually
any Project Tango device

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.540
comes into that
space, the device

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.520
sees that visual fingerprint and
recognizes its precise location

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.930
in the world.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.110
And depth perception allows
Project Tango devices

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.540
to see in full three dimensions,
thanks to the addition

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.940
of special depth cameras.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.790
This allows them to
see and understand

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.060
the geometry, structure,
and scale of the environment

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.050
that they're in.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.550
And there's no
better time to build

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.180
apps for this platform
than right now.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.370
At CES, Lenovo and Google
launched a partnership

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.350
where we're building the first
Project Tango smartphone,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.420
and it will launch
in this summer.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.210
It's going to be available
globally and the US,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.480
and it's going to be at
mainstream price points.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.940
So this technology really
is coming to mobile phones,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.490
and we're just at the
start of what we hope

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.320
will be a very large ecosystem.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.080
And to this end, we've actually
launched an incubator program.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.570
So we're always
looking for developers

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.640
to build interesting
content, and we

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.360
want to help make that happen.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.290
So if you have an idea,
please reach out to us.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.720
So that concludes my talk.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.360
Thank you so much for listening.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.610
We're excited to see
what we can build.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.940
You can check out our APIs
on developers.google.com,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.634
and you can email me directly
if you want more information.

00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:11.175
And with that, I'm
going to introduce

00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:13.037
Sunil who's going to talk next.

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:13.870
Thank you very much.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.770
