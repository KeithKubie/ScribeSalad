ago maybe in January we did a actually

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
ago maybe in January we did a actually
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.870

we did an episode on iterative

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
we did an episode on iterative
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850
we did an episode on iterative
improvements basically starting from a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
improvements basically starting from a
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.179
improvements basically starting from a
very bare-bones newsreader type app you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
very bare-bones newsreader type app you
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160

know basically had a list of bacon very

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
know basically had a list of bacon very
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.609
know basically had a list of bacon very
bacony articles and a detailed section

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
bacony articles and a detailed section
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319
bacony articles and a detailed section
that let you kind of view the details or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
that let you kind of view the details or
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200
that let you kind of view the details or
or read that article and we figured you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
or read that article and we figured you
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749
or read that article and we figured you
know why not just kind of use that as a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
know why not just kind of use that as a
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940
know why not just kind of use that as a
starting point and and see how we can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
starting point and and see how we can
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100
starting point and and see how we can
improve on the the reading experience

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
improve on the the reading experience
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.609
improve on the the reading experience
from there so here are some some slides

in action and you know you can see that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
in action and you know you can see that
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.639
in action and you know you can see that
you have kind of this list of articles

kind of full-bleed and let the article

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910
kind of full-bleed and let the article
 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.600

more details with recent versions of
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.259
more details with recent versions of
Android you can actually just use a

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269
Android you can actually just use a
 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.900
Android you can actually just use a
single finger kind of to swipe down if

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.229
the list so one of the things that we're
thinking about is you know as you're

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
thinking about is you know as you're
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.120
thinking about is you know as you're
browsing a set of stories right as

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130
browsing a set of stories right as
 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.850
browsing a set of stories right as
you're browsing this list oftentimes you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860
you're browsing this list oftentimes you
 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.380
you're browsing this list oftentimes you
know you want to get a little more you

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390
know you want to get a little more you
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.150
know you want to get a little more you
don't want to necessarily read the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
don't want to necessarily read the
 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.100
don't want to necessarily read the
entire article or see everything you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110
entire article or see everything you
 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.360
entire article or see everything you
just want to get a slightly larger

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370
just want to get a slightly larger
 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.280
just want to get a slightly larger
preview so you know there are a couple

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290
preview so you know there are a couple
 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.110
preview so you know there are a couple
of ways of doing that if that's of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
of ways of doing that if that's of
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.670
of ways of doing that if that's of
interest to you and your news reader app

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680
interest to you and your news reader app
 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.710
interest to you and your news reader app
you know obviously you could have you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720
you know obviously you could have you
 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.259
you know obviously you could have you
know a button within that list item like

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269
know a button within that list item like
 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.900
know a button within that list item like
a preview button you could potentially

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910
a preview button you could potentially
 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.060
a preview button you could potentially
have a go long press preview or sort of

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070
have a go long press preview or sort of
 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.680
have a go long press preview or sort of
a long press to show contextual action

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690
a long press to show contextual action
 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.240
a long press to show contextual action
bar and they could have a preview there

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
bar and they could have a preview there
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.680
bar and they could have a preview there
but you know we thought you know this is

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690
but you know we thought you know this is
 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.479
but you know we thought you know this is
kind of a maybe a power user thing you

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489
kind of a maybe a power user thing you
 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.830
kind of a maybe a power user thing you
know once you discover it you start

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840
know once you discover it you start
 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.960
know once you discover it you start
using it a little more so why not use a

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
using it a little more so why not use a
 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.539
using it a little more so why not use a
power user user gesture so one way of

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549
power user user gesture so one way of
 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.920
power user user gesture so one way of
doing this is let's say you know you use

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930
doing this is let's say you know you use
 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.850
doing this is let's say you know you use
your two fingers to scroll down or

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860
your two fingers to scroll down or
 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.510
your two fingers to scroll down or
to swipe down on an article you would

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520
to swipe down on an article you would
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.830
to swipe down on an article you would
you'd swipe down and then you start

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840
you'd swipe down and then you start
 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.170
you'd swipe down and then you start
seeing the preview so in this case it's

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
seeing the preview so in this case it's
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.809
seeing the preview so in this case it's
a video the video maybe even starts

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819
a video the video maybe even starts
 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.790
a video the video maybe even starts
playing inline automatically and this is

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
playing inline automatically and this is
 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.320
playing inline automatically and this is
something that you can definitely do as

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330
something that you can definitely do as
 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.390
something that you can definitely do as
of Android 4.0 or actually even Android

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400
of Android 4.0 or actually even Android
 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.999
of Android 4.0 or actually even Android
3.0 actually now it's 4.0 that we had

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009
3.0 actually now it's 4.0 that we had
 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.580
3.0 actually now it's 4.0 that we had
this booklet I yeah yeah it's extra view

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590
this booklet I yeah yeah it's extra view
 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.439
this booklet I yeah yeah it's extra view
that the lets you basically play you

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449
that the lets you basically play you
 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.200
that the lets you basically play you
know video int or do lots of interesting

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210
know video int or do lots of interesting
 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.129
know video int or do lots of interesting
things inside of you know a graphical

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139
things inside of you know a graphical
 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.050
things inside of you know a graphical
object that's composed with the rest of

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060
object that's composed with the rest of
 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.290
object that's composed with the rest of
you know your window but the idea is

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300
you know your window but the idea is
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.219
you know your window but the idea is
that you know you could do cool things

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229
that you know you could do cool things
 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.990
that you know you could do cool things
like play video in line you could you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000
like play video in line you could you
 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.369
like play video in line you could you
know apply animations transitions to

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379
know apply animations transitions to
 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.080
know apply animations transitions to
video but you know here's one example of

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090
video but you know here's one example of
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.939
video but you know here's one example of
where you can you know take video and

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949
where you can you know take video and
 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.490
where you can you know take video and
make it inline alternatively you know if

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500
make it inline alternatively you know if
 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.040
make it inline alternatively you know if
you just have text or a photo you can

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
you just have text or a photo you can
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.839
you just have text or a photo you can
kind of you know as you swipe down to

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849
kind of you know as you swipe down to
 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.990
kind of you know as you swipe down to
expand you could show the text obviously

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000
expand you could show the text obviously
 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.309
expand you could show the text obviously
you could show a photo maybe even

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319
you could show a photo maybe even
 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.140
you could show a photo maybe even
horizontally swipeable unless you know

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150
horizontally swipeable unless you know
 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.760
horizontally swipeable unless you know
you have another competing gesture for

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770
you have another competing gesture for
 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.159
you have another competing gesture for
horizontal swipe but it's just the idea

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169
horizontal swipe but it's just the idea
 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.790
horizontal swipe but it's just the idea
that you know sometimes a simple little

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800
that you know sometimes a simple little
 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.769
that you know sometimes a simple little
title that's probably a lip sized is

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779
title that's probably a lip sized is
 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.769
title that's probably a lip sized is
just not enough so so this is kind of

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779
just not enough so so this is kind of
 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.350
just not enough so so this is kind of
one way of doing that of alleviating

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360
one way of doing that of alleviating
 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.959
one way of doing that of alleviating
that absolutely fun power gesture I like

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969
that absolutely fun power gesture I like
 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.040
that absolutely fun power gesture I like
the use of it in the list context

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050
the use of it in the list context
 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.659
the use of it in the list context
because as you say horizontal swipe is

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669
because as you say horizontal swipe is
 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.820
because as you say horizontal swipe is
quite you know competing for a lot of

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830
quite you know competing for a lot of
 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.260
quite you know competing for a lot of
different gestures they're going on its

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270
different gestures they're going on its
 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.579
different gestures they're going on its
face at the moment so this is really

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589
face at the moment so this is really
 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:47.670
face at the moment so this is really
nice way to acts on a single list item

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680
nice way to acts on a single list item
 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.719
nice way to acts on a single list item
yeah it's really good for power users

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729
yeah it's really good for power users
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.459
yeah it's really good for power users
but then for users that you know one of

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469
but then for users that you know one of
 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.719
but then for users that you know one of
brows normally it doesn't sort of

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729
brows normally it doesn't sort of
 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.100
brows normally it doesn't sort of
interfere with that flowy that they can

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110
interfere with that flowy that they can
 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.450
interfere with that flowy that they can
just tap and move into the article as

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460
just tap and move into the article as
 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.129
just tap and move into the article as
well right it's not like the only way of

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139
well right it's not like the only way of
 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.480
well right it's not like the only way of
exposing the content you can actually

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490
exposing the content you can actually
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.670
exposing the content you can actually
just you know touch to get to the

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680
just you know touch to get to the
 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.459
just you know touch to get to the
content that's the primary gesture

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469
content that's the primary gesture
 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:04.990
content that's the primary gesture
involved there but for the parties have

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000
involved there but for the parties have
 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.550
involved there but for the parties have
discovered this may be a kind of

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560
discovered this may be a kind of
 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.980
discovered this may be a kind of
additional nice thing bootstraps on the

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990
additional nice thing bootstraps on the
 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.079
additional nice thing bootstraps on the
rich notification as well right it's pre

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089
rich notification as well right it's pre
 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.490
rich notification as well right it's pre
programs that show a similar amount of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500
programs that show a similar amount of
 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.689
programs that show a similar amount of
content as you might be preparing

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699
content as you might be preparing
 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.309
content as you might be preparing
already it laying out for a rich

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319
already it laying out for a rich
 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.959
already it laying out for a rich
notification and then it builds on that

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:16.969
notification and then it builds on that
 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:18.790
notification and then it builds on that
same gesture so you kind of bootstrap

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800
same gesture so you kind of bootstrap
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.279
same gesture so you kind of bootstrap
the kind of interaction just cool as an

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289
the kind of interaction just cool as an
 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.050
the kind of interaction just cool as an
additional thing maybe to kind of hinted

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060
additional thing maybe to kind of hinted
 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.159
additional thing maybe to kind of hinted
at it at the gesture and this is

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169
at it at the gesture and this is
 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.209
at it at the gesture and this is
something that we talked about a while

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219
something that we talked about a while
 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.279
something that we talked about a while
ago with respect to dismiss right you

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289
ago with respect to dismiss right you
 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.920
ago with respect to dismiss right you
know when we swipe to dismiss you

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930
know when we swipe to dismiss you
 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.889
know when we swipe to dismiss you
sometimes but it's not necessarily a

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:31.899
sometimes but it's not necessarily a
 

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:34.240
sometimes but it's not necessarily a
very very discoverable gesture on its

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250
very very discoverable gesture on its
 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.579
very very discoverable gesture on its
own but let's say you kind of also

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589
own but let's say you kind of also
 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.170
own but let's say you kind of also
provide the ability to long press

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
provide the ability to long press
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.180
provide the ability to long press
an object and then press the delete item

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190
an object and then press the delete item
 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.469
an object and then press the delete item
in the contextual action bar and it kind

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479
in the contextual action bar and it kind
 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.810
in the contextual action bar and it kind
of slides away that kind of hints subtly

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820
of slides away that kind of hints subtly
 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.340
of slides away that kind of hints subtly
that hey I can do that same thing with

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350
that hey I can do that same thing with
 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.010
that hey I can do that same thing with
my finger not necessarily just you

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
my finger not necessarily just you
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.450
my finger not necessarily just you
always use the delete action the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460
always use the delete action the
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.909
always use the delete action the
contextual action bar but I can actually

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919
contextual action bar but I can actually
 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.469
contextual action bar but I can actually
try this with my finger and it works so

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479
try this with my finger and it works so
 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.270
try this with my finger and it works so
in this case what you could do is you

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280
in this case what you could do is you
 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.820
in this case what you could do is you
know as these list items populate you

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830
know as these list items populate you
 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.920
know as these list items populate you
could kind of animate them in so start

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930
could kind of animate them in so start
 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.779
could kind of animate them in so start
with a larger size and then as they fall

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789
with a larger size and then as they fall
 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.150
with a larger size and then as they fall
into place they kind of like shrink into

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160
into place they kind of like shrink into
 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.070
into place they kind of like shrink into
the collapsed size just to hint that

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080
the collapsed size just to hint that
 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.779
the collapsed size just to hint that
there's actually more under each list

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789
there's actually more under each list
 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.219
there's actually more under each list
item and that you can get to it with

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:09.229
item and that you can get to it with
 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.770
item and that you can get to it with
your two finger that's right but lots of

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780
your two finger that's right but lots of
 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.790
your two finger that's right but lots of
different things you can do here that

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800
different things you can do here that
 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.680
different things you can do here that
the basic point is you know make the

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690
the basic point is you know make the
 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.600
the basic point is you know make the
news browsing experience great not only

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610
news browsing experience great not only
 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.670
news browsing experience great not only
the news reading experience but the news

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680
the news reading experience but the news
 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.129
the news reading experience but the news
browsing experience along with in those

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139
browsing experience along with in those
 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.460
browsing experience along with in those
same along the same lines I guess you

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470
same along the same lines I guess you
 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.560
same along the same lines I guess you
know consider alternative presentations

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570
know consider alternative presentations
 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.510
know consider alternative presentations
for your collection right so when you

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520
for your collection right so when you
 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.610
for your collection right so when you
present a list of articles or I guess a

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620
present a list of articles or I guess a
 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.930
present a list of articles or I guess a
collection of articles since it's not

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940
collection of articles since it's not
 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.469
collection of articles since it's not
always a list you know consider ways to

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479
always a list you know consider ways to
 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.330
always a list you know consider ways to
make that a more richer you know

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340
make that a more richer you know
 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.760
make that a more richer you know
experience so one of the things that we

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770
experience so one of the things that we
 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.800
experience so one of the things that we
looked at in the past is pocket which

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810
looked at in the past is pocket which
 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.279
looked at in the past is pocket which
switches from you know on a phone it's a

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:45.289
switches from you know on a phone it's a
 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:47.589
switches from you know on a phone it's a
list to on a 7-inch tablet it's a grid

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599
list to on a 7-inch tablet it's a grid
 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:48.909
list to on a 7-inch tablet it's a grid
to run a 10-inch tablet it's kind of

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919
to run a 10-inch tablet it's kind of
 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.800
to run a 10-inch tablet it's kind of
like a staggered grid where a single

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:50.810
like a staggered grid where a single
 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.379
like a staggered grid where a single
cell can take multiple items or multiple

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389
cell can take multiple items or multiple
 

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.260
cell can take multiple items or multiple
columns you know in that same vein how

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.270
columns you know in that same vein how
 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.060
columns you know in that same vein how
can you make this a little more rich so

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.070
can you make this a little more rich so
 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.680
can you make this a little more rich so
one of the alternatives obviously is you

00:07:59.680 --> 00:07:59.690
one of the alternatives obviously is you
 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.659
one of the alternatives obviously is you
know to make this you know full bleed or

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:01.669
know to make this you know full bleed or
 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.330
know to make this you know full bleed or
basically almost full bleed photos and

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.340
basically almost full bleed photos and
 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.610
basically almost full bleed photos and
just the text on top and in cases where

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620
just the text on top and in cases where
 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.839
just the text on top and in cases where
you don't have a you know photo you

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:07.849
you don't have a you know photo you
 

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.430
you don't have a you know photo you
could kind of use a standard background

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440
could kind of use a standard background
 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.010
could kind of use a standard background
like that this works really well for

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.020
like that this works really well for
 

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.570
like that this works really well for
very very graphically rich you know news

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:16.580
very very graphically rich you know news
 

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.399
very very graphically rich you know news
content pieces like it doesn't really

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:18.409
content pieces like it doesn't really
 

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.860
content pieces like it doesn't really
work so well for text but certainly if

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:20.870
work so well for text but certainly if
 

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.510
work so well for text but certainly if
you have lots of photos or videos this

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520
you have lots of photos or videos this
 

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.670
you have lots of photos or videos this
is a good way of presenting it yeah one

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680
is a good way of presenting it yeah one
 

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.980
is a good way of presenting it yeah one
of the core design principles is that

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:26.990
of the core design principles is that
 

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.629
of the core design principles is that
you know pictures of thoughts of them

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639
you know pictures of thoughts of them
 

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.249
you know pictures of thoughts of them
words and then this is a excellent

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:30.259
words and then this is a excellent
 

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.689
words and then this is a excellent
demonstration of it if you have the

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:31.699
demonstration of it if you have the
 

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.130
demonstration of it if you have the
imagery then like you know shout about

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.140
imagery then like you know shout about
 

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.139
imagery then like you know shout about
it make it as big as you can yeah yeah

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:35.149
it make it as big as you can yeah yeah
 

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.279
it make it as big as you can yeah yeah
it's definitely frustrating when a news

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:36.289
it's definitely frustrating when a news
 

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.529
it's definitely frustrating when a news
app has really great imagery and then

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:38.539
app has really great imagery and then
 

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.269
app has really great imagery and then
they have timing look they even use this

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:40.279
they have timing look they even use this
 

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.440
they have timing look they even use this
ListView one and they have tiny little

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.450
ListView one and they have tiny little
 

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.719
ListView one and they have tiny little
images there so you know both of these

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:43.729
images there so you know both of these
 

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:45.699
images there so you know both of these
presentations look really nice yeah

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:45.709
presentations look really nice yeah
 

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.230
presentations look really nice yeah
tiny photos there's definitely a pet

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240
tiny photos there's definitely a pet
 

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.569
tiny photos there's definitely a pet
peeve especially had tablets like such a

00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:49.579
peeve especially had tablets like such a
 

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:51.190
peeve especially had tablets like such a
beautiful screen like a Nexus 10 right

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200
beautiful screen like a Nexus 10 right
 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.080
beautiful screen like a Nexus 10 right
beautiful screen and not using it to

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.090
beautiful screen and not using it to
 

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.300
beautiful screen and not using it to
show photos if you have really high res

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.310
show photos if you have really high res
 

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.890
show photos if you have really high res
photos is is kind of a missed

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:56.900
photos is is kind of a missed
 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.190
photos is is kind of a missed
opportunity so in the side note to this

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200
opportunity so in the side note to this
 

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.850
opportunity so in the side note to this
pattern is but oh and one of the things

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:03.860
pattern is but oh and one of the things
 

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.830
pattern is but oh and one of the things
I realized using this pattern is the use

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:05.840
I realized using this pattern is the use
 

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.840
I realized using this pattern is the use
of like a a zoom animation if you click

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:07.850
of like a a zoom animation if you click
 

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.490
of like a a zoom animation if you click
on with the tiles to retain context and

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:09.500
on with the tiles to retain context and
 

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.080
on with the tiles to retain context and
that makes it really easy to kind of you

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.090
that makes it really easy to kind of you
 

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.100
that makes it really easy to kind of you
know click on with those squares and it

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.110
know click on with those squares and it
 

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.080
know click on with those squares and it
zooms up so the picture becomes like you

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.090
zooms up so the picture becomes like you
 

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.640
zooms up so the picture becomes like you
know the whole screen and they're super

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:15.650
know the whole screen and they're super
 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.930
know the whole screen and they're super
simple to build it's like two lines of

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:16.940
simple to build it's like two lines of
 

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.000
simple to build it's like two lines of
code record activity options and it

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.010
code record activity options and it
 

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.080
code record activity options and it
really will change your contact you

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.090
really will change your contact you
 

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.400
really will change your contact you
really kind of like have that link

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.410
really kind of like have that link
 

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.600
really kind of like have that link
witching where you came from why you

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:22.610
witching where you came from why you
 

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.660
witching where you came from why you
getting screen that's a good point okay

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:25.670
getting screen that's a good point okay
 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.450
getting screen that's a good point okay
moving on the next thing we wanted to

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:28.460
moving on the next thing we wanted to
 

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.260
moving on the next thing we wanted to
talk about was the the very much

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.270
talk about was the the very much
 

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.330
talk about was the the very much
you know comment that are buzzed about

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:34.340
you know comment that are buzzed about
 

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.090
you know comment that are buzzed about
navigation drawer pattern so you know

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.100
navigation drawer pattern so you know
 

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.950
navigation drawer pattern so you know
what you could do is you know let's say

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:38.960
what you could do is you know let's say
 

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.680
what you could do is you know let's say
you have an app that has lots of

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:41.690
you have an app that has lots of
 

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.060
you have an app that has lots of
hierarchy what you could do is you could

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.070
hierarchy what you could do is you could
 

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.470
hierarchy what you could do is you could
have you know a spinner right you could

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480
have you know a spinner right you could
 

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.600
have you know a spinner right you could
have a drill down list navigation where

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:46.610
have a drill down list navigation where
 

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.100
have a drill down list navigation where
basically you have like you know when

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.110
basically you have like you know when
 

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.740
basically you have like you know when
you first get to the app you have a list

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:50.750
you first get to the app you have a list
 

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.570
you first get to the app you have a list
of categories and then you touch the

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:52.580
of categories and then you touch the
 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.160
of categories and then you touch the
category to get into the details of that

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.170
category to get into the details of that
 

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.960
category to get into the details of that
to see all the articles within that

category but you know what what we've
 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.940
category but you know what what we've
been using in some of our apps recently

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:00.950
been using in some of our apps recently

there now is this new pattern call that
we're calling the navigation drawer so

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
we're calling the navigation drawer so
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.930
we're calling the navigation drawer so
the navigation drawer is basically this

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:07.940
the navigation drawer is basically this
 

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.580
the navigation drawer is basically this
thing that kind of slides out from the

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:09.590
thing that kind of slides out from the
 

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.410
thing that kind of slides out from the
left it's also called the the sliding

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:11.420
left it's also called the the sliding

left it's also called the the sliding
menu or the flyin menu and it can work

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480
menu or the flyin menu and it can work
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.510
menu or the flyin menu and it can work
really well where you have you know lots

really well where you have you know lots
 

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.120
really well where you have you know lots
of you know sibling sections it's really

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.130
of you know sibling sections it's really
 

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.500
of you know sibling sections it's really
good for it's really primarily for

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.510
good for it's really primarily for
 

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.880
good for it's really primarily for
navigation you work really well when you

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:21.890
navigation you work really well when you
 

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.100
navigation you work really well when you
have lots of adjacent you know sections

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.110
have lots of adjacent you know sections
 

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.680
have lots of adjacent you know sections
that don't really work well as tabs and

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:26.690
that don't really work well as tabs and
 

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.200
that don't really work well as tabs and

seven items right mm-hmm so one of the

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:43.610
seven items right mm-hmm so one of the
 

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.800
seven items right mm-hmm so one of the
things that we were thinking about and

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:44.810
things that we were thinking about and
 

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.880
things that we were thinking about and
this is something that comes up

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:45.890
this is something that comes up
 

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.440
this is something that comes up
frequently is you know what if I have a

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:47.450
frequently is you know what if I have a
 

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.720
frequently is you know what if I have a
really really deep heavy hierarchy right

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:49.730
really really deep heavy hierarchy right
 

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.300
really really deep heavy hierarchy right
so I have you know 10 or 20 top-level

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:52.310
so I have you know 10 or 20 top-level
 

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.580
so I have you know 10 or 20 top-level
sections and then within each section I

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:54.590
sections and then within each section I
 

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.560
sections and then within each section I
have you know 10 sub sections or

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.570
have you know 10 sub sections or
 

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.120
have you know 10 sub sections or
something and this kind of if you're a

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.130
something and this kind of if you're a
 

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.650
something and this kind of if you're a
news organization you probably have this

league it could be pretty heavyweight so
 

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.100
league it could be pretty heavyweight so
what we are thinking about is and this

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.110
what we are thinking about is and this
 

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.880
what we are thinking about is and this
is actually something that we've been

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:15.890
is actually something that we've been
 

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.650

recommending is letting the user
 

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.540
recommending is letting the user
customize so a good example of this is

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.550
customize so a good example of this is
 

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.410
customize so a good example of this is
currents google currents it has a list

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.420

things like that but then when within
 

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.070
things like that but then when within
each section you can actually customize

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.080

heavily customizable section so let's
take a look at so this is pretty

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.100
take a look at so this is pretty
 

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.710
take a look at so this is pretty
straightforward but the more interesting

interactions so the idea is that you

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560
interactions so the idea is that you
 

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.470
interactions so the idea is that you
know you have a lot of hierarchy and you

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480
know you have a lot of hierarchy and you
 

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.569
know you have a lot of hierarchy and you
know one of the best ways to to kind of

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:07.579
know one of the best ways to to kind of
 

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:08.889
know one of the best ways to to kind of
flatten hierarchy is through search

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:08.899
flatten hierarchy is through search
 

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:10.660
flatten hierarchy is through search
right so you can obviously let the user

right so you can obviously let the user
you know drill down into different you

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560
you know drill down into different you
 

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.490
you know drill down into different you
know levels of hierarchy and that can be

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:15.500
know levels of hierarchy and that can be
 

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.680
know levels of hierarchy and that can be
tedious but sometimes it's warranted so

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:17.690
tedious but sometimes it's warranted so
 

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.389
tedious but sometimes it's warranted so

the more detailed information on time so
that's you know I had a very you know a

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.660
that's you know I had a very you know a
 

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.710
that's you know I had a very you know a
very very fast way of explaining this

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720
very very fast way of explaining this
 

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.600
very very fast way of explaining this
that's roughly what this

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:25.610
that's roughly what this
 

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.670
that's roughly what this
works like it looks like because of any

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680
works like it looks like because of any
 

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.380

other suggestions or other ways in which

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:29.390
other suggestions or other ways in which
 

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.120
other suggestions or other ways in which
you can you know potentially expose is

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.130
you can you know potentially expose is
 

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.800
you can you know potentially expose is
kind of large hierarchy well just you

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:35.810
kind of large hierarchy well just you
 

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.170
kind of large hierarchy well just you
come into earlier on but I think in the

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:38.180
come into earlier on but I think in the
 

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.780
come into earlier on but I think in the
shocking episode we did a while back you

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:40.790
shocking episode we did a while back you
 

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.100
shocking episode we did a while back you
had a really interesting presentation an

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.110
had a really interesting presentation an
 

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.389
had a really interesting presentation an
alternative to this way instead of

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399
alternative to this way instead of
 

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.400
alternative to this way instead of
having the search you had like a list of

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:45.410
having the search you had like a list of
 

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.530
having the search you had like a list of
articles you had a little view I client

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:47.540
articles you had a little view I client
 

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.970
articles you had a little view I client
muted like table today

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980
muted like table today
 

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.050
muted like table today
so there will be an alternative

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:50.060
so there will be an alternative
 

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.090
so there will be an alternative
presentation if you didn't have such a

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.100
presentation if you didn't have such a
 

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.280
presentation if you didn't have such a
very very deep hierarchy and you wanted

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:54.290
very very deep hierarchy and you wanted
 

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.720
very very deep hierarchy and you wanted
to be able to present them to use it to

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:55.730
to be able to present them to use it to
 

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.430
to be able to present them to use it to
the user to kind of give them the you

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440
the user to kind of give them the you
 

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.930
the user to kind of give them the you
know the the knowledge of what that is

00:15:58.930 --> 00:15:58.940
know the the knowledge of what that is
 

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.000
know the the knowledge of what that is
available what I really like about this

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.010

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.829
available what I really like about this
presentation with the search is not only

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839
presentation with the search is not only
 

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:04.300
presentation with the search is not only
is it kind of you know easier to

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:04.310
is it kind of you know easier to
 

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.579
is it kind of you know easier to
navigate a very large structure it also

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:06.589
navigate a very large structure it also
 

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:08.500
navigate a very large structure it also
makes it feel more like mine the idea of

like presenting me some you know given
 

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.460
like presenting me some you know given
list and then toggling it you know it's

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:12.470
list and then toggling it you know it's
 

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.930
list and then toggling it you know it's
very much kind of here's the things

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:13.940
very much kind of here's the things
 

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.220
very much kind of here's the things
available to you whereas searches like

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.230
available to you whereas searches like
 

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.509
available to you whereas searches like
here's the things like one it's kind of

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519

the app offers but having this very very

00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:30.019
the app offers but having this very very
 

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:31.990
the app offers but having this very very
small list makes it again more relevant

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000
small list makes it again more relevant
 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.730

design principles show me only what I

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:35.149
design principles show me only what I
 

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:37.389
design principles show me only what I
need when I need it and which I really

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399
need when I need it and which I really
 

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:39.850

kind of combat very heavy navigation

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440
kind of combat very heavy navigation
 

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.590

drawers and anytime you have navigation

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600
drawers and anytime you have navigation
 

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.550
drawers and anytime you have navigation
you want to make it as light as possible

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560
you want to make it as light as possible
 

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.310
you want to make it as light as possible
right you don't overburden the user with

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320
right you don't overburden the user with
 

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.600
right you don't overburden the user with
stuff that they have to think about

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:49.610
stuff that they have to think about
 

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.610
stuff that they have to think about
before they actually get to their

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:51.620
before they actually get to their
 

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.620
before they actually get to their
content right so this is just you know

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:53.630
content right so this is just you know
 

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.620
content right so this is just you know
one of the easy ways of doing that I

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.630
one of the easy ways of doing that I
 

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.210
one of the easy ways of doing that I
think when everyone's using a news app

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.220
think when everyone's using a news app
 

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.430
think when everyone's using a news app
you never really not all the sections

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440
you never really not all the sections
 

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.990
you never really not all the sections
are relevant to you so it's just really

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000
are relevant to you so it's just really
 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.250
are relevant to you so it's just really
nice to have to bubble them up quickly

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:03.260
nice to have to bubble them up quickly
 

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.380
nice to have to bubble them up quickly
and if hierarchy is really really deep

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.390
and if hierarchy is really really deep
 

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.789
and if hierarchy is really really deep
and really broad then it's just hard to

and really broad then it's just hard to
 

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:08.620
and really broad then it's just hard to
find those those items that you want to

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:08.630

I know we talked about it's quite a lot

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:22.339
I know we talked about it's quite a lot
 

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.340

in our design hangout to that just while

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:24.350
in our design hangout to that just while
 

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.270
in our design hangout to that just while
we're here a couple of things I really

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280
we're here a couple of things I really
 

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.699
we're here a couple of things I really
like about this and as you can see that

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:27.709
like about this and as you can see that
 

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:30.190
like about this and as you can see that
as the drawer opens we changed the

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200
as the drawer opens we changed the
 

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.440
as the drawer opens we changed the
screen title and drop the up caret and

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:32.450
screen title and drop the up caret and
 

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.290
screen title and drop the up caret and
and also drop that refresh icon so it's

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:35.300
and also drop that refresh icon so it's
 

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.490
and also drop that refresh icon so it's
really important that you know you keep

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:36.500
really important that you know you keep
 

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.290
really important that you know you keep
the action bar in place but you can die

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:38.300
the action bar in place but you can die
 

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.530
the action bar in place but you can die
now

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:38.540
now

navigation in sections open and I think

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760
navigation in sections open and I think
 

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.040
navigation in sections open and I think
another great thing talking about that

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.050
another great thing talking about that
 

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.630
another great thing talking about that

gesture on the list view type screen it
 

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.090
gesture on the list view type screen it
means you could do a whole Content swipe

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.100
means you could do a whole Content swipe
 

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.260

to open this drawer so it makes the
 

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.150
to open this drawer so it makes the
drawer that much more discoverable so

drawer that much more discoverable so
 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.620
drawer that much more discoverable so

waiver anyway yeah that clock is
probably wrong okay so let's we talked

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880
probably wrong okay so let's we talked
 

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.000
probably wrong okay so let's we talked
about that very quickly I wanted to talk

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.010
about that very quickly I wanted to talk
 

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.460
about that very quickly I wanted to talk
about some very last items here so the

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:15.470
about some very last items here so the
 

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.420
about some very last items here so the
other thing you want to obviously

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:16.430
other thing you want to obviously
 

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.670
other thing you want to obviously
optimize is the article reading

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:18.680
optimize is the article reading

experience you know there's you know one
 

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.350
experience you know there's you know one
of the ways in which you could look at

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360
of the ways in which you could look at
 

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.670
of the ways in which you could look at
this is there's a beginning of the

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:24.680
this is there's a beginning of the
 

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.290
this is there's a beginning of the
article a middle of the article where

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:26.300
article a middle of the article where
 

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.940
article a middle of the article where
you're kind of focusing on the content

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:27.950
you're kind of focusing on the content
 

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.020
you're kind of focusing on the content
and then the end of the article where

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.030
and then the end of the article where
 

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.370
and then the end of the article where
you're kind of winding down so the

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:30.380
you're kind of winding down so the
 

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.780
you're kind of winding down so the
beginning of the article you want to you

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:31.790
beginning of the article you want to you
 

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.190
beginning of the article you want to you
know see everything you wanna you know

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200
know see everything you wanna you know
 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.470
know see everything you wanna you know
see the action bar you want to see you

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480
see the action bar you want to see you
 

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.020
see the action bar you want to see you
know the title potentially share options

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:38.030
know the title potentially share options
 

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.310
know the title potentially share options
if like immediately want to share

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320
if like immediately want to share
 

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.930
if like immediately want to share
something but once you start you know

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:40.940
something but once you start you know
 

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.400
something but once you start you know
reading once you start scrolling down

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.410
reading once you start scrolling down
 

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.170
reading once you start scrolling down
one of the things you could do is you

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:44.180
one of the things you could do is you
 

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.790
one of the things you could do is you
can actually first of all go into

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:45.800
can actually first of all go into
 

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.740
can actually first of all go into
lights-out mode where the status bar

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:47.750
lights-out mode where the status bar
 

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.900
lights-out mode where the status bar
navigation bar kind of get into a dim

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:49.910
navigation bar kind of get into a dim
 

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.540
navigation bar kind of get into a dim
state and potentially the action bar can

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:52.550
state and potentially the action bar can
 

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.550
state and potentially the action bar can
you know hide right and this is kind of

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:54.560
you know hide right and this is kind of
 

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.050
you know hide right and this is kind of
similar to the quick return pattern

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:56.060
similar to the quick return pattern
 

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.700
similar to the quick return pattern
where you know you start scrolling down

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:57.710
where you know you start scrolling down
 

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.760
where you know you start scrolling down
maybe you know a few hundred pixels or

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:00.770
maybe you know a few hundred pixels or
 

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.730
maybe you know a few hundred pixels or
so or a few hundred dips and the action

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:03.740
so or a few hundred dips and the action
 

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.560
so or a few hundred dips and the action
bar kind of slides out of the way for

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:05.570
bar kind of slides out of the way for
 

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.030
bar kind of slides out of the way for
you and then as soon as you start

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.040
you and then as soon as you start
 

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.310
you and then as soon as you start
scrolling back up you may be kind of

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320
scrolling back up you may be kind of
 

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.620
scrolling back up you may be kind of
going you know backwards you may want to

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:11.630
going you know backwards you may want to
 

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.600
going you know backwards you may want to
you know see other options so you can

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.610
you know see other options so you can
 

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.310
you know see other options so you can
show the action bar again this could

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320
show the action bar again this could
 

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.470
show the action bar again this could
also be coupled with you know touch to

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480
also be coupled with you know touch to
 

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.840
also be coupled with you know touch to
to toggle the action bar so lots of

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:19.850
to toggle the action bar so lots of
 

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.890
to toggle the action bar so lots of
different things you can do here but the

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:20.900
different things you can do here but the
 

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.360
different things you can do here but the
idea is that if a user doesn't really

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:22.370
idea is that if a user doesn't really
 

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.300
idea is that if a user doesn't really
care about the actions in the kind of in

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:25.310
care about the actions in the kind of in
 

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.430
care about the actions in the kind of in

to show it always and then once you get

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360
to show it always and then once you get
 

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.700
to show it always and then once you get
to the end of the article the action bar

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:33.710
to the end of the article the action bar
 

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.290
to the end of the article the action bar
should slide back in because it has that

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:35.300
should slide back in because it has that
 

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.690
should slide back in because it has that
kind of key share action and you see

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:37.700
kind of key share action and you see
 

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.220
kind of key share action and you see
here the presentation with the share

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:39.230
here the presentation with the share
 

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.770
here the presentation with the share
action provider that gives you the kind

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:41.780
action provider that gives you the kind
 

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.540
action provider that gives you the kind
of the most frequently used or most

recently used shared destination and
 

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.230
recently used shared destination and
then you also see things like you know

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240
then you also see things like you know
 

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.730
then you also see things like you know
the comments obviously

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740
the comments obviously
 

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.830
the comments obviously
or in in this section you see here we

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840
or in in this section you see here we
 

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.000
or in in this section you see here we
kind of expose a little bit of that

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.010
kind of expose a little bit of that
 

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.460
kind of expose a little bit of that
hierarchy and then related stories and

hierarchy and then related stories and
 

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.500
hierarchy and then related stories and
the idea here is you know the only real

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:57.510
the idea here is you know the only real
 

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.450
the idea here is you know the only real
point here is that you don't want to

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460
point here is that you don't want to
 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.150
point here is that you don't want to
have the entire experience and there you

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160
have the entire experience and there you
 

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.860
have the entire experience and there you
know if there are things that the user

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:03.870
know if there are things that the user
 

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.540
know if there are things that the user
can really benefit from at the end of

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.550
can really benefit from at the end of
 

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.120
can really benefit from at the end of
this detail item you know related items

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.130
this detail item you know related items

or other things expose them right there
 

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.870
or other things expose them right there
so that they don't have to press back

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880
so that they don't have to press back
 

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.460
so that they don't have to press back
right the best experience is when you

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:13.470
right the best experience is when you
 

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.110
right the best experience is when you
don't actually have to press back or up

screens out there and there's you know a

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780
screens out there and there's you know a
 

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.210
screens out there and there's you know a
few things you have to think about when

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220
few things you have to think about when
 

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.890
few things you have to think about when
you talk about different types of screen

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900
you talk about different types of screen
 

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.720
you talk about different types of screen
and the one that most people tend to

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:53.730
and the one that most people tend to
 

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.549
and the one that most people tend to
lock onto is resolution right it's a

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559
lock onto is resolution right it's a
 

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:58.160
lock onto is resolution right it's a

you know densities of screen resolution

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:07.110
you know densities of screen resolution
 

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.110
you know densities of screen resolution
actually turns out to be not that you

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120
actually turns out to be not that you

when you're going to design you know

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520
when you're going to design you know
 

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.940
when you're going to design you know
content is going to go on to it right so

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:25.950
content is going to go on to it right so
 

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.919
content is going to go on to it right so
it turns out the resolution isn't as

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:27.929
it turns out the resolution isn't as
 

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:29.390
it turns out the resolution isn't as
interesting as talking about size and

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400
interesting as talking about size and
 

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.270
interesting as talking about size and
density so luckily Android has embraced

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280
density so luckily Android has embraced
 

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.890

this from the very start and we have

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900
this from the very start and we have
 

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.870
this from the very start and we have
this concept this kind of abstraction

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880
this concept this kind of abstraction
 

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.490
this concept this kind of abstraction
layer if you want called this density

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500
layer if you want called this density

you know size is like a finger is like
 

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.840
you know size is like a finger is like
77 millimeters big on average or

77 millimeters big on average or
 

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.919
77 millimeters big on average or
something like that so you want to size

00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:57.929
something like that so you want to size
 

00:21:57.929 --> 00:22:00.890
something like that so you want to size

devices so that they're easy to tap easy

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:04.780
devices so that they're easy to tap easy
 

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.040
devices so that they're easy to tap easy
to see and so forth so by using and this

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.050
to see and so forth so by using and this
 

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.360
to see and so forth so by using and this
this kind of like fake size you know

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.370
this kind of like fake size you know
 

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.010
this kind of like fake size you know
this dip and you don't have to worry

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.020
this dip and you don't have to worry
 

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.420
this dip and you don't have to worry
about how many pixels the screen

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.430
about how many pixels the screen
 

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.800
about how many pixels the screen
actually you know lights up to display

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:13.810
actually you know lights up to display
 

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.480
actually you know lights up to display
it you just kind of slide it so this

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.490
it you just kind of slide it so this
 

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.820
it you just kind of slide it so this
right kind of you know virtual size and

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:17.830
right kind of you know virtual size and
 

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.640
right kind of you know virtual size and
the screen will take care of it so one

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:20.650
the screen will take care of it so one
 

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.810
the screen will take care of it so one
thing I wanted to mention real quick is

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:21.820
thing I wanted to mention real quick is
 

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.060
thing I wanted to mention real quick is
that you know the core takeaway I think

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.070
that you know the core takeaway I think
 

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.410
that you know the core takeaway I think
from the rest of this if you're if

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:25.420
from the rest of this if you're if
 

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.820
from the rest of this if you're if
you're gonna take one thing away is that

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:26.830
you're gonna take one thing away is that
 

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.340
you're gonna take one thing away is that
you know as somebody that's working with

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:29.350
you know as somebody that's working with
 

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.410
you know as somebody that's working with
layout or as something that's working

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.420
layout or as something that's working
 

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.270
layout or as something that's working
with interaction design just forget

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280
with interaction design just forget
 

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.070
with interaction design just forget
about pixels like pixels don't matter

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080
about pixels like pixels don't matter
 

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.860
about pixels like pixels don't matter
right for visual design pixels matter

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:37.870
right for visual design pixels matter
 

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.900
right for visual design pixels matter
but for layout design interaction design

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:39.910
but for layout design interaction design
 

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.450
but for layout design interaction design
pixels just don't matter because dips

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:42.460
pixels just don't matter because dips
 

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.400
pixels just don't matter because dips
are kind of the way in which you kind of

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:44.410
are kind of the way in which you kind of
 

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.470
are kind of the way in which you kind of
make this entire world of designing for

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480
make this entire world of designing for
 

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.440
make this entire world of designing for
different densities sane yeah we'll pick

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.450
different densities sane yeah we'll pick
 

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.880
different densities sane yeah we'll pick
up on that it's kind of you control you

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:50.890
up on that it's kind of you control you
 

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.380
up on that it's kind of you control you
kind of sacrifice a little bit of like

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:52.390
kind of sacrifice a little bit of like
 

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.900
kind of sacrifice a little bit of like
precise control in order for sanity for

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:54.910
precise control in order for sanity for
 

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.220
precise control in order for sanity for
dealing with this vast array of

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:56.230
dealing with this vast array of
 

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.710
dealing with this vast array of
different devices out there and so yeah

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720
different devices out there and so yeah
 

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.240
different devices out there and so yeah
in the example here we've shown you have

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.250
in the example here we've shown you have
 

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.590
in the example here we've shown you have
a xhdpi device which might you know use

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600
a xhdpi device which might you know use
 

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.090
a xhdpi device which might you know use
four hundred pixels to display an item

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.100
four hundred pixels to display an item
 

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.950
four hundred pixels to display an item
and a mdpi device which might actually

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960
and a mdpi device which might actually
 

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.540
and a mdpi device which might actually
use 200 pixels but they're both the same

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.550
use 200 pixels but they're both the same
 

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.330
use 200 pixels but they're both the same
physical size as 200 different measure

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340
physical size as 200 different measure
 

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.470
physical size as 200 different measure
other as we showed the wrong device in

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480
other as we showed the wrong device in
 

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.840
other as we showed the wrong device in
that vision clothing yet the zoom is a

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:15.850
that vision clothing yet the zoom is a
 

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.120
that vision clothing yet the zoom is a
device that's mdpi so we've got a nexus

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.130
device that's mdpi so we've got a nexus
 

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.320
device that's mdpi so we've got a nexus
10 there we see which is actually

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:19.330
10 there we see which is actually
 

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.960
10 there we see which is actually
exception the Nexus S is hdpi in that

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:21.970
exception the Nexus S is hdpi in that
 

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.860
exception the Nexus S is hdpi in that
xhdpi but just forget about it right

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:24.870
xhdpi but just forget about it right
 

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.740
xhdpi but just forget about it right
let's move to next slide I'm calculating

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:28.750
let's move to next slide I'm calculating
 

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.800
let's move to next slide I'm calculating
do any you know talk about Kalkadoon

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:31.810
do any you know talk about Kalkadoon
 

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.010
do any you know talk about Kalkadoon
that's yeah so the the sort of baseline

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:35.020
that's yeah so the the sort of baseline
 

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.650
that's yeah so the the sort of baseline
dip value is is what we call em dpi or

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:37.660
dip value is is what we call em dpi or
 

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.850
dip value is is what we call em dpi or
160 160 dpi so this is sort of equation

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:41.860
160 160 dpi so this is sort of equation
 

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.200
160 160 dpi so this is sort of equation
they can use to calculate

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.210
they can use to calculate
 

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.090
they can use to calculate
pixels and dips and the sort of

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:45.100
pixels and dips and the sort of
 

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.180
pixels and dips and the sort of
conversion between them all so you can

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.190
conversion between them all so you can
 

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.670
conversion between them all so you can
basically take the DPI of a device so it

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:50.680
basically take the DPI of a device so it
 

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.440
basically take the DPI of a device so it
may be 160 but it could be something

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.450
may be 160 but it could be something
 

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.410
may be 160 but it could be something
else it could for example would be you

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:55.420
else it could for example would be you
 

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.960
else it could for example would be you
know HTTP io x HTTP I you divide it by

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:57.970
know HTTP io x HTTP I you divide it by
 

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.510
know HTTP io x HTTP I you divide it by
the baseline which is 160 and then that

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520
the baseline which is 160 and then that
 

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.850
the baseline which is 160 and then that
gives you your ratio of pixels to two

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:02.860
gives you your ratio of pixels to two
 

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.970
gives you your ratio of pixels to two
dips so so just just so I don't know if

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:05.980
dips so so just just so I don't know if
 

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.410
dips so so just just so I don't know if
I fumbled it any wording there but don't

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:07.420
I fumbled it any wording there but don't
 

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.780
I fumbled it any wording there but don't
forget this DPI and this dip so they're

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:09.790
forget this DPI and this dip so they're
 

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.210
forget this DPI and this dip so they're
very closely related you know one is the

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.220
very closely related you know one is the
 

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.680
very closely related you know one is the
actual density of the device

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:13.690
actual density of the device
 

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.509
actual density of the device
the other is these dip units that we're

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:15.519
the other is these dip units that we're
 

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:17.759
the other is these dip units that we're
talking about so yes that's why I do PPI

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:17.769
talking about so yes that's why I do PPI
 

00:24:17.769 --> 00:24:22.139
talking about so yes that's why I do PPI
is as I got dots per inch or PPI pixels

00:24:22.139 --> 00:24:22.149
is as I got dots per inch or PPI pixels
 

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:23.820
is as I got dots per inch or PPI pixels
per inch and then you have dips which is

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:23.830
per inch and then you have dips which is
 

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.639
per inch and then you have dips which is
density in the pinnacle so I think we've

00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:26.649
density in the pinnacle so I think we've
 

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:29.490
density in the pinnacle so I think we've
got some sample calculations here so

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:29.500
got some sample calculations here so
 

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.159
got some sample calculations here so
this mean sorry is to hammer this home

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:32.169
this mean sorry is to hammer this home
 

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:33.869
this mean sorry is to hammer this home
yeah I guess we got to be pretty fast

00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:33.879
yeah I guess we got to be pretty fast
 

00:24:33.879 --> 00:24:36.990
yeah I guess we got to be pretty fast
here so of course if the DPI of the

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000
here so of course if the DPI of the
 

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.299
here so of course if the DPI of the
device is 160 which is the standard then

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:39.309
device is 160 which is the standard then
 

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:41.639
device is 160 which is the standard then
one pixel equals one dip straight

00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:41.649
one pixel equals one dip straight
 

00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:43.080
one pixel equals one dip straight
forward

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.090
forward
 

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.419
forward
if the density that ice is 320 so double

00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:45.429
if the density that ice is 320 so double
 

00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:47.310
if the density that ice is 320 so double
the sort of standard baseline of 160

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320
the sort of standard baseline of 160
 

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.659
the sort of standard baseline of 160
then one dear pool equate to 2 pixels

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:50.669
then one dear pool equate to 2 pixels
 

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:54.090
then one dear pool equate to 2 pixels
yeah if you're coming from an iOS world

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:54.100
yeah if you're coming from an iOS world
 

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.259
yeah if you're coming from an iOS world
that's kind of similar to like the rest

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:55.269
that's kind of similar to like the rest
 

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:58.049
that's kind of similar to like the rest
of that is like act 2 X is IR xhdpi

00:24:58.049 --> 00:24:58.059
of that is like act 2 X is IR xhdpi
 

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:01.470
of that is like act 2 X is IR xhdpi
right yeah so just you know one example

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480
right yeah so just you know one example
 

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.450
right yeah so just you know one example
you know this is actually something that

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:03.460
you know this is actually something that
 

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.009
you know this is actually something that
the Wii best at anytime we've we've

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:05.019
the Wii best at anytime we've we've
 

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:06.720
the Wii best at anytime we've we've
talked about dips and presentations

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:06.730
talked about dips and presentations
 

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.299
talked about dips and presentations
we've we've asked this question so if

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:09.309
we've we've asked this question so if
 

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:10.680
we've we've asked this question so if
you look at the Nexus 7 screen

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:10.690
you look at the Nexus 7 screen
 

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.600
you look at the Nexus 7 screen
resolution 1280 by 800 right it's

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:12.610
resolution 1280 by 800 right it's
 

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.220
resolution 1280 by 800 right it's
actually the same as the Motorola Xoom

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:14.230
actually the same as the Motorola Xoom
 

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.950
actually the same as the Motorola Xoom
screen resolution 1280 by 800 and very

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960
screen resolution 1280 by 800 and very
 

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.049
screen resolution 1280 by 800 and very
similar to the Galaxy Nexus and the

00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:19.059
similar to the Galaxy Nexus and the
 

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.360
similar to the Galaxy Nexus and the
Nexus 4 is screen resolution 1280 by

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
Nexus 4 is screen resolution 1280 by
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.869
Nexus 4 is screen resolution 1280 by
something 768 720 but it's dip

00:25:24.869 --> 00:25:24.879
something 768 720 but it's dip
 

00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:26.940
something 768 720 but it's dip
resolution is very different so if you

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:26.950
resolution is very different so if you
 

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.119
resolution is very different so if you
you know plug in these values that the

00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:30.129
you know plug in these values that the
 

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:34.110
you know plug in these values that the
fact that Nexus 7 is 213 dpi and 1280 by

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120
fact that Nexus 7 is 213 dpi and 1280 by
 

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.139
fact that Nexus 7 is 213 dpi and 1280 by
800 you'll actually find that it's dip

00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:37.149
800 you'll actually find that it's dip
 

00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:42.389
800 you'll actually find that it's dip
resolution is 960 are roughly 960 by 600

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399
resolution is 960 are roughly 960 by 600
 

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:44.549
resolution is 960 are roughly 960 by 600
dips and that kind of helps you figure

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559
dips and that kind of helps you figure
 

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:47.159
dips and that kind of helps you figure
out you know how much content will fit

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:47.169
out you know how much content will fit
 

00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:48.570
out you know how much content will fit
into this space right screen real estate

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:48.580
into this space right screen real estate
 

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.029
into this space right screen real estate
is really available for you to work with

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039
is really available for you to work with
 

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:52.740
is really available for you to work with
you yeah so when you think about screen

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:52.750
you yeah so when you think about screen
 

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.450
you yeah so when you think about screen
real estate like definitely don't think

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:54.460
real estate like definitely don't think
 

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.350
real estate like definitely don't think
in pixels thinking dips okay so yes

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360
in pixels thinking dips okay so yes
 

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.230
in pixels thinking dips okay so yes

this resolution not the pixel resolution
 

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.970
this resolution not the pixel resolution
so make sure that you use this

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:14.980
so make sure that you use this
 

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.680
so make sure that you use this
resolution when looking at the resolute

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:16.690

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.410
so with grids you just briefly talk

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:24.420
so with grids you just briefly talk
 

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.300
so with grids you just briefly talk
about some of the grids that you should

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:26.310
about some of the grids that you should
 

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.920
about some of the grids that you should
be using when you're doing layout so

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:27.930
be using when you're doing layout so
 

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.780
be using when you're doing layout so
once you you know kind of are in this

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:29.790
once you you know kind of are in this
 

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.480
once you you know kind of are in this
world of dips you know after that you

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:32.490
world of dips you know after that you
 

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.470
world of dips you know after that you
kind of need to start thinking about

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480
kind of need to start thinking about
 

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.270
kind of need to start thinking about
laying out your elements so obviously on

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:35.280
laying out your elements so obviously on
 

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.470
laying out your elements so obviously on
on Android you want to make sure that

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480
on Android you want to make sure that
 

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.910
on Android you want to make sure that
you use you know constraint based

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:37.920
you use you know constraint based
 

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920
you use you know constraint based
layouts so you know don't say this

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:39.930
layouts so you know don't say this
 

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.690
layouts so you know don't say this
should be exactly 200 dips or this

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700
should be exactly 200 dips or this
 

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.670
should be exactly 200 dips or this
should be exactly 300 and that'll you

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:43.680
should be exactly 300 and that'll you
 

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.380
should be exactly 300 and that'll you
know roughly fill the space make sure

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:45.390
know roughly fill the space make sure
 

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.340
know roughly fill the space make sure
that you're using things like this

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:46.350
that you're using things like this
 

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.650
that you're using things like this
should be 20% of the screen or 20% of

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:48.660
should be 20% of the screen or 20% of
 

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.400
should be 20% of the screen or 20% of
the available real estate and then you

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:52.410
the available real estate and then you
 

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.360
the available real estate and then you
know make sure that you're using

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:53.370
know make sure that you're using
 

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.400
know make sure that you're using
straight base layout layout as well like

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:55.410
straight base layout layout as well like
 

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.990
straight base layout layout as well like
this should be to the right of this and

this should be to the right of this and
 

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.140
this should be to the right of this and
there should be below that but also you

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:00.150
there should be below that but also you
 

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.480
there should be below that but also you
know you want to use some basic sizes so

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:02.490
know you want to use some basic sizes so
 

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.280
know you want to use some basic sizes so
to the things that we generally

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.290
to the things that we generally
 

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.350
to the things that we generally
recommend using and to the things that

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360
recommend using and to the things that
 

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.790
recommend using and to the things that
we document on developer that enter that

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:07.800

comma flash design are our 48 dip rhythm

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:10.950
comma flash design are our 48 dip rhythm
 

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.350
comma flash design are our 48 dip rhythm
which basically says that you know

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360
which basically says that you know
 

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.880
which basically says that you know
roughly both vertically and horizontally

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:13.890
roughly both vertically and horizontally
 

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.190
roughly both vertically and horizontally
you should try to you know structure

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200
you should try to you know structure
 

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.800
you should try to you know structure
items around you know 48 dips and width

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:18.810
items around you know 48 dips and width
 

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.990
items around you know 48 dips and width
and height especially touch target touch

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000
and height especially touch target touch
 

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.700
and height especially touch target touch
targets the minimum size should really

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:22.710
targets the minimum size should really
 

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.540
targets the minimum size should really
be 48 dips but you know 48 dips 96 dips

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:26.550
be 48 dips but you know 48 dips 96 dips
 

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.150
be 48 dips but you know 48 dips 96 dips
multiples of 48 things like that work

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:29.160
multiples of 48 things like that work
 

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.630
multiples of 48 things like that work
well but with with the things like

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640
well but with with the things like
 

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.420
well but with with the things like
spacing and margins and padding you want

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:35.430
spacing and margins and padding you want
 

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.220
spacing and margins and padding you want
to try to use a forever feel like a four

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:37.230
to try to use a forever feel like a four
 

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.410
to try to use a forever feel like a four
dip grid so what that means is that you

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:39.420
dip grid so what that means is that you
 

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.860
dip grid so what that means is that you
know the very smallest size or amount of

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:42.870
know the very smallest size or amount of
 

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.360
know the very smallest size or amount of
space between two items should be about

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.370
space between two items should be about
 

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.430
space between two items should be about
four dips or zero right if it's it's

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440
four dips or zero right if it's it's
 

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.580
four dips or zero right if it's it's
completely flush but also it means that

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.590
completely flush but also it means that
 

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.470
completely flush but also it means that
you should use you know multiples of

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480
you should use you know multiples of
 

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.510
you should use you know multiples of
four as things like margins you know so

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520
four as things like margins you know so
 

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.890
four as things like margins you know so
the margins around your screen should be

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900
the margins around your screen should be
 

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.550
the margins around your screen should be
you know 16 dips or 32 dips and then in

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:58.560
you know 16 dips or 32 dips and then in
 

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.590
you know 16 dips or 32 dips and then in
some cases you know you want to use like

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600
some cases you know you want to use like
 

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.810
some cases you know you want to use like
eight dip spacers so you know what I

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820
eight dip spacers so you know what I
 

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.300
eight dip spacers so you know what I
generally do as a designer is I use you

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:05.310
generally do as a designer is I use you
 

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.670
generally do as a designer is I use you
know 4 dips very rarely I use mostly

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:07.680
know 4 dips very rarely I use mostly
 

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.180
know 4 dips very rarely I use mostly
either 0 8 or 16 as my primary you know

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:11.190
either 0 8 or 16 as my primary you know
 

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.190
either 0 8 or 16 as my primary you know
of padding's and then on tablets I

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200
of padding's and then on tablets I
 

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.080
of padding's and then on tablets I
actually used larger ones select 16 or

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.090
actually used larger ones select 16 or
 

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.020
actually used larger ones select 16 or
32 or things like that so in general you

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.030
32 or things like that so in general you
 

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.730
32 or things like that so in general you
know think in terms of multiples of 4

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740
know think in terms of multiples of 4
 

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.770
know think in terms of multiples of 4
and then think about this 48 deeper than

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:21.780
and then think about this 48 deeper than
 

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.670
and then think about this 48 deeper than
where everything should really just

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:22.680
where everything should really just
 

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.980
where everything should really just
align to you know multiples of 48 in a

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:24.990
align to you know multiples of 48 in a

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360
this 48 it rhythm so that you know if
 

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.730
this 48 it rhythm so that you know if
you've got software navigation like on a

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740
you've got software navigation like on a

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:40.330
kind of you know falling into the rhythm
 

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.090
kind of you know falling into the rhythm
of this layout means your your app will

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:42.100
of this layout means your your app will
 

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.320
of this layout means your your app will
kind of fit in with the rhythm of the

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:43.330
kind of fit in with the rhythm of the
 

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.640
kind of fit in with the rhythm of the
page you know kind of Gestalt principles

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:44.650
page you know kind of Gestalt principles
 

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.540
page you know kind of Gestalt principles
yeah alright let's move on

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:47.550
yeah alright let's move on
 

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.120
yeah alright let's move on
so you're just an example of some of our

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.130
so you're just an example of some of our
 

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.770
so you're just an example of some of our
layouts and Nicki want to talk about the

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:52.780
layouts and Nicki want to talk about the
 

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.650
layouts and Nicki want to talk about the
red lines yeah so as you were saying

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:55.660
red lines yeah so as you were saying
 

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.520
red lines yeah so as you were saying
earlier when you're talking about layout

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:56.530
earlier when you're talking about layout
 

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.690
earlier when you're talking about layout
you talking about you know what you're

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:57.700
you talking about you know what you're
 

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.740
you talking about you know what you're
gonna put on a page you want to forget

00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:58.750
gonna put on a page you want to forget
 

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.090
gonna put on a page you want to forget
about physical pixels and you want to

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:00.100
about physical pixels and you want to
 

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.410
about physical pixels and you want to
work in dips as I say you want to

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:01.420
work in dips as I say you want to
 

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.780
work in dips as I say you want to
prepare a layout for like a 10-inch type

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:03.790
prepare a layout for like a 10-inch type
 

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.880
prepare a layout for like a 10-inch type
device you know that size of screen then

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:05.890
device you know that size of screen then
 

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.080
device you know that size of screen then
you don't want to think about the raw

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:07.090
you don't want to think about the raw
 

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.330
you don't want to think about the raw
pixels you want to you know create your

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:09.340
pixels you want to you know create your
 

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.340
pixels you want to you know create your
canvas the all-union using an

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.350
canvas the all-union using an
 

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.170
canvas the all-union using an
illustrator or photoshop or fireworks or

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.180
illustrator or photoshop or fireworks or
 

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.270
illustrator or photoshop or fireworks or
whatever it might be to the dip size and

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.280
whatever it might be to the dip size and
 

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.130
whatever it might be to the dip size and
you know work at this baseline

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:17.140
you know work at this baseline
 

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.200
you know work at this baseline
resolution tip size so then when you do

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.210
resolution tip size so then when you do
 

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.850
resolution tip size so then when you do
your layout like the red line like we're

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:20.860
your layout like the red line like we're
 

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.730
your layout like the red line like we're
showing here the items like one pixel

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:23.740
showing here the items like one pixel
 

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.650
showing here the items like one pixel
therefore translates straight into one

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:25.660
therefore translates straight into one
 

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.570
therefore translates straight into one
dip so it's really really easy to do

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:27.580
dip so it's really really easy to do
 

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.400
dip so it's really really easy to do
your layout at this resolution and then

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:29.410
your layout at this resolution and then
 

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.410
your layout at this resolution and then
communicate that to your developers you

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:31.420
communicate that to your developers you
 

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.910
communicate that to your developers you
know hand them these red lines and show

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:32.920
know hand them these red lines and show
 

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.410
know hand them these red lines and show
them that these are the sizes and dips

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:34.420
them that these are the sizes and dips
 

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.390
them that these are the sizes and dips
that things need to clean it also works

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:36.400
that things need to clean it also works
 

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.980
that things need to clean it also works
well with like redlining tools there are

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:37.990
well with like redlining tools there are
 

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.680
well with like redlining tools there are
some tools for fireworks like inspector

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:40.690
some tools for fireworks like inspector
 

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.660
some tools for fireworks like inspector
or suspect there's some like that that

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:42.670
or suspect there's some like that that
 

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.100
or suspect there's some like that that
actually create these red lines for you

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.110
actually create these red lines for you
 

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.530
actually create these red lines for you
not these exact ones but the good thing

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:46.540
not these exact ones but the good thing
 

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.000
not these exact ones but the good thing
is that if you work with one pixel

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.010
is that if you work with one pixel
 

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.410
is that if you work with one pixel
equals one death and that baseline

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:49.420
equals one death and that baseline
 

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.990
equals one death and that baseline
density then it kind of uses the correct

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000
density then it kind of uses the correct
 

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.060
density then it kind of uses the correct
values so you have to do any sort of

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.070
values so you have to do any sort of
 

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.670
values so you have to do any sort of
like doubling or halving or anything

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:55.680
like doubling or halving or anything
 

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.500
like doubling or halving or anything
yeah yes I think we kind of hammering

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:58.510
yeah yes I think we kind of hammering
 

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.540
yeah yes I think we kind of hammering
home here is layout is dips forget about

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.550
home here is layout is dips forget about
 

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.970
home here is layout is dips forget about
physical pixels layout equals dips

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:02.980
physical pixels layout equals dips
 

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.070
physical pixels layout equals dips
little about that yeah once like I guess

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080
little about that yeah once like I guess
 

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.690
little about that yeah once like I guess
yeah if we go into the next slide one

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:09.700
yeah if we go into the next slide one
 

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.670
yeah if we go into the next slide one
slight and you know variation on dips

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:11.680
slight and you know variation on dips
 

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.350
slight and you know variation on dips
and is when we're talking about text

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360
and is when we're talking about text
 

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.230
and is when we're talking about text
sizing so and this is very closely

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240
sizing so and this is very closely
 

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.880
sizing so and this is very closely
related to dips but and we have to

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:17.890
related to dips but and we have to
 

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.040
related to dips but and we have to
introduce you know the ability the user

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.050
introduce you know the ability the user
 

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.900
introduce you know the ability the user
has the ability to scale the text up and

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:21.910
has the ability to scale the text up and
 

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.230
has the ability to scale the text up and
down as a user preference it's really a

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240
down as a user preference it's really a
 

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.550
down as a user preference it's really a
climate accessibility feature so you

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:26.560
climate accessibility feature so you
 

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.140
climate accessibility feature so you
know some users just need to have larger

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.150
know some users just need to have larger
 

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.170
know some users just need to have larger
text so whenever you're sizing any any

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:31.180
text so whenever you're sizing any any
 

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.550
text so whenever you're sizing any any
text for your layout so you need to be

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:32.560
text for your layout so you need to be
 

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.650
text for your layout so you need to be
using this SP unit the scale independent

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:34.660
using this SP unit the scale independent
 

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.500
using this SP unit the scale independent
pixel and if the users kind of not

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:37.510
pixel and if the users kind of not
 

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.720
pixel and if the users kind of not
change their kind of scale than one SP

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:39.730
change their kind of scale than one SP
 

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.900
change their kind of scale than one SP
and will equal one DP and but you need

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:42.910
and will equal one DP and but you need
 

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.250
and will equal one DP and but you need
to bear in mind that the user can bump

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.260
to bear in mind that the user can bump
 

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.650
to bear in mind that the user can bump
that both up and down so you can I get

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:46.660
that both up and down so you can I get
 

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:46.950
that both up and down so you can I get
like

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960
like
 

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.990
like
to scare like what is it like 1.2 X or 1

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000
to scare like what is it like 1.2 X or 1
 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.730
to scare like what is it like 1.2 X or 1
before exercise if you bunk it up or it

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:50.740
before exercise if you bunk it up or it
 

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.560
before exercise if you bunk it up or it
might be slightly smaller so you need to

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:52.570
might be slightly smaller so you need to
 

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.750
might be slightly smaller so you need to
respect that users you know chosen

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760
respect that users you know chosen
 

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.690
respect that users you know chosen
chosen setting and scale your units your

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:57.700
chosen setting and scale your units your
 

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.389
chosen setting and scale your units your
text in SPS yeah so that means if you're

00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399
text in SPS yeah so that means if you're
 

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:02.130
text in SPS yeah so that means if you're
if you actually have like two content

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:02.140
if you actually have like two content
 

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.960
if you actually have like two content
blocks right like two pieces of text

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:03.970
blocks right like two pieces of text
 

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.399
blocks right like two pieces of text
that are adjacent you know make sure

00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:05.409
that are adjacent you know make sure
 

00:31:05.409 --> 00:31:07.110
that are adjacent you know make sure
that you know the spacing between them

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120
that you know the spacing between them
 

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.970
that you know the spacing between them
for example scales with the text size

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:08.980
for example scales with the text size
 

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.190
for example scales with the text size
you also want to use SP units for the

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200
you also want to use SP units for the
 

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.620
you also want to use SP units for the
like the margins for example generally

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:13.630
like the margins for example generally
 

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.180
like the margins for example generally
we use SP units for like text size

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.190
we use SP units for like text size
 

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.830
we use SP units for like text size
attributes but they're useful in other

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840
attributes but they're useful in other
 

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.450
attributes but they're useful in other
cases when you want to make sure be very

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:18.460
cases when you want to make sure be very
 

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.159
cases when you want to make sure be very
cognizant of you know spacing between

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:20.169
cognizant of you know spacing between
 

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:24.090
cognizant of you know spacing between
texts and things of that is a good way

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:24.100
texts and things of that is a good way
 

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.019
texts and things of that is a good way
to test your apps right if you're

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:25.029
to test your apps right if you're
 

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.919
to test your apps right if you're
worried about you know you want to test

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:25.929
worried about you know you want to test
 

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:27.330
worried about you know you want to test
your layouts to the extreme then change

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:27.340
your layouts to the extreme then change
 

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.769
your layouts to the extreme then change
the language to German and put the

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:28.779
the language to German and put the
 

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:30.810
the language to German and put the
scaling feature up to maximum and see

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:30.820
scaling feature up to maximum and see
 

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.940
scaling feature up to maximum and see
how your how your layout handles it so

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:32.950
how your how your layout handles it so
 

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.700
how your how your layout handles it so
we got a flight in Rio novo let's fly

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:35.710
we got a flight in Rio novo let's fly
 

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.990
we got a flight in Rio novo let's fly
through so do ya

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000
through so do ya
 

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.430
through so do ya
I was going to say they say yeah when we

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440
I was going to say they say yeah when we
 

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.630
I was going to say they say yeah when we
talk about layout then you wanted to go

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640
talk about layout then you wanted to go
 

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.519
talk about layout then you wanted to go
about physical pixels but when we're

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:44.529
about physical pixels but when we're
 

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:46.560
about physical pixels but when we're
talking about bitmap assets then you

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:46.570
talking about bitmap assets then you
 

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.539
talking about bitmap assets then you
absolutely need to think in pixels so

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:48.549
absolutely need to think in pixels so
 

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:49.980
absolutely need to think in pixels so
you know the only thing that changes

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:49.990
you know the only thing that changes
 

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.510
you know the only thing that changes
when you go to from you know some like

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:51.520
when you go to from you know some like
 

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.130
when you go to from you know some like
the zoom to the nexus 10 which has the

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.140
the zoom to the nexus 10 which has the
 

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.010
the zoom to the nexus 10 which has the
same kind of layout size and dips is you

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.020
same kind of layout size and dips is you
 

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.720
same kind of layout size and dips is you
need your assets to be crisp right if

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:57.730
need your assets to be crisp right if
 

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.220
need your assets to be crisp right if
you were just used the exact same assets

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.230
you were just used the exact same assets
 

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.930
you were just used the exact same assets
from a from an MDP air device on an

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:00.940
from a from an MDP air device on an
 

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.760
from a from an MDP air device on an
xhdpi device then they'll be super

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:02.770
xhdpi device then they'll be super
 

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.370
xhdpi device then they'll be super
blurry so this is where this and we

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:05.380
blurry so this is where this and we
 

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.870
blurry so this is where this and we
introduced this concept of density

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880
introduced this concept of density
 

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.769
introduced this concept of density
buckets

00:32:07.769 --> 00:32:07.779
buckets
 

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:09.360
buckets
it lets you like nothing about raw

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:09.370
it lets you like nothing about raw
 

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.590
it lets you like nothing about raw
density but kind of group them together

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600
density but kind of group them together
 

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.149
density but kind of group them together
into these kind of illogical densities

00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159
into these kind of illogical densities
 

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:14.340
into these kind of illogical densities
here so as we've talked about all along

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:14.350
here so as we've talked about all along
 

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.070
here so as we've talked about all along
we have this mdpi bucket or 160 dpi is

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080
we have this mdpi bucket or 160 dpi is
 

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.480
we have this mdpi bucket or 160 dpi is
our baseline and we're all the first

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:18.490
our baseline and we're all the first
 

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.310
our baseline and we're all the first
android devices came out and slowly

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320
android devices came out and slowly
 

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.659
android devices came out and slowly
that's kind of drifted upwards into

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:21.669
that's kind of drifted upwards into
 

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:25.019
that's kind of drifted upwards into
where it arranged now we're xhdpi is

00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:25.029
where it arranged now we're xhdpi is
 

00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:27.600
where it arranged now we're xhdpi is
kind of like the norm on most phones and

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:27.610
kind of like the norm on most phones and
 

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.049
kind of like the norm on most phones and
XX seems to be perhaps coming in and so

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:31.059
XX seems to be perhaps coming in and so
 

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:32.399
XX seems to be perhaps coming in and so
the idea here is that if you have an

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:32.409
the idea here is that if you have an
 

00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:33.779
the idea here is that if you have an
icon like we show here in the right-hand

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:33.789
icon like we show here in the right-hand
 

00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:36.210

dips on an mdpi device that would

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:38.500
dips on an mdpi device that would
 

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.740
dips on an mdpi device that would
translate into 50 by 30 pixels but on an

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:40.750
translate into 50 by 30 pixels but on an
 

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.779
translate into 50 by 30 pixels but on an
xhdpi device that would actually turn

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:42.789
xhdpi device that would actually turn
 

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:45.450
xhdpi device that would actually turn
out to be 64 by 64 pixels so you have

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:45.460
out to be 64 by 64 pixels so you have
 

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.980
out to be 64 by 64 pixels so you have
complete control over there you know a

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:46.990
complete control over there you know a
 

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.930
complete control over there you know a
pixel perfect icon on an xhdpi device

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:48.940
pixel perfect icon on an xhdpi device
 

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.740
pixel perfect icon on an xhdpi device
you can draw it at 64 by 64 and and then

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:52.750
you can draw it at 64 by 64 and and then
 

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.389
you can draw it at 64 by 64 and and then
you know the device will pick the right

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399
you know the device will pick the right
 

00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:57.130
you know the device will pick the right

just quickly here there's sort of the

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:02.630
just quickly here there's sort of the
 

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.510
just quickly here there's sort of the
key density buckets so you should not

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:04.520
key density buckets so you should not
 

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.950
key density buckets so you should not
generally provide all your assets in

those densities the other ones are sort
 

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.330
those densities the other ones are sort
of less common but you may potentially

we're off site and the room is going to

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:30.800
we're off site and the room is going to
 

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.990
we're off site and the room is going to
come back to talk about some techniques

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000
come back to talk about some techniques
 

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.760
come back to talk about some techniques
you can use to actually you know do this

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:33.770
you can use to actually you know do this
 

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.910
you can use to actually you know do this
a little bit more smartly but yeah just

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:36.920
a little bit more smartly but yeah just
 

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.260

moving for to the next slide and this is

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.270
moving for to the next slide and this is
 

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.520
moving for to the next slide and this is
the kind of concept I want to talk about

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:39.530
the kind of concept I want to talk about
 

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.900
the kind of concept I want to talk about
is a you don't really want to design

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:40.910
is a you don't really want to design
 

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.700
is a you don't really want to design
your your application you know

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:42.710
your your application you know
 

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.020
your your application you know
specifically around a certain device

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.030
specifically around a certain device
 

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.670
specifically around a certain device
because you know the device landscapes

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:45.680
because you know the device landscapes
 

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.810
because you know the device landscapes
changing all the time it's kind of

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:46.820
changing all the time it's kind of
 

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.120
changing all the time it's kind of
giving end up chasing your own tail

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.130
giving end up chasing your own tail
 

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.440
giving end up chasing your own tail
so using these techniques of you know

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:50.450
so using these techniques of you know
 

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.240
so using these techniques of you know
only thinking in depth for layout and

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:52.250
only thinking in depth for layout and
 

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.280
only thinking in depth for layout and
only thinking about density for pics all

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.290
only thinking about density for pics all
 

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.010
only thinking about density for pics all
assets for bitmap assets is your route

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.020
assets for bitmap assets is your route
 

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.080
assets for bitmap assets is your route
to happiness for you know device future

00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.090
to happiness for you know device future
 

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.690
to happiness for you know device future
devices so the example kept on going

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:01.700
devices so the example kept on going
 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.280
devices so the example kept on going
back to here is you know if you had

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:03.290
back to here is you know if you had
 

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.050
back to here is you know if you had
provided a layout for something like the

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.060
provided a layout for something like the
 

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.580
provided a layout for something like the
Motorola Xoom the first generation of

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:06.590
Motorola Xoom the first generation of
 

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.530
Motorola Xoom the first generation of
Android tablets came out and which was

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:08.540
Android tablets came out and which was
 

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.210
Android tablets came out and which was
like 1280 by 800 and you had provided

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:10.220
like 1280 by 800 and you had provided
 

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.580
like 1280 by 800 and you had provided
and you know xhdpi these kind of high

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:12.590
and you know xhdpi these kind of high
 

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.890
and you know xhdpi these kind of high
high density bitmap assets for something

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:14.900
high density bitmap assets for something
 

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.900
high density bitmap assets for something
like the Galaxy Nexus all of a sudden

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:16.910
like the Galaxy Nexus all of a sudden
 

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.430
like the Galaxy Nexus all of a sudden
when a device like the Nexus 10 comes

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440
when a device like the Nexus 10 comes
 

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.300
when a device like the Nexus 10 comes
out which you know you've mine I've

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:19.310
out which you know you've mine I've
 

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.560
out which you know you've mine I've
heard about you know a year ago when you

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:20.570
heard about you know a year ago when you
 

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.720
heard about you know a year ago when you
did this it'll pick the same layouts as

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.730
did this it'll pick the same layouts as
 

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.250
did this it'll pick the same layouts as
the Motorola Xoom your pick and you know

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:24.260
the Motorola Xoom your pick and you know
 

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.350
the Motorola Xoom your pick and you know
the high-density bitmap assets from the

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:26.360
the high-density bitmap assets from the
 

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.150
the high-density bitmap assets from the
from the phones and put them together

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:28.160
from the phones and put them together
 

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.100
from the phones and put them together
and have this you know you know

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.110
and have this you know you know
 

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.560
and have this you know you know
optimized looking layout and and clear

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:32.570
optimized looking layout and and clear
 

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.970
optimized looking layout and and clear
assets so it's a really really nice

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:33.980
assets so it's a really really nice
 

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.260
assets so it's a really really nice
system to be able to think about these

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.270
system to be able to think about these
 

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.920
system to be able to think about these
things to you things separately mm-hmm

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:37.930
things to you things separately mm-hmm
 

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:41.380

moving on really quick pixel grid tips

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:41.390
moving on really quick pixel grid tips
 

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:43.240
moving on really quick pixel grid tips
so when you're doing asset production

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:43.250
so when you're doing asset production
 

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.210
so when you're doing asset production
this is actually one general tip and you

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.220
this is actually one general tip and you
 

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.650
this is actually one general tip and you
can kind of tweak this as you see fit

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:47.660
can kind of tweak this as you see fit
 

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.870
can kind of tweak this as you see fit
one thing that I generally do is use a

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:49.880
one thing that I generally do is use a
 

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.110
one thing that I generally do is use a
four pixel grid for designing assets and

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:53.120
four pixel grid for designing assets and
 

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.110
four pixel grid for designing assets and
I start with xhdpi so you can see here

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:56.120
I start with xhdpi so you can see here
 

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.310
I start with xhdpi so you can see here
you know starting with xhdpi

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320
you know starting with xhdpi
 

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.620
you know starting with xhdpi
lining things up to a four pixel grid

00:34:59.620 --> 00:34:59.630
lining things up to a four pixel grid
 

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.600
lining things up to a four pixel grid
means that you can actually then scale

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:01.610
means that you can actually then scale
 

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.210
means that you can actually then scale
down to http IM DPI and i'm not sure

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:04.220
down to http IM DPI and i'm not sure
 

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.980
down to http IM DPI and i'm not sure
about ldpi but probably all dpi as well

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:05.990
about ldpi but probably all dpi as well
 

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.980
about ldpi but probably all dpi as well
and get really really crisp borders so

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:08.990
and get really really crisp borders so
 

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.700
and get really really crisp borders so
this is actually something that we do

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:10.710
this is actually something that we do
 

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.170
this is actually something that we do
our system assets so if you look at the

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180
our system assets so if you look at the
 

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.260
our system assets so if you look at the
default button asset the kind of the

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:15.270
default button asset the kind of the
 

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.030
default button asset the kind of the
pressed state for the button you'll

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040
pressed state for the button you'll
 

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.849
pressed state for the button you'll
notice that the size of the of the kind

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859
notice that the size of the of the kind
 

00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:23.180
notice that the size of the of the kind
of glow around the core shape is eight

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:23.190
of glow around the core shape is eight
 

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.370
of glow around the core shape is eight
pixels and the reason for that is that

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380
pixels and the reason for that is that
 

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.570
pixels and the reason for that is that
you know the reason it's not seven

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:26.580
you know the reason it's not seven
 

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.460
you know the reason it's not seven
pixels or five pixels is that it scales

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:28.470
pixels or five pixels is that it scales
 

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.470
pixels or five pixels is that it scales
down really really nicely so there's

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480
down really really nicely so there's
 

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.670
down really really nicely so there's
just kind of a quick tip if you're doing

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680
just kind of a quick tip if you're doing
 

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.099
just kind of a quick tip if you're doing
asset production you know aligning to a

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:34.109
asset production you know aligning to a
 

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:35.480
asset production you know aligning to a
four pixel grid is really really useful

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.490
four pixel grid is really really useful
 

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:40.040
four pixel grid is really really useful
for scaling down okay so that was it for

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.050
for scaling down okay so that was it for
 

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.349
for scaling down okay so that was it for
units of measure we flew through them

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359
units of measure we flew through them
 

00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:43.579
units of measure we flew through them
there's they're still you know we're

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:43.589
there's they're still you know we're
 

00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:45.500
there's they're still you know we're
still over time let's really briefly

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:45.510
still over time let's really briefly
 

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.859
still over time let's really briefly
talk about design news actually anything

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:48.869
talk about design news actually anything
 

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:50.060
talk about design news actually anything
Before we jump into that any kind of

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:50.070
Before we jump into that any kind of
 

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.370
Before we jump into that any kind of
parting thoughts on pixels and dips and

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380
parting thoughts on pixels and dips and
 

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.450
parting thoughts on pixels and dips and
things now yeahit's layouts dips always

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460
things now yeahit's layouts dips always
 

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.020
things now yeahit's layouts dips always
easy yeah let's play out some day okay

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.030
easy yeah let's play out some day okay
 

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.780
easy yeah let's play out some day okay
so design news the first is we actually

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.790
so design news the first is we actually
 

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.849
so design news the first is we actually
have a New York Android designers meetup

visual designs and if you're interested
 

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.440
visual designs and if you're interested
in doing this and you're I think I don't

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.450
in doing this and you're I think I don't
 

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.480
in doing this and you're I think I don't

going over time yes so yeah so that's
 

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.170
going over time yes so yeah so that's
kind of his updated version of the UI

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:25.180
kind of his updated version of the UI
 

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.840
kind of his updated version of the UI
design kit all right and I think that's

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:27.850
design kit all right and I think that's
 

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:32.100
design kit all right and I think that's
it for the content today any parting

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:32.110
it for the content today any parting
 

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.660
