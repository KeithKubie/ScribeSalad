00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.170
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
Last month, Farrah

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.390
launched her new book, "The
Discomfort Zone," which

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm sure you've seen by now.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.840
And she's here to tell
us a little bit more

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.870
about that today.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.280
So let's first delve a little
bit into her, and her journey,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.420
and what brought her here today.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.964
So hello.

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:22.130
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.780
FARRAH STORR: Biographies
are so weird because you

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.030
feel like you're going to
be vastly underwhelming now.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.892
But yeah, that's my
sheen, but you know--

00:00:30.892 --> 00:00:32.100
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Absolutely.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.250
Well--

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.759
FARRAH STORR: I
always think people

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.140
should-- we should talk
about their failures

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.450
before-- because it's just all
about your successes, isn't it?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.340
And actually, it's like,
actually, Farrah Storr

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.298
didn't get into Oxford.

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.060
Farrah Storr bombed
out at this job.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.410
But-- we'll do that next time.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.180
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: That's fine.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.940
Well, we'll cover it.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.398
We'll definitely
cover it because I

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:48.000
think that's really
important as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520
So tell us about your early
years at "Cosmopolitan."

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.830
When you first
started back in 2015,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.400
you'd come from
"Women's Health."

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.940
You had successfully
risen up from the trenches

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.130
as in your launch.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.820
And what made you
move on to "Cosmo"

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.930
after such a successful
time at that magazine?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.640
FARRAH STORR:
Well, so I launched

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.467
"Women's Health" with kind of--

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:12.550
it was really challenging.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.383
So I never thought I
wanted to be an editor.

00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:15.820
I thought I wanted
to be a writer.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.770
And editorships do not
come up very often.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.370
And so when "Women's
Health" came up,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.140
it was not a typical editorship.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.720
It was kind of two
people, three people,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.910
including me, in a room.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.420
We had six weeks to get
this magazine together,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.020
and we had minimal resources.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.710
And we had to sell 100,000
copies from issue 1.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280
And so we had massive
expectations on us.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.140
And against all the
odds somehow, we

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240
managed to make a big
success of that magazine.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.550
And so by the time
I'd been doing

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.020
that magazine for
3 and 1/2 years,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.112
I remember, it was in
June, I said to my husband,

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:50.820
I said, wow, I said,
I've had three years

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.778
where it's just been
challenged after challenge

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:53.490
after challenge.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.250
And I said, this
honestly feels--

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.000
I think it was June the 15th.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.280
I said, this honestly
feels like it's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.835
comfortable for the
first time in my life.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.460
Like, the sales were
doing really well.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.550
I had a wonderful team.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.030
It was great.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.600
And then I got a
message from my CEO.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.440
She was on holiday.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.730
And usually, if you get
a message from your CEO,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.230
oh, come and see me,
you're about to get fired.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.780
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
Something's up.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.571
FARRAH STORR: Yeah.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.110
And I thought,
well, that can't be.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.280
And basically, she
said, look, how do you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.310
feel about "Cosmopolitan"?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.550
And the truth is, "Cosmo"
had been one of those brands

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.960
which I'd always
applied for jobs

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.745
there, early on in my career,
and I'd never got the jobs.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:36.870
I'd never actually got
beyond the second interview.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.920
And I always felt that I
just wasn't a "Cosmo" girl.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.290
And actually, that's why, now,
I'm very clear on actually,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.332
there is no "Cosmo" girl.

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:48.248
Do you know what mean?

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:49.380
It's just a state of mind.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.690
And actually, that's why
we don't have a "Cosmo"

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.430
tone of voice in the magazine.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.114
We have divergent
voices within there.

00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:57.280
And so I think that was
part of that which was like,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.460
OK, now, I get to be
editor of this magazine.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.300
But also, because
the magazine needed

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.620
to go through a load of changes.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.172
I remember my CEO
said, look, we need

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:07.380
to just give it a freshen up.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.600
We need to make
it more attractive

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.700
to millennials, who, of course,
are the hardest group to reach.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.179
And I went home.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.220
And I was like, oh, I just
don't know about this.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.310
And then in the end,
I decided, well,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.267
challenge had always
served me very well

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:23.350
throughout my entire life.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.250
When I looked back,
my greatest successes

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.560
had come from when I'd
had challenging times.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.632
And so I took the job.

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:31.590
And it was challenging.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.430
It was really challenging.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.750
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Definitely.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.760
And I would say in
light of the fact

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.220
that the publishing industry
is a challenge at the moment

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.310
as well, often, Google's blamed
for a lot of the challenges

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.470
that the publishing
industry has.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.460
How do you measure your
success based on that?

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.220
If your sales are
down one month,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.730
how do you determine,
for example,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.270
that it's an industry
problem, perhaps, the changing

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.720
readership that
you've experienced?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.299
Or is it just the
issue that month,

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.840
that you think, oh, perhaps we
should have changed the person

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.160
on the front of the
cover, or the tone

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.240
should have been different?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.900
FARRAH STORR: Well,
traditionally,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.760
that's what you do.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.510
So you look at your
sales for every month,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.790
and you go, OK,
well, this was down,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.887
and so it's something to
do with the cover star.

00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:12.220
And covers are really important.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.303
They're probably the most
important marketing tool

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:17.220
you have at your disposal,
more now than ever before.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.370
But actually, "Cosmo" is a
really unique brand in that

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.669
our sales are pretty static.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.210
Occasionally, we'll
have a big spike.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.700
So the Tess Holliday
cover recently, we

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.060
had a huge spike there.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.450
But usually, they are pretty
static and they're high.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.900
You know, we sell over
300,000 copies a year,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.214
so still huge numbers.

00:04:35.214 --> 00:04:36.630
So for me, as an
editor, of course

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.980
I've got to look at the sales.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.460
You have to look commercially.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.700
Do people still want to
spend money with you?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.832
But for me, it's
changing readership.

00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:45.540
So there's nothing
more gratifying for me

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.139
when, actually,
I'll meet everyone.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.680
And of course, you get to meet
and interact with your readers

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.263
much more now.

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:53.610
I mean, I get about 40
messages a day on Instagram,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.670
the different ages.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.610
So for me, what's
successful about "Cosmo" is

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.640
I can reach everyone from a
16-year-old right up to a woman

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.290
in their kind of late 50s.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.360
And I think dialogue.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.650
I think one of the things for
"Cosmopolitan," when I joined,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.510
one of the first
things I did was I

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.010
looked back at what
"Cosmo" had been

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.180
when it was at its peak, which
was in the '60s and '70s.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.590
And it had always been
about starting conversations

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.720
amongst people, never
having a point of view,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.130
because that's not the
point of journalism

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.820
unless you're a columnist.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.486
But it was about
putting the information

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:27.660
out there and then people
making their own decisions.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.380
And so for me, one of
the most gratifying--

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.080
and I think it's one of the
best metrics of success for me--

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.432
is, does "Cosmopolitan"
start conversations?

00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:37.640
And does it help people to
start thinking differently

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.767
about issues when they're
very blinkered in their views?

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.850
And then the other thing--
and this is very unique

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.050
to "Cosmo"--

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.120
is we have two schemes,
which I'm so proud of.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.630
One is Cosmopolitan
Houses, where

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.120
we house young creatives,
who can't, perhaps,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.529
afford to come to London.

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.320
We will house them.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.820
We charge minimal rent.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.350
We house them in these amazing
houses in Central London.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.900
And then we do a sex
education program in schools.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.286
So all that-- you
know, where there

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:07.910
is a real hole in
the school curriculum

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.180
is sex ed, consent,
online grooming.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.360
And a metric of success
for that, for example,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.930
we just did a pilot over
the summer on 700 kids.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.850
And we got-- I think,
from one school that

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.640
was 82% of young boys said they
had no idea what consent meant.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.497
So the change actually is
another metric success.

00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:28.580
It doesn't bring money in.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.790
But actually, I would argue--

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.340
it seems very grandiose, but
it genuinely changes lives.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.990
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: And you're
blazing the trail for something

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.540
that "Cosmo" originally has
never been known for, which

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.250
is quite significant in itself.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.630
So that's brilliant.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.300
And going back to
the cover star--

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.950
I'm sure a few people in
this room would have seen--

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.620
the disruption and dialogue
created from the Tess Holliday

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.870
cover from September,
what was it like going--

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.687
did you expect that reaction
from the cover, first of all?

00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:00.520
I know you would have
expected a little bit.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.980
But what was it like
seeing from everybody,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.650
sort of dividing a room,
how they reacted to it, how

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.710
going on Piers Morgan, you
had to lean into that fear

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.350
to go in there and
defend your decision?

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.290
And how, importantly, did
you convince those around you

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.880
to follow your
lead and your team?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.109
Because often, when
you make that decision,

00:07:19.109 --> 00:07:20.900
was your team with you
on it the whole way?

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.730
How did that work for you?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.080
FARRAH STORR: Well, I have
a team who doesn't always

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.700
agree with me.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.320
And actually, I employ them
deliberately because of that.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.570
I always say to them,
just because I'm the boss,

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.280
just because I'm at
the top doesn't mean

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.380
I'm right about everything.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.490
So we often have discussions
rather than arguments about,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.012
is this right.

00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:40.970
And sometimes I will go
back on what I've said.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.178
And I'll go, it's a fair cop.

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:43.880
I'm completely wrong.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.500
My instinct is
always to push things

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.150
to almost breaking point.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.712
And so I like having more
measured people on the team

00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:51.920
to go, well, if you do that,
this is going to happen.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.970
Of course, often, we go
with the thing that's

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.110
going to spark the debate.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.270
Because for me,
sometimes that overrides.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.625
And Tess was-- well,
actually, the truth about Tess

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:06.200
is, we didn't think it would
cause the kind of success

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.580
and the fury that it did.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.285
Because I'd had Rebel
Wilson on the cover.

00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:12.740
It had done very, very well.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.480
We didn't hear
anything about it.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.070
We had Ashley
Graham on the cover,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.500
who is a plus-size model.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.350
And so actually,
I didn't think--

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.190
I thought there may
be a little bit.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.820
But actually, I remember when
that issue went to press,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.650
we had a far more
contentious story

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.150
in the mix, which
was we had a story

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.750
about a young brilliant writer,
who we'd just discovered,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.330
who wrote about her
experience of rape.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.032
And actually, it was
quite an incredible piece.

00:08:39.032 --> 00:08:40.490
It is online so
you should read it,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.600
where she came to
us with a story.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.390
She said, my rape was traumatic.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.510
It was terrible.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.050
However, she said, I dealt
with it in my own way.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.602
And she said her
problems began when

00:08:49.602 --> 00:08:51.560
she told-- she was at
Columbia University-- she

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.970
told the sisterhood.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.380
And the sisterhood
said, you need

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.550
to be the face of this now.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.008
And she said, that's
not my choice.

00:08:57.008 --> 00:08:58.290
I do not want to do this.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.170
And she said, when
they turned on her,

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.420
it was worse than the rape.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.119
So when we decided to publish
that-- because, of course,

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.910
the people on the team
going, [INHALES]----

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.076
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: All right.

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:08.570
FARRAH STORR: Yep.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.270
We thought that would
certainly would spark debate.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.990
But actually, that
would cause the furor.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.860
And it didn't, not at all.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.940
It so happened that it was the
Tess cover, which is amazing,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.410
because I think what it
revealed more than anything

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.170
is we have a real
problem with fat

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.910
in a way I had never expected.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.370
When we put the cover
up on social media,

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.890
I remember, the first thing,
my features director phoned me.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.340
And she said, we've got
all of these people, some

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.720
of them consumers, saying going
to cancel my subscription,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.430
not going to read
this, which is a shame,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.846
because they never
read the story.

00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:50.150
And Tess was on there
not because of her size.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.506
Tess was on there because,
against all the odds--

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:54.880
she suffered a
lifetime of abuse.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.090
She grew up in a trailer.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.620
She's 5 foot 3, and
she's 300 pounds.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.610
She still became a
very successful model.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.920
So that's the "Cosmo" girl is
kind of that's scrappiness,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.530
hustling.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.800
Yeah.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.840
So that, we thought,
oh, my word.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.130
And then, of course,
Piers Morgan happened.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.890
And then we had all the
over-- and I cannot tell you,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.600
the overwhelming response.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.520
In our office, as
you can imagine,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.695
everything is by email.

00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:21.820
The general public, when
they get in touch with us,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.480
it's by email.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.170
It's through
Instagram or Twitter.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.150
The phone was ringing
every single day.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.590
And it was from older women.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.310
And this was interesting.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.685
It was from older
women, who were

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.670
kind of my age,
slightly older, saying,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.680
I haven't picked up
"Cosmo" in years.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.134
This picture, this image,
made me pick it up,

00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:39.550
and it made me
really think about,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.227
if I had seen a woman like
this when I was growing up--

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:45.310
and I feel like this because
I suffered disordered

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.069
eating most of my life.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:49.360
They go, I wonder how different
my life would have been

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.677
and some of the choices I made.

00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:53.760
So that was the really
interesting thing about it.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.540
And it's turned out to be
incredibly successful, which

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.290
is great.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:56.800
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Just great.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.258
And as you say,
it's getting people

00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:59.870
to pick it up, look
at what's inside--

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.760
FARRAH STORR: Read it, yeah.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.570
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
And read what she

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.700
has to say, other than just
her image on the front--

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.991
FARRAH STORR: Absolutely, yeah.

00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:07.420
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: --which
is a huge success to you.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.652
So she also, Tess Holliday,
publicly endorsed your book.

00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:12.610
FARRAH STORR: Yes, yes.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.260
After all of that, I said,
here, here's a book if you've

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.259
got any time to read it.

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:16.060
But yeah.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.280
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Now,
it's your turn, exactly.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.470
And that's the hustle, isn't it?

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.844
So we'll talk a
little bit about.

00:11:19.844 --> 00:11:20.595
FARRAH STORR: Yes.

00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:22.219
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
For those in the room

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:24.130
that don't know much
about your book yet,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.620
would you mind just giving
us a brief introduction

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.880
as to what it's about?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.630
FARRAH STORR: Yeah,
so the book is about--

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.110
I mean, if it was like
an elevator pitch,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.460
it's essentially that life is
tough, but you are tougher.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.370
And actually, the only way that
you discover you are tougher

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.034
is by putting yourself--

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.700
stepping really into
the discomfort zone

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.630
and challenging yourself.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.430
So that's the very
short end of it, really.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.490
I mean, you asked
me earlier, did you

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.640
just come up with the idea?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.560
Well, not really.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.820
You know, they say
it takes a lifetime

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.320
to write your first book
because you're always

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.260
thinking about it.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.180
And for me, every success
I'd had in my life,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.420
when I look down
the tunnel my life,

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.090
had been from when I'd
had difficult times,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.830
success had followed.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.680
And so I thought, A, it's
something worth sharing,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.700
and I think, B, it
happened at a moment

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.559
in culture, which is
really interesting,

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:19.600
because, of course, we
are going through a period

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.260
of high anxiety, but also a
period of intense coddling.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.560
And we see this--

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.060
in our education system, it's
happening in our universities.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.170
But particularly, in a lot
of the liberal elite American

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.510
universities, we
see this coddling

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.950
of students, safe spaces.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.850
And I think the thing is--

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.670
and we know this--
exposure therapy does work.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.870
The studies are there.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.890
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: It
builds resilience.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.348
FARRAH STORR: It
builds resilience.

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:49.510
And it's like it's not that
things become less scary.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.020
They don't.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.020
But you become braver by
exposing yourself bit by bit

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.810
to them.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.380
And I just think it's an
important message rather than--

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.459
I think at the moment it's like,
well, if something scares you,

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:02.000
don't worry, you
don't have to do it.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.020
And actually, I would challenge
that and say, you can do it,

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.124
but you need to go
in with a plan of how

00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:08.290
you're going to tackle this.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:08.860
Yeah.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.540
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: So let's
talk a little bit about stress

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.498
because that came through
in your book as well.

00:13:12.498 --> 00:13:15.670
We told, as you say, with
the coddling and so forth--

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.860
we have too much
stress in our lives.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.380
We need to disengage, detox.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.720
And cortisol is
really bad for you.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.940
But you have a different
theory on that in your book.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.440
And actually, stress can
be really good for us.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.530
So can you explain a
little bit what that means?

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.220
FARRAH STORR: Well, yeah.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.010
And of course, it's the
right amount of stress.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.250
I mean, I think sometimes
people are like,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.310
so you're saying stress is good.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.000
And I'm saying, well,
the right amount.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.280
And actually, I've always
believed that human beings

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.587
are meant to carry a load.

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:42.670
A little bit of struggle
is what we are built for.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.430
And we know this from
our caveman days.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.550
Adrenaline, it's
flight or fright.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.145
The thing is is--

00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:54.040
and I think this is what
hopefully the book explains--

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.420
is you need to know
what to do with fear.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.540
And I think that's the
thing, fear or stress

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.565
or whatever we call it.

00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:01.630
And I've found this.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.200
It's like all the physiological
sensations we have,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.740
which are sweaty palms,
the kind of stomach that

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.590
feels it's been macramed,
the beating heart,

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.500
these are things we are told,
it's because you're scared.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.280
Don't worry.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.220
And actually, they are
identical physiological symptoms

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.750
to when you're excited.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.670
But we're very rarely told that.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.860
And there are again
copious studies

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.810
on that, which is if
you tell yourself--

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.430
and you only have nanoseconds
in which to do this, by the way.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.610
If you tell yourself-- and this
is what I did before I went

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.140
on to--

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.309
I say talk-- to argue
with Piers Morgan.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.600
I felt all of those sensations
because actually, you're

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.350
in this green room.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.340
And there's a big screen.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.350
And he was building up, going,
oh, my god, the woman behind

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.750
this, she's coming in to
answer some questions.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.220
And so I felt all
of those things.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.130
But instead of thinking,
oh, my god, I'm terrified,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.990
it was like, no, I'm
in a challenged state.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.130
And it's amazing.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.620
When you tell yourself
that, your body changes.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.480
Your lungs enlarge.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.000
Your blood flows quicker
through your body.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.300
And you become sharper
and I say smarter.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.490
Your thinking becomes sharper.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.852
And that was all fleeing
woolly mammoths and whatnot.

00:15:05.852 --> 00:15:07.310
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
Back in the days.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.851
FARRAH STORR: Yeah,
but I don't think

00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:10.390
we're told to do that enough.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.000
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Yeah, I mean,
you said one of the key things

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.541
that you did that was probably
the most fearful thing is when

00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:17.110
you had to first
walk onto a stage

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.819
when it was 10,000
people, 20,000 people.

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:19.984
FARRAH STORR: 20,000 people.

00:15:19.984 --> 00:15:21.130
But I didn't know that.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:21.850
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
And you didn't know.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.440
And you felt like you
were going to blackout.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.270
There's that feeling
where suddenly you think,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.290
I'm gonna freeze,
and there's not

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.660
going to be anything I can
say, and I'm sweaty palms,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.440
adrenaline.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.170
So what did you do to pivot
off that situation when

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.659
you were suddenly confronted
with this massive crowd,

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:36.200
and you had to do
something about it?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.658
FARRAH STORR: Well, I think
that there were lots of things.

00:15:38.658 --> 00:15:42.130
So actually, that scenario--

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.180
most of my life is
just quite chaotic.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.660
I agreed to do an interview,
as you are doing now,

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.780
with a tech founder.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.260
And it was at a big summit.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.600
And at that point,
I hadn't really

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.410
done much public speaking.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.160
I'd probably done it to as
big an audience as this.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.170
And I was like, yeah,
I'll interview him.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:15:59.890
Don't worry.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.650
And I remember--
because there were

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.570
lots of different
rooms at this summit.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.430
And I remember we
were on at 4 o'clock.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.400
And I remember walking towards
the area it was supposed to be,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.737
and there were just these
crowds and crowds of people.

00:16:13.737 --> 00:16:15.820
Because it's all-- you
don't really see the stage.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.830
I had to walk up these stairs
and through these tunnels.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.955
And I was with this guy,
who, as you would imagine,

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:22.810
is lovely, but very quiet.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.870
And then somebody
said to us-- well,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.581
actually, it was the organizer
who ran backstage and said,

00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:30.580
there's a massive crowd.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.788
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.788 --> 00:16:33.940
FARRAH STORR: Yeah,
it's 20,000 people.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.540
And the worst thing
was, he said--

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.498
I'll never forget this.

00:16:36.498 --> 00:16:39.120
He goes, I want you to just go
out there and be rock stars.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.440
It's like, I'm a
middle-aged journalist.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.564
He's, like, just
a quiet tech guy.

00:16:43.564 --> 00:16:44.980
And then he's like,
and I need you

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.940
to stand there for 15 seconds
because we need some pictures.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.590
And then you can see this
big counter counting down.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.007
And so it was like, oh, my god.

00:16:54.007 --> 00:16:55.590
And we kind of looked
at one another--

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.975
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Terrifying.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:56.360
FARRAH STORR: Yeah.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.030
We didn't know what
we're going to do.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.830
And we walked out there.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.680
And because-- even
though I'd only

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.130
spoken in front of
small crowds before,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.190
one of the things I'm always
terrified of in public speaking

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.800
is not public
speaking per se, even

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.050
though I used to think the
whole experience was awful.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:14.950
It's not, of course.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.359
There are moments within it.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.010
And one of my big
things is always

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.170
the moment when the
crowd is kind of talking,

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.670
and you have to get
their attention.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.109
It's very difficult to do.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.540
And I remember, even when
I would give small talks,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.730
one of the things
that I had learned

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.070
by watching lots
of YouTube videos

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.660
was, great speakers always
diverted the attention away

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.660
from themselves and they
put it on the audience.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.750
Because everyone loves talking
about themselves, right?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.030
Or thinking about themselves.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.863
And so they ask a
question, or they instruct

00:17:39.863 --> 00:17:41.110
the audience to do something.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.770
And because I had done that a
number of times, gut instinct

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.250
is basically
pattern recognition.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.200
So I kind of knew that.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.411
And so when I walked in front
of the crowd, I remember,

00:17:51.411 --> 00:17:52.660
we were walking up the stairs.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.720
And I said to Sean,
I said, let's them

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.340
to take-- let's get a selfie.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.810
Let's take a massive selfie.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.050
And so we were stood in
front of this huge crowd.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.844
And I remember just
saying, you know,

00:18:03.844 --> 00:18:06.010
this is what we're going
to do and instructing them.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.611
And they did it.

00:18:07.611 --> 00:18:08.110
They did it.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.276
They turned their lights on.

00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:10.707
And we got this amazing picture.

00:18:10.707 --> 00:18:12.790
And then they were very
subdued, and it all began.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.650
But it was because I had had--

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.470
and in the book, I call them
brief moments of discomfort.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.010
Because no one situation is
ever completely uncomfortable.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.297
It's just not true.

00:18:22.297 --> 00:18:23.380
But there will be moments.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.080
And those are what stop you
from delving into the discomfort

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.750
zone because you think
the whole thing is horrid.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.910
And because I had identified,
with public speaking,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.870
what mine was, and I'd
come up with a plan--

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.530
because all we want is
the illusion of control--

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.230
it saved me.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.220
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: That was it.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.440
You just pivoted on the spot.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.970
That's brilliant.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.720
You also explain a
little bit in your book

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.710
about how failure works and
how important failure is.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.050
Being at Google, a lot of
us are scared of failure

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.570
because we work at such
a brilliant company.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.070
But you've done a lot
of research about it.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.340
And you've also, in
your book, really

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.580
beautifully created a lot
of businesses and leaders

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.900
as your examples.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.020
So can you run us through
some of the failure

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.240
stories of our decade
and our lifetime

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.850
that we should all think of
when we are doing something

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.212
that's important to us?

00:19:11.212 --> 00:19:12.670
FARRAH STORR: Well,
I'm sure Google

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.620
would say it's had
lots of failures,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.800
but actually, that's
actually helped them.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.990
Amazon founder,
Jeff Bezos, Bezos--

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.180
however you pronounce it--

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.520
is obsessed with it,
absolutely obsessed with it.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.700
And I think all of his
shareholder letters,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.710
he talks about failure.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.720
And I remember-- I'm
paraphrasing now.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.005
But they had that phone.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.106
I think it was a phone,
or was it the Amazon Fire?

00:19:35.106 --> 00:19:36.730
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
The Fire Stick, yeah.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.140
FARRAH STORR: And
he said, if you

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.170
think that was a colossal
failure, don't worry,

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.405
we've got even bigger
failures lined up.

00:19:43.405 --> 00:19:45.520
People were like, he's crazy.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.555
But of course, the thing is--
and you work in the tech world.

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.430
There are two types of
failure, aren't there?

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.852
There's failure by complete
carelessness, which

00:19:53.852 --> 00:19:55.060
is the wrong sort of failure.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.101
And then there is smart
failure, which is-- well,

00:19:57.101 --> 00:20:02.110
we are heading into the unknown,
so if you want to be perfect--

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.680
there's no information there.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.346
So smart failure is going, well,
we're heading into the unknown.

00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:08.030
There's no information
available to me.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.580
So we're probably
going to fail, which

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.190
is why you should fail small
and do it incrementally.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.679
The thing is, I
think-- and I think

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:16.220
this is the bit that
people sometimes

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.060
get wrong is looking back on the
failure, like, why did it fail.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.890
I mean, the chap
that I interviewed,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.070
so Sean Rad, who created
Tinder, his big thing

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.310
was, I asked myself why
a minimum five times.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.450
And by combing through
why did it get wrong,

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.300
you then have this really
unique piece of information

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.622
that nobody else has.

00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:38.330
The other thing about
failure, of course,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.300
is that I think most
people have an idea of who

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.180
they think they are.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.138
We go through life
thinking, I'm a good person,

00:20:44.138 --> 00:20:45.470
or I'm a creative.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.530
And failure, which is why
it scares a lot of us,

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.840
it's suddenly you're
confronted with,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.086
I'm not the person I
thought I was perhaps.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:54.210
And people don't like that.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.030
But of course, I
would say, you're not.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.430
But now you know you're
not, you can work on it.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.930
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
So almost, failing

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.300
is actually better
in the beginning,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.640
because you learn so much about
it, than just pure success.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.060
So if you want to be
successful straightaway,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.394
maybe that doesn't set you
up for success later in life.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.684
FARRAH STORR: Yeah, I think so.

00:21:11.684 --> 00:21:12.990
I think it is to be embraced.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.540
I mean, look, and
in Japan, they have

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.780
totally a different methodology
around how you treat failure

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.100
with kids, whereas
in the Western world,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.480
when you're at school--

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.560
and I don't know if that's
the same in South Africa.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.060
When you're at school, the child
that gets the answer right,

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.540
they put their hand up, and
they are kind of decorated

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.740
for they got it right.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.840
In Japan, the child that
gets the answer wrong

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.400
is the one that
they all focus on.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.574
And as a group--

00:21:35.574 --> 00:21:37.490
and this is Eastern
thinking-- but as a group,

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.420
they all come together
without stigma or humiliation.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.844
They analyze, with the
child, why did it not work?

00:21:44.844 --> 00:21:47.260
And they work together on
coming up with the right answer.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.380
So they all learn through
this child's failure.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.665
So it's very, very different.

00:21:50.665 --> 00:21:52.040
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
It's brilliant.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.410
So could you give us a
scenario, in that case,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.912
in terms of failure and what's
happened to you in your life?

00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:59.120
I know you talk a little
bit about some of the things

00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.640
you failed at.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.670
You were a sprinter for
a long time in your life.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:02.160
FARRAH STORR: Right, yes.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.840
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
Which is amazing.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.750
And also, you got a sort of
crushing rejection letter.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.595
How has that set you up now
for what you're doing next?

00:22:08.595 --> 00:22:10.970
FARRAH STORR: Oh, I mean, god,
I've had so many failures.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:16.430
So I think with the
sprinting, I mean,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.100
actually, the minute I started
not succeeding and winning

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.070
races is when I gave up
sprinting, which was a mistake.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.684
But as a 13-year-old, I
wasn't told any different.

00:22:24.684 --> 00:22:25.850
It was just I'm not winning.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:26.990
I'm not perfect.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.110
This isn't for me anymore.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.730
So that was a mistake.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.480
I mean, actually, when
I was in Australia,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.160
I had a job which
I really failed at.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.550
I mean, I was terrible at it.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.790
I really was.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.420
I'd jumped too soon.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.490
I'd taken a promotion
I wasn't ready for.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.812
And I remember when I
was failing at the job,

00:22:42.812 --> 00:22:45.020
I do what most people do,
which is, I was like, well,

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.460
I blame my colleagues,
and I blame the boss.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.210
It was a bad boss.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.720
But of course, even if that's
true-- and it wasn't actually.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.290
She was an excellent boss.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.130
Even if that's true, I don't
believe in blaming other people

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.450
because you can't control that.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.850
The only thing you can
control is your own actions.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.800
And so that job was
really important

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.050
because it told me,
A, my limitations.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.790
But also with that job--

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.950
and there's a little bit
about this in the book--

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.410
is that it was what
I refer to as a slog.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.530
So everything I did, no matter
how many hours I put in,

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.560
it never got any better.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.268
It never changed.

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:16.700
The color of that job
was always kind of black.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.680
I just couldn't do it.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.080
But then you have
other jobs, which are,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.720
you put all the hours
in, and it feels so hard,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.260
but there is
incremental movement.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.640
And that's a challenging job.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.140
And so I think it's
really important

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.510
to hang on to the memory
of the really terrible job

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.060
because then, you
can compare it.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.030
When you're in a tough job,
you can go, is it a slog,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.760
or is it a grind?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.760
And a grind, of course,
is what most of life is.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.020
It's what is on
the way to success.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.260
So I think jobs that you
think you've failed at,

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.550
they're incredibly useful.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.380
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Definitely.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.890
And then you often, I
suppose, related to that,

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.020
you address feedback
in your book a lot.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.790
And who you get it from is
obviously very important.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.580
So how do you do feedback?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.010
I mean, you obviously have
a massive team at "Cosmo."

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.080
You've got different
mentors in your life.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.250
But how do you
curate that feedback?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.360
And who do you trust
to ask for that

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.590
and get a solid answer that you
know is going to work for you,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.190
and you can take yourself
to the next level?

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.380
FARRAH STORR: Well, I don't
believe in mentors for a start.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.160
I just think
mentorships can be--

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.770
I believe in momentary
mentors, so you can get people.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.909
I think amazing people
come into your life.

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:22.450
You get them for a
very short window,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.824
and you're very lucky if you
get them for a short window.

00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:28.110
And you should take what you
can and give when you can.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.700
But I think the whole idea of
mentors for a very long period,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.520
I've never found personally they
are great because what ends up

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.750
is you sit down--

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.970
they can go on for an
indeterminate length of time.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.595
And all that happens
is you just end up

00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:41.510
offloading and just moaning.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.250
And actually,
mentorship-- I mean,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.590
I call it having a care coach,
which is identifying someone--

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.810
if it's for your career,
somebody in your environment,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.887
possibly not on your
team, actually-- so I

00:24:53.887 --> 00:24:55.970
give feedback to my team,
but I give it every day.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.050
Every day, it's constant.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.633
And every day, they're probably
put into their discomfort zone

00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:03.680
because I give them feedback
all the time on every project.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.700
But actually, for me, at
work, I identified somebody

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.452
who knew my job and
what it entailed.

00:25:08.452 --> 00:25:09.660
So she could make a judgment.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.050
She was informed on my job.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.040
But she wasn't in my immediate
team and she wasn't a peer.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.620
Because I think you have
to be really careful.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.110
Somebody said to me recently,
all feedback is good.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.160
And I was like,
yeah, but it depends

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.210
who the feedback is from.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.335
And they're like, no, no,
no, all feedback is good.

00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:25.840
And I was like,
let's not be naive.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.340
Some people will
have an agenda when

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.630
they're giving your feedback.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.820
So you need to
choose somebody who

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.730
I think is outside of your
department, who doesn't

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.220
challenge your status, or you
don't challenge their status,

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.690
very important.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.190
And then I think
what you need to do

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.080
is you need to be
very specific in what

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.249
do you want from this person,
so you don't just go--

00:25:44.249 --> 00:25:45.040
I mean, I get this.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.790
You must get this.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.620
People go and just
pick your brain.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.900
Well, about what?

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.859
And that's the same as
success, when people go,

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:52.858
I want to be famous, or
I want to be successful.

00:25:52.858 --> 00:25:53.460
It's so vague.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.376
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: How?

00:25:54.376 --> 00:25:55.360
FARRAH STORR: How?

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.544
And so you put in time
with your care coach.

00:25:57.544 --> 00:25:59.210
And you probably only
do it once a month

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.376
or however much you need it.

00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:01.270
And it can change.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.390
It can be once a week If you're
going through a difficult time.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.010
And then it can
change over time.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.410
But you put in a very specific
amount of time, so say,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.610
20 minutes.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.710
And you do it outside
of the work environment.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.710
And in preparation, you come up
with no more than three things,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.410
which are super, super specific
about what you want to know.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.930
So it could be, what am I like
when I am doing public speaking

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.090
in the first 10 minutes, say.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.580
Be specific, because then
they can be specific back

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.360
in what they give you.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.120
And I think you let
them go after a while.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.709
I don't think you get to
keep hold of that person.

00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:35.250
But they're really,
really important.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.960
And I think the other
thing is, nobody

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.190
likes receiving feedback.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.124
But also people don't
like giving feedback.

00:26:41.124 --> 00:26:42.790
Again, it goes back
to the caveman days.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.810
You would be isolated.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.140
We see on "Big Brother" when
people go, just being honest.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.035
They get excluded.

00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:51.160
And so I think when people
are giving you feedback,

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.993
you've got to smile.

00:26:51.993 --> 00:26:53.380
You've got to say thank you.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.162
You've got to make it
as easy as possible

00:26:55.162 --> 00:26:57.370
for them to be able to give
you the feedback as well.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.780
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: Absolutely.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.950
And you talk a little bit
about the three things

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.950
that you envision and visualize
when you go and do something.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.800
And that's your
inner mentor talking.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.976
You train yourself to
be your own mentor.

00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:12.850
Because, as you say,
they're quite momentary.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.534
You go along life, and
different people enter your life

00:27:15.534 --> 00:27:16.450
for different reasons.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.120
But how do you become your
own mentor, so no matter

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.076
what, that little
voice in your head

00:27:21.076 --> 00:27:22.450
is the right one
speaking to you,

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.950
and you're not having the
other voice in your head

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.075
telling you not to do it
because you're too scared?

00:27:26.075 --> 00:27:28.090
So how do you
separate those two?

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.131
FARRAH STORR: Well, I
mean, look, it's very hard.

00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:32.050
And it takes lots
and lots of practice.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.550
And it goes back
to, again, I mean,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.760
I think when we have
something difficult

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.460
approaching-- say it's a job
interview-- we're actually

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.290
brilliant at
visualization, but we're

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.130
brilliant at
catastrophizing things.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.130
So actually, most of us, when
we think about a job interview,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.140
say, we think about
everything that will go wrong,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.460
what happens when they
ask me the question,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.360
I don't have the answer.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.526
What happens when I walk in?

00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:51.730
I take the wrong seat.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.037
What happens when I get
sweat patches under my shirt?

00:27:54.037 --> 00:27:54.870
All of these things.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.980
So we are brilliant
at visualization.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.350
And of course, there
is some research

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.194
to show that, actually,
it can manifest.

00:28:02.194 --> 00:28:03.610
So what you have
to do is you have

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.410
to do the very thing which
is the opposite, which

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.826
is you have to--
say you're coming

00:28:06.826 --> 00:28:07.990
for an interview at Google.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.880
You can do everything
right down to--

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.980
it sounds quite
stalkerish, but looking

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.327
at the building on Google Maps.

00:28:13.327 --> 00:28:15.910
You can imagine what it's like
when you walk through the door.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.650
I mean, Wayne Rooney
does this or used

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.180
to do this before a match.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.020
He would do everything from what
did the socks feel like on him,

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.978
what does it feel like
when he scored the goal,

00:28:23.978 --> 00:28:26.410
what music is he listening
to before he goes

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.491
and he's got the match that day.

00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.990
And you have to do it every
day, in the build-up to your job

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.859
interview, say.

00:28:32.859 --> 00:28:34.150
You've got to keep on doing it.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.857
Because the urge is so
strong to catastrophize

00:28:37.857 --> 00:28:39.940
that your inner mentor,
you've got to build it up.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.790
So start with five minutes,
10 minutes visualizing,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.427
until, by the time you
come to said job interview,

00:28:45.427 --> 00:28:46.510
you've changed your state.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.220
You're in a challenged state.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.470
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: I've got it.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.630
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.620
That's brilliant.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.490
And the question that most
authors get, no matter when

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.190
they've done their first
book-- what's next for you?

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.140
I mean you've written
this amazing book.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.370
It's still got a lot of legs.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.720
You've still got a
lot to do with it.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.680
But what is next for you?

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.471
Do you see yourself
doing something similar

00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:07.149
in the future, writing another
book like this perhaps?

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:08.440
FARRAH STORR: I don't think so.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.190
My editor's here.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.450
And I was so bad
with my deadline.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.310
I don't think so.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.060
Not for the time--

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.730
I think the thing is--

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.120
I mean, ironically, this did
throw me into my discomfort

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.730
zone because I'd also had
a big full-on job which

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.340
was going through a period
of monumental change.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.590
So I had to be so
disciplined with this.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.240
It was very, very
early mornings.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.860
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: A passion
project of note too.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.430
FARRAH STORR: Yeah.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.180
Yeah, really.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.530
And I think sometimes
when you're a writer,

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.890
you think, oh, it's
easy to write a book.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.120
Well, of course,
it's very difficult.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.880
And if you're an editor
as well, you are writing,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.921
and then you're editing,
and then you're writing,

00:29:35.921 --> 00:29:37.570
and then you're editing again.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.760
And the feedback is
very hard to get.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.260
So my editor gave me lots of
feedback, which was amazing.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.224
But it's hard to take.

00:29:44.224 --> 00:29:45.640
I think the next
thing for me is--

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.290
I mean, look, I love "Cosmo."

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:52.900
I think, for me, it is the most
interesting female media brand,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.370
because I can talk about
the issues that count.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.290
The big thing for me
will be with the brand

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.060
is building more of
the housing scheme.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.870
That's a huge thing.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.870
The sex education
project is huge.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.290
And there will be other socially
motivated projects coming up.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.752
So those are the things that
are my real passion project.

00:30:10.752 --> 00:30:11.460
And the magazine.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.626
You know, I love journalism.

00:30:12.626 --> 00:30:15.270
I think it's a really
important time for journalism.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.840
I think journalists need to
keep their head about them

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.820
at the moment.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.347
And I think in a
world of outrage,

00:30:24.347 --> 00:30:26.430
there needs to be a place
where you go, look, this

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.580
is what's happening in culture.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.790
Here's all the information.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.412
Now, go forth and figure it out.

00:30:32.412 --> 00:30:33.870
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
That's brilliant.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.500
Thank you.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.040
FARRAH STORR: You're welcome.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.840
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: I want
to open up to the floor,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.640
to people who wanted
to ask some questions,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.380
potentially-- we've
got a few minutes--

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.902
and then perhaps
some book signings.

00:30:41.902 --> 00:30:43.110
FARRAH STORR: Yes, of course.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.860
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: That
would be brilliant.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.655
So any questions to start?

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.310
So my question is
basically around--

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.030
so when you're trying to figure
out for yourself what you're

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.530
good at, what
you're not good at,

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.710
I feel like, for me, I always
concentrate on the things

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.060
that I'm doing really badly
or that I need to focus on.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.080
But I can't get myself to
think about the positives, what

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.440
I can do really well.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.560
So how would you
reframe that situation

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.900
to try and understand,
what are the things

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.287
that you are good at?

00:31:16.287 --> 00:31:17.120
FARRAH STORR: Sorry.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.470
That microphone is outstanding.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.259
Was it a Dictaphone with
a microphone on top of it?

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:22.550
Well, it's very hard, isn't it?

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.046
Because the natural tendency
is to think about everything

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:26.045
that you're terrible at.

00:31:26.045 --> 00:31:27.500
And actually, what
I would say is,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.390
you may be surprised
what you're good at.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.624
So again, if you
have a care coach,

00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:33.040
or you have somebody
who you trust

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.280
who is not your mum or your
brother or you know, ask them.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.036
Give me five things
that I excel at.

00:31:39.036 --> 00:31:40.910
And I guarantee, some
of them will cross over

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.590
what you thought or what
you hoped you were good at.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.620
But there's nothing better than
having it from another source.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.870
And actually, I would say get
it from about three sources,

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.536
because you'll see
overlap in, actually,

00:31:49.536 --> 00:31:51.690
what people see you
are really good at.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.900
And then again,
it's the specifics.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.270
It's like, I didn't realize I
was good at analytical work.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.720
Then, again, once you've
had that confirmation,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.600
you just need to focus on that.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.350
So it's very hard.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.880
I mean, most people do.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.440
And people always say to
me, I get imposter syndrome.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.600
I kind of feel
imposter syndrome can

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.319
be a really good
thing because when

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:19.610
you feel an imposter-- of
course, if you were sat back,

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.330
and you were the boss
with a cigar and your feet

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.540
up on the table and you
didn't feel an impostor,

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.860
well, then, where's the
drive to learn everything?

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.730
And so actually, whenever
my team get new jobs,

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.980
they always say before they
leave, I'm really scared.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.416
And I'm like, that's
absolutely how you should feel,

00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:38.040
because you're going
to the next level.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.956
And if you're not scared
about your next move,

00:32:39.956 --> 00:32:41.450
you don't feel an
imposter, I would

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.010
challenge whether you are
going into the right job.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.934
So I think, actually, you can
harness imposter syndrome.

00:32:47.934 --> 00:32:49.850
If you have imposter
syndrome, what do you do?

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.930
Well, you look for
all the information

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.670
so that you never
get caught out.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.800
And ultimately, that's
what makes you brilliant.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.730
Always have the answers.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.420
AUDIENCE: And as a
follow-up, so when you go

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.760
into a negotiation-- like,
say you want to get a raise

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.300
on your salary or more
scope in your job--

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.750
how do you use both the
negatives and the positives

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.246
to approach that
kind of conversation?

00:33:11.246 --> 00:33:12.620
FARRAH STORR:
Well, I don't think

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.790
you'd bring that into a
pay negotiation actually.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.550
I think pay negotiation
is about hustle,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.890
which we talked about earlier.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.825
And I think what
a lot of people--

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:20.900
I mean, it's interesting.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.540
Steve Jobs said--
again, I'm paraphrasing.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.110
He's like, all I ever did
in life was ask, and I got.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.140
Well, he's Steve Jobs.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.480
Of course he got, because
people wanted, ultimately,

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.780
something from him.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.830
And so I think hustle, which
is what ultimately a pay

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.790
negotiation is, it's not
about, I think I deserve more.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.130
And we've been told this.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:39.890
I'm good at this.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.450
I think I deserve more money.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.630
That's not enough.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.870
You have to hustle that person.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.465
So you have to go, I
want this, but here's

00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:48.590
what I'm going to give you.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.730
That's what true hustle is.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.590
The best hustlers
in life, they almost

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.180
give you more than what
you want from them.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.660
So I would say if you have
to go into pay negotiation,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.090
you say, look, this is what I
would like, rather than this

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.180
is what I deserve, because
they may not feel the same.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.350
But you need to have
a massive list of,

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.719
here's what I'm going
to give you for that.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.280
Most people, that's
very seductive.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.060
Does that help?

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.685
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:12.685 --> 00:34:13.370
It's good.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.699
Thank you for the session.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.034
Really interesting.

00:34:18.034 --> 00:34:20.870
I think at Google,
there's no lack--

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.960
and that's everything.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.840
We don't have a lack
of opportunities

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.380
to do things and put ourselves
in the discomfort zone,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.699
I believe.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.810
I wanted to ask you, how was
your decision-making process

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.719
when you have to decide whether
an opportunity is really

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:42.050
a good one, in the sense that
to set yourself for success?

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.750
Because I guess there are many
situations where you could

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.340
go into discomfort
zones, arguably,

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.750
but actually not be really
necessarily prepared.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.370
So if you haven't thought it
through, it could be, in a way,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:52.879
too risky.

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:53.420
I don't know.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.780
Your thoughts about that.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.760
FARRAH STORR: Well, it's
interesting, isn't it?

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.600
I mean, I think
first of all, you

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.880
have to have real self-awareness
about what does a discomfort

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.838
zone look like for you.

00:34:59.838 --> 00:35:01.970
So for example, I
would never go, oh,

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.179
the CEO job has
come up, brilliant,

00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:05.720
I'll take that,
because it's too big.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.800
The gulf is too massive.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.176
And actually, I think stepping
into your discomfort zone,

00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:11.466
it's only really a good thing
to do if you have a plan.

00:35:11.466 --> 00:35:12.920
So this goes back
to the idea of,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.940
can I control the situation?

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.150
So there's that.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.344
It's like, if I take
this next opportunity,

00:35:18.344 --> 00:35:20.510
do I have a plan of how I'm
going to get through it?

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.685
What I don't do--

00:35:21.685 --> 00:35:23.060
and this is a
personal thing-- is

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.839
I don't do where,
again, we were told,

00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:26.630
do all the positives
and all the negatives,

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.300
because the natural impetus is
to look at all the negatives

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.170
and stop.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.640
And actually, what
I tend to do is

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.370
I tend to say yes
to a lot of things

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.200
and then I figure out the plan.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.250
I go, do I think I
can roughly do this?

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.500
Do I have the skills to do it?

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.124
Or if I stretch my
skills a little bit,

00:35:41.124 --> 00:35:42.249
would I be able to do it?

00:35:42.249 --> 00:35:44.540
And if the answer is yes,
then I say yes quite quickly,

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.900
because I tend to find the
more you think about things,

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.040
you'll catastrophize it.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.289
I mean, it's just our nature.

00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:52.830
You know, unless
you're a narcissist,

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.039
and there's a lot
of those around,

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:57.580
in which you'll just say yes,
but you won't be able to do it.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.025
And you will fail ultimately.

00:35:59.025 --> 00:36:01.150
So I think when it comes
to new opportunities, what

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.530
I do is I look at them.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.180
I'm very aware of
what my skills are,

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.890
which is why you've got to go
back to, what am I good at,

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.800
what am I not so great at.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.480
If I push them a
bit, can I do this?

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.480
Which is why I took
"Cosmo," because I'd already

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.500
been an editor.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.860
I had vaguely the skill
set to do the job.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.130
But I definitely don't
do negative and positive

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.380
because I tend to find the list
of the negatives is so big.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.132
And that's what you think about.

00:36:27.132 --> 00:36:27.965
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:31.600
And as a small follow-up,
I feel personally

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.650
that with age, we tend
to have less ability

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.150
to go into the discomfort zone,
maybe because the stakes are

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:41.020
higher, or we are more afraid
of risking what we have,

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.060
while thinking of
myself as a student,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.179
it would be such an easy thing
to go and jump into projects.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:48.970
How did you experience
something like that?

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:51.439
Do you have a way of
dealing with that?

00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:52.730
FARRAH STORR: Well, it depends.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:53.710
I mean, you're right.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.620
I think as you get older, a
lot of people go, oh, it's age.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.140
But actually, it's because
the stakes are usually higher.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.064
You have a family, or
you know what I mean--

00:37:01.064 --> 00:37:03.230
the life you have built,
the stakes are much higher.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.376
So I think that's why,
when you're older,

00:37:05.376 --> 00:37:06.500
you're a bit more cautious.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.130
I don't think it's
actually age per se.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:12.820
I also think there is a lot of
thought around younger people--

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:17.080
and I'm talking about iGen
and millennials largely.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.830
So I'm Gen X. Millennials
grew up during the self-esteem

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.350
movement.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:27.550
So they're told, quite well
meaning, you can do anything,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.700
whereas my generation
was not told that.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.220
The whole self-esteem movement
hadn't really reached me.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.462
So I actually think now--

00:37:35.462 --> 00:37:36.920
I don't know if
you'd have asked me

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.211
that question 20 years ago
whether I would have agreed.

00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:41.050
Because actually, I
think as you're older,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.759
you have all the expertise.

00:37:42.759 --> 00:37:45.050
So actually, you're in a much
better position to do it.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.590
I don't think it's the
idealism of youth per se.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.380
But I do think
younger people now,

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.360
they are built slightly
differently to us.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.510
So that's why they're
perhaps more willing.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.502
And also, actually, if
you're a millennial,

00:37:56.502 --> 00:37:58.210
you kind of haven't
got anything to lose.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.420
Because I really feel for them.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.961
They've got, like,
no chance of a job

00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:04.270
for life, mortgage, no pension.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:07.420
So actually, I think that's why
they're also less risk averse.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.120
Because it's like, well,
what have I got to lose?

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.630
Whereas for us--
you're younger than me.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.287
But for me, say, I'm lucky.

00:38:16.287 --> 00:38:17.120
I've got a mortgage.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.130
I've got a pension.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.640
So I think they're a really
interesting generation right

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.029
now, really interesting.

00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:25.820
LAURIAN CLEMENCE: We
have another question.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.945
AUDIENCE: So you might have
answered this question.

00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:31.660
I mean, I think I'm still
part of the generation that

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.179
just came out of uni and got
into a company at Google.

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:36.220
So I'd like to take you
a little bit back in time

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.377
and maybe give some advice
to your younger self.

00:38:39.377 --> 00:38:40.960
What would be the
first thing that you

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.780
would tell her going forward?

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.060
FARRAH STORR: Probably
what the book is about.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.430
Because when I was growing
up, I was a middle child.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.890
I was very quiet.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.200
And I didn't always--
apart from the running.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.090
But then the running,
once I started losing,

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.569
I just left because I
was scared of failure.

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:02.860
I think it's about you are
much tougher than you think.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.890
And actually, you
have to do things.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.820
You've got to go
through obstacles

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.170
because obstacles are amazing.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.410
They teach you,
again, about yourself

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.270
and what your limitations are.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.705
And I think when I was
much younger, going back

00:39:16.705 --> 00:39:19.990
when I was 10 to 13, I
was a really quiet child

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.241
and quite nervy
about certain things.

00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:22.990
I think it's that.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.530
It's like, trust
yourself, that actually,

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.574
when you go through the tough
stuff, that's absolutely

00:39:29.574 --> 00:39:30.490
the right thing to do.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.073
And you will come
out changed, and you

00:39:32.073 --> 00:39:34.000
will learn incredible
things about yourself.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.460
I think most people think when
they go through obstacles,

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.810
it's going to be
debilitating, and you'll

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.726
learn about all the
things you're terrible at.

00:39:39.726 --> 00:39:42.250
But actually, once you know
what you're not good at,

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.910
you can make a plan
of how to do it.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:44.785
So I think that's it.

00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:47.230
I think I would have taken
more risks as a young child.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you for sharing.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.480
My question is with failure
and self-confidence,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.540
I find that I personally
like to succeed and win.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.310
And I find the more I win,
the more self-confident I am.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.110
But the more I fail at stuff,
the less self-confident I am.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.680
So how do you get
into the discomfort

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.780
zone and self-confidence?

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.732
Because I feel like
it's inversely related.

00:40:12.732 --> 00:40:13.690
FARRAH STORR: So sorry.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:14.606
What was the question?

00:40:14.606 --> 00:40:16.040
So--

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.829
AUDIENCE: Entering discomfort
zones and self-confidence.

00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:20.620
FARRAH STORR: Keeping
your self-confidence.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.420
FARRAH STORR:
Yeah, I mean, look,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.878
that's really hard, which is
why you have to-- because what

00:40:24.878 --> 00:40:28.120
you're saying is, if you go
into your discomfort zone

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.060
and you fail, then your
self-confidence takes a knock.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.340
But I think it goes back
to how do you see failure.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.530
And actually, if you
fail at it, but you

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.110
went in with the right
frame of mind, which is,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.076
let's make this up.

00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:40.450
I'm going to start
this business.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.283
There is no information
about this business,

00:40:42.283 --> 00:40:44.260
so I'm going to have
to take the leap.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.870
You failed for
the right reasons.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.620
And that's what you
have to tell yourself.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.880
It's like, well, did I fail?

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.880
Yeah, but look at
all this information.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.107
I mean, there are so
many businesses that fail

00:40:57.107 --> 00:40:59.190
but actually, they then
went on to greater success

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.260
because they looked
at the failure.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.070
So I think what you have
to do is when you step

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.194
into your discomfort zone--

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.490
and if it doesn't
work out for you,

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.175
you have to analyze what
went wrong, but also

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:10.800
not beat yourself up
about the failure.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.675
I think this is a cultural
shift about, well,

00:41:12.675 --> 00:41:14.620
the failure was for
the right reasons.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:20.307
And so in theory, it shouldn't
impact your self-esteem.

00:41:20.307 --> 00:41:21.390
And I think it's changing.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:23.850
I think a lot of the
world now, if you fail--

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.620
I think, certainly
in my day, people

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.374
would go-- they'd
keep away from you.

00:41:27.374 --> 00:41:28.290
It's like a bad smell.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.800
People don't like
being near failure.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.600
I think it's very different now.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.710
I think it's starting to change.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.955
And people are seeing it as
brave, unless, of course,

00:41:33.955 --> 00:41:36.330
you fail, because you threw
yourself into your discomfort

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.670
zone without any plan.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.010
But then you wouldn't do that.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.410
You know what?

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.120
You would go in with
a really clear plan

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.261
of why you're doing it.

00:41:46.809 --> 00:41:47.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.260
I'm just curious, because you've
talked a lot about experiences

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.460
within the workplace.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.100
But was there anything
during your career

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.190
that you pursued outside of
work, where you purposefully

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.100
put yourself outside
of your comfort zone

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.119
to further your development?

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.160
Say, something that helped
both in the workplace,

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.350
but you pursued outside of work.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.820
FARRAH STORR: Well,
I suppose it's

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.730
helped my personal development.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:16.790
So when I was 21, I had a best
friend, a male best friend.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.220
We were so close.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.470
Never fancied him.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.525
But we were so close.

00:42:21.525 --> 00:42:22.900
And I remember--
and he never had

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.430
a girlfriend the whole time.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.710
And I remember one
day just waking up,

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.340
and he'd met someone
called Farrah, weirdly.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.960
And he'd met her at Glastonbury.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.630
And there was
something in me that

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.790
could sense that it was
a moment of opportunity.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.030
I don't know.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.404
I was just overcome
by, actually,

00:42:38.404 --> 00:42:41.674
I'm in love with this guy, and
actually, if I don't say it--

00:42:41.674 --> 00:42:42.840
it goes back to the failure.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.720
It's like, I could fail.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.261
He could turn around
and go, I'm just

00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:46.600
not interested in you, Farrah.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.540
But actually, I'd have failed
for the right reasons because I

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.200
hadn't--

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.689
I didn't know how
he felt at all.

00:42:51.689 --> 00:42:52.730
And actually, I remember.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.270
He was at Glastonbury.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.650
It was on the Saturday.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.829
And I said, I want you
to come back to London.

00:42:59.829 --> 00:43:01.620
And I didn't know what
he was going to say.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.100
And he was like, why?

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.260
And I said, I just
need to see you.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.450
And he'd just met this girl.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:04.990
And bless him.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.823
He got on the train.

00:43:05.823 --> 00:43:06.580
He came back.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.350
And I opened the door.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.560
And we had a kiss.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.560
And he's my husband now.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560
Do you know what I mean?

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.380
So I took a massive
chance on that.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.880
It could have worked
terribly, and I

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.650
could have lost the
best friend of my life

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.132
because we were so close.

00:43:19.132 --> 00:43:19.840
And I would have.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.757
I think instinctively you know
what is right for yourself.

00:43:23.757 --> 00:43:25.090
You just have to trust yourself.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.010
I don't there's any such
thing as a right decision.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.510
But you make the decision right.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:29.940
I really believe in that.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.440
And I think I knew when he met
that girl that I was probably

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.064
going to have to
retreat from his life.

00:43:34.064 --> 00:43:35.320
And so I just went with--

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.080
I'm very good at just going
after what I want and saying.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.640
And what's the worst
that's going to happen?

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.335
So does that-- probably far more
detail than you need to know,

00:43:43.335 --> 00:43:43.835
but--

00:43:43.835 --> 00:43:45.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.412
Yeah.

00:43:46.412 --> 00:43:47.870
LAURIAN CLEMENCE:
That's brilliant.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.270
Do we have time for one more?

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.926
One more?

00:43:53.258 --> 00:43:54.210
We're good.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:55.240
We can do some signings.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.019
Thank you so much.

00:43:56.019 --> 00:43:57.310
It was really good to have you.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.360
[APPLAUSE]
