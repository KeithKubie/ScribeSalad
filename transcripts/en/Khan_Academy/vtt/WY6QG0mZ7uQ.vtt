00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.260
I want to make a quick
correction or clarification to

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.540
the last video that you may or
may not have found confusing.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.420
You may not have noticed it,
but when I did the general

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.090
case for multiplying a row by a
scalar, I had this situation

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.240
where I had the matrix A and I
defined it as-- it was n by n

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.560
matrix, so it was a11, a12,
all the way to a1n.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.970
Then we went down this way.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.220
Then we picked a particular row
i, so we called that ai1,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.410
ai2, all the way to ain.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.065
And then we keep going down ,
assuming that this is the last

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:40.250
row, so an1 all the
way to ann.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.500
When I wanted to find the
determinant of a, and this is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.770
where I made a-- I would call
it a notational error.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.360
When I wanted to find the
determinant of a, I wrote that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.460
it was equal to-- well, we could
go down, and in that

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.010
video, I went down this row.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.350
That's why I kind of highlighted
it to begin with,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.770
and I wrote it down.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.370
So it's equal to-- do the
checkerboard pattern.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610
I said negative 1
to the i plus j.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.640
Well, let's do the first term.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.240
I plus 1 times ai1 times
its submatrix.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.750
That's what I wrote in the last.
So if you have ai1, if

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.810
you get rid of that row, that
column, you have the submatrix

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.550
right there: ai1.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.550
That's what I wrote
in the last video,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.970
but that was incorrect.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.050
And I think when I did the 2 by
2 case and the 3 by 3 case,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.000
that's pretty clear.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.780
It's not times the matrix, it's
times the determinant of

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.420
the submatrix, so this right
here is incorrect.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.770
And, of course, you keep adding
that to-- and I wrote

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520
ai2 times its submatrix
like that.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.620
ai2 all the way to ain
times its submatrix.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.560
That's what I did
in the video.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.780
That's incorrect.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.250
Let me do the incorrect in a
different color to show that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.680
this is all one thing.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.960
I should have said the
determinant of each of these.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.200
The determinant of a is equal
to minus 1 to the i plus 1

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.180
times ai1 times the determinant
of ai1 plus ai2

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.440
times the determinant of ai2,
the determinant of the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.440
submatrix all the way to ain
times the determinant of the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.440
submatrix ain.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.890
It doesn't change the logic of
the proof much, but I just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.910
want to be very careful that
we're not multiplying the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.850
submatrices because
that becomes a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.630
fairly complicated operation.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.260
Well, it's not that bad.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.820
It's a scalar.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.630
But when we find a determinant,
we're multiplying

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.360
times the determinant
of the submatrix.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.850
We saw that when we first
defined it using the recursive

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.760
definition for the n by n
determinant, but I just wanted

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.230
to make that very clear.
