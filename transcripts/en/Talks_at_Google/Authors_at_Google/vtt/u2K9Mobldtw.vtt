[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.000
ADAM BECKER: Fantastic.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.390
Well, thank you Alex
for overpromising.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.136
I hope to underdeliver.

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.010
And thank you everybody
for being here today.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.476
I'm really excited to
be talking at Google.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:18.850
Before I get
started, I just want

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.740
to gauge where the audience is.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.490
So if you have a
background in physics,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.830
like if you've ever taken a
course in quantum mechanics,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.500
can you raise your hand?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.090
OK.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.150
So that's like maybe 1/2 to 2/3.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.960
That's good.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.660
If you have no formal
training in physics

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.910
and you just think that
quantum mechanics is cool

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.240
or that physics is
interesting, raise your hand.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.270
Good.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.140
So this talk is going
to be aimed primarily

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.916
or at the level of people
who haven't taken any courses

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:52.790
in quantum mechanics.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.460
But at the end, in the Q&amp;A,
we can get as technical

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.465
as we want.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:59.090
There's all sorts of stuff that
I'm not mentioning in his talk,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.310
which we can get
into in the Q&amp;A.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.090
So if you are annoyed that
I don't mention decoherence,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.965
for example, we can talk
about it in the Q&amp;A,

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:09.890
and I can explain why
I didn't mention it.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.850
So let's talk about
quantum physics.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.360
Quantum physics is fantastic,
but there's a problem with it.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.120
There is a hole at the
heart of the theory.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.020
And just to be clear,
quantum physics works.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.300
It works tremendously well.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.630
It is, by almost any
measure, the most successful

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.750
scientific theory that
humanity has ever devised.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.960
It explains an enormous
variety of phenomena.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.670
It's the physics
of the ultra tiny,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.740
but it goes well beyond that.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.810
It explains why the sun shines.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.410
It explains why we can
see that the sun shines.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.360
It is what almost
every single piece

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.960
of technology in this room
or in the world runs on.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.460
It even explains why you're
not sinking through the chairs

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460
that you're sitting in
right now because quantum

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
mechanics explains why
anything is ever solid.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.110
So it's just a phenomenally
successful theory.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.305
And anybody who says
otherwise has no idea

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:04.430
what they're talking about.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.770
It is a good theory.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.270
But there is a problem.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.490
The problem is that
it is just not clear

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.770
what quantum physics is telling
us about the world around us.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.160
The connection between
the theory, though it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.490
phenomenally successful,
and the world that we're in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.310
is just not obvious.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.190
And to explain what
I mean by that--

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.920
say that I want to figure
out where this marker is.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.790
Right?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.480
So right now, if I want
to use Newton's physics,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.330
the pre-quantum
classical physics,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.310
to figure out where
this marker is,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.304
I need three numbers to
describe where it is.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:44.970
I need to say, OK,
it's a certain height

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.140
above the ground.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.180
It's a certain distance
in front of me.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.630
And it's a certain
distance off to my left.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.932
But if I want to say where this
thing is in quantum mechanics,

00:02:55.932 --> 00:02:57.390
if I want to describe
its position,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.640
I need more than three numbers.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.430
I need an infinity of numbers
scattered across all of space.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.950
And this is known
as a wave function.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.330
And this is somewhat odd that
we need an infinity of numbers,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.264
but oddness is fine.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:15.680
The trouble with
quantum mechanics

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.760
isn't that it's strange.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.990
Strangeness is OK.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.670
The world is a strange place.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.470
If our theories
weren't weird, they

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.860
wouldn't be able to
account for what we see.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.430
The trouble is more
complex than that.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.137
See, wave functions obey
this very, very nice equation

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:33.470
called the Schrodinger equation.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.350
It's a really beautiful
differential equation.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.060
It sort of smells
like a law of physics.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.210
Right?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.780
It's the quantum mechanics
equivalent of Newton's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.370
second law, F equals ma.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.960
It's a good equation.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.460
We like it.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.180
It's pretty.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.670
It says that wave
functions wave.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.190
It says that they
undulate smoothly,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.990
and they don't make
sudden changes.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.099
They don't do anything-- well,
they do some surprising things,

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.640
but they don't make
any sudden moves.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.500
But the strange thing is that
wave functions don't always

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.820
obey the Schrodinger equation.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.270
Sometimes when we go
and look for a thing,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.344
the wave function of
that thing suddenly

00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:18.260
doesn't obey the Schrodinger
equation anymore.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.884
The Schrodinger
equation is temporarily

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.640
suspended when we
make a measurement,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.520
and instead, the wave
function collapses.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.160
All those numbers scattered
across all of space,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.100
they go to zero everywhere
except in the place where

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.360
we found the object.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.750
Now that's somewhat strange.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.250
Right?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.791
Like I said, the
Schrodinger equation

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.682
smells like a law of physics.

00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:40.140
We don't expect
the laws of physics

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.100
to get temporarily suspended
when we make a measurement.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.060
That's just odd.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.770
What's even odder is it's
kind of hard to define

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.210
what we mean by measurement.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.790
What's a measurement?

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.512
Is a measurement when I measure?

00:04:54.512 --> 00:04:56.220
If the measurement's
only when I measure,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.890
why am I giving you a talk
about quantum mechanics

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.440
when it only applies to me?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.540
Solipsism isn't really
a good look on anybody,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.760
and it's not a good
look for physics.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.740
Is it only when humans measure?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.569
Now, Einstein asked, can a
mouse collapse a wave function.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.110
That doesn't seem
quite right either.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.485
It seems like it
shouldn't really

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:18.100
have anything to do with
life or consciousness.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.120
That's not where we want to
go, and that doesn't really

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.090
make the idea of measurement
less weird anyway.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.820
Maybe it's when a
big thing interacts

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.774
with this world of the ultra
tiny, the world of the quantum.

00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:33.190
But there is no experimental
evidence that that's correct.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.106
And in fact, there is a
great deal of evidence

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:37.030
that suggests that
quantum mechanics doesn't

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.030
have that kind of size limit.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.030
So there is just a
host of thorny problems

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.250
here about what we mean
by measurement when

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.610
wave functions collapse, what
prompts them to collapse,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.720
what's going on here.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.160
And this is given
a special name.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.240
It's called the
measurement problem.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.900
Now it's tempting to say that
what's really going on here

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.940
is that the wave function
isn't a thing in the world.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.189
It's just a measure of
probability in some way.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.730
And that is the standard way of
thinking about wave functions

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.190
is that they just tell us
the probability of finding

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.110
a thing at a particular spot.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.270
And then, the idea of collapse,
it looks somewhat less strange.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.587
Because then you know, OK,
we don't know where it is.

00:06:20.587 --> 00:06:21.920
And then we look and we find it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.020
And now we know where it is.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.853
And so the probability
of it being elsewhere

00:06:24.853 --> 00:06:29.100
has gone to zero, and that's
why wave functions collapse.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.110
But it can't be quite
that straightforward

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.320
because wave functions do
some things that we associate

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.540
with physical waves,
like water waves

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.370
or sound waves or light waves.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.010
Wave functions can actually
cause interference patterns

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.357
to appear.

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:44.690
That's not something that we
think of mere probabilities

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.377
as being able to do.

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:48.210
That doesn't mean that
it's not probability.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.180
It just means that if it is,
it's not straightforward.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.580
There has to be a more
complicated story here

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.250
to explain what's going on.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.810
And there's also
the question of, OK,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.230
so before we measure,
where is the object that's

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.570
described by this sort of
spread out wave function.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.670
Where is the marker
before we look

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.141
for it if its wave function is
scattered across all of space?

00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.640
Now, the standard answer here
is to say that it's not really

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.320
in one place or another.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.100
It's in multiple places at once.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.560
And we don't see markers in
more than one place at once,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.190
but maybe subatomic particles,
maybe atoms and molecules

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.620
can perform that kind of trick.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.930
But if we concede
that, if we say, yeah,

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.430
that's definitely
what's going on,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.630
then we run into the most famous
version of the measurement

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.950
problem, which is
Schrodinger's cat.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.200
You knew that this was coming.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.040
It's a talk on quantum physics.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.660
So Schrodinger put
this together in 1935.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.410
He said, OK, say that you take
a cat and a bunch of equipment.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.670
You seal it inside of a box.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.295
You can't see what's
going on in there.

00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:51.120
But what you've put
in there with the cat

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.110
is a very weak
radioactive source, a lump

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.270
of slightly radioactive metal.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.370
And you've hooked it
up to a Geiger counter.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.230
The Geiger counter
detects that radiation,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.550
and if it detects
radiation, it releases

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.700
a hammer, which smashes
the vial of cyanide,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.260
which kills the cat.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.160
So if measurement is really
what collapses wave functions,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.430
then the wave function
of this whole system

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.180
shouldn't collapse
until you open the box.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.460
In other words, this
piece of radiation

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.950
that comes out from the
radioactive metal, that's

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.290
definitely a quantum object.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.860
It's a small thing.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.516
Right?

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:30.890
So it definitely obeys the
laws of quantum physics, which

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.517
means that in this traditional
way of thinking about wave

00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:36.350
functions as probability,
it means that it's

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.329
both been released and
remains in the metal, which

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:42.620
means that the Geiger counter
both goes off and doesn't

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.490
go off.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.920
Which means that the hammer
falls and doesn't fall,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.350
the cyanide is smashed
and doesn't smash,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.380
and the cat is dead and
alive until we open the box.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.360
And Schrodinger-- here he is--

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.400
said, this is ridiculous.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.220
Maybe subatomic particles can be
in more than one place at once,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.860
but cats are definitely
not both dead and alive

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.060
until we open the box.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.100
That just can't be right.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.104
That doesn't make any
sense, and the fact

00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:07.520
that this is what
the theory seems

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.900
to imply with the equation that,
by the way guys, I wrote down,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.170
that seems wrong.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:14.960
Right?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.560
That doesn't seem to be the
way that the world works.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.930
And that doesn't mean that
quantum physics is wrong.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.090
It's definitely not wrong.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.690
It's just not done yet.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.200
It's not complete or there
is something else beyond it.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.390
And this shouldn't be
controversial, right?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.784
The idea that our
scientific theories

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:33.200
aren't the whole
story, yeah, sure

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.730
there's going to
be another theory.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.920
Nobody thinks that our
scientific theories

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.320
that we have right now
are the end of the story.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.000
And that's all that
Schrodinger was trying to say.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.958
He was saying there's
something incomplete here

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.850
in our understanding of what's
going on in quantum physics.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.100
But despite the
fact that this seems

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.100
reasonable and
straightforward, most

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.010
of Schrodinger's contemporaries
profoundly disagreed with him.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.330
So people like Niels Bohr
or Werner Heisenberg--

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.500
Bohr is the guy on the
left of that picture

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.390
from my perspective.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.490
So I guess right from
your perspective.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.490
Heisenberg is the younger
one on the other side.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.040
So Bohr and Heisenberg,
two of the other founders

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.616
of quantum physics,
they profoundly

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.990
disagree with
Schrodinger, as did

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.000
many of Schrodinger's
contemporaries

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.780
and many of the other people who
put together quantum physics.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.980
They said no.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.010
This is wrong.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.180
This whole thing with the
cat, it's a misunderstanding.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.880
Some of them said,
yeah, it's just

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.520
wrong to talk about
what's going on in the box

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.760
before we open it because
what's going on in the box

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.900
before we look is, in
principle, unobservable.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.600
And it's unscientific to talk
about unobservable things.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.020
In fact, it's meaningless to
talk about unobservable things.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.440
This is the lesson of the
philosophy of language

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.090
that comes out of
quantum physics.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.645
Others said, no, no, no, no.

00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:57.020
It's not that it's meaningless,
it's that opening the box

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.840
really does force the
cat to be dead or alive.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.660
And until we look, it
really isn't either one.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.420
Others said, no, no, no, no, no.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.310
You've completely
misapplied this theory

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.080
that you helped develop.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.350
Quantum physics has,
by necessity, a split

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.560
between the measurer
and the measured.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.140
And the problem with the cat
experiment that you've set up

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.015
is you're trying to get
rid of that division.

00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:23.210
And that's what's
leading to the confusion.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.550
And others said,
no, you're trying

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.070
to say that quantum physics
tells us how the world is.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.400
Quantum physics isn't
about how the world is.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.380
Quantum physics is
just a tool that we

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.260
use to predict the
outcomes of measurements.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:36.980
That's all it is.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.910
It's an instrument.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.320
It's not a theory about
the state of the world.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.160
And this collection of vague
related questionably coherent

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.430
contradictory claims, this
is known as the Copenhagen

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.900
Interpretation.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.500
This is named after the home
of Niels Bohr's institute

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
in Copenhagen, which was
the center of the physics

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.850
world for much of the first
half of the 20th century.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.480
And the Copenhagen
Interpretation, like I said,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.000
it seems somewhat contradictory.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.359
It seems somewhat vague.

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:15.650
What does it have to say
about the measurement problem?

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.380
What does it say leads to
wave function collapse?

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.090
What does it say
is going on there?

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.120
How do we define
what measurement is?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.190
How do we say when wave
functions collapse?

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.560
When does the Schrodinger
equation apply,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.590
and when is it suspended?

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.710
The standard answer that the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.770
gives to all of these
thorny questions

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.570
at the heart of the theory
is somewhat unsatisfying.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.880
Basically, it says,
shut up and calculate.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.230
And this is not quite
as foolish as it first

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.010
appears because, again, quantum
physics works remarkably well.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.620
It is incredibly good.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.280
I can't stress this enough.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.900
I mean, quantum
physics is really

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.830
responsible for most of the
technological breakthroughs

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.750
of the last 90 years.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.170
It is an incredibly good
theory, and these questions,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.540
at the heart of it,
really seem very thorny.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.980
And so you have a
choice of either

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.260
trying to bang your head
against these questions

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.540
or contribute to one of
the greatest revolutions

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.330
in the history of science,
a revolution that gave rise

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.190
not only to much of
modern technology,

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.110
but much of modern science.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.330
I mean, the whole
field of genetics

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.460
was based on imaging
breakthroughs

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.740
that came from quantum
physics, for example.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.100
But shutting up and calculating,
saying all of these things

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.810
that the Copenhagen
Interpretation wants

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.190
to tell us, it is unsatisfying.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.970
And I'll take
questions at the end.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.650
I really will.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.320
This talk is not going to take
the whole time, nowhere near.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.290
But I'm excited to
hear your question.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.640
So there is a problem,
shutting up and calculating.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.850
There are several problems.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:07.840
One problem is that
we want to understand

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.940
what is going on in the world.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.909
Quantum physics tells
us why the sun shines,

00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:13.450
but if quantum
physics really is just

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.910
an instrument for
predicting outcomes,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.040
quantum physics doesn't
tell us why the sun shines.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.840
It has no explanatory
power at all.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.160
It only has predictive power.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.850
So it doesn't explain why I'm
not passing through the floor.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.280
It doesn't explain
why I can see.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.500
It just says I won't
pass through the floor.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.960
It doesn't tell us where
those things come from.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.420
It doesn't give us a
picture of the world.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.540
And if that sounds a
little bit wishy-washy,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.820
let me make it more clear.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.530
Quantum physics, if the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.380
is correct, there's no
reason why it's true.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.870
There's no reason why it works.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.790
In fact, its success
is just a coincidence

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.040
because quantum physics,
according to the Copenhagen

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.050
Interpretation, isn't about
anything in the world.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.760
There's nothing
in the world that

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.750
is even approximately described
by the equations of quantum

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.250
physics.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.880
And if that's true, why
does the theory work?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.920
What makes it true?

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.590
The fact that it works
at all, even though it

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.020
has no connection to
anything in reality,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.400
would be nothing
short of a miracle,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.000
a phenomenal
coincidence, if it's just

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.030
a trick for calculating that has
no relationship to the things

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.140
in the world around us.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.410
On top of that, there are
some scientific projects

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.630
that we want to do
as physicists, which

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.860
the Copenhagen Interpretation
explicitly or implicitly makes

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.480
very difficult or impossible.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.790
We want to think
that measurement

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.110
is a physical process.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.574
And physical processes should
be amenable to analysis.

00:15:43.574 --> 00:15:45.990
We should be able to come up
with a physical theory of how

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.580
measurement works.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.960
But the Copenhagen
Interpretation

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.800
says no, you can't do that.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.274
There is no need or way
to come up with a quantum

00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:56.190
theory of measurement.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.550
In fact, Niels Bohr
himself said that coming up

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.050
with a quantum
theory of measurement

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.590
was fundamentally misguided
as a scientific project.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.050
We also-- and I mean, this
is near and dear to my heart,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.040
this next one--

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.050
we want to be able
to do cosmology.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.260
We want to be able to study
the entire universe at once.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.350
But if we have to
split the universe

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:21.350
into the measured and the
measurer, we can't do that.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.850
And if we have to
split the universe

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.440
into the measured
and the measurer,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.790
we have an even bigger problem.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.420
We want to account for classical
physics, the physics of Isaac

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.281
Newton, using quantum physics.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.780
That's why the
theory was developed.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.240
It was developed to
explain situations

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.390
that we couldn't explain
using classical physics.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.530
And yet, if measurements are
a necessary part of the theory

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.980
and those measurements cannot
be described using quantum

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.530
physics, they can only be
described using classical

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.310
physics-- again, as Niels
Bohr and company said--

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.365
then we can't ground classical
physics in quantum physics.

00:16:55.365 --> 00:16:56.990
If anything, it's
the other way around.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.910
The logical foundations
of quantum physics

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.950
require classical physics.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.590
And that seems really strange,
especially because there's

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.670
nothing particularly special
about classical physics.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.430
Bohr and Heisenberg, they
said things like, oh,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.579
the idea of measurement has
to be grounded in classical

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.520
physics because that's the
way our intuitions work--

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.980
they read a lot of Kant--

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.560
and that's not true.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.410
Because classical physics is
profoundly counter-intuitive.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.750
Our intuitions are
no more classical

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.770
than they are grounded in
witchcraft or astrology.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.260
Classical physics has
many surprising results.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.530
If you've ever done that thing
where you sit in a spinny chair

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.750
and you hold a bicycle
wheel, I didn't

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.910
see that coming the
first time I did that.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.100
I don't think any of us do.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.410
So yeah, that can't
be right either.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.820
So the Copenhagen Interpretation
is profoundly unsatisfying,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.140
both scientifically
and philosophically.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.632
Now it's time for a
couple of disclaimers.

00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:59.940
So here's the thing.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.250
Despite the fact that the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.870
is unsatisfactory, it is still
the default interpretation.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.480
It is the standard
interpretation

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.400
of quantum physics today.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.760
It is what is used in
most popular science books

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.900
on the subject.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.820
It is what is presented in
basically every single widely

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.970
used quantum physics textbook
in undergraduate and graduate

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.570
courses.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.020
I was exposed to it
in that way as well.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.820
It's what you learn in school.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.600
It is what many, if not most,
physicists believe to be true.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.590
And they believe this to hold
the answer to the measurement

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.290
problem, especially
older physicists,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.340
as the Copenhagen Interpretation
was once massively

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.750
overwhelmingly dominant.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.480
Its dominance has declined
over the last few decades.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.410
So the first disclaimer
is what I just

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.090
told you is a minority view.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.200
I am a minority.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.630
What I just told you is
not the standard story

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.570
that you get in a
quantum physics class.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.880
So given that this
is a minority view,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.490
why am I so sure that I'm right?

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.100
Why am I so willing
to come up here

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.010
to Google and other places
I've been giving this talk

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.380
and say, yeah, no, the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.170
doesn't work?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.500
Well, there is definitely
some controversy

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.140
over the foundations of quantum
physics among physicists,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.510
but the history and philosophy
of quantum physics, that's

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.290
a different story.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.530
In broad strokes, there
is an understanding

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.470
of what happened over
the last 90 years

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.270
in the development
of quantum physics

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.330
and the philosophy underpinning
the stories that we

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.220
tell about quantum physics.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.870
And that history and
philosophy is wildly

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.940
unknown to most physicists.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.060
Physicists have a set of
historical and philosophical

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.910
myths that they tell
amongst themselves,

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.210
kind of folk history, that's
passed down from generation

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.400
to generation of physicists,
either explicitly

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.940
or implicitly, about the
history of quantum physics

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.740
and why we believe
the things that we're

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.360
told to believe about it.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.000
That folk history is very wrong.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.150
It is just, as a matter of
historical fact, incorrect.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.632
And I'm going to explain to
you what that folk history is

00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:19.340
and then tell you what
actually happened,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.830
which leads me to my
second disclaimer, which

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.500
is that the best psych research
suggests that if you're

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.870
trying to debunk a myth,
you shouldn't repeat

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.510
the myth first.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.240
I'm going to throw
caution to the wind

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.570
and tell you this folk
history, this completely

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.050
mythical account of the
history of quantum physics.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.310
And then I'm going to
tell you why it's wrong.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.620
So with all the stuff that
I'm about to tell you, take it

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.250
with a grain of
salt. So here we go.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.280
Once upon a time,
there was a group

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.510
of phenomenally talented
physicists working

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.750
in a loose team in the first
quarter of the 20th century

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.690
to try to understand
what was going on

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.480
in the world of the ultra
tiny, the world of atoms

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.380
and subatomic particles.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.280
Now this team didn't
have a leader per se,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.430
but they had a kind of
spiritual guide in their quest.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.220
And that was Niels
Bohr, who again, is--

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.000
he's the older guy in the
picture over off on the side.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.870
And this team also included
phenomenally talented

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.490
physicists like
Werner Heisenberg

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.300
in the middle, Pauli
sitting across from Bohr,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.640
and many other
physicists besides.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.520
Erwin Schrodinger, Louis de
Broglie, a wide collection

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.150
of physicists.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.691
And over the course of the first
quarter of the 20th century,

00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:44.750
they developed the first real
theories of quantum mechanics.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.770
And with these theories came
a single unified picture

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.020
of how to think about
quantum mechanics

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.820
called the Copenhagen
Interpretation.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.200
And the Copenhagen
Interpretation

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.960
said questions about
what's happening

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.680
before you look at quantum
objects are meaningless.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.180
It's not sensical to
even ask those questions.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.150
The world is
fundamentally random,

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.580
and quantum mechanics
is the best theory

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.220
that we can come up with
to understand what's

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.250
going on in the quantum world.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.100
And this really bothered
Albert Einstein.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.640
Most physicists were very happy
to accept this, but Einstein--

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.430
Einstein had once been a
bomb-throwing revolutionary

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.060
in his youth.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.580
He had blown up
the physics world

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.040
with special relativity
and then 10 years later,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.030
general relativity.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.310
But that was long ago.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.210
Now he was old.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.100
He was stuck in his ways.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.420
He was conservative,
and he couldn't

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.020
accept that quantum physics
could be fundamentally random.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.650
He couldn't accept that the
world wasn't deterministic.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:54.600
He was sure that the theory
had to be self-contradictory

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.750
or if not contradictory,
incomplete or wrong

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.530
in some fundamental way because
determinism had to be true,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.180
according to Einstein.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.300
So he developed a set of
thought experiments intended

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.340
to show that the theory
was contradictory.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.590
And in particular, he
went after this thing

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.124
called the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle.

00:23:13.124 --> 00:23:14.790
And the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.060
says that you can't know both
the position and the velocity--

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.160
really the momentum,
but whatever--

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.030
the position and the momentum
of an object at the same time

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.830
to arbitrary precision.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.860
He came up with a bunch
of thought experiments

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.401
to try to show that
this wasn't true,

00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:31.860
but Bohr and Bohr's
team of researchers

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.160
showed at every turn that
Einstein was incorrect, that he

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.270
had misunderstood things.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.240
And this culminated in
a thought experiment

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.140
where Einstein
devised a box filled

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.990
with light that was
hanging on a scale

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.800
spring with a clock
attached to it

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.050
and a little door in the side.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.382
And he showed that you
could use this to get around

00:23:51.382 --> 00:23:53.340
a different uncertainty
relationship in quantum

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.250
physics, the energy time
uncertainty relation.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.380
But Bohr took a
look at this thing

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.320
and proved that Einstein
was wrong for an incredibly

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.250
embarrassing reason.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.250
He said, Einstein, you've
forgotten your own theory

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.030
of general relativity, which
shows that this cannot work.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.420
You cannot use this device
to get around the energy time

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.130
uncertainty relationship.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.200
Einstein, of course, was
incredibly embarrassed,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.060
and he laid low for a while.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.700
And then he came up with
a new thought experiment

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.910
that was going to show the world
that quantum physics couldn't

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:24.925
be correct.

00:24:24.925 --> 00:24:26.550
And so he came up
with something called

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.590
the EPR thought
experiment, named

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.570
after Einstein and
his two co-authors

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.460
on the paper,
Podolsky and Rosen.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.640
And the EPR paper
showed that you

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.130
had to be able to get around
the Uncertainty Principle,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.800
and if you couldn't, that
would mean that either quantum

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.750
physics was incomplete or
that there was something going

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.550
faster than light somehow.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.880
Bohr responded to this.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.736
Einstein said,
nothing could possibly

00:24:52.736 --> 00:24:53.860
be going faster than light.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.140
That would be spooky
action at a distance.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.930
Bohr gave a
response, brilliantly

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.910
dismissing Einstein's concerns.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.530
Most physicists thought,
OK, that's the end of it.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.980
We still don't quite know
which one could be right,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.480
but it's a matter of philosophy.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.896
We don't need to
think about that.

00:25:08.896 --> 00:25:12.460
And then, 30 years later,
after both Bohr and Einstein

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.550
were dead, a physicist
named John Bell came along.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:20.090
And he proved that Bohr was
right and Einstein was wrong

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.910
and that you could not have
some more complete theory of how

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.030
quantum physics works without
violating the predictions

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.890
of quantum physics.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:34.780
And thus, the world was made
safe for quantum physics,

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.680
and everybody lived
happily ever after.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.880
So how much of what I
just told you is true?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.620
Not a whole lot.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.930
Most of that is just wrong.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.210
As a matter of
historical fact, if you

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.424
look at contemporary
evidence, letters

00:25:52.424 --> 00:25:54.340
that people sent to each
other, lecture notes,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.520
rather than looking at
people's recollections of what

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.840
happened years after the fact,
here's what actually happened.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.660
It is true that Bohr
and Heisenberg and Pauli

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.820
and a group of
brilliant physicists

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.880
did put together the first true
theories of quantum physics.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.610
It is true that
Einstein was among them

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.530
and that Einstein
didn't like the theory.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.900
Einstein though, when these
debates between him and Bohr

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.900
started in the mid to late
1920s, he was in his 40s.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.440
He wasn't exactly
old and senile.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.280
He was in perfectly good shape,
and his main concern actually

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.880
had nothing to do with the fact
that quantum physics presented

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.060
a world that was
fundamentally random.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.760
He had two major concerns
aside from that one.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.060
That was like a secondary
or tertiary concern.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.960
He was concerned that quantum
physics didn't give us

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.700
a real picture of the world
independent of observation.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.760
So he's concerned about realism.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.289
And he was also
concerned-- and he

00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:59.330
felt that these were two
sides of the same coin--

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.330
that because quantum
physics was not realist,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:07.520
it was also doomed to have
non-locality, spooky action

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.490
at a distance,
things influencing

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.210
each other at a distance
faster than the speed of light,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.067
instantaneously even.

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.650
Einstein felt that that couldn't
be right, not only because it

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.316
would violate relativity,
but because he

00:27:20.316 --> 00:27:22.520
felt it would make it near
impossible to do science.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.870
And he thought the Copenhagen
Interpretation was not only

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:33.520
not realist, but in so far as it
was realist, it was non-local.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.530
And that, he could not abide.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.950
And so he came up with a
series of thought experiments,

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.335
not to get around the
uncertainty principles,

00:27:41.335 --> 00:27:42.220
mostly--

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.720
he had one or two like that--

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.790
mostly, his thought
experiments were

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:50.980
intended to show that quantum
physics was non-local.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.790
This one was meant to show that
quantum physics was non-local.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.880
It had nothing to do with
the energy time uncertainty

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.160
relationship aside from
the fact that it did

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.740
enter into the setup in a way.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.290
But Einstein wasn't trying
to get around it in any way.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.980
Bohr completely misunderstood
what Einstein was trying to get

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.191
at with this set up.

00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.690
He thought Einstein was trying
to get around the energy time

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.100
uncertainty
relationship and thus

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.090
show that quantum physics
was inconsistent internally.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.760
And then in order to answer
this supposed argument

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.780
from Einstein, Bohr brought
in a totally separate theory

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.280
that we still don't know how
to make consistent with quantum

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.760
physics in order to defend the
internal consistency of quantum

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.030
physics.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:36.280
In other words, he gave a
profoundly inadequate argument

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.590
in response to an argument that
Einstein wasn't even making.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:45.450
This should have been a massive
embarrassment for Niels Bohr,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.660
and the standard story around
this thought experiment

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.250
is just completely confused.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.010
Einstein, meanwhile, went
home and thought, shit,

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.160
Bohr still doesn't understand
what I'm getting at.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.620
Let me make it simpler for him.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.560
Thus was born the EPR
thought experiment.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.400
And so after more debates
between Einstein and Bohr,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.360
Einstein put together
this thought experiment,

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.950
the EPR thought experiment.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.980
He published it with his
friends, collaborators Podolsky

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.270
and Rosen.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.219
And after it came
out-- he actually

00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:21.260
wasn't that happy with
the way that the paper was

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.940
put together, but he
then wrote about it

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.940
more in both letters and essays
through the rest of his life.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.640
And he made it very clear
that the point of this thing

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.060
was that there was
a forced choice.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.170
There was a choice
for quantum physics.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:42.060
It could either be incomplete
and local or complete and

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.860
non-local.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.770
So he was saying if the
Copenhagen Interpretation is

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.140
really the end of the
story, then something has

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.200
to be going faster than light.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.860
Bohr gave a response
to the EPR paper.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.770
It was really, really
hard to understand what

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.030
Bohr's response was saying.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.340
And I'm not just saying
that because I've read it

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.440
and it makes no friggin' sense.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.680
I'm saying that because Bohr
said it was hard to understand.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.039
Bohr actually wrote about
this about 15 years later.

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:13.330
He wrote about these debates
that he had with Einstein,

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.038
completely mischaracterized
him, and then

00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:16.690
when he got to
that part, he said,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.460
I responded to the EPR paper.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.550
I apologize for it being
so difficult to understand,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.722
and then he moved on.

00:30:22.722 --> 00:30:24.430
He didn't actually
explain what he meant.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.346
He just said I know it
was hard to understand,

00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:27.220
then he moved on.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.430
Nonetheless, despite the
fact that Bohr's writing was

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.670
convoluted and
obscure, people felt

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.525
that these deep
philosophical puzzles

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:37.900
at the heart of the theory
were actually better addressed

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.500
by convoluted obscure writing
that made the answers unclear

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.400
rather than Einstein's very
clear direct writing that

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.280
made it obvious that
there was a problem here.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.110
Part of that was because--

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.070
this confusion between obscurity
and profundity-- part of it

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.217
was that Bohr work
collaboratively

00:30:57.217 --> 00:30:59.300
with a group of people
throughout his entire life.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.390
And so he had more
people just on his side

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.300
politically whereas
Einstein was someone

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.530
who usually worked alone.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.900
Einstein described himself
as going through life

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.760
like a one horse cart.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.500
He did not really
work with people.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.771
He didn't build a school
of thought around himself.

00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:16.770
And part of it was just
that Einstein was making

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.840
a very uncomfortable argument.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.220
Einstein was saying,
no, we're not done.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.940
There's more work to be done
here whereas Bohr was saying,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.690
no, it's cool.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.962
Let's go off and keep doing
what we've been doing.

00:31:26.962 --> 00:31:28.420
You don't have to
worry about this.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.620
You can just shut
up and calculate.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.960
Now part of the reason
that Bohr won the day

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.260
was also that there was a
proof by John von Neumann that

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.360
had been published in 1932
saying that there was no way

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.840
to come up with a more complete
theory of quantum physics,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.250
that you couldn't add
something to the theory

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.280
and thus get something
not statistical, something

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.740
that gives you a more
complete picture of reality,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.180
without actually changing the
predictions of the theory.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.830
And nobody, not even
Einstein, wanted

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.455
to change the
predictions of the theory

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:06.940
because the theory is
phenomenally successful.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.750
So von Neumann's proof
and Bohr's writings

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.520
helped quantum
physics carry along.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.882
Now, there was just one problem.

00:32:13.882 --> 00:32:15.840
Von Neumann, one of the
greatest mathematicians

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.610
to have ever lived,
made a mistake.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.850
His proof was wrong.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.870
This was actually pointed out by
the mathematician Greta Hermann

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.170
only a few years later.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.160
But people didn't listen
to her, probably in part

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.050
because she was a woman.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.360
And in the 1930s,
women were usually not

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.340
even allowed to teach at
universities much less

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.870
prove John von Neumann wrong.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.710
So quantum physics just sort
of carried on with a hole

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.100
at its heart, piling
success upon success

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.730
over the course of the Manhattan
Project in World War II--

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.520
which incidentally, after
the Manhattan Project and all

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.390
that money poured into physics,
classroom sizes ballooned.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.940
And the historian of
physics, David Kaiser at MIT,

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.240
has done a fascinating study
showing that the amount of time

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.860
devoted to
foundational questions

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.440
in quantum physics
in course syllabi

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:10.620
after World War II is inversely
proportional to classroom size.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.790
So the larger the
classroom, the less time

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.790
they spent talking
about these questions

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.460
at the heart of quantum
physics, which makes some sense.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.050
It's hard to address
them properly.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:24.180
So after the war,
young physicist

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.300
named David Bohm came up with
a different way of thinking

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.770
about quantum physics.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.650
He discovered that
you could just

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:34.830
take the equations as
they were and develop

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.990
an entirely different
picture of nature

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.810
to go along with it, one that
involved waves and particles

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.260
and was entirely deterministic.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.630
In particular, it involved
particles surfing on waves.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.700
And those waves would
guide the particles.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.650
The waves could
interfere with themselves

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.390
and with other
waves, and they would

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.630
guide the motion
of the particles

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.190
to appear in the
correct locations

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.060
as to make the predictions
of quantum physics true.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.750
And this became known
as pilot wave theory,

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.670
but this was largely
dismissed at the time,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.770
in part because of
von Neumann's proof,

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.040
in part because Bohr's ideas
had already become entrenched

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.820
over the quarter
century before that,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.495
and in part because
David Bohm had--

00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:21.590
I'm going to go ahead
and call it shit luck.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:26.449
David Bohm got really interested
in communism in the 1940s,

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:28.880
and then he got called up
before the House Un-American

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.030
Activities Committee
in the late 1940s,

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.239
chaired by someone who
probably haven't heard of named

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:35.915
Richard Nixon.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.750
And then he got arrested
on contempt of Congress

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.719
because he wouldn't name names
because he had, you know,

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.020
integrity.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.336
And then he was cleared
because it turns out

00:34:49.336 --> 00:34:51.710
there is, in fact, a Fifth
Amendment to the United States

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.050
Constitution.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.000
But it didn't matter.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.900
He was blacklisted.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.830
He was fired from
his job at Princeton.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.680
And in fact, it was while he
was waiting for his day in court

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.762
that he developed pilot wave
theory, which had, by the way,

00:35:04.762 --> 00:35:06.470
part of it had been
previously discovered

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.580
25 years earlier by
Louis de Broglie.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.751
But Bohm independently
rediscovered it

00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:14.000
and then completed the theory.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.190
But Bohm was cleared
on all charges,

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.510
but he was blacklisted.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.030
This happened right after he
submitted his papers, even

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.670
before they were published.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.190
Couldn't find a job to work
in physics anywhere in the US

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.820
despite having recommendation
letters from Robert Oppenheimer

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.820
and Albert Einstein,
and ended up

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.400
having to go to
Brazil, at which point

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.890
his passport was
confiscated illegally

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.210
by the American consulate.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.590
And he was trapped in Brazil for
almost five years, during which

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.410
time his papers were
published, discussed

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.670
without him being around.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.860
He could only correspond
at a distance.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.940
Many famous physicists
published papers or gave talks

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.130
explaining why Bohm
was wrong without Bohm

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.290
being there to defend himself.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.700
And ultimately, his ideas were
forgotten by most physicists,

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.110
But not all.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.340
John Bell read David
Bohm's papers in 1952

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.980
when they were first
published, and he immediately

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.840
knew that something was
wrong, not with Bohm's papers.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.200
He had been told of John
von Neumann's proof, not of

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.680
Greta Hermann's disproof
of von Neumann's proof

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.420
because nobody knew about that.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.220
But he had been told
of von Neumann's proof

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.280
even though he had always found
the Copenhagen Interpretation

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.326
hopelessly vague.

00:36:29.326 --> 00:36:30.575
He said he knew it was rotten.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.220
He figured there had
to be something better.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.190
But then he was told
about von Neumann's proof

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.430
and figured, OK, I must just
not be understanding something.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.220
And then he saw Bohm's
papers, worked through them,

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.590
and realized, no, there's
nothing wrong with this.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.450
There must be a
flaw in this proof.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.485
Problem, Bell
didn't speak German.

00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:51.110
The proof was only
published in German.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.744
He couldn't go in and figure
out what was wrong with it

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.910
until it was published in
English a few years later,

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.670
and by then, Bell was
busy with other things.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.800
But in 1963, Bell came out
to the South Bay, actually.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.140
He got invited to be
a visitor for a year

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.450
while he was on
sabbatical from CERN.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.140
He was a visitor at
Slack just down the road.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.810
And while he was at
Slack, he figured,

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.720
I really hate the
Copenhagen Interpretation.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.580
It just can't be
right, and yet there's

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.130
this proof from von Neumann
and these other proofs

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.257
along the same lines.

00:37:23.257 --> 00:37:25.340
I know that they're wrong
because there is nothing

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.440
wrong with Bohm's version
of quantum physics,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.300
and these proofs
would rule it out.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.520
Let me figure out what's
wrong with those proofs.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.850
So he sits down, plays
with them for a while,

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.910
and he finds that von Neumann's
proof is not only broken,

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.890
he later characterized
it as silly.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.220
So he publishes a paper showing
that von Neumann is wrong,

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.940
which gets lost in an editor's
desk for a couple of years.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.260
He was really unfortunate.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.360
But then he says, OK but
there's something else

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.520
funny about Bohm's version
of quantum physics.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.910
It has this spooky
action at a distance.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.460
The position of a
particle way over here

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.790
can instantaneously affect the
behavior of a pilot wave way

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.050
over here.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:05.880
That seems strange.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.700
No, is there a way
of not doing that?

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.350
Can I come up with something
like Bohm's version of quantum

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:13.260
physics without having
this instantaneous action

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.410
at a distance?

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.160
So he starts working on it,
and he realizes he can't do it.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.410
And then he writes up a proof.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.244
And that proof has become
known as Bell's theorem.

00:38:22.244 --> 00:38:23.910
Bell's theorem is one
of the single most

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.180
profound and important results
in all of quantum physics.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.640
It led to what's been
called the second quantum

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.470
revolution, which
among other things,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.720
led to the entire field
of quantum information

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.610
processing, quantum
cryptography, quantum

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.740
computing, you name it.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.370
It's also profoundly
misunderstood.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.870
People often characterize Bell's
theorem not only as proving

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.660
that Bohr was right, but that
proving that you cannot have

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.970
anything like Bohm's
version of quantum physics.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.970
Or they'll say, oh, it proves
that either something is going

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:55.110
faster than light or you have
hidden variables completing

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.580
the theorem, completing
quantum physics saying,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.910
OK this is what's going
on before you look.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.080
That's not true.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.040
In fact, Bell himself said
that that wasn't true.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.900
That wasn't what the
proof was about at all.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.280
It is pretty much just a
proof that nature is not local

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.040
if it conforms with the
predictions of quantum physics.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.170
There are only a couple
of ways out of that.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.222
One of them was--
oh, sorry hold on.

00:39:19.222 --> 00:39:21.180
If you want to learn more
about Bell's theorem,

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.840
it is a whole subject
for a talk by itself.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.010
I have an interactive
essay explaining it

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.627
in more detail on my website.

00:39:29.627 --> 00:39:31.210
I'll leave that up
there for a moment.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.376
But there are only a few
ways out of Bell's theorem.

00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:35.070
People will sometimes
say that realism

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.660
is a way out of Bell's theorem.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.900
That's actually not true either
because in order for realism

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.790
to be a way out, you
would need to deny

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.270
the existence of an external
reality to such an extent

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.990
that the idea of locality
itself would dissolve.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.219
So that's kind of nuts.

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.760
But another way out
of Bell's theorem

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.270
was developed before
Bell did his work

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.510
by a guy named Hugh Everett,
who came up with what is now

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.120
known as the many-worlds
interpretation of quantum

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.410
physics, which says that no,
wave functions don't collapse.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.500
Instead, when you do
Schrodinger's cat, what happens

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.930
is the radioactive
metal wave function

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.930
gets mixed up with the wave
function of the Geiger counter

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.670
and the cyanide in the cat.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.530
And so now instead of
a piece of radiation

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.440
that's both in the metal
and not in the metal,

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.500
you have a cat that is
both dead and alive.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.870
And then when you open the
box, your wave function

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.480
gets mixed up with these
other wave functions as well.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.960
And now there is a copy of you
looking at a dead cat in a box

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.970
and sad and a copy
of you looking

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.610
at a living cat in a
box and happy, I guess,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.730
that you didn't kill a cat.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.400
In any event, this is another
way out of Bell's theorem.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.010
You can come up with a version
of many-worlds that is local

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.930
because Bell's theorem
assumes that you only

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.830
have one universe.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.650
But these are not the only
two options on the table.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.020
There are many other
interpretations

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.057
of quantum physics available.

00:40:55.057 --> 00:40:56.890
It's just that the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.120
isn't one of them.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.140
There are other
ways of doing this,

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.980
and given that there are ways
of understanding what's actually

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.890
going on in nature, just
throwing up your hands

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.880
and saying, I give
up, we can't do it,

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.700
there's no way to
understand it, seems

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.812
both profoundly inadequate
and, frankly, unscientific.

00:41:13.812 --> 00:41:15.520
But you may be left
with another question

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.110
a much, much deeper and more
profound question, who cares.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:24.290
If quantum physics works, then
why does any of this matter?

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.560
And it does work, as I've
said over and over again.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.080
Quantum physics
definitely works.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.900
So why does it matter what
it's telling us about the world

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.500
if we can use it to
do whatever we want?

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.420
I'm going to need to appeal to
a higher authority on this one.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.806
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.460
- Now another thing that people
often say is that for guessing

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.970
two identical theories,
two theories--

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:54.041
suppose you have two
theories, A and B,

00:41:54.041 --> 00:41:56.040
which look completely
different psychologically,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.000
different ideas
in them and so on.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.490
But then all the consequences
that are computed

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.105
are exactly the same.

00:42:04.105 --> 00:42:06.835
You may even say they even agree
with experiment [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:06.835 --> 00:42:09.210
The point is though, that the
two theories, although they

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.620
sound different
at the beginning,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.100
have all consequences the same.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.559
It's easy usually to
prove that mathematically

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:16.350
by doing a little
mathematics ahead of time

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.510
to show that the logic
of this one and this one

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.054
will always give
corresponding consequence.

00:42:21.054 --> 00:42:22.470
Suppose we have
two such theories.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.110
How are we going to
decide which one is right?

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:25.830
No way.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.122
Not by science.

00:42:27.122 --> 00:42:29.580
Because they both agree with
experiment to the same extent,

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.621
there's no way to distinguish
one from the other.

00:42:31.621 --> 00:42:33.100
So the two theories,
although they

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.430
may have deeply different
ideas behind them,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.880
may be mathematically identical.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.752
And usually people say then
in science [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:42.752 --> 00:42:44.460
one doesn't know how
to distinguish them.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.390
And that's right.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.390
However, for
psychological reasons,

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:51.540
in order to get new
theories, these two things

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.660
are very far from equivalent
because one gives a man

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.730
different ideas than the other.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:59.010
By putting the theory in a
certain kind of framework,

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.255
you get an idea what
to change, which

00:43:01.255 --> 00:43:03.380
would be something, for
instance, in theory A, that

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.950
talks about something
that you say,

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.690
I'll change that idea in here.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.970
But to find out what the
corresponding thing is

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.854
you're going to change in
here may be very complicated.

00:43:11.854 --> 00:43:13.020
It may not be a simple idea.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.570
In other words, a
simple change here

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.104
may be a very different theory
than a simple change there.

00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:20.520
In other words, although they
are identical before they're

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.920
changed, there are
certain ways of changing

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.260
one which look natural,
which don't look natural

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:25.886
in the other.

00:43:25.886 --> 00:43:27.510
Therefore psychologically,
we must keep

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.270
all the theories in our head.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.710
And every theoretical
physicist that's any good

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.800
knows six or seven different
theoretical representations

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.670
for exactly the same physics.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.327
And knows that
they're all equivalent

00:43:40.327 --> 00:43:42.660
and that nobody is ever going
to be able to decide which

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.904
one is right at that level.

00:43:43.904 --> 00:43:46.320
But he keeps them in his head
hoping that they'll give him

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.260
different ideas for guessing.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.480
Incidentally, that reminds
me of another thing

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.610
and that is that the
philosophy or the ideas

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.324
around the theory--

00:43:56.324 --> 00:43:57.900
there are a lot of ideas.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.860
You say, I believe there is
a space-time or something

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.730
like that in order to
discuss your analyses.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.710
That these ideas
change enormously

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.060
when there are very tiny
changes in the theory.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.210
In other words, for
instance, Newton's ideas

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:16.170
about space and time agree
with experiment very well.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:20.220
But in order to get the correct
motion of the orbit of Mercury,

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.530
which was a tiny,
tiny difference,

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.170
the difference in the character
of the theory with which you

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.370
started was enormous.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.480
Reason is these are so
simple and so perfect.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.870
They produce definite results.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.080
In order to get
something that produces

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.580
a little different results,
has to be completely different.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.580
You can't make imperfections
on a perfect thing.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.000
You have to have
another perfect thing.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.479
So the philosophical ideas
between Newton's theory

00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:43.770
of gravitational and Einstein's
theory of gravitational

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.430
are enormous.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.590
Their differences,
rather, are enormous.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:48.810
What are these philosophies?

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.880
These philosophies
are really tricky ways

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.920
to compute consequences quickly.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.800
A philosophy, which is sometimes
called an understanding

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.230
of the law, is simply a
way that a person holds

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.670
the laws in his mind so as to
guess quickly at consequence.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:04.271
Some people have
said, and it's true

00:45:04.271 --> 00:45:06.270
for instance, in the case
of Maxwell's equations

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.850
and other equations,
never mind the philosophy.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.240
Never mind anything
of this kind.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.570
Just guess the equations.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.370
The problem is only
to compute the answers

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.680
so they agree with
experiment and is not

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.970
necessarily to have a philosophy
or words about the equation.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.190
That's true in a sense.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.450
Yes and no.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.640
It's good in the sense
you may be if you only

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.890
guess the equation, you're
not prejudiced in yourself,

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.980
and you'll guess better.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.480
On the other hand, maybe the
philosophy helped you to guess.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.590
It's very hard to say.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.310
For those people
who insist, however,

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:37.890
that the only thing
that's important

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.030
is that the theory
agrees with experiment,

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.200
I would like to make
an imaginary discussion

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.170
between a Mayan astronomer
and his student.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.100
The Mayans were able to
calculate with great precision

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.230
the predictions, for
example, for eclipses

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.690
and the position of the moon
in the sky, position of Venus,

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.140
and so on.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.070
However, it is all
done by arithmetic.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.360
You count certain numbers,
you subtract some numbers,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.290
and so on.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.600
There was no discussion
of what the moon was.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.510
There wasn't even a
discussion of the idea

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.410
that it went around.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.930
There was only
calculate the time

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.680
when there would be
an eclipse or the time

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.840
when it would rise,
their full moon

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.790
and when it would rise
half moon, and so on.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.610
Just calculate it only.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:20.400
Suppose that a young man went
to the astronomer and said,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.630
I have an idea.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.510
Maybe those things
are going around

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.660
and there are balls
like rock out there.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.250
We could calculate how they move
in a completely different way

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:34.320
then just calculate what
time they appear in the sky.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.875
So of course, the
Mayan astronomer

00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:40.451
would say, yes, how accurate
can you predict eclipses.

00:46:40.451 --> 00:46:42.450
He said, I haven't developed
the thing very far.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.415
He says, but we can
calculate eclipses

00:46:44.415 --> 00:46:46.290
more accurately than
you can with your model,

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.331
and so you must not pay
any attention [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:49.680
mathematical scheme is better.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.150
And there's a very
strong tendency

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.972
of people to say
against some idea.

00:46:53.972 --> 00:46:55.680
If someone comes up
with an idea and says

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.540
let's suppose the
world is this way,

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.360
and you say to him, well, what
would you get for the answers

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.790
for such and such a
problem, and he says,

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.520
I haven't developed
it far enough.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.170
And you say, well, we have
already developed much further,

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.290
and we can get the
answers very accurately.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.990
So it is a problem
as to whether or not

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.587
to worry about
philosophies behind ideas.

00:47:15.587 --> 00:47:16.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.150
ADAM BECKER: So
it's certainly true

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.550
that you can use whatever
interpretation of quantum

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.520
physics you like and come up
with the same predictions.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.010
And given that, there
is no test that you

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.110
can perform to show
which interpretation

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.020
of quantum physics is correct.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:37.330
But the story of the world that
goes along with the theories

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.770
that we have in science plays a
big role in the actual practice

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.300
of science.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.050
It actually influences
the way that we come up

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.900
with new theories to go
beyond the current theory.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.190
It influences what
experiments we conduct,

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:58.670
and it influences how
we interpret the results

00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:59.750
of those experiments.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.924
Feynman gives an example of--

00:48:02.924 --> 00:48:05.090
and this is in, by the way,
his book, "The Character

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.850
of Physical Law", which is a
compilation of the lectures

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:11.270
that I was going to
play a clip from.

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.300
Feynman gives the
example of someone

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.450
going to a Mayan
astronomer, back

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:21.120
when the Mayan civilization was
at its peak, and saying, look,

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.700
I know we have this
theory that allows

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.420
us to predict when
eclipses will happen

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.270
and when Venus will transit the
sun and all these other things

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:31.370
to phenomenal precision.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.740
But the theory doesn't
tell us what Venus is

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.730
or what the moon is.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:38.450
I have a theory that
tells us all those things.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:41.210
And then the Mayan astronomer
says, OK but can you

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.094
do the same things we can do.

00:48:43.094 --> 00:48:44.510
And the other guy
says, well no, I

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.375
haven't developed it fully yet.

00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:47.750
It doesn't mean
that we shouldn't

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:48.800
listen to the other guy.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.300
Right?

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.110
And it doesn't mean
that even if he

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:54.080
could get it to work just as
well as Mayan astronomy, that

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.110
doesn't mean that there is no
difference between the choices

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.760
we make in our theories.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.530
It matters for the
progress of science.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.190
And it matters beyond just
the realm of science as well.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.410
It matters for the entire world.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.540
Remember, throughout
the history of humanity,

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:13.610
this was at least in
Europe, the dominant way

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.860
of thinking about what
the universe looked

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.860
like throughout most
of human history.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.620
The Earth is at the center,
and everything moves around us.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.600
And it wasn't until
Copernicus in the 1500s,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.360
that people started seriously
considering the possibility

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.880
that the Earth is not at
the center of everything.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.420
And without that move,
without Copernicus uncentering

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.520
the Earth, it seems
unlikely that Darwin

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.840
would have had the
audacity to say, yeah,

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.840
humans are not at the
center of creation either.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.680
We are just another part
of a giant tree of life.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.770
And without those two insights,
our entire modern world,

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:52.460
not just science, but
culture, art, movies,

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.070
would look entirely different.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:58.100
Kubrick would never have
been able to film 2001,

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.710
not that that's the pinnacle
achievement of humanity

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:04.940
in the 20th century, but
I really like that movie,

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.770
and I think it's an
important piece of art.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.480
And there are other
very important pieces

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.040
of art, science, religion,
politics, economics.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.940
All of the realms of human
experience and endeavor

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:22.040
are affected by the stories
that we get from our science.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.340
And in fact, this is how we do
every other piece of science.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.850
Nobody says, oh,
genes aren't real,

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.460
they're just a way of
explaining the outcomes

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.010
of electron microscope
observations and genetics

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.000
experiments.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.180
Nobody says, or at least
physicists usually don't say,

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.340
space-time isn't real,
it's just something

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.070
that helps us understand
the outcomes at LIGO.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.350
We don't say electromagnetic
fields aren't real.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.350
We're very willing to
grant reality to things

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:50.240
except when it comes
to quantum physics,

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.920
and the reasons for that
are largely historical.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:58.820
I've written a book that
is about all of this.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.620
There were copies at
the back, but it looks

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.870
like everyone snapped them up.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:03.140
That's great.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.570
You can buy it online.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.290
You can go find it
anywhere books are sold.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.090
And if you do, that
will make me happy.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.650
I hope you enjoy it.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.000
You can get a hold of
me relatively easily

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.450
if you want to ask me questions
about anything in there.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:20.720
I discuss all of this in much
greater detail in the book,

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.630
and the book is, like
this talk I hope,

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.850
understandable for people
who have no physics

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:26.600
background at all.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.440
The intended audience is
just the interested public.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.600
So with that, thank
you for your time.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.577
Any questions?

00:51:34.577 --> 00:51:36.565
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:44.960
AUDIENCE: I guess putting things
historically correct, Einstein

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.830
has also attributed to this
quote of God doesn't play,

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.680
doesn't roll the die
and play with dice.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.940
And so that might have also
been taken out of context.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.230
If he actually didn't--

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.120
his biggest problems
weren't with,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.340
as you said, the
randomness but more

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.680
with this action at a distance.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.590
It sounds like that quote was
also kind of out of context.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.480
ADAM BECKER: Yes, I
think that's correct.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.210
Given that Einstein famously
said that God doesn't play dice

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.870
with the universe, it sounds
like that was taken out

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.180
of context, given that his
primary problem with quantum

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.450
physics was not randomness.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.900
I'm sorry, Alex, can you take
the computer and do that?

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.111
Yeah, thank you.

00:52:25.111 --> 00:52:26.610
ALEX: [INAUDIBLE]
account, actually.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.291
ADAM BECKER: Oh, OK that's fine.

00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:28.790
So yeah.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.050
I think that's right.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.060
It's not so much
that it was taken out

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.680
of context as it is that it
was a real problem that he had.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.270
He did not like the
randomness of quantum physics.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:46.710
He just also didn't like other
things about quantum physics,

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:47.210
even more.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:50.600
I mean, he also said, I
can't abide spooky action

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.560
at a distance.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.470
That got closer to
his real problem.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.750
And he also said some
very quotable things

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.410
about his problems with the
non-realism of the Copenhagen

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.190
Interpretation.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.980
They're just not as well-known.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.820
And I think that that's largely
because the idea of God playing

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.920
dice is this very sexy image
and also because it conforms

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.950
with this standard incorrect
narrative among physicists

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.620
about the history of physics.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.890
Einstein also said-- and I
love this quote so much--

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.550
he said, regarding the
Copenhagen Interpretation,

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:32.780
that it was a soft pillow
that the true believer can

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.060
rest his head on, but it
provides very little comfort

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:35.870
to him.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.750
Or he also said that--

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.950
again regarding the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.430
and its denial of reality--

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.120
he said that this
epistemology fueled

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.079
orgy must come to an end.

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:48.620
And I went and looked
it up thinking,

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.540
OK maybe the translation
from the German

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.440
took a few liberties.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.610
And it's right in there.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.740
It's something like
epistemologies orgy.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.690
So yeah, no, Einstein was
pretty clear about what

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:00.799
his problem was.

00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:02.465
It's just not been
represented properly.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:07.400
Yeah?

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.432
ALEX: Let's do an
online question first.

00:54:09.432 --> 00:54:11.390
ADAM BECKER: OK and then
we can then alternate?

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:12.170
OK sounds good.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:13.910
So what's the online question?

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:17.570
ALEX: What are your thoughts
on the Conway-Kochen Free Will

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.180
theorem, which basically
says that there

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.431
is a finite set of
experiments such

00:54:22.431 --> 00:54:24.930
that there is no consistent set
of possible outcomes for all

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:25.684
the experiments?

00:54:25.684 --> 00:54:27.350
ADAM BECKER: Yeah,
so this is a question

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.540
about my thoughts on the
Conway-Kochen Free Will

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.340
experiment.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.325
It's a good question.

00:54:31.325 --> 00:54:33.200
I'm going to say something
that will probably

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.100
piss off people in response.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.010
The Conway-Kochen
Free Will theorem

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.830
is just an attempt to
repackage Bell's theorem

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:42.800
along with a different result
known as contextuality, which

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.230
is actually also due to Bell.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.750
It was a Bell's demolition
of von Neumann's proof

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.030
that I talked about earlier.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.640
I don't think that there
is anything in there that

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.830
isn't in those two proofs.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:58.640
And I think that
mostly, what it means

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.990
is that there is non-locality
in nature or something else,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:05.180
one of the other ways
out of Bell's theorem,

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.750
must be true like
multiple universes.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.850
So yeah, maybe not the
most interesting response

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.099
to that, but I actually don't
find the result terribly

00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:17.050
interesting either

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:20.650
AUDIENCE: So I find
it very surprising

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.960
that there are
prominent physicists who

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.280
don't think that
quantum mechanics is

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.900
unitary or violates other
neat mathematical properties.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.670
It's non-local.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.000
So I mean, you've had some
interesting discussions

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.310
with Peter White and
Sabine Hossenfelder

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:44.890
is also a prominent
blogger who doesn't

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:48.470
believe in the multiverse.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.160
So what do the shut
up and calculate

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:56.050
people say happens in the
Schrodinger's cat scenario

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:58.560
for a sufficiently small cat?

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.240
ADAM BECKER: It's
a good question.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.680
So first of all, let
me make it clear.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.870
I am not saying, oh, the
multiverse is definitely true.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:08.750
I am saying--

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:09.410
AUDIENCE: I am saying that.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.730
ADAM BECKER: OK good.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.140
Yeah, no, it's a viable option.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.560
But well, some people
don't seem to understand

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.660
that that's what I'm saying.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.320
I don't know.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.990
I thought I made it pretty clear
in my book and in the talk.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:28.180
So you're asking what the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.640
people say happens to the
cat in Schrodinger's cat

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.330
for a sufficiently small cat.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.870
That's an excellent question.

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:39.840
I am strongly tempted to
give a very glib answer

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.330
and say they don't say
what happens to the cat.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:43.980
They don't say what
happens to anything

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.804
because their interpretation
is profoundly anti-realist.

00:56:48.804 --> 00:56:50.220
If I wanted to be
more charitable,

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.820
I would say you have to pick
a version of the Copenhagen

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.540
Interpretation.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.940
There is no single
Copenhagen Interpretation,

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.920
and arguably, it's not
interpretation at all.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.740
So the phrase the
Copenhagen Interpretation

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.990
is a little bit like
the Holy Roman Empire.

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:07.680
There's no the, and
there's no interpretation

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.150
and the affiliation with
Copenhagen is questionable.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:14.571
But if you pick a version
of Copenhagen, if you say,

00:57:14.571 --> 00:57:17.070
OK, let's pick the version that
says quantum mechanics stops

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.025
applying at a
particular size scale,

00:57:20.025 --> 00:57:22.650
then the answer of what happens
to the cat is reasonably clear.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.150
If it's larger than
that size scale,

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.160
then the cat is
either dead or alive.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.160
And if it's smaller, then the
cat is both dead and alive.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.316
If you pick a version
of Copenhagen that says,

00:57:31.316 --> 00:57:33.690
no, it's meaningless to ask
about what happens to the cat

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:36.360
before you look,
then the answer is,

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.920
we can't say what
happens to the cat

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.586
until you look because
it's meaningless.

00:57:39.586 --> 00:57:41.100
Because that's what we said.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.410
Because we don't
understand philosophy

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.381
of language or
metaphysics because we

00:57:45.381 --> 00:57:47.880
didn't pay attention when the
logical positivists were taken

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.800
down in the mid 20th century.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.550
But I definitely--

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.800
AUDIENCE: But then you can
get an interference pattern

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.310
of cats.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:54.030
ADAM BECKER: I agree.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:54.510
Yeah, no.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:55.550
You can get an
interference pattern.

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:56.924
The interference
pattern is real.

00:57:56.924 --> 00:57:58.740
I can't defend it
because they think

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:03.930
it's not just wrong, but
logically incoherent,

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:07.680
which makes it very, very
difficult to be sympathetic.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.420
I have to pick a version of it.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.870
And as far as I can tell,
the most reasonable version

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:15.900
of Copenhagen, which
some people, at least,

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.110
did believe at some
points is that there

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:21.450
is some sort of split between
the classical and the quantum.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.550
It happens either at
some scale or when

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.560
it hits the brain because
the brain is somehow

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.440
exempt from the laws of physics.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.530
Anyway.

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:31.260
Yeah.

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.850
ALEX: Let's take another
Dory question first.

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:36.460
Oh OK.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.870
Free will is bogus,
and the world

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:40.820
is entirely deterministic.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.190
Does this contradict
quantum physics?

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:47.084
What does it mean for
there to be no causation?

00:58:47.084 --> 00:58:47.750
ADAM BECKER: OK.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:50.180
So the question is about
whether quantum physics is

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:56.030
deterministic and
what it would mean

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:58.010
for there to be no causation.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:59.960
Whether quantum physics
is deterministic

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.650
depends on your interpretation.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:04.400
For example, the pilot
wave interpretation

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.170
is entirely deterministic.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.711
The many-worlds interpretation
is entirely deterministic,

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.460
which is actually kind
of a problem for it

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.960
because you need to figure out
where the probabilities come

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.460
from.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.835
|n the pilot wave
interpretation,

00:59:14.835 --> 00:59:16.004
they come from ignorance.

00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:17.420
In the many-worlds
interpretation,

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.210
you need to figure out
why we don't know things

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:23.240
because everything just obeys
this totally deterministic

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.752
Schrodinger equation.

00:59:25.752 --> 00:59:27.710
But there are people who
work on that who think

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:29.420
they've found solutions to it.

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.380
It's an active area of research.

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.430
Nonetheless, that's
totally deterministic.

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.964
There are proposed modifications
to quantum mechanics

00:59:37.964 --> 00:59:40.130
that would also solve the
measurement problem called

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:42.110
spontaneous collapse theories.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.260
Those are fundamentally
non-deterministic.

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.537
So it depends on what you pick.

00:59:48.537 --> 00:59:50.870
As for what it means for
things to not be deterministic,

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.150
it means that sometimes
the future of the world

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:57.520
is not fully specified by
the past state of the world.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.250
AUDIENCE: An effort to figure
out the nature of the universe

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:03.460
and how the universe works,
until or unless it can come up

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:08.710
with some kind of device
that can measure or detect

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:12.729
that which energy
and mass actually is.

01:00:12.729 --> 01:00:14.770
Because when you tear
apart both mass and energy,

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.510
eventually you're
left with nothing,

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:20.320
but obviously, mass energy
must be coming from something.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.880
Do you think we'll ever come
up with some means made up

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.360
of mass or energy that
can detect that which

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.040
underlies mass and energy?

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.550
Do you think that's
ever possible?

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.922
ADAM BECKER: I think that mass
is just one form of energy.

01:00:36.922 --> 01:00:38.380
I wouldn't say that
mass and energy

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.620
are two sides of the same coin.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.453
I would say mass is
just one kind of energy,

01:00:41.453 --> 01:00:42.934
and what's
fundamental is energy.

01:00:42.934 --> 01:00:45.100
And that is the standard
view among most physicists,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.799
and I think it's probably right.

01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:49.090
Mass is a kind of energy the
same way kinetic energy is

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.423
a kind of energy, the same
way heat is a kind of-- well,

01:00:51.423 --> 01:00:53.650
heat is a kind of
kinetic energy--

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.380
the same with that potential
energy is a kind of energy.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:00.220
I think that what e equals
mc squared really says

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.400
is that mass is
a form of energy.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.680
So yeah, I don't see a problem
there the way that you do.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.388
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:01:08.388 --> 01:01:09.326
Thank you.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.530
ALEX: Let's go back to the Dory.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.590
What is consciousness
according to quantum physics?

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.738
ADAM BECKER: I don't
see a relationship.

01:01:19.738 --> 01:01:21.960
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.870
OK let me be less flip.

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:28.410
So I think that a
lot of people like

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:30.510
to say that consciousness
has some relationship

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.780
to quantum physics because
we don't fully understand

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.390
what consciousness is and
because there's controversy

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.380
over the solution of
the measurement problem.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.630
So if we put together
the two things

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:41.171
that we don't
understand, maybe we'll

01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:44.040
get just one thing
we don't understand.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.307
And some serious physicists
have, at various points,

01:01:47.307 --> 01:01:49.890
proposed that consciousness is
the solution to the measurement

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.800
problem, that it's consciousness
that collapses wave functions.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.930
Eugene Wigner believed
this at one point

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:56.940
until he was set straight.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.920
I don't think that
that's correct.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.570
I think that if
that is correct, we

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:03.540
need to do a lot more work
to prove that it's correct

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.780
because there are definitely
viable alternatives to that

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.850
on the table.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.370
I think that if consciousness
causes collapse,

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.550
we have questions like,
OK, what is consciousness.

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:16.740
By what virtues does
it cause collapse?

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.420
What property does
it have that allows

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.800
it to collapse wave functions?

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.850
What else can collapse
wave functions?

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.915
It's a whole host
of other problems.

01:02:23.915 --> 01:02:25.290
And I don't think
quantum physics

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.780
itself says anything about
the nature of consciousness.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.150
I think that that's--

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:35.950
what consciousness is, is a good
question for a different field.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.590
AUDIENCE: So I remember reading
30 years ago these books,

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.810
following up to that, the
"Dancing Wu Li Masters"

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:43.157
and "The Tao of Consciousness".

01:02:43.157 --> 01:02:44.990
And I think the whole
premise of those books

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:50.622
was what can cause a
collapse in these functions.

01:02:50.622 --> 01:02:51.830
Is that basically the whole--

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:54.496
that was the whole misconception
of those books, that they based

01:02:54.496 --> 01:02:56.750
their entire framework around?

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.540
ADAM BECKER: Yes, so
the question was--

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.040
AUDIENCE: And can
I ask a follow up,

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.559
which is what can cause a
collapse in this function.

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.850
ADAM BECKER: Sure, so first
I realized I never actually

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.141
repeated the original question.

01:03:08.141 --> 01:03:08.890
I just answered.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:11.473
Which was, what is consciousness
according to quantum physics.

01:03:11.473 --> 01:03:12.730
That's the answer I just gave.

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.340
Your question was these books,
"The Dancing Wu Li Masters",

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.410
"The Tao of Physics", was
this about a misunderstanding

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.410
of what causes the collapse
of the wave function

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.050
and then what does cause the
collapse of the wave function.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:26.800
I think that those books were--

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.675
full disclaimer, I
have not actually

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:31.550
read both of those books
from cover to cover.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.640
I flipped through
them, but I think

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.520
that part of the
deal with those books

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.970
is that they are
interested in going

01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:42.850
after these questions that were
seen as verboten for physicists

01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:45.130
by the Copenhagen
Interpretation, which

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.930
the shut up part of
shut up and calculate

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.330
has a sort of
moralistic sense to it.

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:53.380
Like not only don't you
need to ask these questions,

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.300
you shouldn't ask
these questions.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.060
Good physicists don't
ask these questions.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.390
There's something wrong with
you if you ask these questions.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:03.280
Which is bullshit.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.840
But I think that
these books were

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.379
motivated in part by a desire
to ask those questions.

01:04:07.379 --> 01:04:08.920
And then they said,
OK, and let's ask

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.900
other questions that are
verboten to physicists

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.000
like is there ESP.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.770
What about telekinesis?

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.560
What about the relationship
between religion and quantum

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.940
physics, consciousness
and quantum physics?

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.010
And I think throwing in all that
stuff really confuses things,

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.720
but I think that they
were right to ask

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.759
the question of what's going
on in wave function collapse.

01:04:29.759 --> 01:04:31.300
I also think that
they were motivated

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.270
by this sort of desire
to see similarities

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:39.880
between certain religions
and quantum physics.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.150
And just to talk about
that for a second

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.200
before I get to your last
part of the question,

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.590
I think it's
generally a bad idea

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.770
to try to find parallels
between religion and science

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:55.420
because science has this
nasty habit of being refined

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.870
and corrected and proved wrong
or scientific theories get

01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:59.470
overturned.

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:03.130
So if you try to latch
your religious philosophy

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:04.750
onto a particular
scientific truth,

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.490
there's a good chance that
your religious philosophy

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:08.200
is going to go down
the toilet when

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.490
that truth is found to be not
quite true or completely wrong.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:14.475
So I'm not very sympathetic
to that project,

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:15.850
and I don't think
that people who

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:19.090
like religion should be either.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:24.240
Anyway as for what actually
causes the collapse of the wave

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.999
function, I don't know.

01:05:25.999 --> 01:05:27.790
I don't even know if
functions do collapse.

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.550
If they don't collapse,
we live in many worlds.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:35.680
Or we have something like pilot
wave theory where it collapse,

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.980
it's something that's
relative to other stuff.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.680
It's more complicated than that.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.912
Or we have something like
a spontaneous collapse

01:05:42.912 --> 01:05:44.620
theory where collapse
is a real objective

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.960
thing that happens at random.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.590
Or one of the other options.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.290
So I don't know what causes it.

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:53.080
But either wave function
collapse is happening

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.960
or something is causing it to
look like function collapse is

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.770
happening.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:59.050
And figuring out
what's going on there

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:02.650
is a legitimate area of
scientific inquiry called

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.170
foundations of
quantum physics that

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.260
still has a bad reputation among
physicists even to this day,

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.050
though it's less bad
than it used to be.

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.770
ALEX: I've heard you mention
many times that there's

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:20.110
sort of this big split between
physicists and philosophers

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:23.950
of physics because
physicists don't know

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.310
any philosophy while
philosophers of physics

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.350
know a lot of physics.

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.310
I'm also thinking of--

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:33.440
I'm probably going to
misquote it, a quote by--

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.250
I think it might be
some modern philosopher.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.720
It might be Dan Dennett--

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.210
I don't know-- who
said something like,

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.980
there's no science
without philosophy.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.190
There's only science with
unexamined philosophy

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:46.620
or something like that, which--

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.410
ADAM BECKER: Yeah that sounds
like something Dennett would

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:47.910
say.

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:49.780
ALEX: Yeah, and
so I thought maybe

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.260
you might want to
comment on why is

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.931
it that physicists don't
know any philosophy any more

01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:57.430
at least?

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.180
ADAM BECKER: This is
a very good question.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.720
So the question is about
why physicists mostly

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.790
don't seem to know
philosophy, but philosophers

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:06.820
of physics, the serious ones,
tend to be very well schooled

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.320
in physics.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.220
Many of them have
undergraduate or even

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:15.139
PhDs in physics as
well as philosophy.

01:07:15.139 --> 01:07:16.930
Yeah, there's definitely
an asymmetry there

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:18.471
where the philosophers
know much more

01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:21.490
physics than the
physicists know philosophy.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:24.880
As a physicist, I'm
interested in asymmetries.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.520
So yeah.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:36.610
I think that basically,
this is due to a variety

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.420
of historical and
cultural factors.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:45.090
I think that that quote, whether
it's Dan Dennett or whoever who

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.790
said that, it's definitely
true that physicists

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:51.746
engage in philosophy all the
time while doing physics.

01:07:51.746 --> 01:07:52.620
It's just part of it.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.084
And then the question is, OK
why don't they admit that.

01:07:58.084 --> 01:07:59.250
Why don't they look at this?

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.652
Well, philosophy has a
bit of a bad reputation

01:08:01.652 --> 01:08:02.360
among physicists.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.160
So why does it have
a bad reputation?

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.850
That's a hard
question to answer.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:10.050
I think part of it has to do
with those same factors at work

01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:13.140
after World War II where
academia just got flooded

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.430
with more people and this led
to a sort of Balkanization

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.880
of academia and the walls
went up between departments.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.002
It used to be that
physicists generally had

01:08:23.002 --> 01:08:24.210
some schooling in philosophy.

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:26.319
Now, that's not necessary.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:29.200
I'm not saying that we should
go back to the good old days.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.580
There are plenty of problems.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.040
But I do think
that a liberal arts

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.529
education is quite valuable
for doing almost anything.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:43.689
But I think that due to
that set of boundaries

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.490
between academic
disciplines, that

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.490
has made it easy for physicists
to be ignorant of philosophy.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:50.170
And then it's easy
for misconceptions

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:52.180
about philosophy, like
it doesn't make progress,

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.721
they just ask the
same questions over

01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:56.513
and over again, they're
not like us physicists,

01:08:56.513 --> 01:08:59.124
that kind of thing to show up.

01:08:59.124 --> 01:09:00.790
Philosophers also
have a habit of asking

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:01.899
very annoying questions.

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:03.315
This is a long and
proud tradition

01:09:03.315 --> 01:09:05.300
going back to Socrates.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:09.250
Now most of us don't have to
drink hemlock as a result.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.430
But one way of dismissing
annoying questions

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:15.130
is to say that the people who
ask the annoying questions

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:18.240
are stupid and don't
need to be listened to.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.520
Or you make them drink hemlock.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.790
So that's another thing.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:28.490
I think that there are
some philosophers who are,

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:32.979
let's say, skeptical
of scientific progress.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:37.300
This has to do with a
split within philosophy

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.680
between analytic and
continental philosophy,

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.279
which is a whole other thing.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:45.939
And those names are
incidentally not relevant at all

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:47.130
to what those fields study.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.390
They're just
historical artifacts.

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:55.000
But continental philosophy
tends to be a little bit more

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.570
skeptical of authority in
any form and in many ways,

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.160
rightly so.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.070
And it tends to ask questions
about scientific authority,

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:05.610
which if you interpret
them naively or if you're

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:09.190
a bad continental philosopher,
can lead to people saying

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:11.660
things like, oh science is
just as good as any other way

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.920
of trying to solve problems.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.620
And that's some bullshit.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.982
And scientists would be
rightly dismissive of that,

01:10:16.982 --> 01:10:18.940
and then they might lump
all other philosophers

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.481
in with that.

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:21.880
But that's just a
guess on my part.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.040
So I think that,
basically, philosophy

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:29.200
has a very bad reputation
for a variety of reasons.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.380
It used to not.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.360
Bohr did read too
much Kant, but it's

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.330
better than reading nothing.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:40.900
Einstein read a lot
of Mach and Leibniz

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:46.570
and Spinoza and other
great philosophers, Hume

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:49.190
in particular.

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.282
Yeah, I think that
it's a real shame

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.490
that that asymmetry is there.

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.090
I think that
philosophers of physics

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:58.330
have a lot to teach physicists
and have a lot of value

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:00.020
to offer.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.870
And I think it's really awful
when prominent scientists say

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:07.420
stupid things about
philosophy, which happens

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.842
more often than it should.

01:11:08.842 --> 01:11:10.300
ALEX: So the next
question is, what

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:14.896
about the success of quantum
electrodynamics in predicting?

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:16.270
I mean, it seems
like your answer

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:19.690
is the past hour-long
talk, roughly.

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:20.700
ADAM BECKER: Yeah.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.410
So the success of quantum
electrodynamics, yeah,

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:23.967
absolutely.

01:11:23.967 --> 01:11:26.050
Quantum electrodynamics
and quantum field theories

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:27.670
in general are
extremely successful.

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:30.490
I'm not debating the
success of quantum physics.

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:32.082
It absolutely works.

01:11:32.082 --> 01:11:33.790
It's just an incomplete
picture of what's

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.140
going on in the world.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.180
And throwing in quantum
field theory, as opposed

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.031
to just vanilla
quantum mechanics,

01:11:39.031 --> 01:11:40.030
doesn't fix the problem.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:42.040
If anything, it makes it worse.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.500
Some people will say, oh,
quantum field theory definitely

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.780
gets you around Bell's
theorem because quantum field

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.820
theory is designed
to be compatible

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.399
with special relativity.

01:11:50.399 --> 01:11:52.690
There are these things called
the commutation relations

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:57.160
that ensure this relationship.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.320
No, that doesn't solve
the problem at all

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.870
because you still have the
problem of wave function

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.490
collapse in quantum
field theory.

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:05.530
And that is subject
to Bell's theorem,

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.620
and that does not get solved
by the commutation relations.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.110
And this is a massive
misunderstanding that still

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.760
persists among physicists.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.500
And that's just a
mathematical mistake.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.940
That's just an error.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.520
Quantum field theory
doesn't solve this problem.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.650
Quantum field theory
also has other problems.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.480
It works incredibly
well, but it also

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.540
has its own unique issues
that mathematicians

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.349
worry about like
re-normalization

01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:29.140
or something called
Hogg's theorem, which--

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.225
don't get me started.

01:12:31.225 --> 01:12:32.020
ALEX: I won't.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.250
ADAM BECKER: Yeah, anyway.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.570
So yeah.

01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:36.080
Quantum field theory is great.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:36.910
I love it.

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:38.290
It is a wonderful theory.

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:39.820
Doesn't solve these problems.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.940
ALEX: OK, we have time
for one more question.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.755
So since you haven't had time.

01:12:44.755 --> 01:12:47.410
AUDIENCE: Just a follow-up
to your previous answer.

01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:49.420
Without speculating
about why physicists

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:54.130
have a bad image of philosophy,
can you, from your research,

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.540
pinpoint when this attitude--
when did physicists

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.280
start to have a bad
image of philosophy?

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.170
Since you're a physicist
and a philosopher,

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:04.741
can you give us your
attitude towards philosophy?

01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:06.990
Noting that your answer
doesn't need to be monolithic,

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:09.737
is there some part of philosophy
that you think is worthwhile?

01:13:09.737 --> 01:13:11.320
ADAM BECKER: I don't
know exactly when

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:11.980
the split happened.

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.320
I don't think it's something
that happened all at once.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.360
I think that World
War II has a lot

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.230
to do with it, which is in
a way kind of boring answer.

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.780
Like one of the central
events of the 20th century

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.100
had a lot of effect.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.570
That's a somewhat boring answer.

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:28.840
But yeah, I mean,
World War II really

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.400
changed the way that
academia worked.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.410
It really moved the center of
physics from Germany to the US.

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:38.440
The US already had a tradition
of much more pragmatic

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.470
approaches to the
sciences, which--

01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:47.120
that's going to make
philosophy look less useful.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.730
There was also this
school of thought

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:51.070
called logical
positivism, which was

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.800
very influential in the first
half of the 20th century.

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:58.540
And it was also a
school of thought

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.690
which was dismissive of
certain kinds of philosophy.

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:06.640
And then, around the time that
physics and philosophy kind of

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.180
decoupled around the end of
World War II, that was also

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.510
the beginning of the real
decline of logical positivism,

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.630
even among philosophers who
were sympathetic to the aims

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.980
of the positivists.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.750
And so by the time positivism
was fully discredited,

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.060
physicists couldn't
really get the memo

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.150
and still used a lot of
positivist-ish arguments,

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:30.880
really knock-off positivist
arguments like, oh,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.900
it's meaningless to talk about
things that you can't see.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.000
They would use those arguments
to dismiss most of philosophy

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.940
when, in fact, philosophy
is decades old counter

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.122
arguments explaining
why that doesn't work.

01:14:43.122 --> 01:14:44.830
And when you present
those to physicists,

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.916
they will sort of stare at
you slack jawed like did you

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:51.040
come up with that yourself.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.300
That seems very profound.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.466
No, that argument is older
than both of us combined.

01:14:58.781 --> 01:14:59.280
So yeah.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.150
As for my take on philosophy,
I think that in general, it

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:08.380
is usually a bad idea to
dismiss almost any area

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.550
of serious academic inquiry.

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:15.730
There are exceptions, such
as evolutionary psychology.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.430
I like psychology.

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.630
Evolutionary psychology?

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:28.960
But I think that
most of philosophy

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.400
has something worthwhile.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.540
I think philosophy of physics,
in the analytic tradition,

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.460
has done a lot of
really great work

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.980
in particular because it's
gone after these questions

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.200
that physicists have
largely ignored.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.600
But I also think that
philosophy of science

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.060
really helps to clear up a
lot of misunderstandings that

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.390
are prevalent among scientists
of all stripes about how

01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:50.120
science works.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.470
There are some naive ideas
there that philosophers

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.990
have help to kick to the curb.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.450
I think that if you think
that you have a simple answer

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:09.320
to a deep question, talking to
a philosopher for a few minutes

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.640
will usually tell you
that you're wrong.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.750
And I think that it's good
to experience being wrong.

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:18.780
I think that's an important
part of the human experience,

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.560
and I think that it's
good to think deeply

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.170
about strange questions.

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.870
And I think that the questions
philosophers tend to ask--

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:30.040
and this might be another
source of the problem--

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.790
philosophers will ask
questions that sound

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.680
like they have obvious
answers to scientists.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.360
Like OK, what is a physical law?

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.650
OK, that doesn't
seem interesting.

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:42.940
That seems obvious.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.857
And then they go on about it for
five minutes, like oh, OK yeah.

01:16:45.857 --> 01:16:48.440
I see what they're asking, but
I think there's an easy answer.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.320
And then they go on about
it for 10 more minutes,

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.403
and you realize you don't
even know where the hell

01:16:52.403 --> 01:16:53.710
you are anymore.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:56.331
And I mean, I think that
that's a really good experience

01:16:56.331 --> 01:16:56.830
to have.

01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.480
I think it's good to
understand weight.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.021
These things that
we take for granted

01:17:00.021 --> 01:17:02.020
might be way more
complicated than we think.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.900
And there is also a
long and proud tradition

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.890
in science of doing science
and damn the torpedoes,

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:12.750
forget the philosophical or
mathematical foundations.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:15.370
I'm not even saying that
shut up and calculate

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:17.110
was always the wrong approach.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:19.480
It's certainly not the case
that every single physicist

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.670
should be thinking about quantum
foundations all the time.

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:24.550
It's just that
moralistic thing of no,

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:26.500
you should shut
up and calculate,

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.340
a good physicist shuts
up and calculates.

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.450
That's some bullshit.

01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:34.090
These questions are
legitimate parts of science,

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.540
and the boundary between
science and philosophy

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:41.140
is and always has been
permeable, just as it

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.529
is between any two disciplines.

01:17:43.529 --> 01:17:45.070
ALEX: And yeah, it's
been a pleasure.

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.612
And thank you all
of you for coming.

01:17:46.612 --> 01:17:47.820
ADAM BECKER: Yeah, thank you.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:50.270
