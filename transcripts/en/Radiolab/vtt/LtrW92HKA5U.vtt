<v 1>You're listening to radiolab from New York public radio, public radio, W,</v>

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.450
Y, Y, c, n, n,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 0>If you want your animals Frisky, you'll start as early as possible.</v>

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Today's show is about animals and at six o'clock there would be crowds of people

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.000
flowing, pushing each other all over the way, jostling, laughing,

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.620
streaming towards the venue about people getting close to animals.

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.650
You have hundreds of lions and panthers, Cheetahs. You have the baboon.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.650
You had an Indian, right? [inaudible] about what happens when we bring animals

12
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.230
into power world. The slaughter is unimaginable.

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.820
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

14
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.750
<v 0>if there was more over the crowd,</v>

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.350
there is musical instruments rolling everybody up.

16
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.950
<v 1>That's Marina Belarus. Skyah.</v>

17
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.960
She's a historian and what she's describing is route 80 80 if you are lucky

18
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:14.080
enough to be alive then and get a seat at the Roman coliseum on a good day,

19
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.660
you could watch no joke. Hundreds. Yeah.

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.780
<v 0>The animals slaughtered right in front of your eyes, one after the other.</v>

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
All kinds of exotic creatures. The populous never knew what would take place.

22
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.320
That was part of the agitation. They wanted the suspense.

23
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.430
They wanted the tension.

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.470
<v 1>Great. So now that you have that picture in your mind, consider this one.</v>

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.983
<v 0>Bye.</v>

26
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.603
<v 3>Wow.</v>

27
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.030
<v 1>Here we are at the Bronx Zoo, the gorilla exhibit and what you've got her in.</v>

28
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.190
Well, no blood, no cheap thrills,

29
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.210
just kids with a baby on the bed like a piggyback ride.

30
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.690
Lots of kids smushing their faces to the glass,

31
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.410
trying to get the attention of the gorillas on the other side.

32
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.050
<v 0>Real is aren't really noticing. But then, and this is the big moment,</v>

33
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.510
one of the dumped gorillas turns around,

34
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:10.750
walks to its side of the glass and down

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.640
<v 3>[inaudible] his hand on the wall.</v>

36
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.750
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

37
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.580
<v 1>today on radio lab. We wonder how did we get here? I mean throughout history,</v>

38
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.970
even before Rome, I relationship to animals is pretty simple. Okay?

39
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.410
We brutalized them. That's how it worked. Then in the 19th century,

40
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.140
someone created the zoological garden,

41
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:43.000
which wasn't much better and now we've got the zoo and we still lord over the

42
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.840
animals, but now we want to be their friends. We want to help them.

43
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.810
How did that happen and how exactly do you help an animal?

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.870
And this is an honest question when it has to spend its entire life in a cage

45
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.520
today on radio lab, zoos are our topic. I'm Jad Abumrad well, you know,

46
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.720
I think I can take you to the very moment in modern zoo history when the balance

47
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.300
kind of shifted in. Who are you? Oh,

48
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.760
I'm Robert Krulwich and I love the zoo, but don't wait.

49
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.090
You don't know about the zoo? Kind of me icky.

50
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.080
Why? I just, I, I want the animals to not be there.

51
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:23.830
And then gave you somebody what's prettier, safer, safer, prettier.

52
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.870
I'd rather watch them on TV frankly, and let them let them,

53
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.520
<v 4>well, the guy, this is interesting.</v>

54
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:33.050
The guy who made the big move in modern zoo history. No. Hello. That's him.

55
00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:37.160
Hello. His name is David Hancocks. We got him into a studio and he sort of,

56
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.150
he sorted a little bit like you. He was very ambivalent about zoos.

57
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.390
I'd actually for a while toyed with the idea of do I want to go and work in zoos

58
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:51.701
and try to change them or do I want to stay outside zoos and work to close them

59
00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:55.670
down and I came to conclusion that there's no way you're going to close who's

60
00:03:55.671 --> 00:04:00.671
down that the fascination of wanting to be close to wild animals cuts across

61
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.470
every strata of society. This is my case, by the way.

62
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.160
I love being close to them. Anyway, David Hancock's decided if,

63
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.780
if you can't beat them, you join them. Man.

64
00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:15.470
It was in the mid 1970s and David was working actually as an architect.

65
00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:17.570
He was between jobs when he got a call.

66
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:22.480
A friend recommended him for a job at the woodland park zoo in Seattle. Yes,

67
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.840
yes. And he gets hired.

68
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900
I was in an unusually fortunate situation in that just after I was hired and got

69
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:33.800
there, the zoo director left and so there was nobody to run the place.

70
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.300
Well except for David.

71
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.360
So he decided to take a look at the entire philosophy of the zoo and change

72
00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:43.370
everything. Starting with the gorillas.

73
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.593
<v 5>They leave</v>

74
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.580
<v 4>awful cages. The,</v>

75
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.870
the gorillas were living in a small concrete building.

76
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.370
It was a spare empty concrete box with a glass window. The gorillas,

77
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:01.720
of course, were bored and slowly going out of their mind.

78
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.610
Occasionally you'd find a gorilla who'd take his feces and smear it on the wall.

79
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.970
Yes, I'm going. I had nothing else to interact with.

80
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.950
The only natural components in his life that he ever came into contact with

81
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.460
would have been the food that he ate and the feces that he produced.

82
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.110
<v 1>Cages were the problem. The solution. He decided, well,</v>

83
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.600
he wanted to rip up the cages, yanked them out completely,

84
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:29.340
and replaced them with, with something, a natural setting of some sort.

85
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.110
But when he looked around for a model,

86
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.880
no zoo in the world had gorillas in what you'd call a natural setting.

87
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:40.070
And he wasn't even sure what is natural for, say, a gorilla. There

88
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.730
<v 4>was very, very little known about gorillas and their wild behavior.</v>

89
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.580
In fact, all the books said that gorillas don't claim,

90
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.320
this was early in the 70s remember? So David invited a person who didn't know.

91
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.730
I heard about Diane Fossey. Diane's fast,

92
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.930
his work was beginning to be carried in national geographic or Diane Fossey and

93
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.260
yeah, from the, from that Sigourney weaver movie, she played the [inaudible],

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.910
she was played by Sigourney weaver. Diane Fossey was an actual person.

95
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.510
She lived with a group of gorillas, wrote down everything.

96
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.040
She saw all their social interactions and all and was, um,

97
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.100
the guerrilla expert at that time.

98
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.130
And I heard that she was coming to the u s and she agreed to come to Seattle and

99
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.940
spend a couple of days with us.

100
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.080
We were trying to get images from her of the sort of environment we could

101
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:27.890
create.

102
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.130
And the breakthrough came after the couple of days she'd spent with that.

103
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.890
So I was driving her back to the airport and I said,

104
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.920
is there anything you seen around here or anywhere in this part of the world

105
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.500
that in any way resembles the sort of places where you've seen gorillas in the

106
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:49.370
wild? And she just pointed to this verge on the freeway. Um,

107
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.350
I don't know what a verge is. What's a verge avert? Oh, sorry. You were the,

108
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.600
the landscape on the side of the freeway, they're sloping at what,

109
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.420
what would you call it? I would call it if they were President Kennedy,

110
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:03.110
I would call it a a not a, what do they call it and no, yes and no,

111
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:05.150
but I wouldn't call it that because only president Kennedy gets out,

112
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.630
I would call it the, the green stuff on the side of the road. Okay. Yep.

113
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.400
It was a banked area that had once been cleared and then this verdant growth

114
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:17.360
that you get in Seattle was springing back and she said that right there,

115
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:19.280
that's where I would expect to see,

116
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.430
to be observing gorillas in the wild till I dropped her at the airport,

117
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.210
came back and on the way back illegally parked on the side of the freeway and

118
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:30.680
took photographs and then said, here, this is what day and fast. He said,

119
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.650
so as you can tell, we have absolutely no idea what they were doing,

120
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:40.550
but they also didn't have a boss and within a few months with help from a

121
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:44.060
landscape architect, I am grant Jones from Seattle, Washington.

122
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.820
He drew up a plan and elk came the balloons

123
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.443
<v 6>exactly,</v>

124
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.770
and we were creating huge mountains and hills about 10 or 15 feet high.

125
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.600
Some rocky cliffs along one side creek off trees,

126
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.640
shrubs about three or four feet high,

127
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.840
big herbs and vegetables and angles of vines, undergrowth,

128
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.520
lots of Laurel Bushes, Hawthorne Trees,

129
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.340
they comfrey leaves that we planted have long berries and pointed drip tips,

130
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:16.330
tropical likeliest growing pioneer plants. Just let it grow wild.

131
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.490
<v 4>Now nobody was watching,</v>

132
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.290
nobody was watching us and that that was the critical factor I think. Yes,

133
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:28.670
because if a traditional zoo director had seen or heard what we were doing,

134
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.900
they would, he would have stopped it and why?

135
00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:34.070
Why would a traditional zookeeper have have stopped all because they were

136
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:35.420
worried about what would like,

137
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:39.320
suppose you had been a gorilla and you'd spend your whole life living in a cage

138
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.350
in a concrete cage and now I'm going to take you little jam my baby gorilla and

139
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:50.051
stick him into a completely new place with sky and jagged things.

140
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.020
I mean, I would be worried that you'd hurt yourself.

141
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.130
I in the zoo world generally, I think

142
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.580
<v 6>people were very nervous about it. That's violet Sunday.</v>

143
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.860
She was the gorilla keeper at the Seattle's. Yes.

144
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:06.861
I was their primary keeper at that time and the zoo was advised by a lot of zoo

145
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:13.170
experts that it wouldn't work. I had two directors tell me it was stupid,

146
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.020
irresponsible, and it was unnecessarily, yeah. You know,

147
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.920
the gorillas would follow the trees and hurt themselves as climbed.

148
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.460
They would fall and break their necks on break their bones or they didn't get to

149
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.500
putting their health at risk and diseases.

150
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.640
They would get sick because it wasn't a sterile environment where you could,

151
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.300
you know, disinfect concrete to get psychologically.

152
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.320
Do you range from all this space? Yes.

153
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.590
Sometimes I'd go to David Hancock's then say,

154
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.590
what are we going to do about these people? He'd say, ignore them.

155
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.360
A bold statement,

156
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:50.220
but as the clock tick down to the day that these five animals would walk from

157
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:53.970
their iron cage through a door into this field.

158
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.110
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

159
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.860
<v 6>It was a real open question at the time. Well, what will happen? I think,</v>

160
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.820
I think we were all somewhat nervous. We were nervous. Oh sure.

161
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:08.190
How will they react? What will they do? The truth is nobody knew

162
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.550
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.550
<v 8>and so after five years getting ready after 16,000 square feet of guerrilla</v>

164
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.280
display area, we're prepared. Finally,

165
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.150
it was time on this sunny July, I think most, I remember it was a July morning.

166
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:29.580
I remember the exact year. I think it's seventies actually. I just looked it up.

167
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.720
Uh, July 31st, 1979, um, we let them out.

168
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.770
Kiki was the first two to come to that doorway and look out Kiki was it the

169
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.910
dominant gorilla of this group? There was six gorillas. He was the star.

170
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:46.800
I think he was my favorite. I have to confess,

171
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.690
he was so smart and he was big. He was six feet tall,

172
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.560
460 pounds. Kiki came into view first.

173
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:59.160
And of course she's never seen anything remotely like this before.

174
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.090
So here he is, this huge creature standing at the doorway,

175
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.440
just looking at this unknown.

176
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.240
<v 6>You stood in the doorway for many minutes</v>

177
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.300
and finally Kiki's starts to slowly step forward

178
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.763
<v 7>first step.</v>

179
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.870
<v 6>And he went as far as a creek and sat down,</v>

180
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.363
<v 7>do any looked up.</v>

181
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.920
<v 6>We noticed he looked up for a long time and we looked up also,</v>

182
00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:35.230
clouds were blowing by med,

183
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:39.700
fairly low altitude swallows flying over here. They were crows in the trees.

184
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.830
There was a wind blowing, the trees were rustling, the grass was moving.

185
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.320
You could see the hair on his face moving

186
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:48.970
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

187
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.870
<v 6>[inaudible] for a long time and took all this in.</v>

188
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.690
And then he looked down into the end of the water in a little eddy there any,

189
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.810
you could see that he was looking at his face in the water,

190
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.640
which she'd never seen.

191
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.260
And then he just starts looking all around and then all of a sudden he sees us

192
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.590
grant violet and David and a few others were standing behind some glass at an

193
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.820
observation point.

194
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.870
They were about a hundred yards away from the doorway.

195
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.170
And he came right up to the glass where we were at.

196
00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:27.171
They knew that Kiki had been a pretty angry to reel before and then he did

197
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:32.250
something that, um, we in a million years, hoped he never would,

198
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.910
which was to reach down into the sands,

199
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.900
screwed his arm down deep into the sand and he pulls out this big chunk of

200
00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:42.990
broken concrete about six, eight inches wide.

201
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.150
And then he held it up over his head. We thought, oh, this is it.

202
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.950
He's going to break the windows.

203
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.220
We'd spent weeks raking and telling the contractor to remove all debris and

204
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.160
begging them to check and recheck to look for such things as this piece of

205
00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:02.990
concrete. And there it was.

206
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.840
So Kiki held it over his head and sorta waved it around a little bit and looked

207
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.910
with an angry look. Yeah, this, he just held it there.

208
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.470
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

209
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.710
<v 6>then he just dropped it. He almost threw it down.</v>

210
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:27.150
He just sort of dropped it down. We all breathe a sigh of relief.

211
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.883
And um,

212
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.960
then he laid down on his back and his mate Nina came over and sat beside him and

213
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:34.591
the little baby,

214
00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:39.591
a little baby came over and laid on his chest and they just proceeded to,

215
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.170
uh, enjoy themselves. Like, like we weren't there.

216
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.390
It was magic.

217
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.810
<v 4>It was just, it was magic.</v>

218
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:51.870
They looked like different animals, totally different animals.

219
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:55.020
I felt like we were seeing a gorilla in the wild. Needless to say,

220
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:59.700
we all cried after he came over. I didn't cry. No. Um, but,

221
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.250
uh, I had a lump in my throat. I felt like finally, this is right.

222
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.440
This is really what's right for them.

223
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.170
I remember there was this strange feeling after it.

224
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.830
It's almost like we'd been to a wedding where there was this mixture of

225
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:17.760
happiness and sadness and I think more than anything else,

226
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.900
that was just a great sense

227
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.410
<v 6>relief. We thought, well,</v>

228
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:24.010
when will he produce this angry behavior and pound on the glass? And you know,

229
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:28.000
he never ever did it. The Old Kiki never returned,

230
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.680
never filled his body again. He was never angry anymore.

231
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.000
<v 4>Well, I think what he's saying is that the Kiki had really changed the change in</v>

232
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:40.070
cages, truly changed the animal here.

233
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.400
This is an interesting science question to, to, to ask about that.

234
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.360
It's like if you do that,

235
00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:47.660
if you take an animal and put them into a radically different environment,

236
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.040
how exactly does that change the animal who

237
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.640
<v 1>ms clearly makes them feel better and can you measure that? I think,</v>

238
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.150
I think the closest we've come to an answer to that question is a little bit of

239
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:03.590
gold is actually done a test with primates where she's put them in different

240
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:05.570
types of enriched environments. That's Jonah Lehrer.

241
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.200
He's a science writer and regular radio lab contributor and what he's talking

242
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:12.800
about is a Princeton experiment. A group of scientists led by Elizabeth Gould,

243
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:17.801
took three groups of monkeys and put them into three different kinds of cages,

244
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.010
sort of like a classes and then the social classes that she divided them into a

245
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.100
middle, lower, a middle and an upper. Then we can go through each one.

246
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.200
Let's start at the top. One group of primates,

247
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:31.250
group a was in the Beverly hills of cages. Describe it.

248
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.820
Lots of different monkeys running around. They had lots of social interaction.

249
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.560
They had to forge for all their food, lots of toys. What kind of toys? You know,

250
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.880
squeezy toys or, or like balls. I really had, it doesn't matter.

251
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.880
So they had lots of choices to make. Lots of things to be engaged with.

252
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:50.720
Lots of conversations to have lots of stuff to occupy their mind.

253
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.080
And what about Group B? The middle-class Group B had, you know,

254
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:57.470
we'll call it like the uh, like the standard suburban setup.

255
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.580
Not too fancy that drove a Chevy. What? What are we really talking about here?

256
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.640
They just had a bit less of everything that a few less toys,

257
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:08.010
a few less monkeys in this granted enclosure. So we can say that,

258
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.590
that they had less. Yeah,

259
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:14.591
they had less than the third group was kind of these standard experiments on

260
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:19.040
closure, you know, wire cage. So they had a lot less. Yeah.

261
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.520
All right, so you've got these three classes of monkeys, upper, middle,

262
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:25.430
lower Gould, and her team put a bunch of monkeys in each class,

263
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.840
let them do their thing for a while,

264
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.150
and then they took a few of individuals from each of these groups and looked at

265
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:32.800
their brains. So,

266
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.960
so they looked at the amount of proteins you have in your synapses.

267
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.290
They looked at the density of your dendritic Arbors, which, which,

268
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:44.060
which is you just say dendritic arbors. Yeah, that's right. That's a great name.

269
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.490
They, they, they look botanical. Especially when they're happy.

270
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.110
There's little like each brain,

271
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.900
so branches out in all kinds of different directions when it's happy.

272
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:54.860
So you get kind of a bushy kind of a feel. Yeah, exactly. What does that mean?

273
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:57.650
If I'm an animal that good? Yeah, they think it is. I mean,

274
00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:00.140
you can't exactly ask them monkey or gorilla, are you happy?

275
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:04.400
You could do no k in that cage, but you can look at their brain cells and ask,

276
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.600
are they branching,

277
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:09.860
are they growing and making new connections and getting full and bushy.

278
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.720
That's what these scientists wanted to know.

279
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:15.560
Which of the class of monkeys had the bushy is brain cells because those monkeys

280
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.540
would be the ones that are most engaged with their world most alive.

281
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.760
Okay, Jonah. So jumping forward, Elizabeth Gould looks into the brains of,

282
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.850
of individuals from each of the three classes. And what did she find?

283
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.750
She found that there's a big difference between the impoverished in the middle

284
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:37.370
class. Big Difference between the pot, between the bottom and the middle. Yeah.

285
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:41.240
The bottom, the middle is a big difference. How big it's, it's very significant.

286
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:46.330
It was generally between 20% and 40% 40% bushy or brain.

287
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.790
Yeah. Wow.

288
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.130
So what about the difference between the upper and the middle?

289
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.840
What was the difference there? There was almost no difference. What?

290
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.590
No difference at all. That's the weird thing between the lower and the middle.

291
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.380
Huge difference. Huge. But between the middle and the upper,

292
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.970
they really couldn't find much.

293
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.960
<v 5>Mm.</v>

294
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.530
<v 10>Why will I buy?</v>

295
00:18:09.531 --> 00:18:13.360
I think the lesson is at a certain point it tipping point is reached and your

296
00:18:13.361 --> 00:18:17.110
brain says, okay, we're in a complex world here. We have enough toys,

297
00:18:17.111 --> 00:18:19.420
we have enough social interactions. We've hit the tipping point,

298
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.400
let's go full throttle. It invest in new neurons and a nice complex brain.

299
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.230
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

300
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.881
<v 1>right. Let me ask you a question.</v>

301
00:18:27.881 --> 00:18:31.960
What if you're a zoo animal and you're living in a crappy wire cage and then

302
00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:33.640
they move you to a nicer one?

303
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.420
What would happen to your brain then as she has she looked into that? Yeah.

304
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.770
And uh, she's found that within four weeks, four weeks, about a month,

305
00:18:41.771 --> 00:18:43.030
the brain itself has changed.

306
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.800
<v 10>It begins to flourish again.</v>

307
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.610
And how long did it take you say four weeks lead moments? Just four weeks.

308
00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:50.650
Imagine mentally like after a year? Yeah,

309
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.210
after just four weeks they saw significant changes in the basic architecture of

310
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:56.044
their brain.

311
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.550
<v 1>So Robert,</v>

312
00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:03.551
just imagine Kiki now gorilla who's brain has been stunted by eight years of

313
00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:07.250
living in this little concrete box.

314
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:11.050
Suddenly Kiki is thrust outside where the weather changes.

315
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.880
Birds Fly with the rain falls from the sky where trees sway when he climbs.

316
00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:17.540
Suddenly Kiki has challenges.

317
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.630
<v 11>Choices, right? And to think that after eight years of he stuck,</v>

318
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.450
his brain could explode with new activity

319
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.650
<v 1>in just four weeks. I mean, but that makes sense. You know, nature and nature,</v>

320
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.230
it's respond quickly. They're not going in.

321
00:19:32.231 --> 00:19:35.330
Most animals don't have four years to sit around and develop a complex brain.

322
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.000
Our neurons have to act fast.

323
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.520
The message from this research is clear from the perspective of the brain.

324
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.900
You can easily create a cage which allows the brain to flourish. You see,

325
00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:49.330
I told, I told you that if you make the zoo better,

326
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:52.770
you can make the beasts better. This is built in. Zoos are not horrible, please.

327
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.660
No, no, no. I know. Yeah, they are. I think before we get ahead of ourselves,

328
00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:58.620
okay. Let me just, let me just throw one more time. Keep that in mind. Yeah.

329
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.270
Let me just throw one more category into our little class hierarchy here.

330
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.260
<v 11>Okay. The category of creatures who live in the wild,</v>

331
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.240
no cages, so in a sense, this is like your lab. Yeah.

332
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.210
He's paid a visit to a guy named Fernando, not Bob.

333
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.870
I'm a biologist at Rockefeller University in New York, and that's where we are.

334
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.430
We're in the woods outside his lab,

335
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.200
which stretched for thousands of acres and he calls these woods is real loud.

336
00:20:24.201 --> 00:20:27.590
It goes up to a chicken. That right there. Which one?

337
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.890
They're a little teeny guys, Huh? And in the trees

338
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.173
<v 1>are his subjects.</v>

339
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.990
<v 11>What these birds do is in the fall they start hiding seeds or nuts throughout</v>

340
00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:42.140
the forest and they have to remember where they put them.

341
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.580
Winter will come on at some point, everything will be under a blanket of snow.

342
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.030
So if you remember where you hit the seeds, you'll be the survivor.

343
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.600
Because I mean, and the case of chickadees, whichever is small,

344
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.150
for them to be alive the next morning,

345
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.880
they'll have to go to sleep with a full belly.

346
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.480
Is that because their metabolism is so fast? The right, right.

347
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:08.380
I mean they're small birds. They lose heat like mad. It's a cold night.

348
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.290
It's long. It lasts 10 hours. I mean,

349
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:14.140
you got to sleep on an empty stomach the next morning you're dead.

350
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.350
Knowing this not bombed, didn't experiment.

351
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.580
He caught a bunch of wild chickadees divided them into two groups. First group,

352
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:26.260
he put in a cage, pretty big cage and by five by three or something like that.

353
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.970
Second group set free so they could roam the woods as they pleased over this

354
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.960
home range of about 30 acres. He did place bird fears throughout the woods,

355
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.320
so they'd come back and visit. Wintertime rolls around.

356
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.880
The wild chickadees are out there snatching seeds from the bird feeder and

357
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.910
hiding them everywhere like crocs or Barack or crackle stone or how many hiding

358
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:50.390
places are we talking about here? Probably talking about thousands.

359
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.810
It's a phenomenal memory task.

360
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.410
The cage chickadees meanwhile didn't have to remember anything cause they could

361
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.230
eat as many seeds as they wanted from a little trough in the cage,

362
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.750
not bombed at a brain comparison.

363
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.540
And what he found was in certain brain regions,

364
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:09.490
the wild chickadees had twice as many new neurons.

365
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.690
Birds as the case ones were recruiting twice as many new neurons as the old one,

366
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.670
twice, twice as many. You know,

367
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:19.330
that process of replacement was moving at a much brisker pace.

368
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.660
His theory is that these new neurons are always showing up every day,

369
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:24.490
like day laborers. The only question is,

370
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.690
is there a job for them in the wild group? Absolutely.

371
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:31.990
We need your help to remember where we put all those seeds in the cage group.

372
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.760
There's nothing for those neurons to do, but here's the sad part.

373
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.260
They still show up every single day.

374
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.660
This appeared over a few days over which I'm here and either gets a job or

375
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:48.570
doesn't, doesn't get a job, and he does. So just awesome. So yeah,

376
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.950
you don't get a job. You're gone. You don't have to kill yourself.

377
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.890
You're just not going to get what it takes to stay alive,

378
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.310
which makes it all the more poignant to me. I mean, in the captives,

379
00:22:57.311 --> 00:22:59.650
you've got all these new cells, they're ready to do some work.

380
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.740
You might give them your job precisely that. I'd love to do it,

381
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:05.590
but it's a shrinking economy guy. So what can I do?

382
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.740
<v 12>Mm mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,</v>

383
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.930
mm [inaudible].

384
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.770
<v 1>Thanks to Fernando, not bum.</v>

who is the author of the upcoming book. Proust was a neuroscientist

389
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.810
<v 8>and coming up.</v>

390
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:37.811
What does a ferocious meat eating 500 pound funeral cat eat for dinner at the

391
00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:41.340
zoo. What? Uh, it's such a discipline. Yeah. Oh No,

392
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.470
I don't wanna I don't wanna tell Ya.

I'm Jad you're Robert and will continue with our program on zoos zoo.

395
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.950
What an unusual [inaudible]. Don't you wonder like where it comes from?

396
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.830
We have to get, it used to be zoo one second.

397
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.610
It used to be called the zoological gardens and then it got this like short

398
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:02.880
name. Yeah. What is it? A song? Let me introduce you. This is it.

399
00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:05.860
I believe Ms Lou in the 1878 song called walking,

400
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.300
walking in the Xer.

401
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.040
<v 13>Well, keep him walking in.</v>

402
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.920
<v 1>People heard the song. They couldn't think of a place in any other way.</v>

411
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:54.090
Today our topic is zoos. We're doing a little sort of chronological thing,

412
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.800
tracing the line from past to present,

413
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:59.820
starting back at those old nasty concrete enclosures,

414
00:24:59.821 --> 00:25:01.580
which I'm sure you love to visit as a little

415
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.463
<v 14>boy.</v>

416
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.030
<v 1>What do you mean? Well, you know you're a city boy, you, you,</v>

417
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:08.670
you don't have much animals here. Nothing to do with New York.

418
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.370
What did like Tennessee [inaudible] fine,

419
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.460
but when you talk about, you know,

420
00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:18.450
enriching the lives of gorillas as we did before the break.

421
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.890
It's a simple heartwarming story cause gorillas, a r s building,

422
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.060
they had their vegetarians rankling it gets a lot more complicated when you

423
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.110
switch to a Predator and who likes to pounce and chase and bite. Yes.

424
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:34.860
If you're going to put those animals in a cage and their whole being is

425
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.370
organized around killing things, well what do you feed them?

426
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.090
[inaudible] guys that question to a NPR science reporter. Now Boys,

427
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.110
<v 14>if we're talking like the big carnivores,</v>

428
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.220
like the Tigers that would normally be out in the wild ripping other animals to

429
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.250
shred. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What do they eat? They're eating mostly this, uh,

430
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.760
this is a little bag of um, uh, kibble. It's,

431
00:25:56.761 --> 00:26:01.670
it's basically like a dog food near and check it out because this is for a

432
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.070
meeting animal. [inaudible] oh, again, try one. Alright.

433
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.050
Skinny. Oh,

434
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.740
that's like getting chocked

435
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.060
<v 1>here. This is what the predators eat according to now. Really?</v>

436
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.820
Why don't they just give them meat? That's sort of what she wanted to know.

437
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.130
Testing the mini days before heading to the zoo.

438
00:26:23.131 --> 00:26:25.950
Testing the many days before heading to the zoo. No,

439
00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:28.320
recently took a trip to the Toledo zoo.

440
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.250
Oh, hi. I'm here to see Ann.

441
00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:36.710
She wanted to know what it might look like if a zoo actually gave the predators

442
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:40.310
what they want in this regard. The Toledo zoo is pretty radical.

443
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.220
Once a year they have this event they call the big, the big

444
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.590
<v 14>fee. Did the big Phoenix the opening. Thank you. No,</v>

445
00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:50.100
got there a day early just to check things out. Okay.

446
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.470
So I ducked behind the Rhino House, go behind the scenes here,

447
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.480
like go in the back door.

448
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.440
And where I finally end up is this kind of non-descriptive hello, this kitchen.

449
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.280
This is the kitchen. We have a freezer and refrigerator down here.

450
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.880
Don't think about a kitchen being at the zoo, but there's a kitchen here. Yes,

451
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.570
yes there. So I'm sorry, your name again? Was Beverly scooting over screen over?

452
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.680
Yes, Beverly is going over. And this kitchen is actually the reason I came.

453
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.680
<v 3>This is our freezer. It usually runs about 10 below</v>

454
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.410
the rats. And we actually have rats in about four sizes.

455
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:30.411
We have large jumbo monsters and then we have packs of 50 Mies packs of 25 mice.

456
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.920
And then these are the fuzzies.

457
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.770
You can probably about 10 days old.

458
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:43.320
The fuzzies and the pinkies are pretty much newborn.

459
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.680
<v 14>Here's the basic idea.</v>

460
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.160
You want to get closer to what the animals actually eat in the wild.

461
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.690
So you want to give them some sort of whole animal pull as in like all the first

462
00:27:52.691 --> 00:27:56.470
eyeballs whiskers. So, um, what are things different today?

463
00:27:56.471 --> 00:27:59.560
Because the big fetus tomorrow hooves. Um, yeah,

464
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.510
the Tigers are getting some calves and that's not something that we give out

465
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.040
like all the time. Cabs. Can we look at it? So they take me into the [inaudible]

466
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.420
<v 3>freezer and</v>

467
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:12.750
<v 14>in the corner just so the one,</v>

468
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:17.751
the floor is this box and it's got a black garbage bag kind of thing in it,

469
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:21.720
which we open up, you know, and like looking right up at me. It happens to be,

470
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:24.630
the head part is the baby cab, but that's just the head.

471
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.480
It was like a little baby, little eyelashes,

472
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.800
little ears. It's a baby cow, you know. And I thought,

473
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:38.580
oh baby cow. And then I thought, oh my God,

474
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.730
tomorrow little children are going to be watching this baby cow be ripped apart

475
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:47.410
by a giant wild cat. They're wild animals. You know, they,

476
00:28:47.411 --> 00:28:51.060
they live in a captive situation, but they still have those wild instincts.

477
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.780
That's Beth stark. She's the one who brought carcass feeding to the Toledo zoo.

478
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.850
The time we hear, oh, carnivores are meat eaters,

479
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:59.550
but really they're not just meat eaters, they're flesh eaters.

480
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:03.780
They eat other animals. And one of the challenges there is is how do we,

481
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.160
how do we provide for the welfare of the animals while at the same time

482
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.060
providing for the needs of our visitors.

483
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.080
So it's about 10 o'clock in the morning and the gates are open now.

484
00:29:17.081 --> 00:29:20.680
So visitors are starting to stream in about 15 minutes or so.

485
00:29:20.681 --> 00:29:22.150
They're going to start the tiger feed.

486
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.430
The tiger feeding was the first feeding of the day.

487
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.780
A big crowd was beginning to gather. Right now the tigers aren't in the pen.

488
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.430
How many people are like maybe 150 people? A lot of little kids.

489
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.490
She wrote the board down and pumps since my wife told me about it.

490
00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:39.250
So we made sure we got her early to check this out.

491
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.600
The carcasses were already out.

492
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.280
The zookeeper comes out with her microphone and tweaks sort of gives a little

493
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.760
enrichment program description of carcass feeding

494
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.280
the animals behavioral needs as well as their psychological needs.

495
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.940
And nobody at this point is listening to the interpretive discussion of this

496
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.900
because as she's doing this, I think I heard a door,

497
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.780
they let the Tigers into the panel. Oh look,

498
00:30:05.781 --> 00:30:09.530
here come the tiger's lodge brand. Look, the big one's coming down.

499
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.570
One of the tires just weeks across the pen and grabs the car.

500
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.130
It's like, you know,

501
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:23.140
it starts like immediately playing with it and I have never seen in all my years

502
00:30:23.391 --> 00:30:26.540
of blue going, I have never seen a tiger move that fast.

503
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.180
Like at 1.1 of the Tigers was like carrying anyone around by the ear.

504
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.270
You could see like the little cafes and it was dragging it around.

505
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.630
What were people doing? Were they cheering? Were they crying?

506
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.560
There was nobody there that seemed to be disturbed by it really.

507
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.710
Although here was a conversation that I heard many,

508
00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:49.790
many times the children would say, what is that?

509
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:54.290
What is he eating? And the parent would say, I clip a baby cow eats a baby cow.

510
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.310
And the kid would say, why is he doing that,

511
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.780
honey? The tigers have to eat. Well that's what he eats the food.

512
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.990
And the child said, well I don't eat cow penny.

513
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.550
Yeah you do. And the parent would say,

514
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.260
of course you eat cow at home hamburgers and hamburger.

515
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.900
Do you think a hamburger is made out of cows

516
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.150
and there would just be this shocked look on the kid and I must've heard that

517
00:31:23.151 --> 00:31:27.320
conversation like five times. Ooh, honey.

518
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.580
Now it's food. Like a birds in the beasts kind of moment. Yeah, it really was.

519
00:31:34.581 --> 00:31:38.330
People are just fascinated by it. They appreciate being so close to it.

520
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.220
They'll say, Oh god, that's really gross.

521
00:31:43.221 --> 00:31:45.800
But then moving closer for a better view.

522
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.350
What Beth stark was telling me is that,

523
00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:52.300
you know the whole time that they've been doing this carcass feeding program and

524
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.830
they would interview people afterwards and ask them questions.

525
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.380
We did survey people. How did you feel? What did you think?

526
00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:59.450
And found that more than, and what she found,

527
00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:04.430
98% of them is that the public is pretty much uniformly very positive in what

528
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.110
they saw. Enthusiastic.

529
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.340
One of the questions we've put on the survey is do you want to see more of this

530
00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:12.080
in which animals would you like to see?

531
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.380
And so what did people say just about everybody.

532
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.820
From what I can remember circled every animal we put every just about every

533
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.330
animal, every animal, you know, like, you know, do you wanna see dead rabbits?

534
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:25.700
Do you want to see dead rats? Do you wanna see dead calves?

535
00:32:25.701 --> 00:32:26.930
Do you want to see dead deers?

536
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.010
And do you want them to see them fed to polar bears, tigers, wolves, you know,

537
00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:34.400
like a Chinese menu, you know, like pick your prey animal, pick your predator.

538
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:36.950
Do you want to see that? And they're like, yes, yes. We want to see this.

539
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:42.370
The only complaints where people want rabbits fed at Easter and around Easter,

540
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.663
you know,

541
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.110
parents complaining or worrying that their kid was thinking that the Easter

542
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:50.770
bunny was being eaten. It just shows you how,

543
00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:55.771
like what the animals eat at the zoo is fraught with sort of human emotions and

544
00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.850
ideas about right and wrong. Here's another example. Okay?

545
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.530
So when I was at the tiger pen,

546
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.960
there was this woman who came up and was very interested.

547
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.980
She didn't seem turned off by the idea that they were eating a dead calf, right?

548
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.820
But then she got this very strange look on her face and she said,

549
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.630
I hope that was dead. And I said, well, does it does it manner?

550
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.110
I mean because at some point it died, you know,

551
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.890
does it matter whether it died at the hands of a human or the hands of a tiger?

552
00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.080
And it was late in the afternoon and I'm ready to go.

553
00:33:26.081 --> 00:33:28.600
So I turn off my tape recorder and just at that second,

554
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.680
even though she's just expressed sort of relief that the calf was dead when it

555
00:33:32.681 --> 00:33:33.730
was putting the Tigers pen,

556
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:38.830
she starts to tell this story that was so diametrically opposed to what she had

557
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.880
just expressed that I just had to turn my tape recorder back on and say like,

558
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.510
wait a minute. Wait, can you start at the whole beginning?

559
00:33:45.511 --> 00:33:47.010
So what was happening, what happened?

560
00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.610
A squirrel health through the layers on the snow lepers cage,

561
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.940
she and her daughter had been hanging out by the snow leopards pin.

562
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.020
There's this sort of net kind of above the pen and there was this squirrel that

563
00:34:01.021 --> 00:34:03.790
had been walking on the net and it fell down.

564
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.710
[inaudible] is here like dumb into the snow leopards pinch.

565
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.040
And her daughter described the story to me where the snow leopard who'd just

566
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:14.100
been like kind of hanging out, kind of bored, immediately began to stop.

567
00:34:14.101 --> 00:34:18.570
The squirrel snow was pouncing and the squirrel like started trying to get away.

568
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.870
Her mother said it was like the standout. Oh yes.

569
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.880
The snow leopard was matching all of the moves of the score on c file at a move

570
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.430
from, and like the audience was transfixed. Daughter like could not walk.

571
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.510
She hid when she thought the squirrel was coming down. Yeah. Yeah. She took off.

572
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.490
Her daughter couldn't watch, was hiding her face.

573
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:39.060
And in the end the squirrel escaped. The Squirrel got away. He was smarter.

574
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.240
And I said to the girl, well how did you feel?

575
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.040
Were you rooting for the Leopard or the Squirrel? Which one? And she said,

576
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.040
I was reading for the snow leopard. Huh? And I said,

577
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.260
but you didn't want to see it eat the squirrel and you,

578
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.890
you didn't want to see that. And she said, well,

579
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.850
I still want to for the snow leopard because I didn't want to see it,

580
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:07.970
but I still wouldn't want it to see it because it is cool nature.

581
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.280
Yeah, the wild.

582
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.210
I think that,

583
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:20.010
that the reason they felt comfortable watching that and telling me about it was

584
00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:24.300
because it seemed like an episode that was not between the animals and the

585
00:35:24.301 --> 00:35:29.010
human. It was between the animals. What about you? If you were that little girl,

586
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.160
how would you watch that little scene?

587
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.090
You wash it kind of gleefully or more sheepishly.

588
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.980
You just watch, just happening in front

589
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.190
<v 1>of you. I mean, that has nothing to do with you.</v>

590
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.220
It's funny. Yeah. You know, she, um,

591
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.250
she never mentioned the possibility of feeding live animals to a predator.

592
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.940
By the way, Nell Boyce is a science reporter for NPR. Thank you. Now,

593
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.650
not those frozen rat sickle things, but, but something that scary, Ethan,

594
00:35:58.651 --> 00:35:59.790
you can buy your people's life.

595
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.810
Feeding is a line which Americans use will not cross.

596
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.890
The only places that do feed out live animals as far as we could find are in

597
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:11.130
China. Lucky for us. Yeah, I live in Beijing.

598
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.570
That's where reporter Jocelyn Ford lifts just over an hour's bus ride outside of

599
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:19.320
Beijing. We asked Jocelyn to go visit one of these live feeding parks.

600
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:21.070
That's what they called the live feeding park.

601
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:25.590
You just get on a bus and they drive you right into the lion's den and they'll

602
00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:29.160
even sell you chicken. But the chickens are about $4 each.

603
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.240
And the tour people sell them right there on the bus or ride in the bus?

604
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.860
<v 16>No, by the time you, when I talk to you</v>

605
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.340
[inaudible] so they drive.

606
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.990
If the lion's den and one of the people in the best one with the tourists

607
00:36:43.991 --> 00:36:48.130
decided to buy a chicken, I'm gonna feed the lion.

608
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.590
<v 0>Everyone's do that side of the class.</v>

609
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.010
<v 1>The Guy who bought the chicken, he would pick it up,</v>

610
00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.223
<v 0>rested again.</v>

611
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.610
[inaudible]

612
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.520
<v 16>here come the lions.</v>

613
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.590
And soon we had four or five lions [inaudible] sitting right under our window

614
00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.630
looking at us, circling US

615
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.170
[inaudible] window. It looks very intense. I tell you,

616
00:37:27.171 --> 00:37:30.440
they had the most intense look I have ever seen anywhere.

617
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.810
I mean they have these very cold amber eyes.

618
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.280
Hungry eyes will always looks like it's ready to pounce

619
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.133
<v 0>and</v>

620
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.830
<v 1>the guy with the chicken just opened the window.</v>

621
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.190
<v 0>I'm going to drop the chicken out</v>

622
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.240
second. That lion grabbed the chicken and just took his mouth.

623
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:04.780
<v 16>It helps me smell. Then I noticed that it's legs were still quivering.</v>

624
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.420
Now it's working away at it sort of rippling it to bits

625
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.780
that would say pilot feathers.

626
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.940
Do they hide it to tell you what's your house, your [inaudible]?

627
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.120
I asked your grandmother who was on the bus,

628
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.350
she was with something like a five year old and I asked her if she thought this

629
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:31.420
was a healthy thing to have this hurt her,

630
00:38:31.421 --> 00:38:34.920
her grandson watching this cruel event.

631
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.320
[inaudible] said, hey, it'll make him a braver guy

632
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.340
if you don't eat them first, they're gonna use.

633
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.890
And she was just very matter of fact about it. Oh my Mama said that

634
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.690
one woman said, we should teach our kids to love animals,

635
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.720
but at the same time, if you know the big random, it's the smaller animal.

636
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:03.340
That's the way the world works.

637
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:05.890
So you should understand this survival of the fittest.

638
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.770
Just your dog went though in socially.

639
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.330
And you should also understand where you fit into it.

640
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.920
If you're weak and you can't, you know, run fast, escape or whatever,

641
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.150
you'll become somebody. And that's the lesson of life

642
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.280
I think. I think in the United States that we've,

643
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:28.360
we're often so far removed from the ugly part of the food we eat.

644
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.840
We just get squeamish when we see it. Whereas, especially the, the,

645
00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:35.360
the rural people in China, you know, they,

646
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.370
they deal with life and death of animals around them all the time.

647
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.870
And I think we're just closing our eyes to it. Having said that, I, I mean,

648
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:48.400
personally I feel that it does make for more humane society when you do feel

649
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.910
sorry or compassionate about the animals around you.

650
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.990
And there was no concern at the safari park here.

651
00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.450
Nothing of that sort. It was all about fun and games.

652
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.190
Okay. So at the end of the bus ride,

653
00:40:05.191 --> 00:40:08.190
they drop you off at the little little circus like place,

654
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:13.800
and they had a little fake shooting gallery with all sorts of creepy music.

655
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.130
<v 2>[inaudible] remember?</v>

656
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.260
<v 16>And I went, I went and looked under this dirty old tent, thrown up over some,</v>

657
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.310
some metal rods,

658
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.600
and there were rows of cages and tigers pacing back and forth and yellow.

659
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.920
Have you ever heard of a tiger? Ya'll

660
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.470
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

661
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.760
the cage. Just the length of his body. He turned it around, but that's about it.

662
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.680
Oh,

663
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.010
<v 16>thanks to reporter Justin Ford.</v>

671

<v 8>This is Radiolab.</v>

672
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.630
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and our topic today on radio lab.

673
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:12.150
Is Zoos the saddest places on the planet there?

674
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.090
What do I have to do? No, they're not this HEDIS place. So you know, I'm right.

675
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.340
The point, Huh? Look,

676
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.480
despite everything we've said up to now about the true wildness of a zoo animal,

677
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:24.620
the fact remains,

678
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.110
looking into the eyes of a live animal can be an extraordinarily transformative

679
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.000
experience. And don't ask me [inaudible] ask Alan Rabinowitz. Okay.

680
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.060
I'm Alan Rabinowitz. He's going to be our last stop on the show.

681
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:43.090
I'm the head of a program that seeks to explore the earth's last great wild

682
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:46.580
areas and try to protect them, right?

683
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.500
Alan Rabinowitz is right noun animal conservation is he set up wildlife

684
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:54.590
preserves all over the world. And Jed, like you,

685
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.600
he's not particularly thrilled by zoos, although without a zoo.

686
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:01.400
And I'm thinking of the Bronx Zoo in particular,

687
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:05.360
he wouldn't be who he is today because when Alan was very young and Archie very

688
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:07.970
young, he had a terrible stutter.

689
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:13.010
<v 17>Oh, I couldn't talk, but my body would spasm you.</v>

690
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:16.390
So if you wanted to say coming, mom, is he Cummings?

691
00:43:16.391 --> 00:43:20.210
A hard contact coming is the tongue against the upper palate.

692
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.580
So you couldn't get the word out.

693
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:27.610
I didn't speak a fluent sentence to another human being until I went to this.

694
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:32.570
Finally, this clinic when I was a senior in college, a senior in college. Yeah.

695
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.850
I never went on a date. I never kissed a girl other than my mom.

696
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.830
How do you connect to anybody and connect to anybody? I had no friends.

697
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:44.570
None. That's how I had none.

698
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.250
I had little animals that I would take into the closet with me and I would talk

699
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.084
to them fluently

700
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.200
<v 8>and that's how it was for Alan from much of his childhood.</v>

701
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:58.580
The only time he says he could free his tongue to talk was in the dark with his

702
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.500
pets, green turtles,

703
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.780
hamsters and troubles and chameleons, which would all die.

704
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.140
I would talk the way we're talking. Will you?

705
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:14.380
I could talk fluently to the animals and his father one time overheard him

706
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.430
talking to the dark, but we'll maybe we should take this boy to the zoo,

707
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.030
<v 17>to the Bronx zoo, to the Bronx Zoo.</v>

708
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.400
He used to bring me to the old great cat house. Horrendous.

709
00:44:26.401 --> 00:44:31.401
You remember that gray cat is classic old concrete floors,

710
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.600
but you'd go in, I mean, talk about unexperienced. You'd walk in and here

711
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.380
<v 7>Ralph Rari. I mean it sounded incredible. Raw power</v>

712
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.530
and he loved being,

713
00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.940
he just loved all those noises of like 20 cats all together,

714
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.250
vocalizing at the same time.

715
00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.960
Maybe it was the sound, which appealed to me as a kid that couldn't speak.

716
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.440
And once again in front of the zoo, Katz was with, he was alone. You can talk.

717
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.660
Yes, father. It's funny cause he knew,

718
00:45:08.661 --> 00:45:11.060
I talked to the animals so he would stand back.

719
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.140
He knew if he came to clothes I'd stopped because I would stutter because he was

720
00:45:17.691 --> 00:45:21.620
there. But if he wasn't, you could talk more fluently. I could talk fluently.

721
00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.310
And there was one, one old Jaguar

722
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.840
and I remember as a kid I would stand there and I would watch that.

723
00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:33.380
I'd watch this magnificent, huge, strong beast.

724
00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.730
This massive, strong animal had blank eyes.

725
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.380
It just looked [inaudible]

726
00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.190
<v 17>blank. And it was pacing back and forth and back and forth.</v>

727
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.870
I felt the Sanamal was like me cause I felt strong. I felt good.

728
00:45:47.871 --> 00:45:49.340
I felt powerful inside,

729
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.390
but yet I was trapped inside this cage of my buddy

730
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.010
<v 7>and that's when Allen remembers turning to that cat as a kind of fellow exile</v>

731
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.010
<v 17>and whispering a promise that I would try to find a place for us.</v>

732
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.800
I remember that. I remember saying once,

733
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.300
I'll find a place for us. No, I didn't mean that particular.

734
00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.290
I don't know what I mean.

735
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:16.270
I can't really look back and know exactly what I meant, but I,

736
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.670
I felt no matter what I would find a place for us.

737
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.193
<v 2>Okay.</v>

738
00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.120
<v 7>And that program, I would find a place for us.</v>

739
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.260
He kept that promise in his head for for two decades he went on to visit a

740
00:46:32.261 --> 00:46:33.100
speech therapist.

741
00:46:33.101 --> 00:46:36.520
He learned how to use his mouth and tongue to get past his stutter,

742
00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:37.354
not completely,

743
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.360
but enough to finish college and then to go to graduate school and Study

744
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.040
Wildlife Ecology and it was at his graduation party from graduate school.

745
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.510
We got the offer that would change his life at my going away party.

746
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.960
My major professor asked me if I wanted to go to beliefs and do and study

747
00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:56.920
jaguars. Not just studied them,

748
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.390
count in an objective survey of how many Jaguars are really in the country.

749
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.860
Alan asked, how do you count Jaguars and that's when the professors said, well,

750
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.480
you got to catch them. Catch a Jaguar. How do I know? I have no idea.

751
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:12.310
It's like saying, go catch a dragon.

752
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:17.220
Everybody knew the Jaguars are still the almost ghostlike cats in a forest.

753
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.630
Nobody had ever captured Jaguars in the range fires.

754
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.910
That was exactly what the professor was proposing.

755
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.760
Go to a little country in Central America.

756
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.400
Please go deep into its jungle collar,

757
00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:29.950
as many jaguars as you can so that we can track them

758
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.343
<v 8>and learn about them.</v>

759
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.760
Weeks passed and picture Alan on the edge of the jungle in beliefs.

760
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.030
We had absolutely no idea what to do next. We opened the map of beliefs.

761
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.030
It had one dirt road down the entire country.

762
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.440
Allan figures the only way he's going to catch a Jag.

763
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.110
What do I do this just to talk to people who hunt. Jaguars. Oh, they're there.

764
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.590
They're a, he calls the Mayans and they live in the forest

765
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.830
<v 17>and I went to the, to the hunters and they told me,</v>

766
00:47:58.831 --> 00:48:02.910
run them with dogs and one hunter still had Jaguar dogs.

767
00:48:02.911 --> 00:48:05.730
And I'll tell you of everything I've ever done in my life,

768
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.900
I still ranked that as the absolute hardest because when these dogs get on a

769
00:48:09.901 --> 00:48:12.330
Jaguar scent, it's a blood [inaudible].

770
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.830
<v 7>You're running full speed through the jungle.</v>

771
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:21.030
The Mayans are in front of us running and chopping at the same time.

772
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:24.030
And I knew in my mind that they would poison the snakes,

773
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.150
but you can't think about it because you don't have time to look where you're

774
00:48:27.151 --> 00:48:28.070
running or get beat.

775
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:33.410
And one time dashing behind dogs and machete waving hunters, disaster struck.

776
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:38.070
It would just about actually treated you or when one of the crew got bit by a

777
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.413
poisonous snake

778
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:45.070
<v 17>and he died. So everybody quit. Nobody had worked for me.</v>

779
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.720
They all thought I was jinxed.

780
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.070
So then I had to figure out how to capture Jaguars by myself.

781
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.851
Nobody works with me.

782
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:56.560
Finally one Mayan Indian came to work for me and we ended up building traps and

783
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.830
I would put live pigs because they didn't want dead meat.

784
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.380
They would want live meat, which they could kill themselves.

785
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:05.440
So I put live pigs in the back of these traps.

786
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.640
I'd have to go feed the pigs every single day. The first trap I built,

787
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.290
I built it out of two by fours.

788
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.180
I caught a Jaguar and the Jaguar chewed its way through the two by four door and

789
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.190
busted its way out of the two by fours,

790
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.110
I mean they are powerful animals and then I built ion rebar.

791
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.150
Even then I made a mistake.

792
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.510
One Jaguar got so mad it bit the iron rebar and pulled at the iron rebar and

793
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:33.460
snapped its canines.

794
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.360
It snapped its own canines trying to bust the iron rebar.

795
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.230
I mean its roots were hanging out and I put it down.

796
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.180
I tried to do preventive dentistry,

797
00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:49.181
I had to cut the roots and it was lying there dying and I just felt so bad.

798
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.280
I carried the Jaguar back to my cabin.

799
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.590
I lay next to it and it died on the floor next to me. I just lost it.

800
00:49:58.591 --> 00:49:59.424
I lost it.

801
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.970
<v 8>But one good thing came out of this experience.</v>

802
00:50:02.971 --> 00:50:07.350
He learned to build a better trap. And so cat by cat, my cat,

803
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.420
Allen was able, and he was the first to do this.

804
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.320
He was able to count the Jaguars in that forest and there were thousands of

805
00:50:13.321 --> 00:50:15.990
them, but he had the sense, and again this was,

806
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:20.190
he was first that they were in real danger because around them people were

807
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:24.990
cutting down their forest. Then if the forest wind, the Jaguars go too.

808
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.980
So that's when he, uh,

809
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.430
<v 17>the campaign, she eventually let him do the prime minister.</v>

810
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.590
I was given a chance and not only did the,

811
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.530
did the prime minister agree to meet me, but he,

812
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:41.360
he invited me to address him in the whole cabinet, but only 15 minutes.

813
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.841
Now remember,

814
00:50:41.841 --> 00:50:45.770
this is a guy who for two whole decades could barely speak his stutter,

815
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:47.030
which is now less of a problem,

816
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:51.560
was still there and now he's being asked to address a prime minister and a

817
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:56.390
capita in a high pressure. Make it or break it 15 minutes or bust situation.

818
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:00.410
I knew I couldn't stutter. I mean I only had 15 minutes. I said, look,

819
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.190
you will lose nothing by this. If you don't protect it,

820
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.080
guaranteed it's going to be gone because the citrus people want it for both

821
00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:13.940
timber and citrus. Make it a forest reserve and make it tentative.

822
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.550
Make it a five year agreement. If I can't prove to you, I can bring in far,

823
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:23.480
bring in outside money in five years, what do you have to lose? And if it works,

824
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:28.820
you've got a Jaguar preserve. You have the world's first Jaguar preserve.

825
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.840
Now his pitch was supposed to last 15 minutes. That's the time he was allotted,

826
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.920
but he went way over.

827
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:38.600
I ended up staying in there an hour and a half and the vote was a tie in the

828
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:39.080
cabinet.

829
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:43.010
The prime minister himself broke the tie in Alan's favorite and by the end he

830
00:51:43.011 --> 00:51:46.640
agreed to the prime minister voted in my favor. That made it.

831
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:51.980
It got great press as the world's first Jaguar preserve. To this day,

832
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:55.010
it's the world's only area designated specifically as a Jaguar

833
00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.780
<v 8>prison. And by the way,</v>

834
00:51:56.781 --> 00:52:00.470
the whole time with the prime minister and all that whole time,

835
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.090
he never started

836
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.153
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

837
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.170
<v 8>So Alan decided his work was more or less done.</v>

838
00:52:08.171 --> 00:52:12.610
He could go home now to New York and just before he left he decided to go for

839
00:52:12.611 --> 00:52:17.260
one last walk in the jungle. The last visit he wasn't looking for Jaguars,

840
00:52:17.261 --> 00:52:20.350
he wasn't expecting to see one, this was his goodbye.

841
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.980
But when he was looking down at the ground as you walked along,

842
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.080
suddenly he thought, well hello,

843
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:30.460
because they're on the ground right in front of him was a fresh print of a

844
00:52:30.461 --> 00:52:31.980
Jaguar and pink,

845
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.690
<v 17>bigger than any I had seen in that area.</v>

846
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.110
And that just got my blood blood going.

847
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.910
So I started following it. You almost never,

848
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:47.080
never see a Jaguar when you follow its tracks because it knows you're there.

849
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.950
I mean, I was hoping against hope. I'd maybe I'd see the Jaguar,

850
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:52.270
but actually I didn't think I would,

851
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.450
cause they always knew I was coming and they'd always go away.

852
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.410
And then it started getting dye started getting late and I didn't want to be in

853
00:52:59.411 --> 00:53:02.020
the jungle at night and I'd have a flashlight or anything.

854
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:07.710
So that's when I turned around and there was the Jaguar about 15 feet away

855
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:13.450
behind you. It was behind me, been behind me, probably quite a ways.

856
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.780
So it knew that you were tracking it and it decided to find out who you were and

857
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.630
it circled around and it probably cut off into the forest.

858
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.670
Watch me as I passed,

859
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.280
then got back on the trail and just stayed back a good ways.

860
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:33.430
<v 8>And it was pretty clear this cat had been creeping closer and closer.</v>

861
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:37.350
<v 17>It's where by the time I turned around and shortened the distance between us,</v>

862
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:40.620
really small. I mean that was, so, it was in, in leaping distance,

863
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.030
I couldn't have gotten away from it. Yeah. And I knew that.

864
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.510
So I did what I thought was the right thing,

865
00:53:48.511 --> 00:53:51.120
which is make myself small,

866
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.360
make myself subdominant just crouched down.

867
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.740
And then the Jaguar did something, which I didn't expect it to do.

868
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.260
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

869
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.810
<v 17>sat down. That was strange to me.</v>

870
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:05.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

871
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.430
<v 17>And then I got scared and I stood up.</v>

872
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:13.270
Then I stepped back because I felt the distance was too close now that that it

873
00:54:13.491 --> 00:54:18.290
didn't like and all this time, I mean I'm totally aware, I have no place to go

874
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.750
<v 8>and with no place to go, nowhere to run.</v>

875
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.560
Alan just stood there frozen in place and the Jaguar Rosen hit to just stood

876
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:28.190
absolutely silent.

877
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.290
<v 17>Then it just turned, started walking off into the jungle</v>

878
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:39.930
and before it disappeared into the rush,

879
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.180
it turned back to look at me

880
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.510
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

881
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:49.510
<v 17>Then I really looked at any in the eyes and they were wild eyes.</v>

882
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:52.870
There was fire in the Jaguar's eyes.

883
00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:58.380
The last thing I remember very clearly is looking into into its eyes and

884
00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:04.450
thinking of seeing that Jaguar in the Bronx Zoo as a child,

885
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.440
but seeing the wildness in this animal's eyes.

886
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.980
It didn't look anything like that cat and the cage.

887
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:17.340
It showed strength and freedom and we had just protected this incredible area,

888
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.960
which now would be its home.

889
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:25.860
And I remember telling the cat at one point that I'd find a place for us.

894

895
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.670
the book is called Jaguar.

896
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:59.630
One man struggled to establish the world's first Jaguar preserve.
