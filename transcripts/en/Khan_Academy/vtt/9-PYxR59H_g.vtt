00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] Which
expression is equivalent

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.450
to the following quotient for all a

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.500
is greater than zero, b greater than zero,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.437
and c greater than zero?

00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:09.840
Now one of the reasons why they had

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.120
to restrict a, b, and c is
because if they actually equaled

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.260
zero, you would be dividing by zero there,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.620
which would be an issue.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.970
And actually, this whole expression,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.060
if a or b were zero, this whole thing

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.390
would be zero, then once again,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.570
you'd be dividing by zero,
which would be an issue.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.700
So, by constraining it,
they're avoiding that problem.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.630
But let's see if we can simplify it.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.100
So we got all of this and we just have

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.090
to remember, dividing by a fraction

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.920
is equivalent to multiplying
by its reciprocal.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.880
Reciprocal, so this is
going to be the same thing

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.380
as this top, actually
let me color-code it,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.730
as this top expression.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.210
So, 3a to the third, b to the fifth,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.250
over c to the third, times so let

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.340
me actually stay in that color.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.260
So that thing times the reciprocal

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.620
of this business right over here.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.620
So times the reciprocal, so
25, c to the fourth power

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.370
over 15ab squared.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.440
And so, what's this going to be?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.890
Well, let's see, in the numerator,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.890
in the numerator, you're going
to have three times 25 is 75.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.603
And then a to the third, b to the fifth,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.350
c to the fourth, c to the fourth.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.570
And then in the denominator,
so you're gonna have 15

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.570
times a, times b squared,
times c to the third power.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.950
Now we can try to simplify.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.590
So what's 75 divided by 15?

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.900
Or if you divide 75 by
15, you're gonna get five.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.180
And if you divide, if you
divide 15 by 15, you get one.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.360
So the coefficient on this
thing's just gonna be five.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.390
So immediately if I was
under time pressure,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.070
I would just stop there and say hey look,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.680
the only one of these
choices that has only

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950
a five out front is this
choice right over here,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.700
so I'm feeling pretty good about it.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.900
But I could continue to simplify.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.330
a to the third divided, if I divide

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.180
a to the third by a, a to the third and a,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.920
I could divide these both by
a, this becomes a squared,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.780
this becomes one.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.500
b to the fifth divided by b squared,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.910
well that's gonna be b to the third power.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.500
So, this is going to be
b to the third power.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.050
This is going to be one.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.883
c to the fourth divided by c to the third,

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:36.040
this is going to be c.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.530
c to the third divided by c to the third

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.260
is just going to be equal to one.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.660
So you've got five a
squared b to the third,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.370
c which is exactly what you have here.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.110
If what I did right at the end here

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.290
looks a little bit
unfamiliar, I encourage you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
to review exponent
properties on Khan Academy,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.300
that should help out, but
I'll do a little primer here.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.220
If I just, let me just do it simplified.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.787
If I had 75a squared over 15a,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.720
yeah I hope, I guess you
get the 75 over 15 part,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.520
that's going to be equal to five.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.320
So let me, I could
rewrite this as 75 over 15

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.070
times a squared over a.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.310
This is five, and one way to view this

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.160
is, this is a squared over a to the first,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.770
our exponent properties tell us that this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.560
is going to be the same thing

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.770
as a to the two minus one power,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.090
which is equal to a to the first power.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.330
And this is the same thing as saying,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.770
well let's just divide both the numerator

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.840
and the denominator by
a, and you're just going

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.020
to be left with a.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.810
So this part over here,
this would just be 5a.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.010
This is obviously a
simplified version just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.860
to feel good about the
exponent properties.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.230
Similarly, b to the fifth
divided by b squared,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.840
that's gonna be b to the
five minus two power,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.720
which is b to the third.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.860
c to the fourth minus c to the third,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.040
well that's gonna be c to
the four minus three power,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.920
which is c to the first power,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.563
which is this choice right here.
