00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.359
black holes really are kind of getting

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369
black holes really are kind of getting
 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.879
black holes really are kind of getting
to the very heart of our physics and I

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889
to the very heart of our physics and I
 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.140
to the very heart of our physics and I
believe that they're kind of showing us

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150
believe that they're kind of showing us
 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.029
believe that they're kind of showing us
the way that we're eventually we're

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039
the way that we're eventually we're
 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.349
the way that we're eventually we're
gonna need different physics and new

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359
gonna need different physics and new
 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.570
gonna need different physics and new
physics people ask questions like what

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580
physics people ask questions like what
 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.820
physics people ask questions like what
happens inside a black hole or even what

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830
happens inside a black hole or even what
 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.140
happens inside a black hole or even what
happens at the very boundaries of a

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150
happens at the very boundaries of a
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.120
happens at the very boundaries of a
black hole the event horizon when light

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130
black hole the event horizon when light
 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.120
black hole the event horizon when light
is absorbed and honestly our physics is

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130
is absorbed and honestly our physics is
 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.250
is absorbed and honestly our physics is
telling us a lot of contradictory things

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260
telling us a lot of contradictory things
 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.970
telling us a lot of contradictory things
and our image of what an event horizon

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980
and our image of what an event horizon
 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.729
and our image of what an event horizon
really is maybe changing people like

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739
really is maybe changing people like
 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.229
really is maybe changing people like
like Stephen Hawking and Leonard

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239
like Stephen Hawking and Leonard
 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.000

Susskind have recently come up with this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010
Susskind have recently come up with this
 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.250
Susskind have recently come up with this
idea that a black hole should not be

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260
idea that a black hole should not be
 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.189
idea that a black hole should not be
able to destroy information okay what do

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199
able to destroy information okay what do
 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.039
able to destroy information okay what do
we mean by information information can

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049
we mean by information information can
 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.020
we mean by information information can
be almost anything you know all of the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030
be almost anything you know all of the
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.110
be almost anything you know all of the
different atoms in my body have angular

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120
different atoms in my body have angular
 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.020
different atoms in my body have angular
momentum they have charge they have mass

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
momentum they have charge they have mass
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.340
momentum they have charge they have mass
they they they they're that there's all

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350
they they they they're that there's all
 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.379
they they they they're that there's all
sorts of little bits of information that

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389
sorts of little bits of information that
 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.740
sorts of little bits of information that
make me me at the quantum mechanic level

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750
make me me at the quantum mechanic level
 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.170
make me me at the quantum mechanic level
you know did the tiniest of levels there

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180
you know did the tiniest of levels there
 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940
you know did the tiniest of levels there
are different amounts of energy there

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950
are different amounts of energy there
 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.440
are different amounts of energy there
are different probabilities that are

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
are different probabilities that are
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.060
are different probabilities that are
contained in the structure of my matter

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070
contained in the structure of my matter
 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.180
contained in the structure of my matter
and information in some ways is a form

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190
and information in some ways is a form
 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.610
and information in some ways is a form
of energy it's actually you know a way

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620
of energy it's actually you know a way
 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.040
of energy it's actually you know a way
that you can describe something which is

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050
that you can describe something which is
 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.980
that you can describe something which is
somehow in a strange way a higher energy

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990
somehow in a strange way a higher energy
 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.900
somehow in a strange way a higher energy
state than not being able to describe

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910
state than not being able to describe
 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.810
state than not being able to describe
something and so one of the questions is

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820
something and so one of the questions is
 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.060
something and so one of the questions is
if energy really can't be destroyed

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070
if energy really can't be destroyed
 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.220
if energy really can't be destroyed
energy itself is something that is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230
energy itself is something that is
 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.840
energy itself is something that is
intrinsic in the universe you can't

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850
intrinsic in the universe you can't
 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.810
intrinsic in the universe you can't
really create it or destroy it is it

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820
really create it or destroy it is it
 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.280
really create it or destroy it is it
possible that information is the same

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
possible that information is the same
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.980
possible that information is the same
way is there really no way to actually

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990
way is there really no way to actually
 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.530
way is there really no way to actually
destroy the information about what all

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
destroy the information about what all
 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.330
destroy the information about what all
of my subatomic particles are doing

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340
of my subatomic particles are doing
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.920
of my subatomic particles are doing
right now

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930
right now
 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.450
right now
so black hole is kind of steer you right

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460
so black hole is kind of steer you right
 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.800
so black hole is kind of steer you right
in the face well what a black hole

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
in the face well what a black hole
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.140
in the face well what a black hole
supposedly does it is it absorbs

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150
supposedly does it is it absorbs
 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.770
supposedly does it is it absorbs
everything space and time Bend into a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780
everything space and time Bend into a
 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.550
everything space and time Bend into a
black hole so that nothing can escape

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
black hole so that nothing can escape
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.050
black hole so that nothing can escape
that means that any information about

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
that means that any information about
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.140
that means that any information about
the material that fell in is gone the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150
the material that fell in is gone the
 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.910
the material that fell in is gone the
only thing we know about it is that as a

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920
only thing we know about it is that as a
 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.249
only thing we know about it is that as a
black hole absorbs material it gets more

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259
black hole absorbs material it gets more
 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.440
black hole absorbs material it gets more
massive it actually adds that mass to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450
massive it actually adds that mass to
 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.989
massive it actually adds that mass to
the mass of the black hole and as that

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999
the mass of the black hole and as that
 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.959
the mass of the black hole and as that
mass increases the event horizon becomes

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969
mass increases the event horizon becomes
 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.390
mass increases the event horizon becomes
larger basically the area where

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
larger basically the area where
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.610
larger basically the area where
space is so curved that you can't get

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
space is so curved that you can't get
 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.280
space is so curved that you can't get
out begins to extend the more mass of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
out begins to extend the more mass of
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770
out begins to extend the more mass of
the black hole is the most massive black

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
the black hole is the most massive black
 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.839
the black hole is the most massive black
holes we know of in the universe are

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849
holes we know of in the universe are
 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.089
holes we know of in the universe are
many billions of times the mass of our

many billions of times the mass of our
 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.699
many billions of times the mass of our
Sun and the physical extent of this

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709
Sun and the physical extent of this
 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.380
Sun and the physical extent of this
event horizon is about the size of our

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
event horizon is about the size of our
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.059
event horizon is about the size of our
solar system maybe like out to the

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069
solar system maybe like out to the
 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.349
solar system maybe like out to the
planet Pluto so is it possible then if

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359
planet Pluto so is it possible then if
 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.210
planet Pluto so is it possible then if
everything goes into a black hole and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220
everything goes into a black hole and
 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.179
everything goes into a black hole and
nothing ever comes out space and time go

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189
nothing ever comes out space and time go
 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.970
nothing ever comes out space and time go
inside the black hole and don't come out

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
inside the black hole and don't come out
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.410
inside the black hole and don't come out
what happened to that information and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420
what happened to that information and
 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.869
what happened to that information and
this has begun to make a lot of people

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879
this has begun to make a lot of people
 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.240
this has begun to make a lot of people
wonder if we really have thought of

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
wonder if we really have thought of
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.520
wonder if we really have thought of
black holes the wrong way maybe there

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
black holes the wrong way maybe there
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.280
black holes the wrong way maybe there
isn't an event horizon in the true sense

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290
isn't an event horizon in the true sense

isn't an event horizon in the true sense
I actually had a friend of mine the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
I actually had a friend of mine the
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.550
I actually had a friend of mine the
study's black holes say well I'm not

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
study's black holes say well I'm not
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.720
study's black holes say well I'm not
sure if they're black they may be very

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
sure if they're black they may be very
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.270
sure if they're black they may be very
very dark navy blue and and what he

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
very dark navy blue and and what he
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.309
very dark navy blue and and what he
meant by that is maybe there are some

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319
meant by that is maybe there are some
 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.080
meant by that is maybe there are some
tricks to actually get information out

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090
tricks to actually get information out
 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.089
tricks to actually get information out
of a black hole maybe there really is

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099
of a black hole maybe there really is
 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.729
of a black hole maybe there really is
some form of energy that can leak away

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739
some form of energy that can leak away
 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.949
some form of energy that can leak away
from the black hole over time now

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
from the black hole over time now
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199
from the black hole over time now

you can actually make mass into energy
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.119
you can actually make mass into energy
and you can make energy into mass around

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129
and you can make energy into mass around
 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.309
and you can make energy into mass around
a black hole where there's very hot gas

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319
a black hole where there's very hot gas
 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.860
a black hole where there's very hot gas
very high temperatures very strong

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870
very high temperatures very strong
 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.930
very high temperatures very strong
magnetic fields perhaps there's a lot of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
magnetic fields perhaps there's a lot of
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.240
magnetic fields perhaps there's a lot of
energy and that energy can actually

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
energy and that energy can actually
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.939
energy and that energy can actually
manifest itself as particles mass and

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949
manifest itself as particles mass and
 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.300
manifest itself as particles mass and
the energy always creates

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
the energy always creates
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.409
the energy always creates
particle/anti-particle pairs they're

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419
particle/anti-particle pairs they're
 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.439
particle/anti-particle pairs they're
called virtual particles and matter

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449
called virtual particles and matter
 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.149
called virtual particles and matter
antimatter the thing you know about it

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159
antimatter the thing you know about it
 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.129
antimatter the thing you know about it
is that it annihilates immediately so

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139
is that it annihilates immediately so
 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.839
is that it annihilates immediately so
these tiny little particles come into

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849
these tiny little particles come into
 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.640
these tiny little particles come into
existence that annihilates and you're

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
existence that annihilates and you're
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.469
existence that annihilates and you're
back to energy and this happens all

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:11.479
back to energy and this happens all
 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.969
back to energy and this happens all
around us all the time

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979
around us all the time
 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.520
around us all the time
so if this happens near a black hole

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
so if this happens near a black hole
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.080
so if this happens near a black hole
it's possible one of these little

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090
it's possible one of these little
 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.819
it's possible one of these little
particles can go into the black hole and

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829
particles can go into the black hole and
 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.370
particles can go into the black hole and
the other one escapes and all of a

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380
the other one escapes and all of a
 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.439
the other one escapes and all of a
sudden is a particle that shouldn't be

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449
sudden is a particle that shouldn't be
 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.930
sudden is a particle that shouldn't be
there the universe basically has a new

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940
there the universe basically has a new
 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.350
there the universe basically has a new
particle energy from nowhere and how can

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
particle energy from nowhere and how can
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.379
particle energy from nowhere and how can
that work and the the information theory

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389
that work and the the information theory
 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.279
that work and the the information theory
people say the

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289
people say the
 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.869
people say the
what happens is that energy has to come

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879
what happens is that energy has to come
 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.670
what happens is that energy has to come
out of the black hole the black hole's

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680
out of the black hole the black hole's
 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.339
out of the black hole the black hole's
mass begins to decrease if there is this

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349
mass begins to decrease if there is this
 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.320

away and maybe there's something about

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409
away and maybe there's something about
 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.829

those virtual particles that contain
 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.019
those virtual particles that contain
some information about the black hole

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029
some information about the black hole
 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.659
some information about the black hole
and what fell into it it even gets

people think that time goes slower and

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.499
people think that time goes slower and
 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.739
people think that time goes slower and
slower as you approach a black hole till

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749
slower as you approach a black hole till
 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.600

right at that boundary there's almost

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300
right at that boundary there's almost
 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.420
right at that boundary there's almost
kind of a sphere a two-dimensional

black hole and this reminded people of
 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.059

there seem to be three-dimensional

people began to wonder maybe that's the
 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.179
people began to wonder maybe that's the
way the universe works on a larger scale

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.189
way the universe works on a larger scale
 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.719
way the universe works on a larger scale
maybe black holes are showing us

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729
maybe black holes are showing us
 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.070
maybe black holes are showing us
intrinsically what the underlying nature

intrinsically what the underlying nature
 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.939
intrinsically what the underlying nature
of reality is that there really is a

kind of gain from this
is that black holes are staring us right

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419
next Einstein a next quantum theory
 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.059
next Einstein a next quantum theory
something that actually describes how

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:20.069
something that actually describes how
 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.219
something that actually describes how
gravity works in very intense situations

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229
gravity works in very intense situations
 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:24.260
gravity works in very intense situations
like a black hole now we're actually

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270
like a black hole now we're actually
 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.749
like a black hole now we're actually
observing black holes well enough that

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759
observing black holes well enough that
 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.999
observing black holes well enough that
we really have to get on this we really

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:29.009
we really have to get on this we really
 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:30.860
we really have to get on this we really
have to figure out how the universe

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870
have to figure out how the universe
 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.050
have to figure out how the universe
works around one of these things and we

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060
works around one of these things and we
 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.059
works around one of these things and we
may end up learning what the universe

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:35.069
may end up learning what the universe
 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:35.869
may end up learning what the universe
itself

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879
itself
 

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.760
itself
really is

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770
 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.629
[Music]
