00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.320
We will use again a visual metaphor to describe what a process is.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.390
Continuing with a toy shop as an example,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.660
you can think of a process as an order of toys.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.309
An order of toys has its state of execution, it requires some parts, and

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.678
a temporary holding area, and even may require some special hardware.

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:25.010
For instance, it's state of execution, may include the completed toys, the toys

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.310
that are waiting to be built, that are part of that order, and other things.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.720
Building the toys may require various parts, like plastic pieces, wooden pieces,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.170
and these come in different containers, or

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.940
we may require some other temporary holding area for the pieces.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.650
And, finally, to actually build a toy, we may need some special hardware.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.610
We may need sewing machines, glue guns, or other types of tools.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.450
So, how does all of this then compare to a process in an operating system?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.900
Well, a process also has a state of execution described with

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.400
the program counter, the stack pointer.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.879
All this information is used by the operating system to decide how

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.160
to schedule the process, how to swap between multiple processes, and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.080
for other management tasks.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.110
In order to execute, the process needs some data.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.280
There's some state in registers.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160
And, it also has some temporary holding area.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.860
For instance, it occupies state in memory.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.495
Finally, executing a process may require some special hardware like

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:28.060
I/O devices like discs, or network devices.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.760
The operating system has to manage these devices and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.480
control which of the processes that are perhaps executing concurrently at

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.070
the same time gets access to which hardware components.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.560
This is similar to what would happen in a toy shop where the toy shop

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.870
manager has to control how the special hardware, like the sewing machine or

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.360
the glue gun, are used.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.798
Which particular order of toys will get to be assigned the usage of

00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:57.010
these more designated hardware components.
