00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.011
- So honestly, the change
from mechanical engineering,

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.317
the broader world view to materials,

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:10.550
like this smaller, literally,
atomic world view--

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.000
- The project that I'm working
with my AP physics class,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.430
currently is guided by
a need to know question

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.263
for the students of,

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:18.380
"How can we successfully put a lander

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.957
on the surface of Mars?"

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.980
During the final task, task five,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.430
where students did there
drop and qualification tests,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.520
we had a number of engineers
from Blue Origin and Boeing

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.420
present and communicating
with the students,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.248
asking a number of great questions.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.591
- Okay, what do the
other designs look like?

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:43.387
- This and this.

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:44.220
- Interesting.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.053
Yeah, how did this one hold up?

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.190
- There's motivation for the students

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.750
when the project they have

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.390
connects to an actual real world problem

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.640
and that they see or hear

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450
actual people that have a
job that uses those skills.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.350
I try to make sure that
they've got that connection.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.183
That they see,

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:00.016
here's a person.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.000
We're gonna hear from them.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.520
They're applying the concepts
that you're learning right now

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.870
to tackle these real world problems.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.710
- I basically knew I wanted
to be in the aerospace field

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.063
since I was around your
age in high school.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.050
It was basically when I learned that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.490
you can get a job building spaceships.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.670
And I was like, "That's it,
that's what I wanna do."

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.430
- Give the students a chance to really see

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.850
if the language they were using

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.710
and the concepts that they
were trying to explain

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.850
actually made sense to somebody

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.770
besides me or a peer in the classroom.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.160
- Equation, impulse
equals force times time.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.993
- Right.

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:29.630
- So if we change, either force or time,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.720
the other one's gonna react
if impulse is constant.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.553
- That's very insightful.

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:34.386
That's good.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:35.690
- It helped that they
were using some of the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.720
same vocabulary we were.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.450
It was kind of a connection of,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.520
this is actually a thing that goes on.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.856
- Things can normalize your motion

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:44.862
that you may have underneath.

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:47.810
Underneath that chute can mellow out some

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.180
before impact.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.720
- If you manipulate time,
the force also changes.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.677
And so that's how we've
been changing the force.

00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:57.140
- [Johnny Voiceover] There is
a lot of great communication

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.265
going on,

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.240
both directions.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.336
- Hit and then crack all the eggs.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.100
- And then directly, okay cool.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.700
And it sounds like you've
done a little bit of testing

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.857
to see if that works.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:05.907
- Yeah, we've done a fair amount.

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:06.890
- [Johnny Voiceover] The
students are able to understand

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.760
what the engineers were
saying back to them

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.260
and the engineers also,
seemed to be quite impressed

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.510
by the ability of the students
to explain their choices

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.920
in the design of their landers

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.930
using appropriate physics language.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.945
- We were really just focused
on the maximum air resistance.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.086
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:22.919
- That we could get.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.100
- We often struggle with the fact

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.330
that we're trying to
teach students knowledge

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.980
for jobs that don't exist yet

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.790
and that's how quickly
things are changing,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.200
especially in the STEM field.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.770
- As a mechanic, I learned a lot too.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.100
So when I into engineering,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.590
I was able to view things
through a different lens.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.960
I knew how a machine worked.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.243
I knew how to program.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.897
- To have these engineers come in and say,

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:44.957
"This is what we do on a daily basis.

00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:47.127
"These are the skills I
wish I had developed more

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:48.010
"when I was your age."

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.400
has a really meaningful impact.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
Can we give a huge round of
applause to all of our experts

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.489
and guests for coming in today?

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.406
(students applaud)
