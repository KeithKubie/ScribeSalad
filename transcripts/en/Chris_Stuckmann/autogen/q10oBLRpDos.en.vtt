earlier sometimes they recreate what the
 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.930
earlier sometimes they recreate what the
original did visually with the tracking

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
original did visually with the tracking
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.060
original did visually with the tracking
shots there's like one shot of the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070
shots there's like one shot of the
 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.040
shots there's like one shot of the
granddaughter running on this desolated

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050
granddaughter running on this desolated
 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.250
granddaughter running on this desolated
Street but they're just recreating these

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
Street but they're just recreating these
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.110
Street but they're just recreating these
scenes yeah that was the best part about

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120
scenes yeah that was the best part about
 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.760
scenes yeah that was the best part about
this movie everything original that they

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770
this movie everything original that they
 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.190
this movie everything original that they
brought to it is underwhelming yeah and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
brought to it is underwhelming yeah and
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650
brought to it is underwhelming yeah and
that's not to say that I think they

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660
that's not to say that I think they
 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.000
that's not to say that I think they
should have just done the same thing

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
should have just done the same thing
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.650
should have just done the same thing
again that's actually I think what

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660
again that's actually I think what
 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.470
again that's actually I think what
you're saying is it's disappointing yeah

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
you're saying is it's disappointing yeah
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.690
you're saying is it's disappointing yeah
that the best parts of the movie were

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700
that the best parts of the movie were
 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.870
that the best parts of the movie were

how they they took things from the
original and sort of switched and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.660
original and sort of switched and
swapped things like the granddaughter

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670

creepy and and he had that mentality
that he wanted to see what Michael would

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210
that he wanted to see what Michael would
 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.270

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010
background and allowed it to happen but
 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.950
background and allowed it to happen but
actually interacting and killing people

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960
actually interacting and killing people
 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.380
actually interacting and killing people
that's that's not clever and even in the

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390
that's that's not clever and even in the
 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.460
that's that's not clever and even in the
beginning of the movie when the bus

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470
beginning of the movie when the bus
 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.290

convenient can people not like how did
 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.820
convenient can people not like how did
that happen but now that you know the

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830
that happen but now that you know the
 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.040
that happen but now that you know the
doctor probably provoked that situation

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
doctor probably provoked that situation
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.500

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.090
it makes sense but there are things that
it makes a little more sense like in the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100
it makes a little more sense like in the
 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.830
it makes a little more sense like in the

was thinking like this is this doesn't
 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.200
was thinking like this is this doesn't
make sense but you know if the doctor is

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210
