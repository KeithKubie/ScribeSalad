00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're here at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, England.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
St. Paul's is on the top of Ludgate Hill, which is the tallest hill in the city.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Over the years, this cathedral has been struck by lightning on countless occasions.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And in 1561, a lightning strike actually caused a large portion to burn down.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this unit, we'll learn not only why this cathedral is such a prime target

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
for lightning strikes but also how to prevent lightning strikes from causing such disastrous fires.
