00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
 . 

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.870
 In this presentation I want to solve a bunch of examples of analysis 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.590
 Multilevel class II, which is what 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.870
 Also called quadratic equation 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.650
 At some times you write a quadratic quadratic equation, or 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.850
 A quadratic equation only, or quadratic, but all mean 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.300
 Multilevel Class II 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.440
 Anything that contains a raised variable 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.080
 Of the second force 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 In this case, in all the examples that we will solve, x will be 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.740
 So let's assume that I have the square statement x ^ 2 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 + 10x + 9 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 I want to analyze it to the sum of two double-edged phrases 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.520
 how to do that? 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.440
 Well, let's think about what will happen if we want to 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 Take x + a, and hit it with x + b 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 If we want to hit these two things, what happens? 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 Well, we have some experience to do this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.170
 This will be x x x, equal to x ^ 2, + x x b 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.690
 Ie bx, + (a × x) + (a × b) -i + ab 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.800
 Or if we want to combine the two phrases in the middle 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.890
 Because both are operators for x 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.102
 We can write this as x ^ 2 + - I can type it 

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:29.700
 b + a or a + b - x + ab 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.390
 If in general, if we assume that this is the product of multiplication 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.765
 With these two bounds, we see that the lab is middle 

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.250
 For the x, or you can say the formula coefficient of the class 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.040
 This will be the sum of a and b 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.360
 And then the constant will be a beat 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.520
 a and b 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.290
 Note that this relates to this, and this 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.790
 Related to this 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.600
 Of course, this is equivalent to this 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.590
 Can we analogize this and that? 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 Is there a and b so that a + b = 10? 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.070
 And a × b = 9? 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.850
 Well, let's think about this a bit 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.470
 What are the 9 factors? 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770
 What can be the value of a and b? 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.170
 We assume that the whole numbers are correct 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350
 And naturally when we analyze the factors, especially when 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 We start analysis, we deal 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.580
 With correct numbers 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.080
 What are the 9 factors? 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.730
 It's 1, 3 and 9 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.000
 If it can be 3 and 3, it can be 1 and 9 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.630
 Now, if 3 and 3, therefore you have 3 + 3 - this 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.840
 Not equal to 10 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.760
 But if 1 and 9, the 1 × 9 = 9 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.670
 And 1 + 9 = 10 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.570
 This has worked 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.190
 If a = 1, and b = 9 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 We can analyze it to be (x + 1) 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.970
 × (x + 9) 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.850
 If you hit them, use that skill 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.970
 We have developed it in recent presentations, you will see this 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.880
 Really equals x ^ 2 + 10x + 9 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.150
 When you see something like that, when it is a coefficient 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.070
 The expression x ^ 2, or the subsequent parameter 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.650
 The quadratic formula is 1, you can say, well, what the two are 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.530
 Are the two numbers equal to this coefficient? 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.720
 What are the two numbers 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.870
 They are the same numbers, when you take the sum of their beat 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.660
 It should equal 9 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.510
 Of course, it should be typical 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.000
 Or if it is not in the typical form, you should place it 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.500
 So shape, so you can always say, OK, whatever 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.530
 The coefficient of the first-order phrase, a and b 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.300
 Their sum must be this 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.890
 No matter how hard I am, the sum of a × b must be 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.370
 Be that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.150
 Let's solve more examples 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.510
 I think the more we solve the more examples, the more 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.630
 We got the idea better 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.700
 Let's assume that we have x ^ 2 + 10x + - ok 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.100
 I've used 10x already, so let's use a different number - x ^ 2 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.366
 + 15x + 50 

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.470
 And we want to analyze it 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.339
 Well, we'll use the same idea 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.600
 We have x ^ 2 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.130
 We have a first class statement 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.960
 This should be a total of two numbers 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.620
 Then this phrase, no hard 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.870
 It should be a sum of two numbers 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.640
 So we need to think twice when we hit them 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.220
 We get 50, and when we collect them, we get 15 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.910
 This will be the kind of art that you are doing 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.530
 Develop it, but the more you practice, you'll see 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.730
 You will be able to get it automatically 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.330
 So what can be the values ​​of a and b? 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.975
 Let's think about the 50 factors 

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:52.230
 Can be 1 x 50 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.072
 2 x 25 

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:57.520
 Let's see, 50 can not be divided by 4 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.450
 It can be 5 x 10 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.580
 I think these are all 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.920
 Let 's try these numbers, and see any 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.310
 Of which a total of 15 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.630
 If 1 + 50 is not equal to 15 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.160
 2 + 25 Their sum is not equal to 15 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.260
 But 5 + 10 the total of 15 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.280
 So the two numbers are 5 + 10, and can be 5 x 10 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.760
 If we want to analyze it, it becomes x + 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.630
 5) (x + 10) 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.840
 We beat them 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.710
 I encourage you to hit them, and you see that 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.660
 Really equals x ^ 2 + 15x + 10 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.320
 In fact, let's do this, x x x = x ^ 2, and x 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.800
 × 10 = 10x 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.600
 5 x x = 5x 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.620
 5 x 10 = 50 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.220
 Note, that 5 × 10 = 50 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.890
 5x + 10x has given us 15x in the middle 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.560
 If we get x ^ 2 + 15x + 50 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.440
 Let's move forward, so we'll get some 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.040
 Negative signals are here 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.890
 Suppose we have x ^ 2 - 11x + 24 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.610
 Now, this follows the same rule 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.580
 I need to think about two numbers, when I have them together 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.570
 The result is -11 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.150
 That is, a + b must equal -11 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.900
 And a × b must be equal to 24 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.290
 Now, there is something here to think about 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.960
 When I hit both of these numbers, I'll get the 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.080
 Positive number 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.960
 Which is 24 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.260
 This means that both of them must be positive, or both 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.380
 They must be negative 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.050
 That's the only way I'll get a positive number here 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.290
 Now, when I have them together, I will get a negative number, if they are 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.720
 There is no way that I can collect two positive numbers 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.280
 And get a negative number, since their sum is 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.750
 The number is negative, since the result of their positive multiplication 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.420
 This tells me that both a and b are negative 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.200
 a and b must be negative 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.730
 Remember, neither can be negative or the other 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.710
 Positive, because the outcome of their beating will be negative 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.687
 Neither can be positive, because when we bring them together 

00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:24.520
 The result will be a positive number 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.500
 So let's think about what can be the value of a and b 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.990
 If there are two 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.260
 Let's think about the 24 factors 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.140
 We have to think about negative factors 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:44.670
 But let me see, it can be 1 x 24, 2 x 11, 3 x 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.070
 8, or 4 × 6 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.220
 Now, any of these numbers when I hit them - well 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.380
 Clearly when I hit 1 x 24, I'll get 24 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.910
 When I take 2 x 11 - sorry, this is 2 × 12-- 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.790
 I'll get 24 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.090
 We know that all this will be 24 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.470
 But any two of them, ie, two factors, when combined 

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.790
 Will I get 11? 

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.880
 Then we can say, let's take 

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.450
 Both are negative 

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.470
 If we look at these, we will see 3 and 8 

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.150
 3 × 8 = 24 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.810
 3 + 8 = 11 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.680
 But that did not work, did it? 

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.510
 Because we have -11 here 

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.690
 But what if they are 3 and 8? 

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:37.789
 -3 × -8 = positive 24 

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.580
 -3 + -8 = positive 11 

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.600
 He succeeded 3 and 8 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.840
 If we analyze this, x ^ 2 - 11x + 24 

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:02.940
 It is equal to (x - 3) (x - 8) 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.270
 Let's solve one another like this 

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.330
 In fact, let me put it a little 

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:19.810
 Let's assume that I have x ^ 2 + 5x-14 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.770
 If we have a different case here 

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.460
 The number of multiples is negative, is not it? a × b 

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.190
 = -14 

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.920
 The product is negative 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.930
 This tells us that one of them is positive, and one 

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.910
 negative 

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.200
 When combined, a + b = 5 

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.360
 So let's think about 14 factors 

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.300
 And what are their components, which when I gather them, if one 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.560
 Positive and one negative, or in fact I will 

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.780
 The difference between them, will I get 5? 

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.450
 If I take 1 and 14 - I'll try the numbers-- 

00:09:53.450 --> 00:10:01.820
 1 and 14, -1 + 14 = -13 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.260
 -1 + 14 = 13 

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.430
 Let me write down all the ingredients that can be taken 

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.440
 Your brain will divide it 

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.490
 If we get -1 + 14 = 13 

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.460
 And 1 + -14 = -13 

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.380
 If these two numbers do not work 

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.950
 This is not equal to 5 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.860
 Now what about for 2 and 7? 

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.600
 If you take 2 - let me write it in a different color - if 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.290
 I took 2 + 7, this is equal to 5 

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:35.750
 We are done! 

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.670
 This has worked 

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.440
 I mean, we can try 2 + 7, but that 

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.070
 Equals -5, if this does not work 

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.960
 But succeeded 2 and 7 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.590
 And 2 × 7 = -14 

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.600
 We got it 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.210
 We know that (x - 2) (x + 7) 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.330
 This is nicely done 

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.950
 -2 × 7 = -14 

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.880
 -2 + 7 = positive 5 

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.760
 -2 + 7 = positive 5 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.680
 Let's solve more of them, so we gain 

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.520
 This skill 

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.360
 Let's assume that we have x ^ 2 - x - 56 

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.570
 If the multiplication of these two numbers should be 56 

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.620
 It should be -56 

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.430
 The difference between them, because one will be positive 

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.280
 The other is negative, right? 

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.350
 The difference between them should be -1 

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.130
 And the numbers that will directly inform me 

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.900
 - I do not know if it has occurred to you 

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.740
 We have learned that this is in multiplication tables 

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.480
 - 56 = 8 × 7 

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
 I mean there are other numbers 

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.950
 It's also 28 x 2 

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.140
 There are many numbers 

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.300
 But 8 × 7 has really scared me, because they are 

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.470
 Very close together 

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.730
 We need numbers to be close together 

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.430
 One must be positive, and the other must 

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.810
 To be negative 

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.250
 Now, when their sum is negative, this tells me that 

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.460
 The greater number of these two should be negative 

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.350
 If we take 8 × 7, this is 

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.320
 Equals -56 

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.470
 Hence if we take 8 + 7, this is equal 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.100
 -1, which is the parameter found here 

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.490
 When I analyze them, x (8) 

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.690
 × (x + 7) 

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.695
 This is often the most difficult concept that people learn 

00:12:21.695 --> 00:12:23.920
 In algebra, because it is a kind of art 

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.710
 You have to look at all the factors here, manipulating 

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.710
 Negative and positive signals, and see which of these factors 

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.900
 Shall be positive, and any of them shall be negative, and their sum shall be equal 

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.590
 For the x statement parameter 

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.860
 But whenever you solve more questions, you'll see that 

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.280
 It becomes obvious 

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.350
 Now let's intensify the exercises more 

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.140
 Let's say we have -x ^ 2 - everything we've done 

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.040
 Recently, his treatment was positive 

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.690
 The coefficient of the expression x ^ 2 is positive 1 

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.590
 But let's assume that we have -x ^ 2 

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.440
 - 5x + 24 

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.910
 How do we solve it? 

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.420
 Well, the simplest way I can think of is to extract the common factor 

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.670
 -1, and then become similar to the issues 

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.260
 Which we have dealt with previously 

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.660
 If this is equivalent to -1 × (x ^ 2 

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.990
 + 5x - 24) 

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.300
 is not it? 

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.080
 I extracted the 1 

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.180
 You can hit -1 with all this, and will 

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.690
 You see it will become as it was 

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.555
 Or you can extract the -1 and divide all 

00:13:23.555 --> 00:13:25.000
 This is on -1 

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.760
 And you'll get this 

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.360
 Now, as we did before 

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.510
 We will need two numbers, when we hit them we get 

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.690
 24 

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.125
 If one of them is positive, the other negative 

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:41.550
 And when I take their sum 

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.770
 When I take their total, it will be 5 

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.850
 So let's think about 24, which is 1 and 24 

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:55.750
 Let's see, if this is -1 and 24, then their sum will be positive 23 

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.540
 If it is the opposite, it will be -23 

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.500
 Did not succeed 

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.210
 What about for 2 and 12? 

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.530
 Well, if this - - Remember, one of these two numbers should 

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.040
 Be negative 

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.570
 If 2 is the negative number, the sum will be 10 

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.750
 If the 12 is negative, their total will be -10 

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.300
 It did not work either 

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.290
 3 and 8 

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.850
 If the 3 are negative, the sum is 5 

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.910
 If it has succeeded 

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:24.620
 If we choose 3 and 8, 3 and 8 will meet our demand 

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.630
 Because -3 + 8 = 5 

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.510
 -3 × 8 = -24 

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.640
 If this equals - I can not forget it 

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.230
 There are -1 abroad, then we analyze the inside 

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:42.990
 -1 × (x - 3) (x + 8) 

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.800
 If you really want to, you can hit 

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.450
 1. With this, you will get 3 

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.560
 - x 

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.810
 Or you are not forced to do so 

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.810
 Let's solve one another 

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.220
 Let us solve another issue on this 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.060
 That's enough practice for you, I think 

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.630
 That's good, suppose we have -x ^ 2 

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.690
 + 18x - 72 

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.320
 Again, I prefer to extract -1 

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.040
 If this equals -1 × (x ^ 2 

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.910
 - 18x + 72 

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.650
 Now we have to think about two dimensions, when 

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.330
 Make a positive 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.480
 If their signals are similar 

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.930
 This makes it simple, at least until I do it mentally 

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.260
 When you hit them, get 72 

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.040
 When I get them together, I get -18 

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.410
 If they have the same signal, their total will be 

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.470
 A negative number, if both must be negative 

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
 Both are negative 

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.790
 We can address all 72 factors 

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.510
 But whatever you think, maybe 8 × 9 

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:53.270
 But 8 × 9, or -8-9, or -8 + 

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.210
 -9, do not succeed 

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.060
 Because their sum is 17 

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:58.860
 It was soon 

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.560
 Let me make it clear to you 

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.400
 -9 + -8 = -17 

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.140
 Very close, but not what is required 

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.990
 What are the other factors? 

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.005
 We have 6 and 12 

00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:09.705
 That sounds good 

00:16:09.705 --> 00:16:13.710
 If we have -6 + -12, this is equal 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.360
 18 

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.590
 Note, it's an art 

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.810
 You have to try different factors here 

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.360
 If it becomes -1 - do not forget 

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.440
 That is - × (x - 6) (x - 12) 

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.866
 .
