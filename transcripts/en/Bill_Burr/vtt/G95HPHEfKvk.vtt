1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.130
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.840
just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.350
I'm just checking in on you. Um,

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.260
I have no life. I don't know what to talk about. I've got no fucking life, man.

5
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.960
We're just right in this God damn show, having a great time doing it, of course.

6
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:22.501
But, uh,

7
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.640
I just stay in a writers room and I stare at a computer screen all day long and

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.600
my eyes were killing me yesterday. It, uh,

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.070
I started looking around the room and I noticed,

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.740
I think I'm the only one in the room that doesn't wear glasses.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.450
That's like, uh,

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
that's like earning your stripes as a writer is you actually,

13
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.650
you wear glasses that, and you can do that thing where you, you know,

14
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.890
you spin the fucking pen around your finger and you can catch it. You know,

15
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:54.090
those, you know, friend of mine always said mathletes could always do that,

16
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.210
you know, but, um, anyways,

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.400
I'm going to do some standup this weekend. Um, we just, uh,

18
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.460
we just did the table read for episode two. Uh,

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
Dave Kepner came in and just crushed it as Bob Pogo was fucking awesome. And,

20
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.590
uh, you know, that's probably my most favorite thing about the week, uh,

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.210
is doing the table reads cause it's,

22
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:19.980
it feels like doing stand up in front of the La live like crowd for those of you

23
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.770
not in the business. It's basically after you write the thing,

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.130
you sit down and before you record it, you basically,

25
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:30.120
you do it in front of a bunch of people who've invested in the show.

26
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.320
So they're hoping it's funny, but if it isn't funny, they're not going to laugh.

27
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.300
So if they, if you get them laughing,

28
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.180
if you get industry industry people laugh and that's always a big thing.

29
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.930
So we had a great table read some very excited about that. Um,

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.500
and um, anyways, but that's not what I want to talk about here today.

31
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:52.380
I gotta tell you something I found the other day, uh, when I was on youtube, um,

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.870
any wrestling fans out there, ah,

33
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.770
anybody old like me used to watch fucking Tony, Gloria and Larry's a Bisco.

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.790
Ivan put ski and Bulldog Brower and Pat Patterson. And Ted Dibiase,

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.130
the Internet intercontinental champion.

36
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.340
You know dusty Rhodes?

37
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.080
<v 0>Mr Fuji. Mr ITTO, the moon dogs.</v>

39
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.190
<v 0>George the animal Steele. Super stabbed. Billy Graham.</v>

41
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.820
Bob backlit. Bruno Sammartino.

42
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.630
<v 0>Greg to Hammer Valentine and can't remember how many these fucking guys who</v>

44
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.860
still remember Tony Atlas. Jimmy superfly snooker.

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.300
I still remember that finishing moves.

46
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.230
Tony Atlas would just fucking basically do a military press with you.

47
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.460
He'd just pick you up over his head and he fucking throw you right Andre.

48
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.440
The giant would just put his giant fucking size 48 foot.

49
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.100
You throw you off the ropes and just stick it right in your face and he'd sit on

50
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.220
you. I haven't put ski. Had the Polish Hammer.

51
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.730
Greg Valentine had the figure four leg lock.

52
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:02.500
That's the time I ever threw up my back. This kid when I was in fourth grade,

53
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.800
showed me how to do the figure four leg lock by putting me into it and was

54
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.270
fucking killing my knee. And I was trying to get up to, to get my free,

55
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.670
my leg from putting pressure on my kneecap.

56
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.130
And that's the first time I fucked up my lower back.

57
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.080
That a bad back since the lower,

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.950
since the a bad lower back since the a the fourth grade,

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
<v 2>um,</v>

60
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.540
<v 0>chief Jay Strongbow would do the fucking rain dance.</v>

61
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.760
That wasn't too fucking racist, wasn't once he did that,

62
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:30.230
he went into this crazy fucking,

63
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.450
he couldn't feel pain anymore and then he kicked the shit out of you. Uh,

64
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.800
all right. Enough of that shit.

65
00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:39.470
So I was just looking at some of the old restaurants, um,

66
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.030
stuff that I used to watch, SD Jones, special delivery Jones.

67
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.480
The guy never fucking won. He was the most coolest fucking guy ever.

68
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.623
<v 2>Um,</v>

69
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.860
<v 0>anyways, Mr Wonderful Roddy Roddy Piper.</v>

70
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.740
I fucking love all those guys. So anyways, um, I was,

71
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.930
I never heard of this before, but yeah, it,

72
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.690
those of you who are fans of wrestling, if I,

73
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.220
there's this thing called the shoot match, which is basically, you know,

74
00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:12.980
wrestling, it's sports entertainment. When I was a kid,

75
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.340
they used to argue that it was real. And then finally they said, now it's fake.

76
00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:19.310
But, but what was great was once they said it was fake,

77
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:23.090
they could actually talk about all the real pain that they go through.

78
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.350
So I was kinda just watching some youtube videos about that and I came across

79
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:30.380
this stuff called a shoot match. So I was like,

80
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:34.850
what the hell is that shoot match in a shoot match is basically a wrestling

81
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:39.230
match where they're fake fighting and then somebody gets pissed at somebody else

82
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.390
and it becomes a real fight.

83
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.830
And what usually happens from the few that I saw is if the person's just not a

84
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:51.260
complete roid roided up psycho.

85
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.993
<v 2>Um,</v>

86
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.160
<v 0>what it really is, is either somebody's not selling your moves,</v>

87
00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:01.100
like I'm fake punching you and you're just acting like it's not hurting.

88
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:06.050
So you making me look like an asshole or somebody you know you are,

89
00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.920
you're allowing somebody to throw you and do a move and they bought it and fuck,

90
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.360
fuck you up and hurt you and then you get mad. Um,

91
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.160
I saw one with this guy.

92
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:21.140
This kid was new when he went to to execute some fucking throw and this guy was

93
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:21.891
just a psycho.

94
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:25.250
He didn't look like he landed that bad and he got up and just beat the fuck out

95
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:28.640
of this guy. Just threw him head first out of the ring.

96
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:32.930
The guy landed on his fucking head and we immediately had a concussion.

97
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:37.340
Then he picked the guy up and threw him into the metal stairs and this guy kept

98
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.130
selling. He, I guess he didn't have to sell the moves at that point,

99
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.970
but that one was fucking brutal. But the funniest one that you got to see,

100
00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.690
and I'm having a link to it, it's the great Antonio Verse Antonio,

101
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.900
I hope I say it right so he doesn't come over and slap the shit out of me.

102
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:53.900
I knocky, I'm a Japanese guy,

103
00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:57.590
so the Great Antonio is guy,

104
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.900
I can't even describe what he looks like.

105
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.901
He looks like a fucking troll with a page pageboy haircut and he's just

106
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.490
ridiculously fat and he's wearing the ugliest mustard colored yellow light

107
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.630
sweatpants with these military boots on.

108
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.740
I'm just not a good looking person.

109
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.030
And he's a wrestling this guy,

110
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:27.320
Antonio or knocky who's a Japanese guy who looks like a fucking movie star,

111
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.200
you know, he's got the old school movie star Chin,

112
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.830
he's got the Jack Lord Hawaii five o fucking haircut.

113
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.390
He's in great shape.

114
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.600
So they start fucking wrestling and wrassling and you know,

115
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.460
the Japanese guy is being a fucking professional and the Great Antonio who I

116
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:50.150
guess had a reputation for not selling people's moves and being selfish in the

117
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:50.984
ring.

118
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.650
You know the Japanese guy would punch him in his fat stomach and he wouldn't

119
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.341
even move.

120
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.670
And then the f the fat that would keep like punching his stomach like it's hard

121
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.690
as a rock and people were laughing in the crowd. The fucking guy,

122
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.890
like the Japanese guy throws him off the fucking ropes and the guy just sort of

123
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.310
stops, you know, and doesn't sell the fucking move.

124
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.440
And the Japanese guy's looking at him like, what the fuck?

125
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.280
And the crowd's laughing. You start seeing the Japanese to look in and I'm like,

126
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:19.340
dude, what the fuck? It's a long story short.

127
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.740
They get a few minutes into the round,

128
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.390
the Japanese guy has been selling everything to fat fucks doing the fat fucks

129
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.100
making the Japanese guy look like an idiot.

130
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.680
So fat fuck gets the Japanese guy against the ropes and he's punching almost

131
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:37.220
like the back of this guy's neck. Super fucking hard.

132
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.880
And the guy takes like three of them before he finally like blocks the fourth

133
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:44.750
one. And then he just snaps like, dude, what? Like fuck this.

134
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.730
And he just stands up and just open hands slaps this fat.

135
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.040
Fucking the head is hard as you possibly can

136
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.530
in the fat pageboy guy like turns his head, it's fucking phenomenal.

137
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.690
And the Japanese guy's going like, go making those like, come on,

138
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.693
let's fucking fight.

139
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.210
And the Fed fuck's still kinda like thinking he's just going to take one.

140
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:08.930
He slaps him in the fucking head again, then grabs his leg,

141
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.960
Japanese dude just snaps, fucking throws him on his belly,

142
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.820
boots them in the fucking head right now the ref is going like, whoa, whoa, hey,

143
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:17.654
whoa.

144
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.820
The fat fucks crawling around like a dog and a Japanese guy boots him in the

145
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:23.654
head again.

146
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.010
Now the fat guy is like fucking plank and he's laying down on the ground and the

147
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:32.060
Japanese guy boots him in the head like another fucking six times.

148
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.140
It's almost attempted murder. The fucking dude is a bloody mess.

149
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.580
They finally just call a match. And um,

150
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.170
it was one of the great pieces of justice I ever saw.

151
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.580
I didn't feel bad for the guy at all when he was getting boated in the head.

152
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:50.120
I was dying laughing. If you saw how hard this,

153
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:54.500
this fat fuck was punching this poor Japanese guy in the back of his neck and

154
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.430
he, the guy was taking it like a pro. And finally he was just like, what the f?

155
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.570
Cause it was all, he was like, he was hitting him for real. Um,

156
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.910
and he wasn't selling his moves. So you got, I'm going to, um,

157
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.730
have a link for it. If anybody else has some good ones up there. I,

158
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.780
it's just a whole new part of Youtube that, uh, you know, if you're at work,

159
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.690
if you're bored right now, just look it up yourself. Shoot matches.

160
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:19.140
S h o o t matches and uh,

161
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.710
there's just some legendary ones. And um, you know,

162
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.650
as much as they talked to wrestlers and stuff, like I, I never hear him,

163
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.590
you know, I always hear you know, about doing the road and these,

164
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.490
these great matches that they had. And then of course they talk about, you know,

165
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.280
you know, people getting the sickness, you know,

166
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.860
getting addicted to painkillers and drugs and all that shit.

167
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.380
They do all that type of shit. But, um,

168
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.590
nobody talks about all these fucking wrestling matches out there that, uh,

169
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.600
suddenly, um, that suddenly became real,

170
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:53.130
you know, so, um, I dunno. I hope you enjoy it. That's all I could say.

171
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.180
But anyways, let's get back to, uh, let's get back to the podcast.

172
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:01.290
So basically everything that I'm going to be talking about over the next couple

173
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.020
of months is going to be whatever I look out the window and see while we're

174
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.280
writing EFAs for family.

175
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.730
So anyways, um, yeah,

176
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.900
the day we're in the writer's room,

177
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:16.110
actually yesterday and all of a sudden we just hear like this fucking commotion,

178
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.340
right? And we look out our windows in this,

179
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:25.341
all these protestors just walking down the fucking taking up like a street,

180
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.270
you know, a lane of the street, like a, you know, like bike riders do now.

181
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.820
You know what I mean? When they ride down the street,

182
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.940
if there's two of them rather than riding single file,

183
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:38.700
they ride side by side because they want to talk and you know,

184
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.790
fuck the 50 cars that are behind them. Oh. And then by the way,

185
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.470
if they actually get hit, it's this major fucking tragedy. Like, oh my God can,

186
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:48.930
can you fucking believe that happened? Yes,

187
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.750
I can totally believe that happened completely.

188
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.010
A bicycle is simply a motorcycle without an engine.

189
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.400
That's what you're riding around on it,

190
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.140
but I know you're dressed up like you're in the Tour de France, you know,

191
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.230
you feel in a little European like that dude and breaking away,

192
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:07.770
maybe you speaking in Italian and you kind of forget that you're riding a

193
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:12.771
bicycle out in the street in Los Angeles home to arguably some of the worst

194
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:17.280
drivers on the planet. All right.

195
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.550
And I've always gotten off on technology and shit and saying, I don't like it.

196
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:24.510
Saying like we had enough technology somewhere around the early nineties we

197
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.720
should've stopped right about there. You let people die off.

198
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.790
Stop trying to cure fucking diseases.

199
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.810
Stop making a new technology that everybody has to go out and go buy this.

200
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:36.360
Just stop right fucking here. Okay. I mean,

201
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.110
I can remember the early nineties it was fucking great. It was fine.

202
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.090
Cars were fast enough, everything was fine.

203
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.700
He didn't have to go any further than that.

204
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.400
Wasn't it better when everybody wasn't on the fucking Internet?

205
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.160
I think it was even, I'm sitting here on the Internet right now.

206
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.160
I'd be willing to walk away from this shit. It's a great time.

207
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.760
Everything you did wasn't filmed. It wasn't fucking recorded.

208
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.420
There wasn't some satellite pointing at you're tracking you down the street as

209
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.800
you tried to get to a dairy queen.

210
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:05.830
But also the Illuminati can fucking take you out cause they probably own that

211
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.300
satellite, you know,

212
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.860
turn on some chip in your car and make it drive into a fucking tree, you know,

213
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.230
make white people. These are very mainstream stories here. Um, anyways,

214
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.720
um, these fucking prod,

215
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.810
they must've had a permit because it was a cop in front of them and behind them

216
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.010
and they're just walking down the street and I gotta tell you something.

217
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.700
All right, I'm all for the work and man, I'm all for that type of shit.

218
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.840
But the second you go out in the fucking street and you start blocking traffic,

219
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:37.990
I don't give a shit. If you're trying to say babies, I hate you and I want to,

220
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.610
I want to rent a cement truck and run you over. Like I was sitting in an office.

221
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.590
They weren't causing me any trouble.

222
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:49.591
And just the empathy that I had for the people trying to drive around them made

223
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:52.600
me want somebody to just fish tail into the fucking crowd.

224
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.160
So if you've ever been in a protest, let me ask you this question.

225
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.073
<v 3>Is it</v>

226
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.320
<v 0>the objective to not only call attention to whatever it is you're complaining</v>

227
00:13:05.961 --> 00:13:08.290
about, but then don't you want people to

228
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.473
<v 3>listen</v>

229
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.590
<v 0>and then be like, Oh wow, I didn't know that was going on.</v>

230
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.870
You know,

231
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.870
so why would you annoy the shit out of everybody by like clogging up traffic?

232
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.240
To me, it's no different than fucking terrorists.

233
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.270
A lot of times whatever terrorists are bitching about, I'm like, yeah, I could.

234
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.250
I, I totally understand why you're upset about that,

235
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.420
but the then go and blow up a bunch of innocent people. I'm just like, yeah,

236
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.470
well that's not the way you solve it. Right.

237
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.090
My over simplifying this,

238
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.900
it's like we don't fly over there and drop bombs at ups.

239
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:49.240
Did that land on your baby? Yeah, we were trying to get the bad guy. Sorry,

240
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:53.180
your baby was within a 30 mile radius. I don't know. Um,

241
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.860
anyways, do you guys have or do you have, do you have like,

242
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.150
like I actually enjoy riding a bike, but, uh, I am an old school bike rider.

243
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.860
Like I ride up on the sidewalk. I don't wear a helmet. Um, you know,

244
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:09.640
I don't ride 90 miles an hour down the sidewalk and I don't care when people who

245
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.950
walk on the sidewalk give me a fucking dirty look.

246
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.260
It's just like I'm not going out there.

247
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.020
I'm not going out there and traffic,

248
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.650
cause I know everybody out there is like me and they're texting while they're

249
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.590
driving or they're fucking air drumming. You know,

250
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.320
God knows how many people are out there on prescription pills.

251
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.530
To go out there on a fucking motorcycle without an engine is really fucking

252
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:36.490
stupid. Yeah. And um,

253
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.280
I feel like this thing with like bike riders,

254
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:43.780
they have this thing where they feel like they're these victims and uh,

255
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.330
I find them way, way more hostile. Yeah.

256
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.910
Considering the position that they're in and they had this whole,

257
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.830
you will respect me and I have just as much as of right to be out here.

258
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.220
What should do you do? I mean, even though there is no bike lane,

259
00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:58.911
they just painted,

260
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:02.780
painted a bicycle on the fucking street so they could get the federal grant.

261
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.130
That's the only reason why they do that shit. Right. And then a, you know,

262
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.410
all right, so you have a right to be out there,

263
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.220
but then you have to obey the rules of the road. And 99% of you don't.

264
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.120
When's the last time you saw a guy on a bicycle actually stop at a fucking red

265
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:21.770
light? They never do. They never do. They fucking look both ways.

266
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:25.100
They fucking glide right through the fucking thing. And then if they get hit,

267
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:28.400
then they frost the bicycle. Like, oh, well can you believe that happened?

268
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.080
What a poor baby. Um, I dunno.

269
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.650
I have to tell you, the people who ride bicycles out here and in Los Angeles,

270
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.220
the ride of their fucking minds and I am so anti those fucking cars that are

271
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.070
going to drive themselves, um,

272
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.940
until I go on the highways out here in Los Angeles. I'm just like,

273
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.250
you know what? I really think it should be. I think if you,

274
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.080
if you suck at driving, they should just take your right to drive away.

275
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.160
You can still have a car, but the car will drive for you because you suck at it.

276
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.490
You know what I mean? But I think if you're actually a decent driver,

277
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:04.760
you should then be allowed to continue driving.

278
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.530
So I think if you got rid of people who suck the driving right off the bat,

279
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.730
conservatively speaking, I'd say that's at least 30% of drivers,

280
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.710
you know? And then I think that middle, you know,

281
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.540
30 to 35% will just have the option because there's a lot of people that are

282
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:25.130
actually decent at driving. But if they're like, dude,

283
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:30.131
if I could just fucking take a nap and just sleep on the way to work for 45

284
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:33.320
minutes and just wake up when I'm there, I would rather do that.

285
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.300
So you figure it, at least half of them are gonna do it initially.

286
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:42.590
And then a half of those halfs are going to be like, well,

287
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.570
he has a self driving car. I, I, you know, grass is always greener.

288
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.540
I want one of those too.

289
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.510
And then I think you'll just basically get down to 18% of people that actually

290
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:55.200
truly enjoyed driving. And um, we'll get our own lane bulky.

291
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.550
This is my drink, we get our own lane, we get to drive as fast as we want.

292
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.480
And you guys are just all in robot cars, you know?

293
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.060
And then everybody who actually still continues to drive,

294
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.660
those are the people that, you know, when they're the first guy to make a left,

295
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.490
they get way out into the intersection.

296
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.030
They feel a sense of responsibility that two cars behind them will make it.

297
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:16.760
Those types of people, you know, those people that,

298
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.000
that realize the further left you go, the faster you go.

299
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.300
And if somebody on your bumper, you don't slam on the brakes, you get over,

300
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.330
that person's obviously in more of a here a hurry than you are.

301
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.950
You fucking let them go those, well, that's probably 18% of drivers.

302
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.963
What'd you say?

303
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.840
You like how I just painted myself as the fucking hero and all that? Oh yeah.

304
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:36.561
I'm one of the guys.

305
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:39.980
I'm one of the guys that knows how to do the things correctly. Um,

306
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.100
anyways, I hope this hasn't been too quiet. Let's plow ahead here.

307
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.350
Um, I am over. Oh, by the way, I'm over the whole fucking Tom Brady thing.

308
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.300
I actually have a buddy of mine that works in the A,

309
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:57.150
I can't say where he works, but just he basically broke it down and said,

310
00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:00.060
listen, this is not a personal thing against the Patriots.

311
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:03.750
What it is is this is a corporation thing versus the employees.

312
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.300
And if the corporation says this is what's going to happen in the employee's

313
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.610
able to go around that,

314
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.790
then they get then that you got the nuts run in the nuthouse.

315
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.930
So basically Tom Brady was acquitted of any sort of cheating,

316
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.380
but the second trial, yes, he was. Look it up.

317
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.970
The second trial was, or very least, he was never convicted of that.

318
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.520
Um, this second trial was,

319
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:31.521
was more about does a corporation have a right to discipline its employees?

320
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.350
So you know what happened at Tom Brady outside in the real world,

321
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.040
in the United States of America, it wouldn't even have made it to trial.

322
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:50.190
All right? But with the lack of fucking evidence that yeah, they had,

323
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.240
okay, the on the other side, um,

324
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.190
you have within a corporation,

325
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.550
a corporation operates the way a corporation operates.

326
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:02.370
So they should be allowed to run their, but that's what it was about.

327
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.790
Are we as a corporation allowed to discipline our employees?

328
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.370
Are they able to go outside the corporation?

329
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.020
Are we gonna have to fucking deal with that?

330
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.230
And it was a big deal for the suits in the NFL to win that because if Tom Brady

331
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:19.710
wins that thing,

332
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.890
then every fucking suspension a player could simply take it outside of the NFL

333
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.820
and it really, um, whittles down the level of power that they have.

334
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:31.260
So I got to actually be honest with you,

335
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.430
I actually understand now I understand why the NFL did that.

336
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.060
And you know, if they've got to throw Tom Brady under the fucking bus,

337
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.360
then so be it. Now,

338
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:44.280
I know a lot of you guys out there think I'm skirting the fucking issue as far

339
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:47.520
as like, oh, he deflated. I'm not saying he didn't deflate the fucking ball,

340
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.060
but that's not why the colts lost by 35 fucking points.

341
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.850
I've said this is Zillion fucking times. You know,

342
00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:58.200
Andrew Luck shouldn't even be on the colts that the colts actually tried the

343
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:00.270
season before he was available in the draft,

344
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:03.660
but they tanked the whole fucking season. And, um, I dunno,

345
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.470
just the amount of attention that Tom Brady gets versus, you know,

346
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.590
you know, have an HGH delivered to your fucking house in your wife's name.

347
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:16.440
And then you sit there in front of the Superbowl media for two weeks and it's

348
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:17.400
not even brought up.

349
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.260
And then you quote Forrest Gump in right off into the fucking sunset and then

350
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:26.120
everybody's cool with it. Um, whatever, that's all I want. Have,

351
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.420
what the fuck you gonna do. So anyways, plowing ahead here,

352
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.100
plowing ahead. Um, let me do, read a little bit of advertising here.

353
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.540
Then I'm going to get the fuck outta here and go stare at a computer screen.

354
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.980
All God Damn Day. I'm on it. Everybody. Joe Rogan's,

355
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:44.160
great company here. Uh, Alpha brain, instant from on. It is,

356
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.520
it is a delicious all natural stimulant free drink that helps support memory,

357
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:50.380
focus and processing speed.

358
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.370
The Boston Center for memory conducted a double blind study showing its

359
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:57.610
effectiveness. I don't know what a double blind study is but that sounds,

360
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.060
that sounds like all checks and balances Cleo.

361
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.020
So mad a buddy fucking itching up a storm.

362
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.270
I'm it's the secret weapon of pro athletes like a Bodie, Miller,

363
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.430
Brian Cushing and Jonathan Tabes.

364
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.630
But anyone can benefit from the effects of Alpha brain instant.

365
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:22.050
Simply mix a stick packet of Alpha brain instant into a water bottle and start

366
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:23.950
feeling the effects immediately.

367
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.640
It's non GMO gluten free,

368

Get a little buzz going and forget about your miserable life.

377
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:05.230
But unless you plan ahead, you probably don't even have a bottle in your house.

378
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.110
And getting up and going to the store is not happening cause you're wiped out.

421
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:44.620
I read these last two later, so I'll tell you, I'll read them later. You know,

422
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.930
um, oh, congratulations to the meet me in St Louis.

423
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.780
Louis meet me at the fair St Louis Blues, got the job done.

424
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.910
Um, what a fucking huge one for that city. Um,

425
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.950
that's always great to see that,

426
00:25:01.951 --> 00:25:05.980
but it was instantly also depressing not to see Chicago when it, because uh,

427
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.460
then he, you don't get to watch, you know, all the great players that they have,

428
00:25:09.461 --> 00:25:13.040
tapes, Kane, Dunkin, Keith and all those guys. Um,

429
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.080
it's weird to see the Blackhawks and the kings out in the first round and look

430
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:22.081
who's coming up the outside and they come San Jose sharks,

431
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.420
the fucking, I mean,

432
00:25:25.421 --> 00:25:29.290
their logo should literally be somebody choking on a piece of fucking steak.

433
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.330
You know, I don't know why steak,

434
00:25:31.331 --> 00:25:35.740
but just choking on something that I don't think you could find a team that's

435
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.950
won more hockey games and left in the first round or just not want a cup.

436
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.740
And I don't know what it is about the San Jose sharks.

437
00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:49.600
I just don't have any sympathy for them or their fucking fans. I don't know why.

438
00:25:49.601 --> 00:25:53.050
I think it has to do with that teal color that they have.

439
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.210
You know, maybe it's because the kings got rid of their, their fucking,

440
00:25:58.211 --> 00:26:01.450
you know, royal colors, the Laker colors that they had.

441
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.830
And they took basically black, white and gray because you know,

442
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.240
you think the sharks would have like a gray looking uniform.

443
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.380
You'd think if you had, like, if he came up with a killer name, like the sharks,

444
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.040
like that animal, that fish there was just sitting there on the table.

445
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.540
Cause you know, you know the deal with sports teams, this,

446
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.570
there's only so many ferocious fucking animals to pick from, you know,

447
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.030
and then once that goes out the window,

448
00:26:28.031 --> 00:26:31.210
then you kinda gotta talk about like the jobs people do,

449
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.000
like a where the packers, yeah.

450
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:37.690
Everybody pack stuff up here and where the fucking these guys or those guys,

451
00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:40.420
you know, and then when you're really out of names,

452
00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:44.880
that's when you start naming teams after like weather, right? The hurricanes,

453
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:47.910
the heat, the thunder, right.

454
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.480
The mystique or whatever the fuck you come, flurries the Florida flurries.

455
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.650
That would make sense. That doesn't snow down there. Um,

456
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.130
Florida Sun showers, it's just really going to be bad.

457
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:05.670
That's why you can't go beyond 30 teams and he's fucking leak, you know, or 32,

458
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:08.580
I guess that's where up to, but shocks was just sitting there.

459
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.300
We'd just sit there on the table and I remember thinking like, Oh wow,

460
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:14.520
the shocks, that's a great name. I can't wait to see that uniform.

461
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:17.310
And it was like bump, bump, a bomb bow.

462
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.640
It's a shark and he's biting a hockey stick and half. Well yeah,

463
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:24.210
then you're going to get a penalty for, for slashing and today's NHL,

464
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:30.450
right second. The stick breaks automatically. I'm, I'm sorry. I don't know.

465
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.430
I don't know what it is. I just don't, uh,

466
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.640
this is where I have sympathy for the shock fans.

467
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.850
I know what it's like to root for a fucking team year in and year out and they

468
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:41.610
fucking blow it. I don't know what it's like for the last 15 years.

469
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:46.611
All of a sudden my hell turned into a fucking paradise cause everybody started

470
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:49.320
fucking winning. But before then, you know,

471
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:53.910
I was a red sox fan living in New York City with all that curse of the Babe Shit

472
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:58.400
going on, you know, Boston sports, we're in the fucking shitter.

473
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.780
Basically when I was growing up,

474
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:05.520
we had the Boston Celtics and then up to 86 and then once led by his died.

475
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.500
Um, and then Reggie Lewis died. I mean the whole thing, it just, it just,

476
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.190
the wheels fell off for like 20 fucking years. But, um,

477
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.040
fortunately nowadays you can go out and buy a championship,

478
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:21.150
which we did in 2007. Um, anyways,

479
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:23.280
so I'm just trying to say congratulations to St Louis.

480
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.200
Now my two favorite teams out west,

481
00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:29.490
the stars and the blues are playing each other. And um,

482
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.840
I think I'm gonna stick with the blues just cause, uh, I don't know.

483
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:35.580
I just worked St Louis, I saw how excited they were. And you know,

484
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.570
I like the stars cause I used to like the Minnesota north stars and I like the

485
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:42.240
people on the stars, but I'm not into their fans either.

486
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.810
You Know Dallas fans at the end of the fucking day,

487
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:47.640
you don't give a fuck about the stars.

488
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.680
There's only one star in Dallas and that's the one in this side of the cowboys

489
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.620
helmet. You know it's fucking true. You know,

490
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.620
that's all you give a fuck about.

491
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.130
Those beautiful ladies coming out and their Little Horry Cherries,

492
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.730
Charlie's angel outfits. That's what you give a fuck about that.

493
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:06.780
You give a fuck about that.

494
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.560
And your shiny four-door pickup truck that's never seen dirt. Right.

495
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.520
Come in there with your fake tid fucking botox,

496
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.800
Dolly Parton fucking hair check going down the street looking like a couple of

497
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:23.400
televangelists. That's what you do out there in Dallas in the big day.

498
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.550
Isn't that what you do? I don't. I'm just fucking with you.

499
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.660
I'm the one great thing though. I do like, you know something.

500
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:35.280
I can't say I'm totally anti-technology because uh, I do love Tivo,

501
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.180
but back in the day I also had a VCR so I could have take games, right? I'm,

502
00:29:40.181 --> 00:29:41.320
I'm saying like the one thing,

503
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.360
the citing thing that I have in the writers room as we're doing all the work,

504
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.330
no, is, is the excitement is right around five o'clock.

505
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.850
I know we only got a couple hours left and that whatever game I want to watch is

506
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:58.360
currently being taping and it being taped. And I don't go on Twitter.

507
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.850
I don't look at my phone or anything that I just shut it off and uh,

508
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.670
I'm able to come home and watch all these fucking great series and uh,

509
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.310
there's just the best, you know, I actually retweeted, there was civic duty.

510
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.230
You guys see that thing on Twitter ad? That dude becoming a hockey fan

511
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.970
is fucking black dude was hilarious. Like he goes, you know what,

512
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:23.020
I'm going to give this hockey shit at tri and he just starts live tweeting game

513
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:26.590
seven of the blues. And uh, the Blackhawks,

514
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.350
I guess he decided to root for the blues.

515
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.720
He was just tweeting this hilarious shit. Like what the fuck is a power play?

516
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.940
I don't know who this cane guy is,

517
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:37.690
but we gotta stop this motherfucker and that towards the end of the game he

518
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:40.810
goes, what's so like the goalie just leaves?

519
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.240
Then the best question he ever, as I've ever heard a hockey goes for real.

520
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.560
Why don't, why does it, the whole other team just stand in front of their net.

521
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.650
You know when you're up by one in the just shooting, like why don't you do that?

522
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.650
That's fucking hilarious. Um,

523
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.890
that's just someone who's never gotten hit in the foot with the fucking puck.

524
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.650
It's like you really, I, and whenever I watched somebody block a shot,

525
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.210
like I just, the fucking balls that that takes you do that and pick up hockey,

526
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:10.270
you're going to be limping for the rest of the fucking week to watch these guys

527
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.550
block an NHL shot. They're out of their minds. But, um, anyways,

528
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:18.220
I'm up to 30 minutes here. I gotta kind of cut this thing short.

529
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:23.140
I know I usually do a little bit more time than this, but I gotta I gotta go,

530
00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:26.170
I gotta go to work or Billy goes to work every day,

531
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.770
eat a fucking salad every day at lunch. That's what I do.

532
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.790
They like a big fucking pussy every fucking day. Um,

533
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.640
and I'm actually doing okay. And I tried to lose two pounds this week,

534
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:38.890
which I think I did, but I had a Burrito last night,

535
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:41.320
so I only lost like a fucking pound.

536
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:46.321
So next week I have to be down to one 76 going to buckle down over this weekend

537
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:50.860
and fucking workout and um, get myself back down to about a buck 70.

538
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.450
Um, by the way, I think the Celtics are playing tonight.

539
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.790
I think game six, that's obviously a must went well winning at home,

540
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:03.910
but we're getting pounded. We got fucking pounded that last game.

541
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.390
Second joke was almost, we almost losing by fucking 30, but you know,

542
00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:10.420
we're a young team. We'll see hopefully next year with all our draft picks.

543
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:14.290
Maybe we'll get Kevin Duran or that unit brow guy from fucking New Orleans.

544
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.160
Although I don't think either one of those are good. You know,

545
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:19.870
as far as for the league,

546
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:23.980
I think Doran should stay in Oklahoma and I think unibrow guy should stay in New

547
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.630
Orleans. Does that make sense?

548
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.720
My out of my fucking mind to think that that if you come in with the team,

549
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.230
you ought to fucking,

550
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.100
unless they're fucking you over like shack should have stayed with the magic.

551
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.730
You know, Shit. It came out just piled on with the fucking Lakers.

552
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.463
Look what happened.

553
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.990
He went a couple championships and then he threw out his next celebrating as he

554
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:44.510
went down. The Courtney was never the same. All right.

555
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.420
Let me do a couple more reads here and then I gotta get Outta here. All right,

556
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.060
hallux. He likes h. E. L. I. X.

557
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.040

558
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:59.900
I don't know. What the fuck happen to you at this store? Jesus Christ violated.

559
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:03.170
That's a really strong word. Especially when you have a mattress.

560
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:06.710
I was phased out. I heard him on Pucko his pants.

561
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.850
Um, is it, is it the pushy salespeople,

562
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.840
the fake president day sales or the fact that you know you'll regret what you

563
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:18.350
bought as you do the walk of shame out of the mattress store?

564
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.730
These days are over.

smartphones, Matt Katz, Matt Holmes.

feel really stupid.

586
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:36.140
Tracker makes losing things a thing of the past tracker is a called tracker.

587

605
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.560
which at the end of the day is just a state school,

606
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.330

609
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.410
<v 5>the sidewalk. If you're riding a bicycle,</v>

610
00:35:57.411 --> 00:35:59.420
please be careful and ride single file.

And have some fucking courtesy for the people behind you.

612
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.570
And if there's a red light, why don't you fucking stop at the thing. Okay.

613
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.390
And stop wearing aerodynamics. Shit. All right.

614
00:36:08.391 --> 00:36:13.160
It doesn't make you any faster and you, there's nothing at stake. All right. Ah,

615
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.720
alright. Enjoy the music and the, uh, the highlights from podcasts from it,

616
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.330
from years gone by.

617
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:30.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

618
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.760
<v 6>[inaudible] seize</v>

619
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.213
the day.

620
00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.203
[inaudible]

621
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.193
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

622
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.130
<v 7>hey, what's going on? [inaudible] the Monday morning podcast</v>

623
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.380
<v 8>that I'm doing at seven 30 at night Pacific coast time.</v>

624
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.390
So it's still 10 30 on east coast. So it's still Monday. Uh,

625
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.680
what's going on with me? I'm cooking fish. That's what I'm doing right now.

626
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.461
Cooking fish.

627
00:38:04.461 --> 00:38:07.670
And I'm steaming some Broccoli cause I have to be in shape next week.

628
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.550
Why you ask? Because on November 10th,

629
00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:14.930
I'm taping my one hour comedy special,

630
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.330
uh, for a DVD. I like that segue right out of the fish and Broccoli,

631
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:24.320
right into the goddamn comedy. Jesus Christ. I'm a professional.

632
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.650
Um, and this is the deal, man. I just, if you guys want to go,

633
00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:31.940
the tickets are free. Yes, they are free.

634
00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.710
All right. And, uh, I sent out a bulletin and a,

635
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.090
one of the problems I'm having is, um, all you have to do,

636
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.930
you just go to Belper at Broadway video and just write bill burrs and capitals,

637
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.190
Bill Burr, Broadway video. Just request your tickets,

638
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:52.420
leave your name and your phone number. It's all in the bulletin. But you know,

639
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.920
people don't like to read.

640
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:58.030
So what they're doing is they're reading the first quarter of it and then

641
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:01.060
they're sending me the email with their name,

642
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:06.130
with their requests and their phone numbers. So being a comedian,

643
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.040
I'm going to have to call them and say some stupid shit.

644
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.330
Now I don't have those 10 minutes on my phone. The fuck am I kidding?

645
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.010
I think I have the worst plan ever.

646
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.140
I probably made like seven phone calls last month and I've got a $380 cell phone

647
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:20.974
bill

648
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.440
screamed like a bitch echoed in my fucking living room. Um,

649
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.930
yeah. So that's the deal. So, uh,

650
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.560
anybody in the New York City area that wants to come out or I don't know if

651
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:35.830
you're going to be in New York and you want to come down. Um,

652
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.880
I'm taping my special and I,

653
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:41.980
I obviously don't want to take my special in front of 40 people. Uh,

654
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.540
it's a nice big theater, nice and cushy and um,

655
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.340
I want to make you laugh so seriously. Go to bill bar at Broadway,

656
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:54.700
video.com to get your tickets.

657
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.670
And uh, with that, I think I'm done. Um,

658
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.550
I think I'm done whoring out my stuff. Is that it?

659
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.660
I Dunno. It's like I got one other thing here. God Damn it.

660
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.600
I'm never organized for these things. Really not. Um,

661
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.090
I see these available on uh,

662
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.610

682
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:34.160
Just read the whole email though and bill bar at Broadway video.

683
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.860
All right there. I said at 98 times.

684
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.020
Then I just make my fucking Broccoli all soggy.

685
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.490
I did who steams Broccoli and does a podcast, you know, who does I do.

686
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.510
I do you think Rodney Dangerfield of it? Did some shit like that.

687
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.240
I mean probably did some blow, but it was the eighties okay.

688
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.690
I would have been on bluff. It was the 80s now I'm just on crystal meth.

689
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.240
All right. Hey and Oh, last,

690
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.320
last time I did a podcast also people said, you know, 50 things.

691
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:07.890
I just sort of meander. You know, I cook, I cook fish. I uh,

692
00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:11.130
I seen shit. I drive my car and you know,

693
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.160
I got into people I'm running out of stuff to talk about. You know,

694
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:20.600
I really thought that my life was interesting enough that once a week I could

695
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:22.130
babble about it for 10 minutes.

696
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.680
And you know what I realized nobody's that interesting.

697
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.650
Nobody is that fucking interesting. You know,

698
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:31.220
like how I did that rather than just taking it myself and just say,

699
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.110
you know what? I'm really not that interesting. A guy.

700
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:37.190
I dragged everybody down with me, including you listen to this.

701
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:41.150
I haven't said that you are not that interesting. You realize that. What a Dick.

702
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.850
Right. All right, so people sent me some questions.

703
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.950
I'm going to try to answer these things as honestly as I can so you can get to

704
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:53.480
know me a little better. Alright, what did, what did this guy, right?

705
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.480
This Guy Brad. The fuck names a kid, Brad. You know what I mean?

706
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.910
That's like, you don't even give a shit. It's not, you know,

707
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.350
it's like you don't want to be popular.

708
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.570
You don't want him to get the shit kicked out of him. You just,

709
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.160
he was just like, you know, do you want fries? Yeah. Yeah. I'll get fries.

710
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.410
What do you want? What do you want to call her kid? Hey Brad. Yeah, Brad is,

711
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.310
Brad wants to know, do you ever feel like you have time off?

712
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.540
Wait a second. I can't read out loud that why?

713
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.710
Do you ever feel like you have time off or does everyone you meet expect you to

714
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:32.660
make them laugh on call Brad?

715
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:37.520
You know what, that fucking sentence goes in three different directions.

716
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.790
It's like when a plane is doing it as pattern because there's too many goddamn

717
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:44.990
people in the world and they don't want to go into a holding pattern.

718
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:47.360
That's what your fucking, you just did the DVD.

719
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.720
I don't know the sentence version of my fucking flight into Newark.

720
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.940
Do you ever feel like you have time off?

721
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:57.230
I think it's going to be about going on vacation or does everyone you meet

722
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:02.000
expect you to make them laugh on call? You mean on

723
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.540
Cue Bread? But I got a question for you.

724
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:10.310
Where the fuck did you go to school and learn how to communicate?

725
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.270
Thought two sentences. Is that a run on it? No, it isn't. I don't think it is.

726
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.380
Do you ever feel like you have time off or does everyone you meet expect you to

727
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:20.960
make them laugh on call on call?

728
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:25.961
Like what am a nurse you asking me if I do like a like benefits for sick people?

729
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.040
Yeah, I do. I do those. I know what he's saying. Do you have,

730
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.970
do you ever feel like you can just relax and not be a Zany douchebag? Yeah.

731
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.810
Offstage? Uh, yeah, I, I don't,

732
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.560
I don't walk around with a lampshade on my head if that's what you're asking me.

733
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.650
Um, I actually know what I do find.

734
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:50.880
I find people try to make me laugh and they come up to me and they tell me

735
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:55.530
horrific jokes and then when they're done with them,

736
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.600
if I can even guess when they're done.

737
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.690
That's the worst part is when somebody tells you a joke and it's so bad,

738
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.190
you still think they're in the middle of it.

739
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.600
So you're still sitting there with your eyebrows up. You know, when you do that,

740
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:10.110
when you're, when you're, you're trying, like when you know somebody sucks,

741
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.060
whatever they're doing sucks,

742
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:14.490
but you don't have the balls to just stare at them.

743
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.260
Like your story sucks but you can't fake like, it's interesting.

744
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:22.980
So the only way to do it, you just put your eyebrows up like, Huh? Yeah. Uh Huh.

745
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.660
And then he's just staring at you and it's over and you're sitting there with

746
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:32.130
your eyebrows up by your fucking hairline and you realize that your moment to

747
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:36.690
laugh was a, it has come and gone. That's what I have had people tell me.

748
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:37.524
They tell me awful,

749
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.610
awful jokes and then they tell me about some guy they work with and B and

750
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:44.760
they're like, oh my God, you, you got to put this in your act.

751
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.610
I worked with this Guy Mac, right?

752
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:52.650
And every day he eats chicken salad and then pictures,

753
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:55.260
picture fucking 20 minutes of that

754
00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.300
as you're standing in an airport trying to hear when they're boarding zone

755
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:05.250
seven, however the fuck they work it out. That's what ends up happening.

756
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:07.660
So no, I don't feel like I have to be on offstage.

757
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.300
I just try to chill out and uh,

758
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.560
I certainly don't do it around my family because anytime they even remotely fit

759
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.210
funny around my family, they break my balls. They don't even laugh.

760
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:20.730
They just go, Oh really? Let's go bill. You're going to put that in your act.

761
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.430
It count. Um, okay. That was question number one.

762
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.510
And I guess that's how I'm going to do them.

763
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.820
I'm gonna make fun of how people ask me questions.

764
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:33.330
I'm going to shit on their lives because I'm not happy with my own on some

765
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:36.780
fucked up level. Oh fuck. Seven 55 I only to fish.

766
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.430
What kind of fish? And I think it's called Talia, I don't know.

767
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.720
Get some lemon zest on it or some, I don't know what the fuck it is.

768
00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.950
I'm eating like a, an Asian and a communist country.

769
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.910
People are in great goddamn shape. And last time you saw a fat Asian, honestly,

770
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.650
the only time you get to see a fat Asian,

771
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.320
they hanging out with other white people and they're walking out of McDonald's.

772
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:03.310
So if anybody Asian is listening, stop hanging out with us because uh, you know,

773
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.160
nine out of 10 of us are going to a fucking cuckoo room. Um,

774
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.010
all right. Uh, okay. This brings me to my question. Here's this guy.

775
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:14.844
What is this?

776
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
What is your worst slash funniest experience in dealing with the comedy club

777
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.920
owner? Also?

778
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.190
Have you ever broken the news to a comedian that he just isn't that funny,

779
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:32.050
if not, how often you want to? That's a great question.

780
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.060
Um, as far as the club owners, the worst and funniest experiences, too many,

781
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.340
too many of them. Uh,

782
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:44.320
the most recently is I worked for this psycho up in Seattle who, uh,

783
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.970
he brings me into town. He's going to pay me a disgusting amount of money,

784
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:49.870
right?

785
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.870
So I need to sell tickets and this guy doesn't advertise the show at all,

786
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.380
so I don't sell any tickets.

787
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.660
So then he yells at my management company, you know, I mean,

788
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.400
w even if you had Jesus Christ playing at your club,

789
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:10.951
you, you know, you,

790
00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:15.480
you couldn't just put his name out on the marquee and have somebody would,

791
00:48:15.481 --> 00:48:15.701
you know,

792
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:18.730
you'd at least have to have somebody with the fucking sandwich board walking up

793
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:22.360
and down the street to let you know that the son of God is down the street.

794
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.800
Jesus Christ would have a difficult time selling out a club without advertising.

795
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.040
He'd have to be doing miracles on the corner,

796
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:35.041
like one of those fucking dated blame guys hanging upside down in a cube of ice

797
00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:37.720
or some shit trying to get people to come down there. Okay,

798
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:41.590
that's the son of God. That's what he would have to do. Okay,

799
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.790
now you're talking about little old me. Right? But thank God this guy,

800
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:49.090
Marty reamer up there put me on the radio and then we sold a bunch of tickets

801
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:50.770
and then the guy, you know,

802
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.830
he does like a one 80 and all of a sudden he loves me and he's one of these

803
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:56.590
guys. He's such a psycho. I don't even care if he fucking,

804
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.780
here's this because he's a psycho and psychos have, they don't,

805
00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:04.760
they don't remember anything. He'll be mad, you know,

806
00:49:04.761 --> 00:49:09.490
throw a stapler at his assistant that he's underpaying and then he'll come to

807
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:12.280
like when David banner comes back from being the hall can,

808
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.950
you won't even remember that I said this shit. All right.

809
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.510
So if you are listening all that shit you said to my management company got back

810
00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:23.830
to me. Okay. Fucking fucking psycho.

811
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.620
Get to psycho. You get a comb over to God. Those are the worst.

812
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:31.030
Who Do you think you're fooling? Um, all right.

813
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.600
Oh, the only one. Have you ever broken the news to a comedian that he just,

814
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:38.920
isn't that funny? If not, how often do you want to, I'll tell you right now,

815
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:43.870
I would never do that to somebody. I would never do that to somebody.

816
00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:47.920
I, uh, I don't think somebody is funny. I just a,

817
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:52.921
I keep it to myself because there's been a lot of people who really sucked for a

818
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:59.560
long time and then all of a sudden they figure out how to be funny. And,

819
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.030
uh, I dunno. I look at everybody like they like me. When I started out,

820
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.130
I didn't, when I started out, I had no confidence and uh,

821
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.250
you know, I if one person,

822
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.000
if some established comedian came up to me and said that they didn't wait a

823
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.870
minute, somebody did that, somebody did come up to me.

824
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.610
That's right. It is Vietnam comedy flashback.

825
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.970
I was working in the comedy connection in Boston,

826
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:33.470
Massachusetts is how long ago it was, I had a big Red Afro.

827
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.730
I was wearing a striped shirt with a vest.

828
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.170
Remember in the mid nineties he's right as grunge was starting to die,

829
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:45.890
but it was before in sync and the boy band thing,

830
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:49.610
it's sorta ray of red around like the sublime era

831
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.130
and that people like for half a second we're women's vests.

832
00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.160
It's just one of those things.

833
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:03.980
It's like when black people try to make a pink that color,

834
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.400
remember they was like thugs were wearing painful like a week and a half.

835
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.380
I remember seeing that thinking if black people pull this off, that that's it.

836
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.220
That's the game set match. There was nothing that they cannot make cool.

837
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:21.550
And that shit went away real quick while the white version of that was best.

838
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.400
Okay. I know a lot of people fucking laughing at you,

839
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:30.260
but if there's other people my age out, they are late 30 [inaudible] to 40.

840
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:35.060
You remember it, you had it on and uh, you know,

841
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.460
it's right after doc Martins. It was the bridge, the vests. All right,

842
00:51:39.461 --> 00:51:43.670
get to the fucking point of the story. Jesus Christ. All right. So anyways,

843
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:44.780
so that's what I'm wearing.

844
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:49.700
I go onstage and I kill and I get off stage.

845
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And then this other comedian comes up and he's like,

846
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.180
he's a redhead too, but he's like 60 years old.

847
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:05.080
He's basically me in 40 years at the time when he came up to me and uh,

848
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.950
and he just came up to me and he just like, you know, you know what I mean?

849
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.480
You need to set up there then it was all bullshit. You know, you just have to,

850
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.520
you're jumping around and blah, blah, blah. Any just shit all over my act.

851
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:20.841
You know,

852
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:24.050
you ever watch the discovery channel with some sort of fucking Willdabeast

853
00:52:24.051 --> 00:52:28.350
trying to market territory. That's what he did to my act. And uh,

854
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:32.940
everything he was saying was like a punch through my chest,

855
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.830
pass my heart and into my soul. And uh,

856
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:41.030
it was fucking brutal. And I still had a day job,

857
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.320
so I had to go back to work for like three days before my next show.

858
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.550
And all I'm hearing in my head is this guy's voice telling me that I suck.

859
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.180
And like back then I had such little confidence,

860
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:58.040
I just took what anybody said to me as law. So if they said I sucked,

861
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.310
then I sucked. I didn't have the brains to be like, well,

862
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:05.450
it's just an old bitter comic. He used to be a young red head and now you know,

863
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.930
is not so young anymore. And uh, you know,

864
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:12.560
he's a little drunk and he's being a Douche. This has nothing to do with me.

865
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:15.500
I didn't know how to do that back then. I was like, oh my God,

866
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.010
somebody with TV credits thinks I suck,

867
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.230
so therefore I must suck. So whatever fast forward.

868
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.030
And that's why I'd never do it to somebody. I would never do that.

869
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.220
I would want to make somebody feel like that. Now if you heckle me, you know,

870
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.750
all bets are off. I don't give a shit.

871
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.170
I wants to make you a just short of suicidal.

872
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.160
I'm sure that's Kinda childish. But, uh, that's it.

873
00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:44.580
So to answer your question now, I don't say that and uh,

874
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.740
I gotta be honest with you. I hate watching people bond unless it's my friends.

875
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.610
If it's a friend of mine and who's funny and I watched him go up there and try a

876
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:54.444
new joke,

877
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.490
especially if it's a high energy joke and they end with this big Ted dye look on

878
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:01.070
their face and they get nothing.

879
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:06.470
I can tell you that nothing makes a comedian civilian version of that is

880
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:10.140
watching a good friend dios fall down a flight of stairs.

881
00:54:10.141 --> 00:54:11.340
I mean it's just fucking hilarious.

882
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:15.450
No matter even if they dislocate their shoulder or whatever, you know,

883
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:17.700
at some point as you're driving them to the hospital,

884
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:23.120
you're going to have to turn and look out the driver's side window and you got

885
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.470
to kind of laugh. You know this, you know, you do it subtly cause you like him.

886
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.180
He's your friends, right? Jesus Christ.

887
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.660
Cause I take longer to answer a fucking question. Was trying to get quicker.

888
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.220
Uh, where do we go here? What do we got next? What do we get next?

889
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.020
I'll answer a couple more of these. All right. Um,

890
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:49.470
what's your most embarrassing moment on stage or in life? Jesus Christ.

891
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.990
I don't know. I block them out at this point.

892
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.840
Had somebody throw a dinner roll at me. Does that count?

893
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.580
That dental floss thrown at me? If you look on my website, I get fucking,

894
00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.920
somebody threw a doughnut at me. I mean, I don't know.

895
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.070
Somebody stole an ice had me a I, you know, I probably,

896
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.440
the first time I bombed in front of an all black crowd,

897
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:15.450
maybe that was the fucking, that was the worst vomit in front of a white crowd.

898
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.270
Sucks enough. But like you just feel like you suck.

899
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:21.730
But when you bomb and you're the only white guy in the room when you bomb and

900
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:26.580
you really feel like you're bombing for the entire white race and you're also

901
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:30.840
reinforcing the stereotype that white people aren't funny.

902
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:35.220
And it was just the worst. And I was standing up there first joke bombed.

903
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.010
I ran to the second joke, the next joke bombed.

904
00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:41.430
At this point I have like dry mouth,

905
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.810
like I can't even explain it. Just, you know, when like concrete,

906
00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.840
I don't know when it gets so dry you can,

907
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.540
you can break it off and it seems that, you know that little powdered mis.

908
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.750
Just imagine if you just took a whole handful of that and stuck it in your

909
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.080
mouth.

910
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.820
That's how dry my mouth was and for some reason no one was heckling.

911
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.830
They would just sort of sitting there just looking around is that the show

912
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:06.900
hadn't even started, which had had been,

913
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:12.100
it'd been going great for like an hour and I went into my third joke in total

914
00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:18.270
panic mode, trapped in my act, just mobile on Blah Blah,

915
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:18.870
blah,

916
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:23.870
blabbing on and then all of a sudden in the back is big black girl is,

917
00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.770
she don't want those voices. She didn't, she wasn't even saying it loud,

918
00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:29.860
but it was just the hot summer day and it just carried throughout the club.

919
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.640
As I'm up there babbling on in dead silence,

920
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.390
I just tear her clear as day. Just go.

921
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:42.610
I ain't last yet. And the whole place just started laughing.

922
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:48.870
It was like a whole nother show was going on while I was still up there in my

923
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:50.410
act and I was so green.

924
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:53.470
I didn't know what to do when I should have done was addresses, but I didn't.

925
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:58.570
I continued doing my act, which made them laugh at me even more. It was,

926
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.910
it was absolutely humiliating, but I got to admit,

927
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.230
I didn't really think about it until you ask me that fucking question.

928
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:10.231
So either I'm over it or I'm just a complete denial.

929
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.690
Okay. Why are you still single? Uh,

930
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.670
cause I'm a psycho and if you don't know that,

931
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:22.580
listen to my podcast, listen to this one. Right? Fine.

932
00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:27.790
I keep forgetting to take the god damn fish up. Um, anyways. All right.

933
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:32.650
I think it's time for me to eat like an Asian in a communist country.

934
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.130
I tell him, if you want to get shredded, man, that's what I'm telling you, man.

935
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:40.130
You don't want to fucking fuck all these stupid other diets. What are they? That

936
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.890
the South Beach, Manhattan beach, it's always like a beach, right?

937
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.100
All that bullshit. You don't need to do that. That's what you do.

938
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:53.130
You eat like somebody in Asia just squatting down on the side of the road and

939
00:57:54.581 --> 00:57:58.940
some zen like no, those Buddhist monks, you know, you ever seen a fat monkey?

940
00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.480
You just don't see it. A Buddhist monk. Okay.

941
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:04.720
But you got those friar tuck white ones. They're fat man. It's just,

942
00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:07.220
I don't know what it is. It sits.

943
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.980
We got that double cheeseburger thing going on, you know, but, uh,

944
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:15.250
I don't know. I, you know what,

945
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.170
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about this point. All right,

946
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:19.020
so I'm going to wrap this up. Uh,

947
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:23.800
I want to thank everybody who listened to and called into the uninformed show.

948
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:28.930
Uh, the, the radio show I do with Joe to Rosa and uh, that's quickly to come.

949
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.060
And one of the most fun things that I do here. And, uh,

950
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.790
in the entertainment world, we did our Halloween show. And real quick,

951
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:38.110
so we had on a, uh,

952
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:43.120
a real live witch and a couple of people from the Church of Satan,

953
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.380
cause we wanted to learn about that shit. And I get, it was unbelievable.

954
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:50.600
They were the most boring fucking people I've ever seen.

955
00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.470
People in the Church of Satan evidently don't believe in the devil there.

956
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.010
They just don't like, Nah,

957
00:58:57.011 --> 00:59:00.940
the Church of Satan is just giving into the desires you want to be and do.

958
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:05.670
And Yeah. You know, I stop at Red Lights and a,

959
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:10.540
I yield to pedestrians. It was the most excruciating hour of radio.

960
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:15.280
I think I've ever done flats. But we did have the drum battle.

961
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.110
Me and Joe de Rosa go to uninformed radio.com.

962
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:22.040
Later on this week we have the, uh,

963
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:27.041
the video up Joe one the plane through the song part and I won the freestyle so

964
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:31.820
you can vote and see which one of us is better. You know, it's,

965
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:35.660
I know it's kind of fucking gay, but we had a good time. Um, so that's it.

966
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:40.690
I'm going to be in Las Vegas on November 17th doing Ed sees as palace.

967
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:46.970
Jeez, it's so beautiful in here, isn't it? I wish I had a toga.

968
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.680
Fuck it. Hey Casinos, they have the ugliest goddamn rugs. I mean,

969
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:57.350
this what they must pay per square footage for a casino rug. It's just fucking,

970
00:59:57.351 --> 01:00:00.910
it's mind boggling how ugly it is. You know?

971
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.580
Got the Vidya drink it.

972
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.730
Why didn't I buy those myths to help you take a hot plate out and you guys won't

973
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:10.070
listen to me to take a hot plate out with a couple of districts.

974
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.200
Maybe I could burn myself in the fucking podcast and see if this thing is don't

975
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.860
fuck out.

976
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.290
This shit done. You know what the worst thing about cooking a white fish?

977
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.060
You have no fucking idea when it's done. All right.

978
01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:29.490
You know what?

979
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.500
I think I'm really trashing white people on this made fun of Asians a little

980
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:38.060
bit. I'm talking about how fucking fat white people are and uh,

981
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:42.650
wait a second. Is that done? Oh Shit. That's gone. Look at that. Oh,

982
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:46.550
would you look at that? If I was emerald right now, Emeril Lagasse,

983
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:47.630
I would fucking,

984
01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:53.540
I would take some chocolate chips and throw them on top and go Bam and start

985
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:57.550
screaming just to get the crowd going. I fucking hate that show. All right.

986
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.060
If you want to watch Emma Lugosi,

987
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.540
you watched the essence of the animal because then he's just sitting there

988
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:07.250
cooking. If you watch Emeril live or whatever his show is to do,

989
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:12.620
he, he's like, he's got to entertain people. Once you have a studio audience,

990
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.870
do you ever notice that? Then all of a sudden you just got to dumb it down.

991
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.350
You can't cook anymore. Now you gotta be like, I got some shirts.

992
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.890
Everybody starts applauding. Like they can't afford it. They know it's sugar.

993
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.140
Okay? You get it for free at a diner, right? You're not kicking it up a notch.

994
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.240
You making people or,

995
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.030
and you contributing to the diabetes and this goddamn country. All right Emma.

996
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:39.030
So why don't you fucking take it down a few notches. And uh,

997
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.570
what about the musicians? He actually has musicians on that show. Jesus Christ.

998
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.080
And you know, when you start out to be a musician, you think, you know, I dunno,

999
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.350
you're gonna fucking play arenas. Well, if you're going to do the TV thing,

1000
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:54.760
maybe you'll be in the Conan band or the tonight show band.

1001
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:55.910
You really don't think you're going to be

1002
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.430
playing your flute while, you know,

1003
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:04.070
in between some guy teaching somebody how to make Lasagna.

1004
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.270
Why did you make me feel better about myself and my career? Anyways, that's it.

1005
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:12.920
Go to bill [inaudible] at Broadway, video.com for the tickets. Uh,

1006
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.980
please come out to the show. I've got a lot of new stuff.

1007
01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:19.860
I haven't been in New York for minutes and uh, come on down.

1008
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.290
Seven 45 November 10th. Come down an hour early.

1009
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:29.070
I will make you laugh. That is what I do. So that's it guys. All right,

1010
01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:31.950
keep the questions, comment. Oh wait a minute.

1011
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:35.190
Congratulations to the Boston red sox. We wanted again.

1012
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.170
And uh,

1013
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:42.120
I want to apologize to every other team in the league that isn't the red sox or

1014
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:45.300
the Yankees, cause that's all that ESPN seems to talk about. I mean,

1015
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:46.740
it's ridiculous. I mean,

1016
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:50.550
we won it last night and I just sit through 20 minutes of shit of what that

1017
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:52.830
means to the Goddamn Yankees. Who gives a fuck?

1018
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.440
What does it mean to the Indians? What does it mean to the angels?

1019
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:57.870
What does it mean to fucking other people out? They don't count.

1020
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:02.970
They don't count. You know, that's how ESPN treats the rest of the league.

1021
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They treat the red sox and the Yankees like they're,

1022
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.690
they're real kids and they street treat everybody else like stepchildren.

1023
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:16.620
It's like you ever see that family that adopted those kids and they kept the

1024
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:21.540
check and they didn't feed the kids and they said they're regular kids.

1025
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.930
You know, if ESPN adopted children, that that's what they do.

1026
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.050
Doesn't even fucking make sense. My Broccoli's all soggy.

1027
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.100
Is there anything worse than that? Now, when you do that,

1028
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:38.640
what you've done is you boiled all the new nutrients out of it.

1029
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.800
So what I'm doing here is I'm just eating clean, soggy shit. Oh,

1030
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.760
that's disgusting. The fish is great though. Fish is great. All right.

1031
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:50.520
There's a lesson for you. Never Seen Broccoli when you're doing a podcast.

1032
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:54.330
All right. Come on down to my taping. If you can't make that come out to Vegas,

1033
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.970
you can't make that. I'll probably end up in your area.

1034
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.230
Please send me more questions.

1035
01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:01.660
Thank you everybody for listening and giving a shit about me.

1036
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.800
<v 6>What I do means a lot to me. Have a great week. Alright guys. Thank you.</v>
