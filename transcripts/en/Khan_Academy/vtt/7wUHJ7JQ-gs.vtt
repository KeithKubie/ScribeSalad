00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome back.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm just continuing on with
hopefully giving you, one, how

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.660
to actually solve indefinite
integrals and also giving you a

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.950
sense of why you solve
it the way you do.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.150
And I think that's often
missing in some textbooks.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.780
But anyway, let's say that this
is the distance and let me give

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.250
you a formula, actually, for
the distance, just for fun.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.200
Oh, my phone is ringing.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.590
Let me lower the volume,
because you're more important.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.610
So, let's say that the
distance, s -- this time I'll

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.845
write it as a function -- let's
say the distance is -- I said

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:40.220
it started at five, so let's
say it's 2t -- let's say this

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.440
is actually a cubic function.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.290
You're not only accelerating,
your rate of acceleration

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.970
is increasing.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.300
I think, actually, the rate
of acceleration, if I'm not

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.340
mistaken, is actually called
jerk, but I might have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.330
to Wikipedia that.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.690
Let's say its 2t to
the third plus 5.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.980
And let's say I wanted to know
how far I travel between t

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:17.540
equals 2 seconds and
t equals 5 seconds.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.100
Right?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.130
I'm not looking for the total
distance I've traveled.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.570
I just want to know how far do
I travel between time equals 2

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.790
seconds and time
equal 5 seconds.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.040
Right?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.610
So this might be
2 and this is 5.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.082
So an easy way to do that is
I could just evaluate this

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:36.920
function at t equals 5 -- let
me use a different color.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.750
I think it's getting messy --
I could just evaluate this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.910
function at t equals 5.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.200
If t equals 5, 5 to the third
power is 125, 250, it's 255,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.640
so the object has gone 255
feet at t equals 5, right?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.070
And then, at time equals 2,
the object has gone how far?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.110
2 to the third is 8.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.550
16.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.180
It's gone 21 feet.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.590
Right?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.450
To figure out how far I
travelled between time equals 2

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.720
and time equals 5, I just say s
of 5 minus s of 2, right?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.825
How far did I go after 5
seconds minus how far I

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:24.000
already was after 2 seconds.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.520
And this is just 255 minus
21 and that's, what, 234.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.480
234 feet is how far I
travelled between 2

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.070
seconds and 5 seconds.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.040
Interesting.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.950
And I think you're starting to
get a little intuition about

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.420
why we evaluated that previous
indefinite integral in the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.120
previous video the way we did.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.820
So let's actually draw the
derivative of this function.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.220
So what's the derivative?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.950
So let me just call
that v of t, I guess.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.690
v of t is just the derivative,
right, because it's the rate

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.420
of change of distance
with respect to time.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.530
3 times 2 is 6t squared and the
constant disappears, right?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.010
So it's just 6t squared.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.140
And that makes sense, right?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.010
Because your velocity doesn't
care about where you

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.500
started off from, right?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.210
You're going to be the same
velocity if you started

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.010
from 10 feet or if you
started from 2 feet.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.520
Your velocity doesn't really
matter about where your

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.710
starting position is.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.420
So let's graph this.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.570
See?

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.250
You're actually learning
a little physics while

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.310
you're learning calculus.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.800
Actually, I think it's silly
that they're taught as

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.630
two separate classes.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.060
I think physics and calculus
should just be one

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.960
fun 2-hour class.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.330
But I'll talk about
that at another time.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.100
So, going back to this.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.730
Let me graph that.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.090
6t squared.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.120
Well, that's just going
to look like a parabola.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.110
Right?

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.440
It's going to look
something like this.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.970
This is t.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.090
This is the velocity.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.990
And now, if we just had this
velocity graph, if we didn't

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.320
know all of this over
here and I asked you the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.070
same question, though.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.370
I said, how far does this
thing travel between 2

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.420
seconds and 5 seconds?

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.815
Right?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.990
Well, I could do it the way
that we learned in the previous

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.230
video where I draw a bunch of
small rectangles, each of a

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.530
really small width, and I
multiply it times its

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.565
instantaneous velocity at
that exact moment, right?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.350
And then I sum up all of those
rectangles -- look how pretty

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.350
that is -- I sum up all
of the rectangles.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.930
And I'll get a pretty good
approximation for how far

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.850
I've travelled between
2 and 5 seconds.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.070
Because remember, the area of
each of these rectangles

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.960
represents how far I
traveled in that little

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960
amount of time, dt.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.310
Because time times a constant
velocity is equal to distance.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:17.480
But as you can see this also
tells me the area between

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.130
t equals 2 and t equals 5.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.440
So, not only did I figure out
the distance between how far I

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.280
traveled from 2 seconds to 5
seconds, I also figured out the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.060
area under this curve from
2 seconds to 5 seconds.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.580
So, interestingly enough, if I
just changed this from a to b,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.920
and, in general, if you want to
figure out the area under a

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:51.680
curve from a to b, it's just
the indefinite integral from a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.790
to b -- actually, from b to a.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.650
The b should be the larger one.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.920
b to a.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.090
I guess a to b, depending
on how you say it.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.360
Let me write that in a
different color because I

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.100
think I'm making it messier.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.950
From a to b of this
velocity function.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.460
So, in this case, 6t
squared d t, right?

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.200
If these weren't 2 and 5,
if this was just a and b.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.370
And the way you evaluate this
is you figure out the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.760
antiderivative of this inside
function, and then you evaluate

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.010
the antiderivative at b,
and then from that, you

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.040
subtract it out at a.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.590
So in this case, the
antiderivative of this is 2t to

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.900
the third and we evaluated at
b, and we evaluated at a.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.770
Actually, let me stick
to the old numbers.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.510
We evaluated it at 5 and
you evaluated it at 2.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.240
So if you evaluated
it at 5, that's 255.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.750
If you evaluate it
at 2, that's 21.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.020
So you're doing the exact same
thing we did here when we

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.480
actually had this graph.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.560
So I did all of this, not to
confuse you further, but really

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.580
just to give you an intuition
of why one, why the

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.290
antiderivative is the area
under the curve, and then two,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:21.390
why-- let's say that a, b-- and
then why we evaluate

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.560
it this way.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.950
You might see this
in your books.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.560
This is just saying, if I want
to figure out the area under a

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.820
curve from a to b of f of
x, that we figure out

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.600
the antiderivative.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.660
This capital F is just
the antiderivative.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.740
We just figure out the
antiderivative and we evaluated

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.940
at b and we evaluated at a, and
then we subtract

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.540
the difference.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.680
And that's what we
did here, right?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.150
This is what we did here
intuitively when we

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.110
worked with distance.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.220
The derivative and the
antiderivative don't only apply

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.020
to distance and velocity.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.870
But I did this to give you an
intuition of why this works

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.690
and why the antiderivative
is the area under a curve.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.710
So let me clear this up and
just rewrite that last thing

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.490
I wrote, but maybe a
little bit cleaner.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.650
OK.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.380
So let's say that F of x with a
big, fat capital F is equal to

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.440
-- actually, let me do it a
better way -- let me say that

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.930
the derivative of big fat F
of x is equal to f of x.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.200
Right?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.920
I think, actually, this is the
fundamental theorem of

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.450
calculus, but I don't want to
throw out things without

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:43.920
knowing for sure.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.170
I have to go make sure.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.770
See, I haven't done
math in a long time.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.230
I'm giving you all this based
on intuition, not necessarily

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.400
what I'm reading.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.020
So the derivative of big F is
small f, and all we're saying

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:06.470
is that if we take the integral
of small f of x from a to b,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:13.480
dx, that this is big F, it's
antiderivative, at b minus

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.320
the antiderivative at a.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.190
In the next presentation,
I'll use this.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.846
This is actually pretty easy
to use once you know how

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:20.580
to use antiderivatives.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.990
And we did these three videos
really just to give you -- or

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.165
actually, is this the third or
the second -- just to give you

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:28.720
an intuition of why this is,
because I think that's really

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.830
important if you're ever going
to really use calculus in your

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.160
life or write a computer
program or whatever.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.280
And in the next couple videos
I'll actually apply this to a

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.640
bunch of problems and you'll
hopefully see that it's a

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.860
pretty straightforward
thing to actually compute.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.880
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
