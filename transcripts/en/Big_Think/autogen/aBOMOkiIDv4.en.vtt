decisions before they really need to and
 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
decisions before they really need to and
it's<00:04:04.380><c> a</c><00:04:04.770><c> strange</c><00:04:05.130><c> -</c><00:04:06.060><c> strange</c><00:04:06.090><c> thing</c><00:04:06.540><c> so</c><00:04:06.720><c> I</c><00:04:06.750><c> did</c>

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 align:start position:0%
it's a strange - strange thing so I did
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.290 align:start position:0%
it's a strange - strange thing so I did
that<00:04:07.350><c> a</c><00:04:07.380><c> bit</c><00:04:07.650><c> too</c><00:04:07.920><c> and</c><00:04:08.190><c> then</c><00:04:08.370><c> you</c><00:04:09.060><c> know</c><00:04:09.180><c> the</c>

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
that a bit too and then you know the
 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.030 align:start position:0%
that a bit too and then you know the
older<00:04:09.510><c> you</c><00:04:09.600><c> get</c><00:04:09.720><c> realized</c><00:04:10.380><c> the</c><00:04:10.500><c> less</c><00:04:10.680><c> you</c><00:04:10.890><c> know</c>

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
older you get realized the less you know
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.660 align:start position:0%
older you get realized the less you know
and<00:04:11.250><c> you</c><00:04:11.340><c> know</c><00:04:11.489><c> some</c><00:04:11.760><c> things</c><00:04:12.060><c> and</c><00:04:12.380><c> I</c><00:04:13.520><c> guess</c><00:04:14.520><c> the</c>

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 align:start position:0%
and you know some things and I guess the
 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.420 align:start position:0%
and you know some things and I guess the
key<00:04:14.820><c> thing</c><00:04:15.030><c> is</c><00:04:15.150><c> to</c><00:04:15.709><c> don't</c><00:04:16.709><c> make</c><00:04:16.799><c> a</c><00:04:16.859><c> decision</c><00:04:17.310><c> on</c>

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
key thing is to don't make a decision on
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.610 align:start position:0%
key thing is to don't make a decision on
