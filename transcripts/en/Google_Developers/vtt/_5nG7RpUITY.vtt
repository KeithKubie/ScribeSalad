DAVID GLAZER: All right,
good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.295
Welcome to first session of day
two of Google I/O. Hope

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.340
everyone had a great
day, yesterday.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.840
We're going to spend
most of our time

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.060
answering your questions.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.030
There are two microphones in
the aisle, and as there are

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.200
people queued up the
microphones, you guys get

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.790
precedence over just about
anything that we would want to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.830
say because we're here
to chat with you.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.410
We're sitting down and we don't
have slides because this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.490
is meant to be a conversation.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.440
I want to start off with a
little bit of introductions,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.570
both ways, so I'm going to ask
the folks who are sitting up

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.855
here with me to give you a
little bit of information

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:41.940
about who they are, and what
their areas are, and the kinds

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
of questions they are best
able and best capable to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690
answer from you all.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.160
I'm going to ask you, as an
audience, a couple of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.440
questions, show of hands kind of
things, just to get a sense

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470
of who's who here.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.570
But at any point, feel free to
step up to the mics and we'll

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.410
jump in once we get
through that.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.650
So I'll start.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.550
I'm David Glazer.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.400
I'm the Director of Engineering

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.080
for the Google+ platform.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.290
We're the team that's
responsible for connecting

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.960
what people do on Google and in
Google+ with what they do

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.890
everywhere else, on all
the apps, all the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.910
sites, that they visit.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.250
And we can go deeper into
any part of that as

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.120
you want, later on.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.200
I've been at Google for about
seven years, now, so I've

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.430
worked on different projects and
different teams at Google,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.680
and this is one of
the fun ones.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.580
So why don't we start
at that end.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.426
Jen, you wanna introduce
yourself.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.080
JENNIFER LIN: Hi, I'm
Jennifer Lin.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.330
I'm an Eng Manager on the
Google+ platform team.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.480
I specifically work on building
Android and iOS

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.140
libraries for you guys,
so you could connect

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.610
users to Google+ Sign-In.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.200
And I also work on offering
you guys REST APIs.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.630
I've been at Google for six
years, and this is the second

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.842
team I've been on.

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:52.880
VIC FRYZEL: Hi, everyone.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.720
Thank you for coming.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.420
My name is Vic Fryzel.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.190
I lead developer relations for
Google+ and Google Apps.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.980
I've worked at Google for
almost four years now.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.840
My team is generally responsible
for delivering a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.830
good developer experience
from end-to-end.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.669
So when you first decide to
adopt Google+ and integrate,

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.770
all the way out of launching
your application in production

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.720
and then maintaining
it over time.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.540
So we're responsible for things
like the documentation,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.740
and the samples.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.800
We work with a lot of you in a
one-on-one capacity, in which

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.570
your integration requires
some special attention.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.340
But really, we're focused on
making your integration as

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.076
simple as possible.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:28.100
CHEE CHEW: Hi, I'm Chee.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.960
I manage the engineering
team for Hangouts.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.910
So prior to yesterday, people
understood that to be the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.070
video chatting system.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.110
And now we've expanded that to
include the new app that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.010
includes text messaging and
media, all up through video.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.730
SANDY JEN: Hi, I'm Sandy Jen.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.810
I came to Google less than a
year ago through the Meebo

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.280
acquisition.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.710
I was one of the founders,
with Seth here.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.350
I am an Eng Manager on
the publisher side.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.660
So all the publisher offerings
to help gain audience and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.354
eyeballs to your apps and sites,
my team takes control.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.530
SETH STERNBERG: Hi
there, I'm Seth.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.380
So, like Sandy said, I also
joined just under a year ago

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.070
with Meebo acquisition.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.840
So I'm David's counterpart.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.770
I run product for the
Google+ platform.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.970
I'm-- just one quick second on
the Google+ platform, for

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.950
those who missed it yesterday.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.990
Like David said, the goal is
to make it really easy for

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.350
users to bring the best of their
Google experience with

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.580
them to the rest of
the internet.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.060
So when they're on a given
site-- like a couple days ago

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.400
we launched with Forbes--

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.000
they can see recommended content
as they're scrolling

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.340
through articles in Forbes,
and see really interesting

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.480
other articles that they
might want to see.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.790
Or, because we know they have
an Android phone, if they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.520
connect with a website of yours,
and they say hey, I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.300
want to go ahead and sign in
with Google+ Sign-in Then we

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.050
say, would you like the Android
app, too, right?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.310
So great for the users
for app discovery.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.500
Great for all of you because
it drives more Android

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.550
installs, where you tend to
have more engaged traffic.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.540
So the goal for users is bring
Google with them to the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.305
internet and then best
of their internet

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:07.490
experience back to Google.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.020
Talk about specifics later
on in this session.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.510
At the same time, for you guys,
all the product that

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.860
we're putting out should
drive you.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.200
There are more unique users,
more engaged users, right,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.469
which means more page views,
or create a completely

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:25.020
seamless experience between
mobile and desktop.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.810
We should make it so that you
form a relationship with your

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.910
user and your service.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.630
Not your user, and your service,
and a device, which

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.100
is just too complicated.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.860
So I'm sure we'll get to talk
more about that to you.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.185
DAVID GLAZER: I'm okay
with the mic.

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:38.660
OK.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.370
Yeah.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.280
All right.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.660
So that's us.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.510
Let me get to know you guys
a little bit better.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.090
In no particular order, I'm
trying to get a sense of how

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.220
much you have already, or are
interested, in using different

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.150
parts or different features
of our platform.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.350
So let me start with how many of
you manage a Google+ page?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.560
That's a large fraction of the
audience, that's interesting.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.880
How many of you have
written nontrivial

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.700
code in the last year?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.400
OK.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.660
How about in the last decade?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.290
My hand goes up in the
last decade, but

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.310
not in the last year.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.710
OK.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.710
Of the people who've written
code, how many of you have

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.850
written web code?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.550
Whether back end, front
end, something that's

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.160
backing a web page?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.830
OK.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.670
How about Android code?

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.844
iOS code?

00:05:30.844 --> 00:05:31.660
OK.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.700
That's a good mix of
all the above.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.290
I happened to ask them in the
order hands got a little bit

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.510
smaller for each of those
questions, but a good mix of

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.350
all of the above.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.000
How many of you have put a
Google+ widget on a website?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.160
Probably a +1 button because
it's the one that's been up

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.740
the longest.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.880
All right.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.570
How many of you have integrated
Google+ sign-in

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.905
into something?

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:52.590
All right.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.030
We've got somewhere between
10 and 20 hands

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.070
went up for that one.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.910
How many of you--

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.180
OK, so now I'm going
to look forward.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.170
How many of you think that over
the next year you will be

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.340
integrating Google+ sign-in into
something you're doing?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.490
About three times as many
hands as before.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.980
All right.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.900
That's useful.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.930
Hangouts.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.730
How many of you have been in
a Hangout in the last week?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.610
OK.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.680
How many of you have used
an app in a Hangout?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.390
How many of you have used
an app other than a

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.050
mustache in a Hangout?

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.590
How many of you have built
a Hangout app?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.840
OK, that's about seven
or so, like there.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.460
All right, that's great,
that's useful.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.210
I'm very happy to see that mix
of things because there's a

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.770
I'm seeing a fair amount of
interest in all of the

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.030
different things that we all can
help answer questions on.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.640
I invite you guys
up to the mic.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.666
I'll ask questions if you don't,
but mine are going to

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.260
be softballs, all right.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.890
If you want the hard questions,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.530
you need to ask them.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.665
So come on up.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:04.140
Oh, great.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.390
Yeah.

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.592
AUDIENCE: When Google+ started,
it was seen by some

00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:14.580
as blogging service, by some
as something unknown.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.610
Then it was clear it's
not a blogging

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.030
service, something more.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.860
It moved in public cognition
to something more like

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.890
Pinterest, or something
like that.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.670
How do you want to see Google+'s
identity in the eyes

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.740
of your users, in
the long term?

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.620
What's the, if not arrival
point, but the reasonable

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.800
milestone in terms
of what it is?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.490
How you define it?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.676
DAVID GLAZER: Yes.

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:39.250
That's a good question.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.615
I'll take a first crack at
it, but anyone else who

00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:43.160
wants to jump in--

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.630
I think the way to understand
Google+ from Google's point of

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.640
view is there happens to be a
product at plus.google.com,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.980
and on the mobile apps.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.320
It's a great product.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.350
It's a very important product,
and it's not the main point.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.960
What Google+ really is is it's
a way for Google to get to

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.410
know our users.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.460
It's a way for Google to have
a relationship with people,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.990
where we know something about
who our users are.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.990
We know something about who
they're in relationships with,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.720
who else they care about, and
we give them a way to share

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.740
with other users, and with
people that they know, or

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.230
people that they might
want to know.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.860
And that layer, that spine,
that backbone, really is

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.710
designed to make all
of Google better.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.180
Can Search be better,
if we knew you were?

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.120
Could Maps be better,
if we knew we were?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.860
Well, if you saw the keynote
yesterday, you know the answer

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.650
to both of those is yes.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.210
Could YouTube be better,
if we know who you are?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.059
Could Docs be better, if
we know who you are?

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.120
Could Gmail be better, if we
knew more about the ways you

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.409
connect with other people?

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.260
We already, obviously,
know who you are.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:51.070
That's the real point of
Google+, is to allow that

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.670
notion of who people
are as people.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.500
To be available across
all of Google.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.640
And then, with this team,
to also be available for

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.380
everything else that
you do online.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.500
Within that, all of the
hypotheses you tossed out--

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.230
the answer is yes.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.280
Is it useful for a blogging
service to

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.110
know who people are?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.730
Of course.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.910
Is it useful for a content
discovering and curation

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.110
system to know who people and
who they're connected to?

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.810
Yes.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.055
Is it useful for a conversation
system to know

00:09:19.055 --> 00:09:20.840
who people are and what
they care about?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.750
Yes.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.930
So all those end up
being important

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.390
features of "who are you".

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.530
Anyone?

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.680
SETH STERNBERG: Let me give you
a couple of examples to

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.026
bring some of those
points, because I

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:31.780
think it's pretty important.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.530
So, if you think about Hangouts,
and what we were

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.130
talking about with Hangouts and
what Chee and team built,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.210
just very recently.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.300
Hangouts, if you think
about it, are--

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.630
it's a social piece
of Google, right,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.840
that's woven into Gmail.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.520
That's woven into
plus.google.com.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.760
You'll see that across
properties, right, to make it

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.090
really easy for users to
communicate with each other

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.210
live across various
Google properties.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.260
If you think about what's
happened with Google+ sign-in,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.910
and how an application can write
app activities that a

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.620
user's taking.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.350
So, for example, TuneIn, writing
to Google, hey, here

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.150
are the music stations
that our users are

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.910
listening to in TuneIn.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.530
And then we take those, and we
aggregate them anonymously,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.070
and we put them into Search.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.020
So when someone does a search
for TuneIn, they can see what

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.620
actual people are doing inside
that app at Search, and have

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.550
more context before they
ever go there.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.980
And then when they click on
that radio station that

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.320
interests them because they can
see what's hot in TuneIn

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.590
right now, they're a very
qualified user that's heading

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.360
over to that particular
property, in that case TuneIn.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.930
Or when someone sends an
interactive post, right.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.390
So this is based on, obviously,
we know who you are

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.300
inside a given application,
like at OpenTable.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.580
We know you want to send
something to a friend of

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.910
yours, and if you write your
friend's name, then that post

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.820
goes through all Google
properties, right, because it

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.110
hits the notifier, which appears
in Search, and in

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.750
YouTube, and it goes on the
stream inside Google+.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.880
So like David said, all of the
features, if you really break

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.430
it down, right, they're about
connecting a user seamlessly

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.950
across all Google properties
with who they are and who

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.386
their friends are.

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:14.090
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.210
Just, maybe to follow up.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:20.040
My question is not how Google
sees the Google+, but how you

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.990
want the users to see it.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.680
And, so far, I don't hear
anything specific, so my

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.880
takeaway, then, and I just want
to check if it's right,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.170
that Google doesn't want user,
per se, to see Google+--

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.950
CHEE CHEW: No.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.800
AUDIENCE: --to see what's
on the top of it.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.720
Is that fair?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.310
DAVID GLAZER: That's
a good question.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.960
CHEE CHEW: I think the way I
think about this is we want

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:48.310
users to see Google+ as a real
reflection of their life.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.470
We designed circles to better
enable you to really reflect

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.840
that your connections to
people, to friends, and

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.300
family, co-workers, are
at different levels.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.260
Your interactions with them
are at different levels.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.900
We designed Hangouts to bring
you face-to-face, so that

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.530
interactions are real.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.600
We want to facilitate very real
interactions that you

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.030
have with your friends, your
family, your neighbors, your

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.810
acquaintances, other
people around the

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.000
world, in a real way.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.500
But bring that to the web, and
to the internet, and bring the

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.930
people around the world closer
by using technology.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.755
But still is making it
as real as possible.

00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:35.010
I think that's how we want
people to perceive Google+.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.770
Does that answer
your question?

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.810
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.990
So I take it as-- essentially,
it's a embodiment of the

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.930
connections which users
have in real life.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.820
CHEE CHEW: And making
that richer.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.460
Facilitating it.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.010
AUDIENCE: --connection to
the information world.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.376
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:12:50.376 --> 00:12:51.340
That's exactly right.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.480
And because there's many kinds
of connections, there's many

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.400
ways to use.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.670
All right.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.004
Let's go to the back
microphone.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.440
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.520
So I had a question on Google
Apps for Business.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.480
How do you want Google+
to be viewed for

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.680
Google Apps for Business.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.620
So do you think that Google+ is
evolving into some kind of

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.190
a Yammer for businesses?

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:28.720
Or is it evolving into just a
contact discovery and intranet

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.450
page for businesses?

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.460
What's the direction?

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.810
What's the vision and mission?

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.140
DAVID GLAZER: So Vic, do you
want to take this one?

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.130
VIC FRYZEL: So, I'm sorry, was
the question how we're

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.970
targeting Google Apps
for Business,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.990
integrated with Google+?

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.140
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.710
So Google+ is made available
for Google Apps for

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.450
Businesses, right?

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.090
How does Google Apps--

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.060
how do businesses use
Google+ better?

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.380
Is the Google+ platform being
developed in the direction of

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.680
being a Yammer?

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.340
Or is it being developed in the
direction of being just an

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.530
intranet page where people can
share, and it's a social

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.340
discovery thing, but not
really a Yammer.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.580
DAVID GLAZER: Maybe we should
talk a little bit about how we

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.150
use it internally as one
data point, as well

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.990
as what we're seeing.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.640
VIC FRYZEL: So internally,
within Google, we obviously

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.981
have our own Google Apps
domain, google.com.

00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.610
And I would say that we're
maybe the biggest user of

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.640
Google Apps.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.000
Yesterday, I received
2000 emails.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.430
And what I would say is that
Google+ coming into Google

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.240
Apps for Business in a more
prolific way is actually

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.710
having a pretty large impact.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.700
So internally what we do with
Google+ and these social

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.770
annotations throughout the
rest of Google are really

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.190
fueled by my connections
internally at work.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.290
So I work for a company with
like 50,000 people, and I know

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.030
maybe 1,000 of those people.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.190
That's actually--

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.690
DAVID GLAZER: And they sent
you email, yesterday.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.700
VIC FRYZEL: They all sent me
an email, unfortunately.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.590
So, when I interact with these
people, there's different ways

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.360
in which I need to interact
with them.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.480
So, for instance, I said, when
I started, I work on Google

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.262
Apps and on Google+.

00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:08.990
So I have circles internally
for the Google+ folks, and

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.960
then also for the Google
Apps folks.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.190
And one integration for me
that's really useful is the

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.790
integration between circles
and Gmail, for instance.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.180
So now I can much more easily
categorize and find the emails

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.560
that are relevant to Google+,
things I'm working on on

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.340
Google+, and things I'm working
on on Google Apps.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.050
And that's an example of a
social annotation and a social

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.870
integration between our services
that could not exist

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.470
without Google+ being there for
Google Apps for Business.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.260
So that's a really, really
compelling feature, and we

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.900
have a number of these
other features.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.530
Hangouts, internally, is one of
our most prolific services.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.980
I think we use Hangouts every
day, every meeting I have.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.880
DAVID GLAZER: Chee, do you
know how many hours--

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.440
CHEE CHEW: Yeah, we do about
20,000 Hangouts a day,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
internally.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.880
So we really work by it.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.870
But also we connect that through
to the rest of Google+

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.050
internally, and we share
information out.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.550
And when people have issues or
questions, they don't quite

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.590
know who to go to.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.590
Often what they'd do is
they'll use Google+

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.620
internally.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.730
And then people will come and
respond to it or Forward it

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.380
around and find the
right people.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.480
So I think it's a great tool
to communicate and bring

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.390
people closer together, whether
it's outside in your

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.370
personal life, or within
a business setting.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.340
DAVID GLAZER: There was a
session, yesterday, it was end

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.070
of day yesterday.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.880
The video was not up as of first
thing this morning, but

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.650
it will be up shortly, on how to
get the most out of Google+

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.210
in your domain and organization
that had some

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.550
interesting discussion
about this.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.623
We are just starting to offer
some platform capabilities so

00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:47.230
you can program on top of that
and do some making it fit

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.430
better in your org.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.960
But, as with the first question,
I think my short

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.580
answer to your question
is "all of the above".

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.520
Google+ works to add that
layer of "who are my

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.685
coworkers" to all of my
interactions at work.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.390
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.210
So then, from a business
perspective, there is a

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.160
conflict between Google+ for
personal account and Google+

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.650
for business account.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.290
How do you really allow
multi-log-in with the Android?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.470
Or is that something
in the development

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.142
direction that's happening?

00:17:15.142 --> 00:17:17.750
Where you could have a personal
Gmail as well as a

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.790
business Gmail coexisting on a
mobile device, wherein you can

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.790
switch and toggle
back and forth?

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.790
DAVID GLAZER: Everyone who works
at Google lives in that

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.570
world of having at least
two accounts.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.445
I bet the average number of the
average Googler has 2.2

00:17:32.445 --> 00:17:36.200
accounts, is my guess, with a
few people having multiple

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.700
from side things.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.850
And I think my take on
it is living in that

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.620
world is not bad today.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.300
Pretty much everything I want
to do with having the two

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.560
identities works.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.830
But it's not great
today, either.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.770
And it's getting better.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.210
We keep our cross--

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.480
there's Chrome capabilities,
and there are app

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.640
capabilities.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.460
The multi-log-in, the Add
Account thing works, browser

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.750
profiles is sometimes helpful.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.145
On my phone, I can easily switch
between my two email

00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:07.780
accounts, and it's
comfortable.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:13.600
So I think that category of
people who have two accounts

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.860
is going to always be a
minority, and always be a very

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.790
large and important minority.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.170
And it's slowly getting
better.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.430
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.850
Thanks.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.270
DAVID GLAZER: All right.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.590
Front mic, please.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.330
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Mooney Langenic.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.160
I come from a company
called TheAudience

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.750
out in Beverly Hills.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.940
And we manage brands.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.840
We manage celebrities' social
media presence.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.420
DAVID GLAZER: Can you
drop a name or two?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.250
Come on, you work at the--

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.960
AUDIENCE: You want me to.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.490
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah, give
us a name or two.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.510
AUDIENCE: I don't know, I heard
some guy that performed

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.290
last night is one
of our clients.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.970
So--

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.302
the younger one.

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:48.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.910
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily
the better shape

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.160
one, the younger one.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:01.000
We have an interesting model in
this celebrity and agency

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.390
type world.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.830
We have to represent
a persona, not

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.760
necessarily a person.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.700
So these direct connections
are--

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.920
we want people to connect with
a person's image, but not

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.490
necessarily--

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.450
maybe not them, themselves.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.090
I doubt that Steve Aoki would
want you to know exactly what

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.356
he's eating right now.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.410
But he would want to
know what he's

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.440
performing, or where he's--

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.420
when a new album
is coming out.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.670
So the way that we--

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.860
I see that there's all this
hooks in with Sign-On and with

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.150
App and everything.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.880
But we have to establish a need
to put these people and

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.300
their personas on every social
media platform out there.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.450
And for us, the difficulty
has been--

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.340
I see the value in all these
other aspects, but why would I

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.160
want to get a celebrity, or a
brand, on Google+ without--

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.030
and I think one thing is I would
need to get some type of

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.380
value metrics to prove the
benefits of being on Google+

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.570
for these brands and these
celebrities because it's hard

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.740
to pitch to them.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.690
And so is there anything being
done to address that?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.430
And even though I know it's been
talked about, all this

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.470
integration, what about the
feed, what about-- is there a

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.340
value in getting these
people on the feed?

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.700
Is there going to be any need,
is there going to be any

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.240
effort to really get
more people to

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.600
interact with the feed?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.590
Or is it just a place to--
you've got to get content on

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.190
there so it'll be relevant
for a search.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.820
So that I know how to position
this to our business and to

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.070
our clients.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.020
DAVID GLAZER: You want
to take it, Seth?

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.490
SETH STERNBERG: So I
think there are a

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.390
few answers to that.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.060
It's a really great question.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.290
The first is just focusing on
plus.google.com itself, right.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.210
So the social destination.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.310
I think there are a lot of
ways for celebrities--

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.800
for personas, as you say it,
that you can really get a

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.970
community engaged and involved
around that person.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.490
One, obviously is if you have
a page for them, right.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.650
Another one is if you choose
to have a profile for them.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.840
We've seen it go both ways,
and in both cases, it's a

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.780
great way to have their audience
engage with them, at

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.850
least is they're putting
out posts.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.400
One of the advantage is, if they
have a page that's very

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.780
active, given that they're a
persona, is that a lot of that

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.770
content can make its way
into Google Search.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.500
So if someone went and searched
for the celebrity's

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.100
name, right, there's a social
card that will come up on the

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.430
right hand side where the ads
usually are, but instead it'll

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.990
have recent posts
from the page.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.880
AUDIENCE: And I understand
that.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.920
So what I need to be able to do
is, how can I quantify that

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.450
success in a nice report to some
Hollywood executive that

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.350
is breathing down my neck.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.130
I can tell them hey, you're
showing up in Search.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.550
Like, no, show me
some numbers.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.970
That's where I am
in terms of--

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.500
I need some type of

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.610
quantifiable metrics and reporting.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.630
I hear you have this amazing
product called Google

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.885
Analytics that would be great
for this, so I'm just

00:22:09.885 --> 00:22:13.930
wondering there will be even
plans to integrate with that?

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.460
CHEE CHEW: I think that's
good feedback that

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.480
we should take back.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.280
I think it's an important point
that you raise, that in

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.240
order for you to help your
customers, there's more

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.180
information that you need.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.900
I also think that another thing
to think about is that

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.470
we're trying to open up new
experiences that you may not

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.560
be able to do in any
other platform.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.210
So we have a lot of entertainers
who launch their

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.320
albums on Hangouts, Alicia Keys,
and Taylor Swift, and

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.280
that sort of thing.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.710
And people can connect with
their fan base in a richer,

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.230
new way that they couldn't
have before.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.750
I mean, this morning the Star
Trek crew had a Hangout, which

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.580
is kind of a brand new,
innovative experience.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.320
And the feedback that we're
getting is that that

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.310
connection is unique, and rich,
and it just takes it to

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.310
a new level.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.020
So I think--

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.805
DAVID GLAZER: You could maybe
even say to a new frontier.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.910
CHEE CHEW: You might say that.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.555
I would get too many groans
if I say that.

00:23:13.555 --> 00:23:16.550
But I think that we should take
your point that like,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.310
you're asking for more
clarity, more

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.870
metrics, to help you.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.480
And I think that we also say
there's value in new

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.350
experiences that we would--

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.600
AUDIENCE: All I'm saying is if
I'm going to tell JJ Abrams

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.890
pay me $1 million to have
Hangout, he's going to tell

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.320
me, all right, prove to me what
value it gives me, aside

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.590
from "it sounds really cool."

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.260
CHEE CHEW: It's a fair point.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.750
SETH STERNBERG: And do
know that in the--

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.420
so this is something
that we have heard.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.790
The first places that you can
see some metrics coming

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.130
through on social engagement
is actually, if you do use

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.650
Google+ Sign-In, there's a
dashboard that's available at

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.610
your Plus page where you can
see engagement metrics.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.470
How many people are signing
in, how many people are

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.710
sending interactive posts--

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.190
DAVID GLAZER: It's a start.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.060
SETH STERNBERG: --the
click rate.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.840
It's a start, like David said.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.290
But you will see us continue to
improve there because we do

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.280
know it's an area of
desire for people.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.860
DAVID GLAZER: All right, back
microphone, please.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.020
Yeah, I have a design
suggestion for you.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.110
So one of the pain points I have
in having a multi-account

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.040
sign-in to the Plus site,
plus.google.com.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.210
This typically happens when
I'm landing on a community

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.050
page, or a profile page,
of some user.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.580
And I've gotten there because
I've clicked in a link in

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.830
Gmail or some other thing and
I'm in the wrong account, that

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.100
I want to circle that person in
one of my other accounts,

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.810
not that one.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.440
The way you do it now, when you
switch accounts, you just

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.570
open up a new page, and I'm in
the home page of my Google+.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.310
I've lost the context
of that person.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.830
And even if I copy and paste the
URL, because of the little

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:55.270
slash u slash n thing, I'm
hopelessly lost about how to

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.570
even get back to that page
in the right account.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.430
So I would just suggest that,
when you switch accounts, in

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.750
those cases where you're on a
community page or profile

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:10.380
page, you stay there instead of
taking me to my home page.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.860
DAVID GLAZER: That's
a great suggestion.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.830
SETH STERNBERG: I had that
problem this morning.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.850
DAVID GLAZER: How many people
here been burned by that in

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.983
the last week?

00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:17.406
AUDIENCE: Whoo-hoo!

00:25:17.406 --> 00:25:17.829
DAVID GLAZER: All right.

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:19.100
All right.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.420
DAVID GLAZER: Front
microphone.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.110
AUDIENCE: It's just a
quick question, is--

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.590
I've been in process of moving
a bunch of blogs and stuff

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.850
into this community because it
has a lot more traction and a

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.450
lot more visibility.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:37.510
The problem is your text
formatting is lacking.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.290
You can't actually bold,
italicize, you can't insert

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.070
images into feeds.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.280
You can't do a lot of the basic
stuff that you can do

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.490
with Blogger and some
of the other tools.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.500
So if that's one of the
purposes, to generate more

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.470
social interaction, more of a
conversation with people, it'd

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.890
be great if we actually had the
basic font manipulation

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.920
tools that most of your other
products seem to have.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.940
Or I could've missed it, it's
just I've been trying to get

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.620
onto the internet in
this room, and it's

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.080
a little bit hard.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.150
DAVID GLAZER: There are some
very basic markdown that you

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.920
probably do know about,
where you can bold

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.560
and italicize text.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.460
And that far from addresses
everything about your question

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.300
but it is something.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.600
I've heard that before.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.720
There's a balance that we
are looking for where

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.750
we don't want to--

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.600
first of all, we don't want to
make it too hard, and second

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.090
of all, we don't want
to make it too noisy

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.650
for people who are--

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.380
like the birth of desktop
publishing, where everyone

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.440
showed off they knew
how to pick fonts.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.430
DAVID GLAZER: But I also agree
with you there's a kind of

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.310
communication.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.490
So it's a good point.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:41.942
Thank you.

00:26:41.942 --> 00:26:43.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.760
DAVID GLAZER: Back mic.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.520
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.055
First, I want to
make a comment.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.080
Google+, as a platform
for us--

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920
I come from a large
enterprise--

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.160
has been phenomenal.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.850
It has absolutely changed
the way we can do work.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.190
The real time collaboration,
we've never seen it before.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.930
We had played around with
looking at what Microsoft has

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.140
in the past, and I have to
tell you that that really

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.520
never came to fruition for us.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.190
It really didn't meet
what we needed.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:13.430
But Google+ is one of those sets
of tools where we did the

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.080
Google Apps, and then
along comes Google+.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.590
It's a small little thing you
think of, for Hangouts, but

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.860
what a great, great tool for
us to collaborate, and have

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.810
people bring themselves together
for things that they

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.800
need to do.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.680
Adding in things like
collaborating on documents, or

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.470
files, or doing screen sharing
or things like that.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.040
It's absolutely just
turned around the

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.210
way we can do business.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.830
And so I just want to
congratulate you guys for a

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.990
really great tool set.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.080
DAVID GLAZER: Thank you, Chee.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.558
CHEE CHEW: I did not pay him.

00:27:41.558 --> 00:27:43.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.540
CHEE CHEW: I swear, I have
never met him before.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.460
AUDIENCE: But now I
want to ask you a

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.160
separate question, though.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.390
So I think it's for--

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.160
I don't really remember
the name, you talked

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.050
about iOS and Android.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.880
So, in looking at the tools
you have right now, you've

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.570
got-- it's kind of a mishmash,
right now.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.190
You've got this great Google+
apps that's got built in

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.430
applications today.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.850
And then you just released
Hangouts, that has Hangouts

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.462
and messaging, but you've got
Hangouts and messaging within

00:28:07.462 --> 00:28:09.150
the Google+ app.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:14.560
So is there a plan deprecate
Google+ features and functions

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.250
and build out separate
applications for those?

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.110
Or what's the long term strategy
and vision on that?

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.770
To try to help our--

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.430
explain this to our users
properly, so they know--

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.730
we can tell them to just do it
one way and not have to do it

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.526
multiple different ways.

00:28:29.526 --> 00:28:31.990
CHEE CHEW: So let me see
if I got a question.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.360
And correct me before I answer
the wrong question.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.280
So the question is
really around--

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.930
since we brought Hangouts top
level, is this a strategy

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.330
where we will bring lots
and lots of features as

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.000
independent apps?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.690
Is that your question?

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.840
AUDIENCE: At the same time, will
you then be deprecating

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.414
out of the Google+ apps.

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:52.250
CHEE CHEW: Ah, OK.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:29:00.260
So we won't be bringing all
independent functionality and

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.030
breaking apart the Google+
app into a whole bunch of

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.680
different apps.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.310
But we believed that, for this
particular case, it was

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:14.830
important because this is a use
pattern that people have

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.670
with the many other tools
that we provided.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.410
Like Google+ Messenger, and
Talk, and Google Voice.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.260
And, since they're used to
going at it, and getting

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.360
access to it, in this way, there
it's top-level, we want

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.460
to do a better job of having a
comprehensive tool that still

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.950
matches that use pattern.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.720
So I don't think you should look
at this as a strategy for

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.460
all Google+ features,
but I think this is

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.870
a very unique case.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.930
So I think that's half
your question.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.410
The other half is will we be
removing and deprecating that

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.970
functionality out of
the Google+ app?

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:53.730
Yes.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.200
So we will be investing and
continue to invest heavily in

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.180
the Hangouts app in the
functionality there, and we'll

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.370
reconcile that with
the Google+ app in

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.130
the very near future.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.436
Thank you so much.

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:05.348
CHEE CHEW: Sure.

00:30:05.348 --> 00:30:05.804
DAVID GLAZER: OK.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:06.260
Front.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.650
And the question is about Google
Events, which is a

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.140
great feature and very useful.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.520
We are part of the GDG Dublin
Organizer Group, so we're

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.880
using that to add events, and
have all the photos and

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.230
they're coming from the
people that came.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:25.110
But there's one feature really
missing is all events are

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.160
public events, so open
to everyone.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.490
But we have a limit.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.560
So the room we have, like
80, 100 people.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.985
And there's no way to say, well,
we have a limit of 80,

00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:36.610
and then system of
waiting list.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.760
So that would be a great
feature to have.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.870
And then, the other question,
again, about events.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:45.620
Once and event is finished--

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.310
I guess it's a future.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.450
Something that maybe you could
bring in the future is have

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.570
some sort of statistics,
or data, about events.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.350
Like how many people came?

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.580
And how many people say
they would came, but

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.980
never checked in?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.540
Not pair people coming,
but a more general

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.070
statistics on the event.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.010
DAVID GLAZER: Those are
two great requests.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.900
Thank you.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.380
Yeah.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.220
I have nothing to announce right
now about any immediate

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.790
plans, but those
are good ideas.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.190
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.604
DAVID GLAZER: Anyone else?

00:31:21.604 --> 00:31:22.040
All right.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.670
In the back.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:22.916
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.250
A quick comment, first.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.940
I meet with a couple different
folks in Hangouts each week in

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.080
some different industries.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.470
And I just wanted to mention
that we had one last week,

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.160
people all over the country,
about five or six

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.360
participants.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.490
One of the ladies that was
pretty necessary for the

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.570
meeting was not joining, so I
called and said, hey, you

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.660
joining us soon.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.310
I'm stuck in traffic, it'll
be about 15 minutes.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.550
Instead of wasting everybody's
time or trying to reschedule,

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.395
I remember hearing that
you guys integrated

00:31:46.395 --> 00:31:48.560
some phone with it.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.380
We called her.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.640
It worked flawlessly.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.580
She could hear everybody.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.720
We could hear her real well.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.630
It was great.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.990
DAVID GLAZER: Chee, how
much of a marketing

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.960
budget did you have?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.215
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:01.430
CHEE CHEW: $120.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.540
AUDIENCE: When I go I travel
around and I check out Plus, I

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.830
like to look at what's Hot, and
then occasionally I look

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.840
at Nearby, just to get
a flavor for what's

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.260
happening in the city.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.440
And about two weeks ago, I was
in Charlotte, and I went to

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.450
what's Nearby, or whatever you
title it, and literally spent

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.480
two or three minutes scrolling
through and saw the same guy's

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.490
either Spotify songs
or something that

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.570
he's listening to.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.750
Just hundreds and hundreds.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.770
Like, every three minutes,
here's what he's listening to,

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.130
and it basically drowned
everybody else out.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.110
And my question is, is
that a user error?

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.810
Is that a developer error?

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.820
Did he flip a bunch of switches
to just say make

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.750
everything I do public?

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.410
Is that how it comes standard?

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.500
And just saying it really
flooded everybody else out.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.490
DAVID GLAZER: First of all, it's
always our problem if you

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.660
had a bad experience.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.300
So there may be other things,
but it's always our problem.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.470
SETH STERNBERG: So actually
I'm not quite

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.100
sure how that happened.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.550
That was probably the user just
literally choosing the

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.380
post everything manually
into the stream.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.980
SETH STERNBERG: Because there is
not a way for developers to

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.270
be able to write programmatic
activity like that and have it

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.360
all get into the stream.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.920
But a design point--

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.760
when we did App Activities, so
when we let developers start

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.220
writing activities into
Google's, we really want to

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.520
take that and put it into places
that have real meaning

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.660
and context for users.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.870
So if you've got to that
person's profile, and you were

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.120
specifically looking for what
they had done in a given app,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.110
then you would see the full
stream of what they've

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.800
done in that app.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.600
But we are specifically not
just publishing it in the

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.530
stream because at this point in
time, like right-- a stream

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.650
is chronological, right,
more or less.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.250
And you might not really care
right now that I read an

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.720
article or listened to a song.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.620
But if you start searching for
music, great music, later, you

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.570
might really care, right.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.650
Or looking for travel
destinations.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.600
You might really care what I've
read about great travel

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.720
destinations.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.210
So that-- like David said,
that's probably our fault that

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.730
it was able to happen.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.990
But it's definitely
a design point.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.480
What we heard from users was--
it was actually interesting,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.540
they said I want to absolutely
know that I'm not going to

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.670
spam my friends.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.460
SETH STERNBERG: But, when I want
to share my friends, I

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.710
want to know they're
going to get it.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.929
And that was hard for us to
reconcile, initially, right.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.400
We did a lot of thinking
about that.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.699
And that's why we landed on
programmatic app activities

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.620
right into Google do not
just publish to Stream.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.699
But, if a user chooses to share
something, and they

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.969
write in a friend's name, then
we're going to pop a

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.780
notification to that user in
every Google property, right,

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.219
to make certain that
that user's

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.920
friends do get that message.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.590
So yeah.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.565
Our fault, but not
a design point.

00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:37.920
AUDIENCE: All right, cool.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.796
Thanks.

00:34:38.796 --> 00:34:41.719
DAVID GLAZER: In
front, please.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Diana.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.679
I'm a User Experience Designer
with Bridgepoint Education,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.659
and I wanted to say it's really
exciting what you guys

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.659
are doing with the social
platform and changing the

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.190
landscape of learning.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.880
And I wanted to ask from
your experience--

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.500
or if you could give insight
from an institution level,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.900
from a student level, and from
a professor level, where have

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.550
you seen the biggest pain points
being alleviated by

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:14.160
utilizing Google+, or where have
you seen the most value

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.300
being added in the learning
or teaching experience?

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.620
CHEE CHEW: So I don't
know if you--

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.960
did you get a chance to
attend the Coursera--

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.430
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.400
I did.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.400
Unfortunately, it was a really
short course, and they didn't

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.070
get to dive too much into it.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:34.040
So I was hoping to see if you
guys can add anything to that.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.770
CHEE CHEW: Yeah, so the
observation that we had when

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.770
we looked at--

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.450
if you guys aren't familiar,
Coursera is online learning.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.250
So it's a MOOC.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.440
And one of the things that we've
noticed is that there's

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.700
a large fall off on people who
start the course versus then--

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.570
who complete the course.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.110
And we know through
education and--

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.690
you just think about
your experiences,

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.170
maybe college, or whatever.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.430
A huge part of your memories
and what keeps you going is

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.960
actually the interactions that
you have with others, whether

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.930
it be other students, or direct
connections you have

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.210
with the TAs.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.360
And we also find this
is true with MOOCs.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.580
When people connect with other
people, then they stay with

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.970
the program longer.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.510
When they're alone, and studying
alone, and sometimes

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.290
getting frustrated alone,
then they fall off.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:30.370
So what we found through the
work that we've done with

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.840
partners is that, when we're
actually able to bring people

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.610
face-to-face, that's
been a huge help.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.860
Now, as we've learned, there are
a bunch of challenges in

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.000
bringing people face-to-face
around the world, in this

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.330
online sort of world.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:47.070
Some of that is timing,
coordination, and time zones,

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.500
and that sort of
stuff, and find

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.090
compatibility and language.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.680
And those are the sort of
things that we're really

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.535
trying to work through.

00:36:52.535 --> 00:36:55.410
But I think there's a lot
of opportunity there.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.990
AUDIENCE: And then from
an institution level?

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.200
I mean, I don't know if you've
worked with any brick and

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.090
mortar schools, but if you can
share any experiences where on

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.390
a university actual
location level.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.520
CHEE CHEW: Yeah.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.390
So we've worked with several
universities on this.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.650
Actually, we found out there are
a lot of universities who

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.110
are just trying things and we're
finding out about them

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.080
afterwards, which is amazing.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.310
The MIT Media Lab, for example,
has been doing a

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:28.410
bunch of online courses
using Hangouts.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.830
And I think part of the
challenge there is that they

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.110
want to reach a very large
audience, hundreds, if not

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.930
thousands, of people.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.280
So they're using on-air
and broadcasting.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.940
And two of the most common
requests we get there are for

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.800
some universities who want to
restrict that to just a

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.610
limited audience.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.460
MIT is a bit more willing to
have the world see it.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.850
But the other one is when you
have a large audience, how do

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.510
you manage Q&amp;A with
1,000 people?

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.500
I think that's one of the
challenges that we're thinking

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.740
through, but also that we find
the partners are able to come

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.068
up with other solutions as
well to complement ours.

00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:10.550
SETH STERNBERG: So it turns out
my mother's a teacher, and

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.420
I was talking to her a little
bit about how she could use--

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.180
she asked me.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.230
She was like, hey, you work at
Google+, how can I use this

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.080
with my students.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.980
One thing we also talked about
was the idea of creating

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.220
community for her class.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.060
And you can create closed
communities.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.390
And so that's a really good
way to just let you as a

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.080
teacher and all the students
in your class interact with

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.860
each other.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.540
So that's something
you might look at.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.660
The other thing I was pointing
my mother to is, hey, you can

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.960
actually create a circle for
everybody in your class, and

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.060
that's a really easy way to
share things that you find

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.350
that are really interesting
for all of your students.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.730
So there's another couple
things that--

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.870
in real life, when my mother
said hey, you know what do I

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.082
do, I pointed out to her.

00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:49.470
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.350
Thank you.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.610
SETH STERNBERG: Thank you.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:52.510
DAVID GLAZER: And back.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.550
How are you?

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.120
Couple of issues.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.140
I'm a start up addict.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.750
so currently I have five active
Google Apps accounts in

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.410
different domains, plus my
personal Gmail account.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.420
And one of the issues that
I have is that--

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.860
well, I have to create a Google+
profile for each

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.740
account to administer the pages
for each company and

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.180
stuff like that.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.350
But the issue that I have is
that I get people following me

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.530
in Google+ accounts where
I don't post.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.410
So the issues that I have
Google+ is that, I can't

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.840
consolidate my profiles, or
automatically redirect, or

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.040
when they follow me on one
company, say, hey, this is not

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.760
an active Google+, please follow
me on my Gmail account,

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.620
which is something that I--
actually, I post that, right.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.200
So one of the issues that I have
there is that having so

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.270
many Google+ accounts sort of
messes up my online profile.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.450
So when you Google me, you might
get one of the profiles

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.590
that I don't actually use.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.790
And It's hard for people to--

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.710
investors, actually, as well--

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.470
to actually get a hold of me
because they try to reach me

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.200
through one of the accounts
that is not really active.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.900
So that's one of the quirks that
I have about Plus, the

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.920
profiles themselves.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.600
Also, I'm sort of geek, so I
don't really use Google+ web

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.970
profile because I'm
not that social.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.690
But what I do use is the APIs,
and I want to say thank you

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.320
for the APIs that were released
about 11 weeks ago.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.970
And I noticed that there are
two subsets of APIs.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.510
There's an HTTP API, which is
mostly REST, to get people

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.080
list, circle list, et cetera.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.630
And you have the web API to be
able to do posts, interactive

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.930
posts, et cetera.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.830
The issue there is that--

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:59.600
well, to be honest, when I saw
what the web APIs, I figured

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.770
hey, this is web, it has to be
REST, I should be able to

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.990
actually hack this easily and
make my own REST calls.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.210
I almost got it, but
it never worked.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.020
But that's the thing.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:16.140
I mean, for the web APIs, why
aren't there HTTP equivalents?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:21.860
Why am I forced to use the
iframe, or the Google

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.480
interface, to share posts?

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.020
Why can't it with
server side--

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.020
to be honest, I have an
extension, a Chrome extension,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.710
which currently allows a person
to cross post into

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.840
Twitter and Facebook.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.880
And I'd love to add,
hey, cross post

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.320
this to all your networks.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.720
But I can't.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.070
They have to cross post to
Facebook, Twitter, and then

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.970
they take additional step
to post to Google+.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.490
DAVID GLAZER: Let me pick
apart those questions.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:54.990
On your first question, which
is, hey, you're not social,

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.390
but you have a lot
of profiles.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.870
Something like that.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.320
I don't have a magic answer to
that, but there's something

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.760
that I've certainly seen other
people use, which is use the

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.030
profile picture to encourage,
or discourage, people paying

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.690
attention to you.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:11.830
If you have a picture on one of
them, and not the others,

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.790
That's a pretty strong signal
that this is the real you,

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:15.990
this is the one you
care about.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.750
And there are other simple
things, if anyone has other

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.200
tips, but that would work.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.150
On your other question--

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.470
let me make sure I heard it
right, before answering.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.080
So we have a set of APIs, which
are RESTful APIs, which

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.330
are designed for programmatic
access, whatever.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.840
You like that set of APIs,
you like that model of

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.640
interaction.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.100
We have another set of
interfaces which are widgets,

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.200
which are user present
interactions with the user

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.290
that let the user
do some things.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.650
And you're asking how come we
don't let you programmatically

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.720
automate all of the capabilities
that we offered

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.860
via widgets?

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.530
Is that right?

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:56.876
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:56.876 --> 00:42:57.570
Yeah.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.470
DAVID GLAZER: And the answer
to that is very similar to

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.850
Seth's answer before.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.470
It's so that you don't cause
problems for our friend who

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.720
visits Charlotte by
automatically

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.560
writing to his stream.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.140
The intent is we are trying
to say there's a set of

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.980
interactions that we really want
to be human-based, human

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.130
present, a user actually
did this, interactions.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.750
And the safe way for us to do
that is to say the only way to

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.130
do that interaction is
through a Google UI.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.040
So we know for a fact that,
when someone posts, it's

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.370
because they saw UI, they saw
it was the Google UI, they

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.580
looked at their circles,
they said Share.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.340
And there are legitimate use
cases where programmatic

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.500
access would make sense, and
it was the user's explicit

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.330
intent, but they're very hard
to tell apart from the

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.380
unsavory use cases.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.630
And I trust you, but I don't
necessarily trust everyone

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:04.150
else who might accidentally or
intentionally misuse the kind

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:09.260
of API that would do dangerous
things automatically.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.850
AUDIENCE: But at the same time,
sorry for saying this,

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.940
but Google+ has to play catch
up with the other social

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.610
networks like Twitter and
Facebook, all right.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.910
So if you have a tool which
allows you to consolidate your

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.080
social network access, but you
can't consolidate the access

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.180
to Google+.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.690
It's harder to incentivize the
user to-- hey, you also have

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.210
Google+, try to see what
advantages it has over

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.000
Facebook and Twitter,
for example.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.620
With the tool that I'm
developing, at least, you

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.440
can't really do that
because there's an

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.780
extra step for Google+.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.260
So you have this tool which
tries to consolidate

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.320
everything, but there's always
the exception for Google+, you

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.820
have to bring up the widget.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.890
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:58.900
There's a quality-quantity
conversation trade-off, and we

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.000
are starting by being very
careful to keep the quality of

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.880
the conversation in
Google+ high.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.850
And it is a trade off.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.130
I agree with you, there are use
cases, there is this some

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.580
value to a different point.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.200
But we're starting by making
sure that we keep the quality

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.520
of the community and the

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.600
conversations as human as possible.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.820
And we are willing to take
some short term slower

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.900
quantity of information, of
conversation, to have it be

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.460
higher quality.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.370
SANDY JEN: The other thing to
think about is that we're not

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.500
trying to mimic the interactions
that you'd have

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.460
other social networks.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.380
We're trying to create a much
more engaging, human--

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:37.000
like Chee said, real life
equivalent on the web.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.420
And so, in some cases, as David
said before, we don't

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.650
necessarily want you to have the
exact same sort of blast

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.270
out sequence of events
that you have on

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:48.090
a Facebook or Twitter.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.910
So it could be right now, our
experiences may seem very

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.230
similar, but as we developed and
made more product plans,

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.600
we hope to differentiate in that
way, so that it becomes

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.270
more clear when you'd want to
use Google+, versus when you'd

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.650
want to use Facebook,
versus when you

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.180
want to use all three.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:03.500
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.540
Thank you very much.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.520
DAVID GLAZER: OK.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.920
AUDIENCE: I'm told too tall
for I/O. Am I okay here?

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.940
SETH STERNBERG: I wish
I had that problem

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.820
of being too tall.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.340
AUDIENCE: Uh, I have
slouch like a geek.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.810
Love Google+, my only complaint
is the multiple

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.240
account thing, in terms of
having my Apps account versus

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.480
my Gmail account.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.463
It means that I get a lesser
experience throughout Google

00:46:27.463 --> 00:46:28.470
as a result.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.450
now isn't as good because
Plus is here.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.624
But that's not I want to
be up here, I just

00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:33.640
wanted to cut that in.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.070
Quick question.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.820
I work a lot of media
companies-- not like JJ Abrams

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.510
who can pay a million dollars,
but poor, dying newspapers.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.680
And I'm trying to convince them
how wonderful Google+ is,

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.060
and how they should work with
local business for Google+.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.060
So quick question-- what would
your ideal media organization,

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.643
especially a local one,
do on Google+.

00:46:48.643 --> 00:46:52.740
And what, in turn, would they
ideally help small local

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.080
businesses do on Google+.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.440
SETH STERNBERG: That's a
really good question.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.240
So in terms of a media
organization--

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.650
presumably right now a lot of
their traffic, probably their

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:08.630
dominant traffic, is going
to their website.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.440
There are great social
interactions that people

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.820
actually are having on that
property that can probably be

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.440
used to filter kind of social
data into Google.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.530
So something like, hey, I just
read this article, you might

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:22.930
want to read too.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:27.870
And if the user does Google+
Sign-In for that property, and

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.500
the user sends their friend an
interactive post, that will

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.180
have a Read button
on it, right.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.560
So when it goes into the stream,
it will literally have

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.960
a big Click Me to send my friend
back to that media

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.020
organization.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.890
Same thing for something like
watching a video, right.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.460
Ask your friend to
watch with you.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.810
And send an interactive post
that has a watch button on it.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.990
Or commenting.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.870
I want to hear what you
think about this.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.580
So send an interactive post
with an action to comment.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:04.580
So one thing we'd love to see
publishers do, both mobile and

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.760
web, of course, is send
interactive posts that are

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.790
about engagement.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:13.470
About getting their current fans
to engage their friends

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.720
back at that property.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.700
Couple other things.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:26.560
Creating a Plus page is an
awesome way for that property

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.300
to get more traffic and more
engagement inside Google's

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.240
ecosystem as a whole.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.340
When we see a people do an
awesome job on Plus pages, and

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.140
National Geographic has
done an amazing

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.350
job their Plus page.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.130
Wall Street Journal has
done an amazing job

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:41.170
with their Plus page.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.030
They have millions
of followers.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.570
And they have really high
community engagement.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:51.180
So they've opened up a channel
with their fans inside Google.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.370
And that gets them, obviously,
the social card

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.540
inside Google Search.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.310
And so it's even more
discoverability.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:59.480
So that's another one.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.690
Then the more we talk to
publishers, they obviously are

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.210
seeing their traffic shift very

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.620
dramatically over to mobile.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.840
So one thing that we've done to
hopefully help is, when a

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.350
user does Google+ Sign-In, and
if they have an Android phone,

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.080
then we ask, would you like the

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.410
Android app of this publisher?

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:29.050
So if a publisher lets a user
say, hey, friend I want you to

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.670
watch this video.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.900
When the user takes that action
for the first time, it

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.690
will say, in order to send this,
connect your presence

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.300
here with Google.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.160
When the user's making that
connection, it will ask, would

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.740
you like the mobile app?

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.570
And we hear from publishers
that their engagement on

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:49.340
mobile apps is orders of
magnitude higher than their

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.480
engagement on the mobile web.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.240
And so we're trying to help
the publishers get more

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.330
distribution of their
mobile apps for

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.870
more engagement, right.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.400
So they can have a really great
feature for users like,

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.590
hey, involve your friends, get
them to comment, get them to

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:05.370
watch, get them to read.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:10.320
That simultaneously drives them
more app distribution

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.420
that simultaneously gets them
more traffic back from

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.060
people's friends on Google.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.490
The last one, which I think
Sandy probably wants to talk

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.690
about, is what we just launched
around mobile content

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.210
recommendations, which
is great for

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.070
publishers on mobile web.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:24.301
SANDY JEN: Right.

00:50:24.301 --> 00:50:26.970
There's that where you create
a much more engaging

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.300
experience, where you try to
have the user come back to the

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.900
content of the publisher to say,
oh, look, I didn't know.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.990
Let me pull this little
breadcrumb trail and fine

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.330
what's actually more interesting
on your site.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:40.050
Then another point from what
Seth was saying before is we

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:43.510
actually had this concept at
Meebo where publishers these

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.100
days don't really understand
the individual

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.710
human face to a user.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:51.060
Your IP address, your gender,
your age, your location.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.240
How do you connect that
real life aspect?

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.190
And so with Google, what you can
do is that once you create

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:59.750
these communities, you actually
have faces to your

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.720
most addictive fans.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.530
Like, a New York Times or a
small newspaper, may not know

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.630
this person visits theirs
site every day.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.340
And they're spreading content
all over the place.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.970
How do I create that connection
so that I, as the

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.330
publisher, am taking advantage
of that user, and creating a

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:16.380
circle around them so
they can start my

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.490
content around the web?

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:20.020
So that kind of evangelism is
really hard to do when you

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.760
don't have those tool sets, and
we're hoping that a lot of

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.160
our publisher offerings,
recommendations, circles, plus

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.200
pages, will then help create
that ecosystem to make it a

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.990
lot more engaging.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:31.560
SETH STERNBERG: Actually,
riffing off that--

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.010
so Sandy just pointed out that
publishers often don't really

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.750
know who the person is behind
the IP address.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:41.300
Something that Hugo announced
in his talk on Android

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.890
yesterday is what we're calling

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.070
cross-device single sign-on.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.230
And this is huge, huge,
for publishers.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:52.350
So if a user does connect on
web or on mobile, they can

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.370
start on either side.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.820
The publisher finds out
who that person is.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.030
They get their name.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.460
They get their profile picture,
their public profile

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.420
data, and their list
of friends.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.300
Now, there's a problem that we
have in our industry today,

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.770
that is we have this device
proliferation thing going on.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.820
And so you might actually have a
user that's logged in on the

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.010
mobile device, but you have no
idea who they are when they go

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.110
to the web.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:20.110
And that's a problem for
delivering them a more

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:22.150
relevant experience, because
you don't know who

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:23.060
they are in one place.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.490
You do on another.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:26.920
And it's a monetization problem,
right, because you

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.760
can't help figure out what this
person's interested in

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.810
from a monetization perspective
cross-device.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.960
With single sign-on, if the user
connects on one device,

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.050
they are now connected on every
device because they've

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:43.800
created a relationship between
them and your service, not

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.740
them, your service,
and a device.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:49.300
So that's another very powerful
tool that Hugo just

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.390
announced yesterday that
publishers can take advantage

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:54.330
of to create a much
more relevant

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.460
experience for their users.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.370
The last one I'll just mention
really quickly, because,

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.740
sorry, you've asked a--

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.050
We've built a lot here, hoping
that we can really help both

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.590
developers and publishers.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:09.330
We've heard from publishers
that in mobile web, their

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.000
bounce rate was unbelievably
high.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.140
They have tons of traffic coming
in from social streams,

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.760
but people stay for 10 seconds,
they read an article,

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.850
then they vanish, right.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.530
And I'll bet if you all think
about your use of mobile web

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:23.390
and social streams.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.750
You're going through, you see
an article, you click, you

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.990
read for 10 seconds,
you're gone, right.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.000
And what we've done on Monday
was we announced mobile

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.970
content recommendations.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.960
We had partners come
in from Turkey.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.200
They heard about mobile content
recommendations before

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.670
they got on the airplane.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.620
They landed in SFO and they
had a little bit of time

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.840
before the car was coming
to pick them up and they

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.330
implemented mobile content
recommendations, literally

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.950
while they were sitting
in SFO.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.000
It is that easy to do.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.300
And that is designed to engage
a user in your site, in your

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.326
property, when they come visit
you, and drive you, then, more

00:53:58.326 --> 00:53:59.576
page views.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:01.860
DAVID GLAZER: I think--

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.060
I can't quite see the timer,
but I think we're down to

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.850
around five minutes.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:07.200
OK.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.810
So I want to get to as many
of you as we can.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:14.060
We'll try to do some short
answers in the interest of

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.120
breadth, but--

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.300
back microphone, please.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.470
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:20.200
I'm coming from mobile.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.110
I'm a communications
consultant.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:27.460
One or two years I've had the
Stay Tuned list on features at

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.510
the platform.

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:34.390
It's about the API, it's about
Analytics, and it's about the

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.370
advantage URL.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:40.860
And I'm just wondering, the
development that you how with

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.850
design and functions and
different functions like that,

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:49.140
which I love, is that a
conclusion that you won't make

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.250
regular read-write API?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.350
That's the first question.

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:57.600
The second question is when will
we see a Google Analytics

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.560
for Google+?

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.690
Not for the Sign-IN functions,
not for the interactions with

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.190
websites, but for the engagement
on the destination,

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.910
the social destination as-is.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.930
And the third question is
a regular guy question.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.140
When are you guys going to
give people vanity URL?

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:19.360
SETH STERNBERG: Sorry,
what was the last--

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.590
DAVID GLAZER: Vanity URl.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:21.920
SETH STERNBERG: Vanity URL.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.960
So I'm going to take that
one really fast.

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.420
We have nothing to announce
on personal,

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.470
vanity URLs right now.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.710
For read-write API, like
David said, we are

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.100
getting closer, right.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.440
What we've done with Google+
Sign-In is getting a lot

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.840
closer to publishers
being able to

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.650
write stuff into Google.

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:40.720
We'll obviously keep pushing
the envelope, but we do not

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.550
have a read-write API that's
a straight write to

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:43.220
stream right now.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.330
Like David said, it's because
we want to keep content

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.000
quality really high.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.280
We will keep working on it.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.400
The last question--

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:50.500
DAVID GLAZER: Analytics.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.130
Google.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:51.790
SETH STERNBERG: Analytics.

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:54.400
So definitely a request that
we've heard loud and clear

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:54.980
from the market.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.080
There is some early social
analytics, both in Google

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.770
Analytics and as part of the
Google+ Sign-In release that

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:03.660
you can get from
your Plus page.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.590
But request noted.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.653
Next question.

00:56:06.653 --> 00:56:09.371
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:09.371 --> 00:56:10.640
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah,
front microphone.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.060
SETH STERNBERG: Just trying to
go quickly, and get as many--

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.170
AUDIENCE: Try and make
it as fast as I can,

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.730
for the sake of time.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.340
One-word question, XMPP.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.390
And then--

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:21.258 --> 00:56:23.670
AUDIENCE: And then second
question is regarding

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:29.360
extending the schema for
individual users for

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.480
applications where you
use Google+ Sign-In.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.970
Are you looking at being able to
say, use Knowledge Graph to

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:37.540
allow people to add schema to
people's identity for their

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.400
applications.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.320
CHEE CHEW: So XMPP has two
modes, server-to-server and

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:42.970
client-to-server.

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.230
Which one are you particularly
interested in?

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:47.620
AUDIENCE: Client-to-server.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.250
CHEE CHEW: So for
client-to-server, this is to

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:53.320
allow an additional apps
to connect in,

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.390
like a Pidgin or Adium.

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.270
What we found is that the
client protocol has been

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:00.940
pretty limiting in terms of
what we want to do and the

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.370
model for Hangouts.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:07.780
So we have interop through
to the talk XMPP network.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.300
And those apps will
continue to work.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.450
But the protocol isn't as rich
to we do all what we want.

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.680
That'll be limited to one-to-one
text messages.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.020
So you can continue to do that,
and we'll continue to

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.091
evaluate from there.

00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:24.385
AUDIENCE: As far as integration
with users from

00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:26.225
other presence environments
like Jabber,

00:57:26.225 --> 00:57:26.550
and things like that.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.420
Are you still going to be
able to do that, or no?

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.970
CHEE CHEW: So that's a
server-to-server federation.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:35.250
And we have not seen a
really strong uptake.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.030
There have been a few folks.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:41.320
Actually, one of the biggest,
most frequent users of clients

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.170
of that server-to-server are
actually abusers and spammers,

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.280
who throw up a bogus network
and then try

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.960
and attack our users.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.870
So far the uptake has not been
compelling for us to really

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.360
push that forward.

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.410
We'll continue to evaluate it,
but at this point, we've seen

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.130
more attacks on users than
benefit in reality.

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:01.870
DAVID GLAZER: And on the schema
question, catch me

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:02.870
afterwards.

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:06.000
I need to drill deeper and
we don't have time.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:06.950
OK.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.580
We have one minute left.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.840
We're not going to get
to all of you, but

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.890
we're not running away.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:14.390
So we will just walk out into
the hallway right outside that

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.610
back door for other questions.

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:18.630
Yeah, we have less
than a minute.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:22.190
So thank you, everyone, for
coming, really appreciate the

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.410
questions and suggestions.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.900
I've got a list of things
that we'll be

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.110
bringing back to the team.

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:28.140
SETH STERNBERG: Also, if you're
interested, we have a

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.570
full day of sessions.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:31.250
If you're interested in learning
about Android, and

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.450
Google+ Sign-In, or
iOS, or whatever.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.050
All of the sessions are today.

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:38.730
There's a partner panel later
today in which you can witness

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:40.820
what it takes to make a really
compelling integration.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.420
There's a few other talks
that I can't remember.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.540
Oh, Cross-Auth which
is the talk that

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.470
was mentioned yesterday.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:52.550
And then Best Practice.

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.976
How to do best practices
on the platform.

00:58:55.976 --> 00:58:56.330
DAVID GLAZER: Thank
you, everyone.

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:56.590
SETH STERNBERG: Thank you.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:02.273
