00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; male presenter: So, It's my pleasure today
to welcome Dr. Susan Barry, author of " Fixing

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.779
My Gaze " and Professor of Biological Sciences
at Mount Holyoke College.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:14.759
Dr. Barry received her PhD. in 1981 from Princeton
University and has pursued her research of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.800
neuroscience at NASA's Johnson Space Center
and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800
the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, among other institutions.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.550
So, in the summer of 2006, I listened to NPR's
"Morning Editionî during my commute every

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.550
day.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.079
I remember hearing an interview with a neuroscientist
who gains stereo vision in middle age, when

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.079
everyone thought that couldn't be done in
infancy.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.219
And she described the joy of seeing a snowfall
in three dimensions for the first time, and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:49.100
I had to wipe my eyes a little on the way
to the office.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Not quite a year after that, I started dating
a beautiful and brilliant woman, who, invited

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.159
me to meet her family at their Passover Seder.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:03.050
And by the way, she said, my mom is a little
obsessed with stereo vision.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.390
So, my mother in-law, Dr. Susan Barry, stereo
[ inaudible ]. :

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.390
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.500
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Thanks, David, for that introduction.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
I think my daughter is brilliant, partly because
she married you.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.950
OK.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.920
So, today I am going to tell you about the
story in my book, which is a story about how

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.410
I rehabilitated my own vision with the help
of a developmental optometrist in a way that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.530
people thought-- scientists, physicians, thought--
was impossible.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.030
And to understand how that happened, you really
have to go back and think about how, what

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.650
it is that we use our vision for to begin
with.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.650
OK?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.030
And to get at that question, I thought I'd
show you a slide of an animal on the first

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.030
slide.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.640
Does anyone know what this animal is?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.570
You guys need to get out from the building,
and go down to Cape Cod, and scoop your hands

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910
under the pier.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.709
And you'll see these little animals that look
sort of like a hot water bottle.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.609
This animal is called a Tunicate, or a Sea
Squirt.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.370
And they're actually in the Chordate Phylum,
which is our phylum.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.340
So, they're our distant cousins.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.660
And the reason I am mentioning this animal
to you is because, when it's in its larvae

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.799
form, it's juvenile form, it looks sort of
like a tadpole.

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.160
And it swims about and it has two eyes and
a brain.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.819
And then, when it finds a suitable place to
live, it literally sticks its head in the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.969
sand and converts itself to this adult form,
which is simply a filter feeder.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.920
It just brings in water, sieves water right
through its body, extracting the plankton

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.560
from the water for its food.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.310
But, it never uproots itself again.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.840
It just stays in one place for the rest of
its life.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.999
And in the course of converting itself from
this larval swimming form to the adult sessile

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:09.739
form, it loses its eyes and most of its brain.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.859
Because, you donít need eyes or much of a
brain if you donít move.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.810
The major role of vision is allowing us to
move.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
Think about it.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.389
Organisms that donít move, like plants, donít
uproot themselves to move.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.279
Like, plants donít have eyes and they donít
have a brain.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.620
The major role of vision is to allow us to
know where we are in space, and where everything

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.370
else around us is in space.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.169
So, we can move accurately and manipulate
those objects.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.169
OK?

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.739
So, how do we know how to do that?

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.629
Well, think about if you only had one eye
in the middle of your head, like a cyclops.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.430
Then, I would know for example, that I was
looking out the window on my right, because

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.739
I'd move my one single cyclopean eye to the
right.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.750
And I would know that I was looking, for example,
at the projector more or less straight ahead.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.340
Because I have now moved my single eye to
be straight ahead on my head.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.299
And my head is facing straight forward.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.310
But, we donít have one eye.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.870
We have two.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.870
And the fact that we have two eyes overlapping
visual fields, makes the whole situation both

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.819
more sophisticated, but also more complicated.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.500
So, I want you all to do this little experiment.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.419
Take you index finger and just put it a comfortable
distance from your face.

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.699
But, straight ahead.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.250
Straight in front of your nose.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.800
And now I am gonna ask you, you know you are
looking straight ahead.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.139
You're looking at your finger, which is straight
ahead.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.940
But it's either one of your eyes actually
pointing straight ahead.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.960
Well?

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.979
No.

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.099
You've got one eye that is--.

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.449
Your right eye is pointing a little bit to
the left.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.650
And your left eye is pointing a little bit
to the right.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.729
What is straight ahead, is where the line
of sight of the two eyes cross.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.139
As it's shown in this picture here.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.710
And then, if you follow these lines, and you
imagine this target as you're finger that

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.030
you were just looking at, then, you can see
that the image of the finger is cast on the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.639
retina in the back of the eye.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.880
On the central part of the retina called the
fovea.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.139
But, it's cast on corresponding points of
the two eyes.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.139
OK?

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.620
And, so, your brain makes a conclusion.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.819
It says, "My finger, whose image was cast
on the corresponding points of the retinas

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.780
of my two eyes.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.620
I have two images of that finger.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.449
One from my right eye, one from my left."

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.569
But, those two images are falling on corresponding
points of the two retinas.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.639
And, therefore, there is only one finger there.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.010
Not two.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.379
And more important it's located in one unique
location in space.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.569
OK?

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:07.630
And similarly if we look at this picture here,
the two eyes are bi fixating on the block.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.229
The image of the block falls on the same central
part of both retinas.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:20.490
And, these two toys here, the teddy bear and
the rattle are falling basically in the same

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.360
frontal parallel plane as the block.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.129
And if you look to see where their image is
cast, then, you can see that for example,

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:36.070
the image of the teddy bear is cast to the
right of that central region.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.849
And the same number of degrees to the right
of the central region for the left and right

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.139
eye.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.610
And so, your brain will think, OK, I have
two images of the teddy bear.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.479
One for my right and one for my left eye.

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.860
But, they are falling on corresponding retinal
points.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.900
And, therefore, there is only one teddy bear.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.780
And it's located in one unique location in
space.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.099
And that location on the Z axis is roughly
the same as the point I am fixating.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.599
Where my two eyes are meeting.

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.599
OK?

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.080
Or, the line of sight of the two eyes are
meeting.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:20.150
So, that all works perfectly well, as long
as your eyes point to the same place in space,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.860
at the same time.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.310
But, what happens if they donít?

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.379
And, that was my situation, because, I'd been
cross-eyed all my life.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:35.630
So, when I looked with one eye, the other
eye turned in and looked someplace else.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.770
And, I rapidly switched between which eye
was looking, letís say, straight at you,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.770
and which eye was turned in.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.800
So, the two eyes were not pointing at the
same place in time.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:54.400
And that makes figuring out where things are
located in space, and , how many things there

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.060
are out there.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.120
A much more difficult situation.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:08.430
And in fact there are two major consequences
of having misaligned eyes.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.780
Having two eyes that are not pointing to the
same place in space at the same time.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.840
And one is diplopia, or, double vision.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.030
Which I'll talk about in a little while, And
the other is Visual Confusion.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.520
Which is a term coined by the famous psycho
physicist, Helmholtz, the man who invented

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.919
the ophthalmoscope, and was brilliant in a
bazillion different ways.

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:34.919
He termed the coin term--.Or, he coined that
term.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.919
And, let me explain to you what it is.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.919
Yeah.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.919
&gt;&gt;male #1: When you're talking about not having
you two eyes not pointing--.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.550
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: At the same place.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.801
&gt;&gt; male #1: At the--.

00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.829
In the same direction.

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:50.910
Or, not pointing at the same thing.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.910
Right?

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.910
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Right.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.220
&gt;&gt; male #1: But, assuming that the fields
of vision still overlap, assuming that the

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:02.690
skew is not so large, then you are getting
an image of the two things, right?

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.110
It's just that they're not both foveal, right?

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.329
They're not both in the fovea.

00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:10.970
So, is it really, is there something biologically
intrinsic about the fovea that lets you know

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.579
that that's where the two corresponding images
should be?

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:15.060
Do you not make up for--?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.329
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: It's your reference point.

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:18.860
It's your reference point.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.889
It's the center of the retina for both eyes.

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:24.610
It's where you have the greatest number of
photo receptors.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.029
It's where the visual cortex is paying the
most attention.

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:28.870
So, it's your reference point.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.700
This is the same place in both eyes.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:39.860
And, then, like I showed you in this picture
here, if we use the fovea then as our reference,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.189
then , where other images fall relative to
the fovea on both eyes, becomes important.

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.189
&gt;&gt; male#1: Right.

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:50.310
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: And, when you say is this
an innate biological--.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.930
That seems to be the way it works.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:57.720
&gt;&gt; male#1: So, you don't make up for it by
picking some other point as your reference

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
point?

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.399
Having to use the fovea on one eye, and, use
some ex-foveal point as the reference.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:05.000
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Actually, that is an adaptation
that can develop in people with a long term

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.140
strabismus, and, it's called anomalous correspondence.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.649
And that allows you to use both eyes, and,
look though both of them even though their

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:15.140
looking at different things.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.279
But, yes.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.670
&gt;&gt; male#1: Standard way of dealing with it.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.670
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: It's not.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.560
And, it's also not the first way of dealing
with it.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.410
It's an adaptation that develops over time.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.410
Yes?

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.410
&gt;&gt; male#2: And, then, when you do that you
pick a different point, but, it's always the

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.709
same point?

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:32.860
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Well, that would be if it's
harmonious anomalous correspondence.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.860
[ laughter ]

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.750
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: And that would depend upon
the fact that your two eyes are always misaligned

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.760
to the same degree.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.000
Whether you're looking close, or, you're looking
far.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.820
Which is called comitant stabismus.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.250
If your strabismus is incomitant , meaning
that you, mine was incomitant, meaning that

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.700
my eye misalignment was different looking
close, than further away.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.010
Then, it's harder to develop an anomalous
correspondence.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.829
Because, the two eyes are not in the same
relationship with each other.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:04.829
Looking close and far.

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:09.963
&gt;&gt; male#2: I'll take a guess here and say
if you get harmonious, you get stereo, and

00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:10.963
if you don't get harmonious you get--.

00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:13.700
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: You may have some crude stereo
vision with harmonious correspondence.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.839
But, because images that fall outside of the
fovea are less well resolved, and are seen

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:24.820
less well, it's not the same as combining
two foveal images.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.209
Or, even combining two parafoveal images.

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:29.649
But, that are falling at the same place parafoveally.

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:31.970
The two images are not identical.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.970
Yeah.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.030
What you're getting at right from the get
go, some of the complications and subtleties

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.730
of strabismus.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:46.139
Which most scientists and physicians don't
go so far as to think about.

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:49.670
And, so, they think " oh strabismus, easy
to understand.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.540
They use one to press the other.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.900
End of story."

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.839
And now, you're seeing that it's really actually
much, much more complicated than that.

00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:57.839
OK.

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:02.209
So, anyway, we've got the situation where
the two eyes are pointing at different places

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:04.490
in space.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.130
And I was telling you that there two consequences
to that, diplopia, which means double vision,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.370
and visual confusion.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.230
So, let's start with visual confusion.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.820
And, what I want you to think about is this.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.540
Here's the left eye.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.990
It is fixating on the rattle.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.010
The rattle is falling on the fovea.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.470
The central part of this retina.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.000
Here's the right eye, it's turned in.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.210
Its fovea is not looking at the rattle.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.030
Its fovea is looking at the block.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:41.720
The default way that the brain works, is to
say that the two foveal images must be in

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.759
the same spatial location.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:45.899
The same place in space.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:52.009
So, if one eye is foveating the rattle, and
the other eye is foveating the block, the

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:56.410
result is you see the rattle and the block
in the same place in space.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.180
Which as you can see, would be a fairly untenable
situation.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.019
And, well, you might also think, now, that's
kind of interesting.

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:06.759
But, I could never experience that myself.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:12.190
But, actually, if you do have two reasonably
good eyes and reasonable binocular vision

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.110
we can all experience visual confusion with
the hole in the hand experiment.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.271
Has anyone ever done this?

00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:19.699
It's great cocktail party fodder.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.350
So, do you all have a piece of paper?

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.529
If you donít, I can give you one.

00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:36.130
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: OK.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:44.209
So, what I want you to do is take that piece
of paper, roll it up to about the diameter

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.430
of a toilet paper roll.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.259
So that you can put your right eye through
it and look through it.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:51.870
As in eye spy.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.550
And, then, go ahead and look at me for a second.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:01.160
I want you to take your left hand, put the
right hand, I mean, put the tube over the

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:10.589
right eye, and put the left hand so that it
is toward the very end of the roll of paper.

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:12.700
Not over it, so it blocks your view through
the right eye.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.740
But, next to it.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.860
Open both eyes and tell me what you see.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:24.650
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Do you see the hole in the
hand?

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.410
&gt;&gt;male#3: I donít have stereo vision.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.410
[ laughter ]

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.410
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.610
But, did many of you see something that looked
like this?

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.950
Hole in the middle of your hand.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.019
Was anyone in pain?

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:42.950
So, think about what's happening there.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:48.320
The central part of one eye is seeing the
hole through the tube.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.240
The central part of the eye other can't see
that because of the tube, and it sees the

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.350
middle of the hand.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.670
And so your brain says, "Well, the central
part of one eye is seeing is the hole.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.139
The central part of the other eye is seeing
the hand.

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:06.000
Since corresponding retinal points are seeing
these two different things, they must be in

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.300
the same place in space."

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.769
And, you see the hole in the middle of your
hand.

00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:13.160
And, so, that's an example of visual confusion.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:21.300
Obviously an artificial one, but, it's probably
the most detrimental consequence of strabismus,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.810
is this overlap of things in visual space.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.579
Which makes obviously moving through space
very difficult.

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:29.829
OK?

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:37.160
And then, of course, the second consequence
of misaligned eyes is double vision.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.639
Which some people may have experienced if
they drank a little bit too much.

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.490
Maybe not in this crowd.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.480
And, let's figure out how double vision works.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.680
Again, think about the rattle.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.769
Its image is cast on the fovea of one eye.

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:58.980
But, if the second eye is turned, that image
is now falling on a non-foveal point.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.980
OK?

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.230
On a different place on the retina of the
other eye.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.699
And so the brain says, " I have two images
of the rattle.

00:16:07.699 --> 00:16:10.660
One from my right and one from my left eye.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.620
They're not falling on corresponding points.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.790
So, maybe there are two rattles.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.139
And, they're located in two separate locations
in space."

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:22.339
And that, of course, is double vision.

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:23.889
OK.

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:32.410
So, when I was a child, my strabismus- my
crossed eyes- also called infantile esotropia,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.250
developed within the first months of life.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.730
And as a result I adapted fairly rapidly to
the strabismus.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.509
So, maybe I didnít adapt fairly rapidly,
cause my parents told me a was a really difficult

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:47.000
infant and toddler.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.320
But, I adapted and the way I adapted was to
suppress the input from one eye.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.060
So, I would look with one eye and turn in
the other.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.649
And, pay attention to the input from the straight
eye.

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:06.750
And essentially ignore or suppress the input
from the turned eye.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:13.910
And so, I do not remember many incidences
of seeing double as a child or an adult before

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.390
I underwent my vision therapy.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:22.750
And, but there are people who develop strabismus
- misaligned eyes- later on in life.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.730
And maybe plagued with a continual double
vision.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.530
They always see images as double.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.970
And I was very curious as to what this was
like.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.880
And I had a student with exactly this situation.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:43.590
And, so, one day over coffee I asked her what-
How it was that she coped.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.740
And I want to read for you from a section
from my book about what she said.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:53.110
And, so, it goes like this, "one of my students,
Sarah, developed a form of strabismus when

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.370
she was five years old.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.530
And began to experience constant double vision
in high school.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.820
I wanted to know if she coped.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.970
So, one day over coffee I asked Sarah what
her view of the world was like.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:11.870
" She said, " I see two images, but, only
one is real.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.720
I could be driving and seeing two images of
a car, But, I know which one to steer around."

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.289
"This sounded bazaar.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:22.610
Not to mention dangerous, so, I asked her
how she knew.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.440
Sarah thought about this for a moment and
she tried to put into words came automatically

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.570
to her.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:33.340
Then she said that the car image seemed like
her right eye was in context.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.450
In other words the right eye image of the
car was located relative to other things in

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.450
her surroundings.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.200
To Sarah, it had a defined location in space.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.200
She added that in class, she might see two
images of me at the blackboard.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.770
But, again, only the right eye image was real.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.950
I was curious.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.600
Does my voice come from the image seen by
the right or left eye.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.559
Sarah hesitated but said that, the voice came
from the image seen by the right eye.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:05.330
If I were to shake hands with you, she added,
I could reach accurately for and shake only

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.470
the hand seen by the right eye."If I tried
to use the left eye image, I'd miss your hand.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.520
Itís not that I think about this, I just
reach for your hand automatically using the

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.830
right eye image."

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.330
"I pointed to the coffee mug in front of her.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:25.179
From which of your two coffee cup images does
the delicious coffee aroma come from?"

00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:30.720
"Now that you mention it, she said, It only
comes from the cup image seen by the right

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.830
eye."

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.280
So, think about what Sarah had to do.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.270
She had two images of everything.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.490
She has to interact with the world.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.130
One of those images had to be the interact-able
image with.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.160
One of those images had to be the one that
she reached for or moved around.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.510
And so on.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.190
And so, she--.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:56.740
Her brain unconsciously made a decision about
which of those images was the real image.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.510
And that was the image that was imbued with
all the other physical characteristics.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.390
Like the smell coming from the coffee cup.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.990
Or, the voice coming from me as I was talking
in front of the class.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.170
And again you might say that real-unreal dichotomy;
that seems pretty bazaar.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.670
I can't imagine experiencing it.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.090
Well, we can all experience that too, or,
many of us can who have reasonable binocular

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.090
vision.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.090
And here's the trick.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.850
So, take your hand again, hold up your index
finger, and put it in front of your face.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.770
But, this time don't look at it.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.640
Look at me or look further in the distance.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.400
Can you get a double image of your finger?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.440
OK?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.430
That's called physiological diplopia.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.550
It's absolutely normal.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.460
It's because you're fixating further away.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.620
So, your finger image is falling on disparate
parts of the two retinas.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.620
Perfectly normal.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.620
OK?

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.039
So now, get that double image again and then,
very quickly take your right hand and try

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:55.270
to grab both of those images.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.730
Keep looking in the distance, if you look
at the finger it'll single out.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.150
So, keep looking in the distance.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.150
[ pause ]

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:11.390
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: So, I'm seeing a little bit
of this and this, then ,or maybe this over

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.450
here.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.850
You see what I'm getting at?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.620
Even though you're not walking around with
continual double vision, when placed with

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:25.370
the task of grabbing your finger when you
have two images of it, your brain automatically

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.240
selected one of those images as real.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.070
One of those images as manipulate-able.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.270
One of those images is the one you could grasp.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.640
And, that's the decision that Sarah had to
make on a continual basis.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.130
Until she went to see my optometrist and went
through optometric vision therapy.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.520
And now, her double vision is largely resolved
and she's in Optometry school.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.450
So, anyway, these are some of the consequences
of having crossed eyes.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:22:01.789
And, of course, the third consequence is a
lack of binocular vision, it's a lack of stereo

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:02.929
vision.

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:06.970
The ability for example, to enjoy 3D movies.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:15.570
I made this slide before "Avatar" and the
big 3D movie phenomenon came along.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.860
Many of you have probably used " View Masters
" and you have a sense of what I mean when

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.650
I say, seeing in 3D.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.260
I had three operations on my eyes as a child
to make them straighter.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.409
And, although the operations made my eyes
look straighter, it didnít really change

00:22:32.409 --> 00:22:33.670
the way I used them.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.890
I still continued to look with one eye and
turn in the other.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.760
It's just now, the eye turn is more subtle.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.230
So, most people didn't notice it.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.870
But I remember after my third operation being
given a View Master and everyone else in the

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.790
family seemed to enjoy looking into it.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.120
And, I had no idea what they were seeing.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.200
I mean, Mickey Mouse and Superman looked cute
inside the View Master, but, I didn't really

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.240
understand what it was that they were seeing.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.520
Because, I still continue to see the image
as flat, because I was really only basically

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.090
paying attention to the input from only one
eye.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.090
OK.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.789
So, how does stereopsis, or the ability to
see in 3D work?

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:15.840
Real quickly again, it has to do with the
comparison between the images on the two retinas.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.740
So, letís say your eyes are fixating, are
looking at the point called fix, then its

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.910
image is falling on corresponding retinal
points.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.890
Now, take a look at target.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:34.360
That image is not in the same frontal parallel
plane as fix, but, either somewhere--.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.120
In this case it's behind it.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:42.880
Although we can do an analogous analysis if
it were in front of the point called fix.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.809
Follow the dotted lines and look to see where
that image is cast on the two retinas and

00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:53.290
you can see that image is not cast on corresponding
points.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:24:01.549
This distance, "X", is a number of degrees
from the fovea of the left eye that's different

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:08.230
than this distance, "Y", or angular distance
"Y" number of degrees from the fovea on the

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.230
right eye.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.429
And then, your brain makes new interpretation.

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:15.670
The two images are falling on non- corresponding
points.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.940
There's only one image out there.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.409
It must be in some unique location in space.

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:27.370
And by dint of how it falls on one retina
relative to the other, it assigns it a place

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.470
in space that's either in front or behind
the other image.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:35.790
And, of course that's what happens when you
go to a 3D movie, you're wearing glasses that

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:41.190
present images seen from slightly different
perspectives as if they were seen from your

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.430
two eyes.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:49.080
And your brain then makes that interpretation,
"Oh the image is a little different on the

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.049
two retinas and therefore, it's either located
in front or behind the fixation point.î OK?

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:59.570
So, that's basically how 2D vision works and
obviously if you don't point your two eyes

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:05.610
at the same place in space, if the eyes are
misaligned, youíre not going to see in 3D.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:13.539
And, operations to fix or try and realign
the eyes may not work.

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:16.230
Why may they not work?

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:26.550
Because think about this, think about an infant,
a child by the age of one year has already

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.730
learned how to use their eyes to reach for
things.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.700
You start reaching for things at about the
age of three or four months of age.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.990
Which is, incidentally is the same period
of time when infantile esotropia- crossed

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.120
eyes- first develops.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.120
Makes sense.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.140
If youíre trying to reach for things and
the eyes are not well aligned, you're gonna

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.870
have to do something about it.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.580
And one thing you could do, maybe your eyes
are just a little bit misaligned, but now

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.429
if you misaligned one of the eyes even more,
cross it in even more, it's even easier to

00:25:57.429 --> 00:25:58.480
ignore its input.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.830
So, by the time youíre a year old, you know
how to reach for things.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.970
You have been looking at things from a lying
down position, a sitting position, perhaps

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.580
you're cruising around and walking.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.000
Your visual habits have become imbedded by
the time you're a year old.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.520
And that's why I think surgery on its own
can't fix the problem.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.720
Because, in order for you to learn how to
use your eyes in a different way.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.090
That is point them at the same place at the
same point in time.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.809
You have to be taught.

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:36.270
This is something you learn naturally within
the first year of life.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.490
But, after that period of time, if you've
developed different visual habits, you have

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.120
to learn it in a whole new way.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120
OK?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.289
So, that's the situation that I was in.

00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:49.779
&gt;&gt; male#4: Why do some people block out second
eye images?

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:55.440
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Well, actually, I will tell
you an interesting adaption that I used.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.320
So, when I first-.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.710
I went to see a developmental optometrist
at the age of 48.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.159
I didn't go to see her to gain stereo vision.

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:12.761
The dogma was that if you didnít develop
stereo vision within early childhood, what

00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:17.840
was called the critical period in early childhood,
your brain wired itself up in a way that it

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.080
couldnít rewire.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.800
And, you were permanently stereo blind.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.500
And, I had read all the papers supporting
this idea.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.720
And I used to lecture about that in class.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.549
And I used to tell people, " I'm an example
that shows how well this theory of critical

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:34.549
periods, fits reality".

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:39.580
I was cross- eyed since infancy, Iím stereo
blind.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.320
OK?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:49.289
But, what I'm telling you is; you develop
certain adaptations, like you were asking,

00:27:49.289 --> 00:27:50.640
to be able to see.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.330
And, I'll tell you one adaptation I developed.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.360
I went to see my developmental optometrist
because my gaze was jittery.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360
Especially in the distance.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.399
It was very hard to keep my eyes stable on
anything.

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:03.549
And, so, that's why I went to see her.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:07.769
I really wanted to have more confidence and
competence for driving my children around

00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:08.890
town.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.580
I found it very difficult to drive.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.430
Look at a road sign and then go back to the
road, it just was very hard.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.430
OK?

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.030
That's when I went to see her.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.539
And she told me how it was that I learned
to read.

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:23.230
So, I had trouble learning to read in school.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.460
It took until about fourth grade to catch
up to what other kids were doing.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.330
And, the way I learned to read was this way.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:38.909
When I looked at a book, I would look with
one eye at the letters, and the other eye

00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:43.799
would turn in about fifteen degrees, or, 25
prism diopters.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:46.010
Why fifteen degrees?

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:52.750
Well, if you look at the eye, the image, letís
say the letters, from the eye that was doing

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.659
the reading, fell on the fovea.

00:28:55.659 --> 00:29:03.670
The other eye was turned by fifteen degrees,
so, the image fell on the blind spot.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.880
On the place where the optic nerve leaves
the retina and goes to the rest of the brain.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.409
So, in other words, while one eye was looking
at the letters, the other eye did not see

00:29:13.409 --> 00:29:14.590
those letters at all.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.090
Because, the image of those letters fell on
the blind spot.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.750
What a perfect adaptation.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.779
I can't really claim credit for it . It certainly
wasn't a conscious thing, but, that is eventually

00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:24.899
how I learned to read.

00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.820
But, was by making this adaptation.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:33.500
And, fifteen degrees is a very common degree
of eye turn for people with strabismus.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.500
And it makes sense.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.460
It puts the foveal image of eye on to the
blind spot of the other, a beautiful adaptation.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.929
&gt;&gt; male#5: It takes away almost the double
vision.

00:29:41.929 --> 00:29:42.929
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: It takes away almost the double
vision.

00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:44.250
Especially for what youíre paying attention
to.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.250
What's on the fovea.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.059
And, you might say, " well if you can do that
why donít you just put the two images on

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.059
the fovea?"

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:51.279
But, the blind spot is a much bigger area.

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:55.080
Much bigger target to aim for than the very
tiny fovea.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.080
OK?

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.080
So-.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.660
&gt;&gt;male#6: So, I had lateral strabismus when
I was born.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:09.500
And I had an operation when I was one or something.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.500
It was very painless and I donít remember
a thing about it, it went pretty well.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.500
I still have a problem, I don't know if I
have stereovision or not.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.210
I definitely notice sometimes when I'm really
tired.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:27.039
And, every once in a while something will
click and itís like, um, itís like, uhÖwhen

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.430
I bring the two images together I'll know
it.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.430
I don't know, it's like the second eye is
aligning.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.640
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: That's probably what's happening.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.670
Yeah.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.900
We could- I have some tools you could try
afterwards and see.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.410
&gt;&gt; male#6: So, Maybe it's gotten better since
then.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.820
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah, well, you can probably
tune it up.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.809
You can probably tune it up.

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:51.170
But, yeah, I think your experience of the
double vision, or the eyes looking in, that's

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.639
an example of getting them into better alignment.

00:30:55.639 --> 00:31:00.310
&gt;&gt; male#6: So, why not do the surgery for
infants?

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.310
Instead of--

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Well, the surgery is more
successful if it's done on a child before

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.090
the age of one.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.820
Before, like I said, the visual habits become
entrenched.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:15.230
But, it's hard to catch a child at that young
an age.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.400
And there's risks to doing surgery on a very
young infant.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.480
And there may be- Those are some of the issues.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:31.200
And usually surgery alone, if a child does
develop stereopsis, stereo vision afterwards,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.309
it's not as good as the normal stereo vision.

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:38.830
So, vision training at the age when they would
have been old enough to do it would still

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.679
probably be recommended.

00:31:40.679 --> 00:31:45.649
But, yeah those are some of the issues out
there.

00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:46.649
OK.

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:52.019
So then, the question is I've sort of explained
to you the problem.

00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:55.450
And now, I want to give you a little bit of
an idea of the solution.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.510
How did my optometrist teach me to use my
two eyes together?

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.600
To point at the same place in space at the
same time.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.019
And to do that, one of the tools that she
used--.

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:12.179
By the way, she was a developmental optometrist,
which is a small set of optometrists who work

00:32:12.179 --> 00:32:14.320
on this optometric vision therapy.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.950
Vision therapy to train binocular vision.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.490
And they're a very rare group of eye doctors.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.139
To be distinguished from ophthalmologists
who do surgery.

00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:26.139
OK.

00:32:26.139 --> 00:32:29.350
Different types of eye doctors with different
types of expertise.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.809
OK.

00:32:30.809 --> 00:32:36.100
So, one of the techniques that she used was
developed by my hero.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.950
A man named, Frederick Brock.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.130
Who passed away in 1971, I never did meet
him.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:47.059
But what Frederick Brock understood was that
stereovision, the ability to see with two

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:50.309
eyes, is not a passive process.

00:32:50.309 --> 00:32:57.630
For most of us, if you have normal binocular
vision, when you look at something close,

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.850
you automatically turn your two eyes in together.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.690
Make a convergence movement.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:08.570
So that the image is close that you want to
fixate, falls on corresponding retinal locations

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.549
on the fovea of both eyes.

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:14.720
When you then shift your gaze to something
further away, you turn out, or diverge the

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720
eyes.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.620
These are vergence movements.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.919
They develop in children within the first
two, four, months of life.

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:26.899
Or, if youíre like I was, and had infantile
esotropia, they don't develop.

00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:27.899
OK?

00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:30.850
And so, I basically had to learn how to make
vergence movements.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.669
I had to learn something that most people
learned at two months of age and I learned

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:37.269
at the age of 48.

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:40.430
And one of the tools that I used was developed
by Frederick Drove Brock.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.159
And I wanna stress that's it's only one of
many.

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:46.149
But it was my absolute favorite was the "Brock
String" and that's the string you all have.

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.340
Do you all have a--?

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:52.240
Well I have some others if there's somebody
here who needs one.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.790
And there's more.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.960
[ pause ]

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.130
OK.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.420
So, here's what you do.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:10.510
Take the bead on the Brock String, which is
basically a household piece of string.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.690
And put it all the way to one end.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.690
The string should be about arm's length.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:23.290
Put the string up to the bridge of your nose
and look at the bead.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:27.860
And, hopefully you see one bead.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.630
But how many string images do you see?

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.610
&gt;&gt;male#7: Six.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.100
[ laughter ]

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:39.160
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: How many string images?

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.820
Do any of you see two string images?

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.820
OK.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.320
Now take the bead and put it in the middle
of the string.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.380
For some of you it might be easier if the
bead is closer to your nose, some further

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.380
away.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.610
But put it at about the middle of the string.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.700
Look at the bead again.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.160
Hopefully again you see it as single.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.980
And now, tell me, do you see something that
looks like this?

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:12.440
So, you see a bead in the middle of an "X"
configuration right?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.040
Where there are two images converging on the
bead and then two images diverging away from

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.860
it.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.100
Well when I first began to do this exercise
I was overwhelmed.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:29.700
Because, this exercise told me where my two
yes were pointing in space.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.870
It told me the line of sight of the two eyes.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.610
I didn't know what eye I was using at any
one time.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.030
I didn't know how I used my eyes.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.470
I had to bring that information into conscious
awareness, in order to be able to change the

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.300
way I moved my eyes.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.500
OK?

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.400
And this exercise gave me that information.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.230
So, when you were looking at the bead, this
string image was actually the image coming

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.580
from your right eye.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.730
And this was the image coming from your left.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:05.390
And when I started the procedure, The only
way I could get that double string image and

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.850
the " X ", was if the bead, and this is very
common in somebody with my condition, infantile

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:15.730
esotropia, the only way I could get the "X"
is if I put the bead practically up to my

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.900
nose.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.230
Within an inch of my nose.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.510
And then I could get the "X" image.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:27.170
And then I started gradually moving the bead
further away from me, getting that "X" image

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.290
and keep going on.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:33.350
Sometimes I'd see only one image of the bead,
and one image of the string.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.350
What did that mean?

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.080
I was suppressing one eye.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.900
Sometimes I saw both images of the string
but they werenít coming in at the bead.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.520
So, I knew that I was turning on the input
from both eyes but they weren't aligned.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.860
Well with this feedback, so simple, yet so
elegant, I could learn how to point the two

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.400
eyes at the same place in space at the same
time.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.050
And I didn't stop with a little string like
this.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.300
I ended up using an eleven foot string.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:10.670
And, with five beads along it and I would
look at the close bead and get the " X " and

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:15.130
then look at the further bead, and the next
bead, and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:22.020
And this way, training my eyes to bi-fixate
on different distances in space.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.520
And, I still do these exercises on a regular
basis while jumping on a trampoline.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.550
Or striding along on a NordicTrack, because
if I am going to be binocular I need to be

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.550
binocular.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.060
Not just when I am standing still, but when
I'm moving.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.370
OK?

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:44.760
And I wanna tell you about the time- And I'm
remembering it was February 21st, 2002.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.040
I remember this day like it was yesterday.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.630
When I was doing vision therapy at my developmental
optometristís office with a vision therapist,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.060
I did therapy for a year.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.120
One week for a year.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120
Once a week for a year.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.260
And practiced at home every day.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:07.390
And the exercise was to look at a close bead,
and I had just gotten to a point where I could

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.780
do that very well with a single bead.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.180
And now I graduated to using two beads.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.110
And the therapist said "OK, look at the close
bead."

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.930
I said yep I got it, got the "X."

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.580
Now, she said, "Look at the further bead."

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.551
And I looked at her and said, ìYep, I got
the ëXíî "Now look at the close bead, now

00:38:24.551 --> 00:38:27.720
look at the further bead."

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.570
And I said to her, ìI can feel my eyes movingî.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.420
I could feel them turning in to see the closer
bead.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.220
I could feel them turning out together.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.400
In coordination to see the further bead.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.600
I said to her, I feel my eyes moving.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.770
And, she said, "That's great.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.950
We'll do it a little longer then we'll move
on to another activity."

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.140
I said to her, ìNo, I don't wanna stop.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.490
I just wanna keep doing this.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.300
I just want to feel the way this feels.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.830
I want to remember how this feels, so I can
use this, when I don't have a Brock String

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:05.540
with me.î And, it was that afternoon, after
that vision therapy session, that I went out

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:12.711
to my car and sat down in the driver seat;
and I looked at the steering wheel, and it

00:39:12.711 --> 00:39:15.900
was floating in front of the dashboard.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.970
With this palpable volume of space between
the steering wheel and the dashboard and I

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.500
had never seen anything like that before.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:29.330
And I thought to myself, could this be stereo
vision?

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.330
And then I thought , no way.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.330
I'm a neuroscientist.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.950
I know what I teach in class.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.750
It was the day after my 48th birthday.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:43.060
I was more than 40 years past the critical
period for the development of stereopsis.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.720
This had to be something different.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.170
The sun was setting, and I thought, oh the
sun is casting the light into the car at an

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.170
odd angle.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.190
And this must explain what is going on.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.300
[ laughter ]

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.410
OK.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:40:00.400
But the next day I went out to my- I did my
vision therapy exercises in the morning, including

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.790
the Brock String, and I went to the car to
drive to work, and I went to address the rear

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:09.420
view mirror, and it was floating in front
of the dashboard.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.050
And, all that day my vision began to change.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.720
And all that month.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.750
Well, there were many other vision therapy
exercises that I did.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.170
I'm not going to go through them here now.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.490
Because I just want to tell you, you can ask
me some more about them afterwards if you'd

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:25.840
like.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.560
Because I just want to tell you what it's
like to first see the world when you can point

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.840
two eyes at the same place in space at the
same time.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.350
It was a remarkable change.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.560
One that I could never have predicted.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.370
That is certainly not in the textbooks where
they look at stereopsis as just a little frosting

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.460
on the cake when it comes to vision.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.910
It completely transformed the way I saw.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:50.050
So, take trees.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:55.170
All of a sudden I could see- I always knew
that trees, the canopy of a tree was round,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.170
right?

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.570
But I never saw it that way.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:02.150
To me a tree was like a kid's drawing, it
was just flat looking when you looked at it

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.340
front on.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.690
And now, all of a sudden, I could see how
the outer branches enclosed and captured whole

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.560
volumes of space through which the inner branches
came through.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.940
It was just absolutely spectacular.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.240
Snowfall.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.550
My first snowfall , David referred to that,
was just unbelievable.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.000
My first snowfall in stereo.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.860
Because I could see how each flake occupied
its own region of space, And there were these

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.070
palpable pockets of space between one flake
and another.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.090
And all together they produced a beautiful
three dimensional dance.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:45.100
One of the things I mention to people, because
it seems to- people seem to relate to this,

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.760
with my view of a mirror.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.270
In the past when I looked at my reflection
in a mirror, my image was on the plane of

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.061
the mirror, not behind it.

00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:56.930
It was on the plane of the mirror.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.471
So much so, if there was a speck of dirt on
the mirror, I thought it was on my clothes,

00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:04.310
and would try to wash it away.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:09.720
And I remember the day when I looked in a
mirror and my image was no longer on the plane

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.870
of the mirror, but somewhere behind it.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.640
In reflected space.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.630
And that's when I understood what " Lewis
Carol " meant when he titled one of his books,

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.030
" Through The Looking Glass."

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:26.820
When I look through a window now, instead
of having the image just sort of flattened

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.100
onto the--.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:33.770
Within the frame of the window, I now see
it in three dimensions extending great distances

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.700
beyond the window.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.800
That was a real revelation.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.580
And I am still confused by reflection.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.810
Because if youíre sitting- One day I was
sitting in a restaurant, and it was Christmas

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:51.610
time and I am sitting here, and to my left
on the opposing wall of the restaurant was

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:52.870
a bunch of lights.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.320
Christmas lights.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.530
Which were reflected by the window onto the
street outside.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:04.220
And I looked outside and I saw the reflected
lights not on the plane of the window, but

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.220
somewhere out there in space.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:10.650
And I thought, why did they string Christmas
lights in the middle of the street.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:17.040
And then, of course I realized what was going
on, I'm totally captivated by the way reflections

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.290
have this three dimensional field to them
that I had never appreciated before.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:28.370
There were some surprising consequences of
seeing in 3D that went beyond just that the

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.680
sense of depth.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.340
That sense of pockets of space between things.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:39.280
And that one was edges in objects perhaps
because now I could locate them so much more

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.280
precisely.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.380
Took on a sharpness and a definition that
I never seen before.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:50.880
So take this painting for example, by Ingres
which is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.580
in New York.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.490
And, take a look at the creases and folds
in the princess's gown.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:01.540
I used to look at a painting like that and
think, "Gosh it's gorgeous", but, nobody sees

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.540
that way.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:11.910
Nobody actually sees the crinkles and the
creases with such sharp definition.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:16.800
And then, after my vision changed, yes indeed,
I did see them that way too.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.940
So, edges and borders became much, much sharper.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.230
We have a way of understanding depth called,
motion parallax.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:33.970
Which means that as you move like this, back
and forth, images close to you appear to move

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.060
at a faster rate than images further away.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.930
And also, in an opposite direction of images
further away.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.380
And that gives you a sense of depth that you
can see with one eye.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:49.540
But even that sense of depth was greatly enhanced
when I had this special quality of stereovision.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.260
The pockets of space between things.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.620
And my peripheral vision improved.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.980
How?

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.560
My awareness of things in the visual periphery
improved.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.560
Why?

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.730
Because when youíre cross-eyed your vision
is inefficient.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.360
You're looking with one eye and you have to
suppress the other.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.310
And so, as a result, you take in less of the
visual world.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:18.581
Once I resolved the conflict between the two
eyes, because that's the major problem with

00:45:18.581 --> 00:45:19.850
strabismus , not lack of stereo.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.260
It's a visual conflict between the two eyes.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:26.960
Once I resolved that conflict, by pointing
the two eyes at the same spatial location

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.900
, then I could take in more of the visual
periphery.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.950
And so when I'm driving, I now notice that
there's a rear-view mirror off to my upper

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.950
right.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.980
Which means that I tend to look at it more.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.970
which makes me a much better driver.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:49.190
And finally, I just want to add that many
people will say to you, "Oh, I understand

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.740
what you're saying, it's all very cool.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.870
But if I do this, I close one eye, the world
doesn't look all that different.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:58.460
So I don't really understand why you think
it's so wonderful, this stereovision business."

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:04.230
And, I puzzled about that for a long time,
until the day, about three years after my

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.690
vision began to change, when I went to see
the last Star Wars movie.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.130
The Revenge of The Sith.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.460
With my kids and my husband.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.170
It was in 2005.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:19.870
And they insisted we go on midnight of the
opening night, and I was not in the least

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.720
bit interested.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.710
Star Wars was OK, but not worth staying up
all night for.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.380
And being in a theater with screaming kids
and all of that.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.380
Right?

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.180
But, my husband said this is a great family
activity.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.350
So off we went at midnight to see the movie.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:40.210
And I'm looking at the movie and I'm getting
this incredible sense of the spaceships moving

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.210
through space.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.500
And volumes of space in the move, and all
this sort of stuff.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:52.740
And I thought, ìWow, cinematography has really
improved since the last Star Wars film.î

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.330
And it was only until I had a good nightís
sleep that I realized that cinematography

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.260
wasn't all that different between Star Wars
V and Star Wars VI.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.500
What had changed was my own visual perception.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:10.470
That that sense of space and volume that I
saw in the movie was due to clever tricks

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:15.650
by the cinematographers using binocular depth
cues and motion cues, to evoke the sense of

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:19.160
depth, to evoke a sense of space and volume.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.860
But, I couldn't appreciate that deep sense
of space and volume which was suggested by

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.990
the movie until I had actually seen it in
real life.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:34.380
And so, when you just close one eye and you
look out on the world, you still have a lifetime

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.800
of stereo experiences to fill in that missing
stereo information.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.510
But I never had that.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:46.970
And when I began to first see in stereo it
was a radically different experience.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:52.080
And so, I'll just end by saying that some
of you may know, well, you probably don't

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.080
know.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.480
My husband between 1992 and 2005 was an astronaut.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.580
He flew on the space shuttle three times.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.730
And his space launches were absolutely spectacular
experiences.

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:08.080
This is a photo of his first launch in 1996,
it was a night launch.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.420
Incredible noise and lights and sounds.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.640
And you can feel the pressure waves of the
shuttle.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.540
Amazing experience.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:20.450
But, even that pales in comparison to first
seeing in stereo depth.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.450
So, thank you.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.450
[ applause ]

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.450
More questions?

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:30.400
&gt;&gt;male#8: So remind me the retina moves with
the eye right?

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:43.690
Like when you move the eye to look in different
directions, the retina moves along.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:44.690
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Yes, it does.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.590
The turning point is a little in front of
the retina.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:53.190
&gt;&gt;male#8: So, the eye and the brain is actually
using the eye position to figure everything

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.190
out?

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.190
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:56.190
And that's been a very controversial subject.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:01.020
But they've now found areas in the brain that
are monitoring the position of the eye.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:09.030
So they have found that and there are receptors
in the tendons of the eye, called palisade

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:15.870
endings, where there are sensory receptors,
for looking at how the eye is positioned in

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.270
the orbit.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:22.510
And then of course your whole vestibular system
in the inner ear is devoted to how is your

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:25.700
head positioned on your neck.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.410
So, yeah.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.320
It's very important for you to know where
your eyes are.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:39.910
&gt;&gt;male#8: Yeah, I was wondering, I mean, if
the retina was fixed and you were just [inaudible]

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.010
from an engineering standpoint.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.330
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:46.550
No, it's not.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.550
Yeah?

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.670
&gt;&gt; male#9: So, it seems like--Iím just assuming
somebody has two eyes--there is, some place

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:56.460
back in here is a correlator that basically
says, ìYesî, when the two images are viewed.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.460
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: I think you're right.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:03.960
&gt;&gt; MAM#9 : So, listening to your talk here
makes me wonder that if the young child who's

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.960
eyes wont-.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.930
The trouble is that the correlator is broken.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.730
The correlator isn't working right.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:15.160
And I was wondering if the reason you contradicted
the doctrine.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:22.420
You told me earlier you would use one eye
and then use another.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.420
So, you were basically training both eyes.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:29.780
During the plastic period you did the right
things, as opposed to what most people do.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.770
You talked about they'd go fifteen degrees
off, put it on the blind spot, turn one eye

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:35.450
off and then that eye just doesnít get trained.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.900
And that's why they never do recover.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.900
Is this-?

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.540
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Well, yeah this makes absolute
sense.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.440
What you're talking about, where somebody
always uses the same eye for fixation, and

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:52.060
always turns the other, causes the condition,
strabismic amblyopia.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.360
Which is sometimes commonly termed, "Lazy
Eye."

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.670
But actually, there are several different
reasons why somebody can lose vision in one

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.140
eye, which seems to be brain related.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:08.140
That is they didnít lose vision because there's
a problem with the eye itself.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.270
The cornea, the lens, or something, or the
retina.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:15.710
And so what youíre talking about is a condition
called strabismic amblyopia.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:21.340
And youíre right, if you remain, if you alternate,
like I did, alternating strabismus.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:26.460
Then the acuity in both eyes stays relatively
good for both eyes.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:32.780
If you become, if you use only one eye for
fixation and turn in the other, become an

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.210
amblyopic, then the acuity in one eye goes
way down.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:38.450
But it actually passed the critical period.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:43.560
That also can be greatly improved.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.700
And you can get it back.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.140
I'm not saying it's easy, but you can.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.830
And there also these intriguing stories.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:53.400
I know one man, this happened to him.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:59.760
Strabismic amblyopia like I just described,
then he lost vision in his good eye.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:08.810
And, in a large percentage of cases where
that happens, vision in the amblyopic eye,

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:14.220
which can be awful, can sometimes recover
all the way back up to twenty- twenty.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.970
So, it's as if the brain has suppressed that
input all these years.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.140
But, when forced to use it, it can come back.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.970
This doesn't happen in every case, but it
happens in enough of the cases to make one

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:29.390
realize that, that eye is not completely unsalvageable.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:36.760
And now that scientists have embraced the
idea that vision can improve past the critical

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.710
period, and maybe they can change the name
of the critical period to something less critical.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.710
[ laughter ]

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:48.080
You know, call it a sensitive period, or the
period of maximum plasticity.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.600
Once people realize that there are studies
that are called "perceptual learning studies",

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:58.900
and guess what they found, gee, you take a
person who has a weak eye, an amblyopia, and

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.850
you do specific exercises with that eye it
improves.

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:09.730
And so you can bring back the acuity, and
probably what's even more important, is teaching

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.140
the person how to coordinate the two eyes
together.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:17.300
Because, if you don't do that, even if you
bring back acuity in the amblyopic eye, but

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.710
the two eyes still aren't working together,
you are going to lose that acuity again.

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.460
Cause you're not using it.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:26.420
You have to teach the person how to use the
two eyes together.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.420
Yeah?

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:31.310
&gt;&gt; female#1: What makes somebody one-eye-dominant?

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:36.900
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Many of us, probably most
of us have an eye that is dominant.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.460
And, it's actually a very confusing topic.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.160
So, for example, you may have one eye that
is dominant for certain viewing distances,

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.520
and the other eye dominant for other viewing
distances.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:57.270
So, it varies from person to person.

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:02.220
And from condition to condition, which eye
may be dominant.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.641
You can all do this test, you can take your
arms and make a little window with them, like

00:54:06.641 --> 00:54:08.000
this.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.580
And then look at a very distant object.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.970
Smallish object like the clock or something.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:17.080
And then close one eye, and then the other.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.460
And the image should jump when you close one
of the eyes.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.902
And should not jump when you close the other.

00:54:20.902 --> 00:54:22.530
You have to look in the distance.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.760
Because what you're trying to do is make the
window so narrow, that basically only one

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.770
eye can look through it at any moment.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.540
Yeah.

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:36.270
Then if you close one eye and the image jumps,
that means that was the dominant eye for that

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.530
viewing distance.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.450
I don't know what makes an eye a dominant
eye.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:49.240
&gt;&gt; male#10: How about when a child is young
and they're having trouble, and you're concerned

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.250
that maybe they go flat the rest of their
lives, has anybody ever tried putting a patch

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:52.250
over the dominant eye?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.400
To force the-.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.050
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah, they've been doing that
for 200 years.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.510
&gt;&gt;male#10: Does it work?

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.960
It sounds so easy.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960
[ laughter ]

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:05.470
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: I would say there are better
approaches, but that is the standard of care.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:09.340
But, is not the best approach from everything
that I've seen.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.510
And the reason is this, that usually when
a child is suppressing one eye the problem

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.910
is not the eye itself.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:18.720
The problem is with binocularity.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.660
They donít know how to use the two eyes together.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:25.490
Train them how to use the two eyes together
and they will use the two eyes together, and

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:28.000
the acuity in that eye will get better.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.670
So, if you patch the good eye and you leave
the weak eye to do all the visual processing,

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.870
you'll bring up its acuity.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:44.070
But, then when you stop patching, at least
the records show, that about, I forget now,

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.470
is it 30 percent?

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:50.870
A good percentage of kids who's acuity has
gone up in the weak eye, lose that ability.

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.870
And-.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.010
&gt;&gt;male#10: So it works but itís not guaranteed,
so itís not--

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.010
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Right.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.060
Because you're not getting at the basic problem.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.600
The basic problem is binocular coordination
it's not the acuity of the eye alone.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.640
So, you've got to get the eyes to work in
a binocularly coordinated way.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640
To solve the problem.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.640
Yeah?

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:09.780
&gt;&gt;male#11: One vision therapist used Moro
Reflex training as part of the-.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.440
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Yeah.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.210
&gt;&gt;male#11: Can you comment on-?

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.300
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Primitive reflexes?

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.260
Yeah I can comment on it.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.190
So, hereís-.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:29.580
If you are like I was, an infantile esotrope,
it means that something went wrong in those

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.200
first months of life.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.890
Because, you didnít develop normal binocular
vision.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:39.960
So the, the question becomes, is just your
vision that was affected?

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:49.290
Or, are there other probes you can use to
see if there are other neurological problems

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:50.920
that went along with it?

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.060
Subtle ones.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.060
Obviously not as severe as, letís say, cerebral
palsy or something.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.500
But subtle ones.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.400
And sometimes when you start looking, you
look at what a primitive reflex is.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.700
The infant reflex like the Moro Reflex.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.370
These reflexes are prominent in babies.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:13.690
And then, when you grow up, they become in
the background.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.660
You don't use them anymore.

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:22.320
And so, if you take a patient and you test
to see if they are still using primitive reflexes,

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.780
then it may be an indication again that during
that developmental period, when binocular

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.170
vision wasn't developing normally.

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:31.570
There were other neurological things not developing
normally as well.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:40.110
And then, the thought might be, maybe if we
work on those reflexes as well as the vision,

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:44.200
try to get better bilaterality to a person,
maybe that'll help.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.890
So, that's where I think that approach comes
from.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.170
It's an intriguing idea.

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.170
Yeah?

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:56.700
&gt;&gt;male#12: So, I don't have stereovision but
I seem to have more peripheral vision than

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.700
other people.

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.000
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Because you exotropic.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
One eye goes out?

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
&gt;&gt;male#12: Um, probably.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.020
I think, I if I try it, I can.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.020
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Mm-hmm.

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.750
&gt;&gt; male#12: But I seem to have it all the
time.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.450
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Mm-hmm.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:11.860
&gt;&gt;male#12: Is it something that is wrong?

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.100
Because you said you had less peripheral vision.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.100
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Yeah.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.370
Because, you may have-.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:20.570
I had esotropia which meant that when I looked
with one eye the other eye turned in.

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:24.290
If you have exotropia that means when you
look with one eye and the other eye turns

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.450
out.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.290
And you may be taking in-.

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.490
If you think about it, it gives you a wider
visual field.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:32.490
Right?

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:36.030
If you combine both eyes, you've got a wider
visual field.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:40.400
And so, then you are able-.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.510
Then you have a wider visual field.

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:49.540
So the fact is then you might see more peripherally
than a person who has straight eyes.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:58.080
And, in fact, when surgery is done on person
with exotropia, the eye turning out, they

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.310
are upset, because after the surgery they
no longer have this wider peripheral field.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:09.230
Because, that other eye has been more turned
in as well.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:17.010
There's a- I canít remember his name- but
he's the leading base stealer ever in baseball.

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:19.140
And he had this condition.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.380
An intermittent exotropia.

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:27.570
Where he could turn in his eyes and see in
3D, and use that to hit the baseball.

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:34.570
But, when he was on the bases, he could both
look at the picture and look elsewhere at

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.790
the same time.

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:39.079
He could diverge his eyes in that way with
his exotropia.

00:59:39.079 --> 00:59:40.079
[ laughter ]

00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:48.660
And thereby have a better view of the world
and steal those bases.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:55.140
So, there may be advantages to that way of
seeing.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.140
[ laughter ]

00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.780
&gt;&gt;male#12: No, I'm sometimes joking that if
I could get stereovision, I'm not sure I would

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780
want it.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.100
Because I have several aspects that the eyes
work better than--

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.230
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: And that's--.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:07.230
Yeah.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:08.230
Yeah.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.230
&gt;&gt;male #12: than they would most people.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.230
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Right.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.230
And yeah.

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:14.050
So then, it really does become a question
of--.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:16.430
It's a trade-off.

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:22.780
And to get the stereovision, even if you,
let's say, you'd have to work at it.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:28.790
But if you can do both and some can, they
can pull in their eyes and then let them go

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.500
out, then it could work.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.450
But usually, if you're in that situation,
it takes more effort to pull in your eyes

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:36.890
than normal.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:39.240
And so, it's more effort to see in 3D.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240
&gt;&gt;male #12: Right.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.420
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: And so, you're less likely
to want to do it.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.420
Yeah.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:48.280
&gt;&gt;male #13: I understand there's these things
called saccades.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.750
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Yeah.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.750
Rapid eye movement.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.300
&gt;&gt;male #13: I'm looking at that.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.650
I think I'm looking at the space shuttle there,
but what's really happening is my eyes are

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:57.650
going, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:58.650
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Right.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.170
&gt;&gt;male#13: 15 hundred milliseconds or so,
and they're probably, basically, filling up

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.170
a poster board of evidence.

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.140
Well anyway, my first question is, do those
saccades happen same time in both eyes?

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140
So they're eyes are popping together.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.920
And second, I was just wondering if in the
case of somebody with strabismus when theyíre

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
young, that maybe that's not working.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.920
And is there any evidence?

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.680
It would seem to me a very easy thing to measure.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Right.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680
Right.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680
&gt;male#13: Is it the case?

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:29.670
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Well, if you look at saccades,
saccades can be of two types.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:30.860
Conjugate or disconjugate.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.360
Conjugate would mean both eyes going in the
same direction at the same time.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.130
So youíre watching a tennis match in both
eyes.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.930
Swivel to the right when the ball goes to
the right, and both eyes swivel to the left

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:39.020
when the ball goes to the left.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.300
Right and left and right and left.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.350
That's a conjugate saccade.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:48.300
And I don't think there's any evidence to
indicate that that's not normal in somebody

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.540
with strabismus.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.790
When you make a vergence movement, turning
in both eyes to see something close, or turning

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:58.810
them out to see something further away.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:02.830
That actually takes much more time than a
rapid saccade.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:08.760
And by the way saccade are the very fastest
movements we can make, period.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.840
You know, conjugate saccade.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.770
So when youíre turning in your eyes or turning
them out, it takes more time.

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:24.230
Those are also a kind of saccade and those
are not normal in somebody with strabismus.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:26.070
In fact, they may not be existent.

01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:27.140
Yeah.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.210
Yeah.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.140
And those are not normal.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.380
That's basically what I learned to train.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.660
My fusion ranges are wonderful, in terms of
what I can fuse.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:42.940
But, it does take me longer than average to
go from looking close to looking far.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.580
to make the vergance movements back and forth.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.280
So, still working on that.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.280
One last question.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.870
&gt;&gt;female #2: So, I have pretty normal vision
except that I am near sighted.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:59.440
But, it's harder for me, and I think for most
people, to have good depth perception at dusk.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Mm-hmm.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.330
&gt;&gt;female#2: And possibly also at dawn , but
I'm also not as often awake at dawn.

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.330
[ laughter ]

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.370
&gt;&gt;female#2: So, I donít have as much data
on that one.

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:08.810
But I was wondering why that is.

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:12.710
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: I think because you add up
all the cues you use.

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.980
And so, at dusk light is dimmer.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.690
They are all monocular cues to depth.

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:21.150
Perspective, object occlusion.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:27.800
I know for example that, if my hand is blocking
my view of the video camera, I know my hand's

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.250
in front of the video camera.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.340
Object occlusion.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:37.410
Perspective, motion parallax, shading and
shadows, give you a sense of roundness and

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.410
depth.

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:39.410
Those all come from one eye.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:44.170
And you combine those with your sense of stereo
depth to see.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:48.000
And so as those cues begin to fade because
the light is beginning to fade.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.220
Your depth perception is going to go down.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.990
&gt;&gt;female#2: It seems odd though that it's
actually better at night.

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:55.590
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Your depth perception- you're
saying it's better at night.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:01.940
&gt;&gt;female#2: If I am playing tennis with my
dad for example, and it's getting to be evening,

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.370
and so there's still light, you can still
see.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:05.430
I can still see the net.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:12.100
I can still see the line on the court, and
I suck. [ laughs ] and then it gets dark and

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.710
there's a light on the court, and-

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.710
&gt;&gt;Susan Barry: Oh.

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:15.710
I see what you're saying.

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.710
You're getting better.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.710
Yeah.

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:22.070
My guess would be because the light is coming
in obliquely, and casting shadows as a result

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.410
of its obliqueness.

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:27.690
And you're taking real advantage of that and
combining that with your stereovision to see

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:28.690
better.

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.200
That would be my guess as to what's going
on.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.921
Because, I've noticed that too, not so much
playing tennis, but, if I am looking at a

01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:40.890
tree that's in the dark, but thereís a street
light casting light on the tree at an angle,

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:43.920
I'll get this incredible sense of depth now
from it.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.060
Which I think is a combination of the oblique
light coming in setting up certain shades

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.700
and shadows, combines with my stereo.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.740
And it gives me this wonderful sense of depth,
and maybe, that's what you're getting.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.790
So take a look and see what the lighting situation
is like.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:06.360
&gt;&gt;male#14: I have the tennis thing too.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.260
Since I don't have stereovision, I only estimate
where the ball is by the angle in which it

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.260
moves.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.470
So, the light that's coming in and how many
light sources there are plays a big role.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.470
&gt;&gt; Susan Barry: Right.

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:14.470
Right.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.470
Right.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:16.470
Because you're using that oblique light.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:17.470
Yeah.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:18.470
Right.

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:22.030
And I found when I was stereo blind, the worst
thing was having to climb down outside steps

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:23.170
at noon.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.170
You know why?

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:28.090
Because the light is directly overhead , there
are no shadows.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.560
And so, everything flattens out.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.500
Especially if you don't have stereovision.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.640
So, people have asked me for advice about
when you're stereo blind, I said don't try

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.940
to walk down steps at high noon.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.100
[ laughter ]

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.260
Yeah.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.579
Thank you.

01:05:43.579 --> 01:05:44.740
[ applause ]
