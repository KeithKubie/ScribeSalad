MALE SPEAKER: All
right, hey everyone.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.404
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.510
I'm super-excited to introduce
our speaker today Jia Jiang.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.670
Jia Jiang is the author
of "Rejection Proof.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.570
It's his story of 100
days of rejection.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.485
So to conquer his
fear of rejection,

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:19.330
he actually actively sought
out different rejections.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.010
And he had all these
crazy little kind

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.040
of stories going along with it.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.510
So he is also a viral superstar.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.630
He has over five million
views on one of his YouTubes.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.120
So that's going to
be one of his videos

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.780
that he might show you today.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.840
And he's also a member
of our Google family.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.540
His wife is actually one
of our program managers

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.620
in G-tech consumers.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.890
So without further
ado, please help

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.020
me give Jia Jiang a very,
very warm Googley welcome.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.550
JIA JIANG: Charles said
that the introduction

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.010
would be 30 seconds--
actually really good on time.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.200
So you did a good job too.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.410
So if I come here
and tell you, hey, I

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.742
found a solution to one
of your biggest problems

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:08.200
you'll find in
life, whether that's

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.370
your professional
career, academic career,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.120
or personal life.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.440
What are you going to say to me?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.660
You might be like, yeah right.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.960
What are you trying to sell?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.910
Well, you might
reject me right here.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.180
But rejection is precisely
what I'm talking about.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.250
It's the fear of
rejection that's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.670
one of the biggest problems
we'll find in life.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.507
it's a terrible fear that,
yeah, keeps us in line,

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:33.340
makes sure people like
us, and makes sure we

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.860
don't do anything crazy.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190
But it's also the
type of fear that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.670
might keep you asking
from what you want,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.350
getting what you need, and
sometimes even achieving

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.820
your dreams.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.510
And I did find that solution.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.200
But before I go there, I'll tell
you a little bit about who I am

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160
and precisely the
two versions of me--

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.630
we're Silicon Valley,
the two version.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.730
So the version 1.0
is all about gifts.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.030
Who doesn't like them, right?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.010
Well, when I was a
six-year-old, I got my gift.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.680
I was in elementary school.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.330
My first grade teacher
had a brilliant idea--

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.480
brilliant--I'm using air quotes.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.980
She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts as well

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.700
as learning the virtue of
complimenting each other.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.520
So she had all of us come
to the front of the class.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.709
And she bought all of
us gifts just like that

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.000
and stacked them in the corner.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.760
And she said, why
don't we come here

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.610
and just compliment each
other and say nice things.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.050
And if you hear your name
called by another student,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.700
you go pick up your
gift and sit down.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.920
What a great idea, right?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460
What could possibly go wrong?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.840
Well, when he started,
there were 40 of us.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.440
And every time when
someone's name was called,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.870
I would give the
hardiest cheer whether it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.440
was a good student helpful
to teachers and whatever.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.620
And I would just applaud.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.740
And then there were 20 left,
10 left, 5 left, and 3 left.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.600
And I was one of them.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.180
And the compliments stopped.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.100
At that time I didn't want
to compliment anymore.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.760
I didn't want my gift anymore.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.870
I just wanted to sit down.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.420
And I was just crying.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.850
And the teacher though--
she was just freaking out.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.620
And she was like would
anyone say anything nice

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.930
about these people?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.709
No one?

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.292
OK, why don't you
go pick up your gift

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.880
and sit down so you behave
better next year-- someone will

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.370
say something nice about you.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.280
So that was one version of me.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.200
And I would die now to be in
that situation again getting

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.810
embarrassed in front of people.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.270
That's my first
public rejection.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.210
Then fast forward eight
years-- when I was 14.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.400
I grew up in
Beijing, by the way.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.380
And this guy came to
my hometown to speak.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.400
And I heard him talk.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.964
I was in the
audience-- Bill Gates.

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:58.380
I know he's not
that popular here.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.120
But at the time, he was it.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.250
And by the way, I have no
idea why this pictures is in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.260
black and white.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.630
It is 20 years ago.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.700
It wasn't like in
World War II days

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.080
or General Patton was
sitting there or something.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.519
But I guess I didn't have any
Android or iPhone back then.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.140
But he came to my
home town to speak.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.160
I was just mesmerized by
his idea-- by his story.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.270
I loved his idea of using
technology to change the world.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.300
And I just want to be like him.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.960
And that night I wrote a letter
to my family and telling them,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.320
hey, by age 25, I will build the
biggest company in the world.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.650
And I will buy Microsoft.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.960
I just solely embraced this
idea of dominating the world

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.320
and buying everyone.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.300
And then I didn't make this up.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.385
I did write that letter.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:47.343
And here's that letter.

00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.260
The first line says, no, I'm not
going to go through this line

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.759
by line.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.180
But I did highlight
some key words

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.760
so you know what
I'm talking about.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.950
In that letter, I also wrote I
will come to the United States

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.930
someday to fulfill that dream
because, well, first of all,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.250
that's where Bill Gates lived.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.320
Bill Gates was cool.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.460
I wanted to be where he lives.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.820
But also, remember
that year there

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.550
was a movie that was called
"True Lies" that came out.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.930
And that was my-- still my
favorite movie of all time.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.610
In that movie, Arnold
Schwarzenegger he

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.390
was like jumping through
buildings on horseback

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.410
and hanging on helicopters
and saving the world.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.060
And I am like that's America.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.620
That's where I want to be.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.490
So I came when I was 16 under
a cultural exchange program

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.210
as a cultural exchange student.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.740
And so I thought that's
the start of my dream--

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.580
my entrepreneur dream.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.560
And then fast forward
another 14 years.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.710
I was 30.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.030
And I did not build the
biggest company in the world.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.710
I didn't even start.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.110
And even at work, I
feel very stagnant.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.340
I just felt-- I
mean, from outside

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.490
I was doing pretty fine.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.820
I was working in one of the
biggest companies in the world.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.450
And I was collecting
good income.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.950
A lot of people were
asking me for jobs.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.750
But then I-- but I still didn't
do the things I wanted to do.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.910
I didn't go after my dreams.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.410
Even at work, every time I
feel like I have a new idea--

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.010
every time I want to make
a new proposal-- every time

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.280
I want to speak in a
group-- every time I want

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.770
to step up and do
something, I just

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.310
felt there was this constant
battle between the six-year-old

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.490
and the 14-year-old.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.857
One wanted to change the world.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.190
Another was afraid of rejection.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.690
And every time that
six-year-old won out.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.490
And so I just feel maybe
I missed the boat-- maybe

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.060
I got too old.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.160
And so I started my-- this
fear of rejection even extended

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.300
after I started my own company.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.205
I started my own
company when I was 30.

00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:02.580
If you're going
to be Bill Gates,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.420
you got to start
sooner or later, right?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.040
So I started my company.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.520
And four months
into my venture, I

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.450
was rejected with
the investment.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.300
And I was hurt.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.430
I was hurt so bad that I
wanted to quit right there.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.690
I was just having-- I just
thought this six-year-old was

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.880
whispering in my ear again.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.310
Who do you think you are?

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.260
Start ups are for the
geniuses like Bill Gates

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.850
and Steve Jobs or Larry Page.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.700
You are just a wanna be.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.750
And your friends are
going to laugh at you.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.480
And your in-laws are going to
hate you probably even more.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.110
So you should quit and
stop embarrassing yourself.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.030
And that's where
it clicked for me.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.660
And I thought would
Bill Gates give up

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.460
after a simple investment
rejection like that?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.020
Would any successful
entrepreneurs

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.090
give up after rejection?

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.090
Would anyone successful in
their career give up like that?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.460
No way.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.050
So I have to really put
this six year old back

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.060
to his place once and for all.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.770
I cannot let him
dictate my life anymore.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.900
So I found how can I do this?

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.610
How can overcome this
fear of rejection

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.560
that's been bothering
me my whole life?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.040
So I searched online.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.670
Google was my friend.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.030
I just googled how do I
overcome the fear of rejection.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.460
And then I came
up-- first of all,

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.440
I came up with a bunch
of psychology articles

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.429
about where the pain and
fears are coming from.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.880
That didn't say anything to me.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.980
Then I ran through a bunch of
inspirational ra ra articles

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.350
that talks about, hey, don't
take rejection personally.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.340
Just overcome it.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.150
And I'm like who doesn't
know that already?

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.720
If it's that simple, why
was that hurt this bad.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.110
And then I came to a website.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.330
It's called
rejectiontherapy.com.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.000
How many of you have heard of
rejection therapy, by the way?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.180
No one.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.420
Someone has to.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.580
OK, I'll explain this to you.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.590
Rejection therapy is a game.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.110
It's a card game.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.260
It was started by this
Canadian guy-- an entrepreneur.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.800
His name is Jason Comely.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.010
And so, basically,
it's a game that

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.740
is a flash card
game that asks you

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.830
to look for rejection every day
instead of avoiding rejection.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.330
So they give you a
30-day challenge.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.630
So every day it asks you to
get rejected at something--

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.730
maybe just ask strange stuff.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.170
But in 30 days,
you get rejected.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.820
But after 30 days, you
became like a badass

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.350
because you desensitize yourself
from the pain of rejection.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.089
And I just loved this idea.

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:47.380
I thought I'm going to do this.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.900
I'm going to do this not only
for-- not just for 30 days.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.330
And I'll do this for 100 days.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.622
And I'll come up with my
own rejection attempt.

00:09:56.622 --> 00:09:58.830
I'm not going to listen to
what a flash card tells me

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.380
because I have a little
bit of an authority issue.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.680
And so I'm just
using my imagination

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.627
to come up with my
own rejection attempt.

00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:07.960
And I will do this for 100 days.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.920
And I will use my
phone to film it.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.900
And I'll put it on YouTube
to make a video blog or vlog.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.730
And also, I will tell
the world about it

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.400
so they will hold
me accountable.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.690
Otherwise, I would probably
just quit pretty quickly.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.680
So this is what I did.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.170
This is what the
website looked then.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.500
Maybe you can see
rejection one--

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.965
borrow $100 from a stranger.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.230
I was working in
this big building

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.730
in Austin Texas at the time.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.650
And I just one day
I finished work.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.820
I came down I saw this big
guy sitting behind a desk.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.950
He looked like a security guard.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.620
So I just approached him and
as I was a walking toward him,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.830
I could just feel the hair
at the back of my neck

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.140
was standing up.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.220
I was sweating.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.860
My heart was pounding.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.220
And as he came, I said, hey,
can I borrow $100 from you?

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.830
And he looked up me
and was like, no, why?

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.120
And I just turned around
and just said, I'm sorry.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.850
I just ran as fast as I could.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.820
I just felt so embarrassed.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.440
And that night--
but you got to--

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.180
because I was doing the
video because I filmed myself

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.910
with my phone, I had to
experience this twice.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.530
So that night I
was seeing myself.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.640
I had to upload the
video on YouTube, right?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.840
And I just saw myself
frame by frame.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.690
I just saw how scared I was.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.720
I looked like this kid from
the movie "Sixth Sense."

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.790
I saw dead people.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.320
And then I saw this guy.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.740
He was a chubby looking guy.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.480
But he was pretty lovable.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.920
He wasn't menacing.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.880
And he didn't pull out a club.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.850
He didn't use pepper
spray or call the police.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.610
He was just saying no.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.750
And he asked me why.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.491
In fact, he was inviting
me to explain myself.

00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.740
I could have said many things.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.300
I could have said,
well, I'm trying

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.555
to overcome my
fear of rejection.

00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:00.930
That's why I'm
trying to do this.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.700
Or I could have
said, OK, I'm just

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.220
trying to try something new
to see if it's possible.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.680
If you give me $100 and trust
me, I'll give you $110 back.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.760
That's 10% rate of return.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.630
You're not going to get that
in the stock market in one day.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.740
And I worked upstairs.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.823
If you don't trust me,
here's my driver's license.

00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:19.880
I could have negotiated.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.950
I could say if
you can't do $100,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.200
I can do $50--
something like that.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.480
But I didn't do any of that.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.170
I just ran as fast as I could.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.450
And I'm like, wow, this
is a microcosm of my life.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.400
Every time I get
rejected at something,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.370
I would just run because
it was so painful for me.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.740
So I said the next day,
no matter what happens,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.190
I'm not going to run.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.100
I'll stay engaged.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.690
And I'll chat.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.720
So rejection two--
request a burger refill.

00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:54.880
Of course, I didn't
work at Google.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.130
So you can pull this off here.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.671
You get free burgers
if you are here.

00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.230
But I went to a burger joint.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.350
And after having a very
juicy burger for lunch,

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.700
I went to the cashier and said,
hey, can I get a burger refill?

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.230
I was like what's
a burger refill?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.570
Just like a drink refill,
but with a burger.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.640
And he was like, sorry, we
don't do burger refills, man.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.260
And so this is where
the rejection happened.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And I could have just ran
right there like I did before.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.700
But this time I stayed.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.710
I said, well, I love you burger.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.750
It's so good.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.830
If you guys do burger refills,
I'll love you guys even more.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.377
And I'll come back
here every day.

00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:35.460
And it was like, oh, thank
you for the compliment.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.700
But sorry, we can't
do a burger refill.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.670
I'll tell my managers.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.660
And maybe we'll do it someday.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.670
I don't think they ever did
burger refills because I think

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.230
that restaurant is still there.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.290
But when I left that day, that
life and death feeling-- it

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.170
was still awkward.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.400
It was still weird.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.310
I was still nervous.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.360
I was still nervous.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.040
But that life and death
feeling was not there anymore.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.607
So I thought, wow, great!

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:02.690
You know, two days in, I'm
already learning stuff.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.470
If I just don't run,
things can happen.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.730
And I just-- I don't have to
feel the fear if I just stay

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.670
engaged.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.440
Then something happened--
like something strange--

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.070
really strange happened.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.170
People started to say yes to me.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.420
And more than once.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.130
So, for example, let me
see-- rejection six-- play

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.020
soccer in someone's backyard.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.970
All right, so one day
I held a soccer ball

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.455
and knocked on a stranger's
door with my cleats

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.700
and shin guards all decked out.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.990
And I knock on the
door and said, sir,

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.960
can I play soccer
in your backyard?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.020
And he came out .

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.890
And he had this giant
Texas flag on his t-shirt.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.440
People do that in
Texas, you know?

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.900
And he was like
soccer in my backyard?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.520
Then he saw I was all serious.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.660
He saw my cleats.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.190
And he was like, I guess so.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.230
All right, come on in.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.060
I was just confused as ever.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.880
So I went into his backyard
and just bounced the ball

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.590
with my foot and had him
take a picture of me.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.210
So before leaving I said,
how can you say yes?

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:11.320
And he said, this is so off
the wall, how can I say no?

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:18.270
OK, then one day I--
one day I was driving.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.320
I saw a police car.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.800
And I was-- I flagged him down.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.740
I pulled the police
officer over for revenge.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.460
And I said, officer,
can I drive your car.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.840
And he was-- I'm not
going to drive it away

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.200
because if I do that, I'll
probably get in trouble.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.230
But can I just sit there
and listen to your radio

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.124
and feel like a police
officer and give it a spin?

00:15:40.124 --> 00:15:42.040
And he was like, OK, you
look pretty harmless.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.010
Sure.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.370
So I got in a police car.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.000
And then-- in the
front, by the way.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.870
In the driver's seat.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.910
It would be different if
I was in the backseat.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.910
And then one day I said
what is something that's

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.130
so impossible that
someone would-- there's

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.450
no way I would get a yes?

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.490
How about flying a plane?

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:04.430
By the way, I had no license
or courage or knowledge

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.610
to fly a plane.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.690
But I went to an
airfield in Austin.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.020
And I talked to this pilot
guy in the in the lobby.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.340
I said, sir, can
I fly your plane?

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.960
And he was so happy.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.070
He was like, yeah, come on in.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:18.570
Come on in.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.420
I'll teach you how to fly.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.200
I'm like, why?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.370
And it turned out he
didn't own a commercial jet

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.330
liner or something.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.330
He owned a gyro plane.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.250
It's like a small plane--
like a miniature helicopter

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.520
type of thing-- or maybe
like a motorcycle in the air.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.860
And he's an
enthusiast-- a hobbyist.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.720
And he wanted to show everyone
his awesome gyro plane.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.510
So he was so happy
that I approached him.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:50.840
And then there's one day that
my life got turned upside down.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.270
It's never been the same sense.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.840
Day three-- ask for
Olympic symbol donuts.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.750
How many of you
have seen the video?

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.979
Raise your hand.

00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:00.520
A few of you.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.560
OK, most of you haven't.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.916
OK, I got to show
the video then.

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.040
I'll show the full version.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.915
We'll have some time.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.069
I'm driving to a Krispy Kreme.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.710
I'm going to,
well, I don't know.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.329
I just got my hair
cut yesterday.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.890
I look like a Viet
Cong from the 1960s.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.710
It's OK.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.115
I'm going to grow
into it or my hair

00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:25.780
is going to grow
into me either way.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.339
I'm driving toward Krispy Kreme.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:32.880
I'm going to ask them to make
me some specialized donuts.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.557
And we'll see what happens.

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:38.140
JACKIE: What kind of specialized
donuts are you talking about?

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.820
JIA JIANG: I'd like
to have-- getting--

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.620
you link the five
donuts together and make

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.911
them look like Olympic symbols.

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:50.300
JACKIE: And when are
you looking for these?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.780
JIA JIANG: Huh?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.321
JACKIE: When?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.260
JIA JIANG: The next 15 minutes.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.980
JACKIE: How did they
link them this year?

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.075
JIA JIANG: Just normal.

00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:11.950
Normal color is fine.

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:17.615
JACKIE: You want them linked?

00:18:17.615 --> 00:18:18.281
JIA JIANG: Yeah.

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:26.073
JACKIE: I don't know
if we can do that.

00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:29.238
I've got it-- because I
didn't even pay attention

00:18:29.238 --> 00:18:31.460
to the Olympics this year.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.100
JIA JIANG: No, just you got
the five donuts together that

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.540
look like an Olympic symbol.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.739
JACKIE: Was it
this way this year?

00:18:39.739 --> 00:18:41.030
JIA JIANG: Something like that.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.655
That will work.

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:43.159
Just link any five
donuts together.

00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:44.200
It's going to be awesome.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.990
JACKIE: It's going
to take me longer.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.860
JIA JIANG: How long?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.429
JACKIE: Because I've got to
catch them on the other side.

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.345
And then they've got to
go through the proofer

00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:01.995
and then drop in the fryer.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.865
And it was the red,
blue, green, yellow--

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:18.350
what's the other color?

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:23.260
JIA JIANG: Red, green,
yellow-- blue-- maybe white?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.590
JACKIE: Is it white?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.020
JIA JIANG: Could be?

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.980
JACKIE: That sounds right.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.430
Oh, my gosh, I haven't watched
the Olympics in so long

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:38.364
that-- I may not be able to
link them, but maybe make them

00:19:38.364 --> 00:19:40.900
look like they are interlinked.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.210
JIA JIANG: OK.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.309
That would be great.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.975
JACKIE: The only thing
I'm worried about

00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:47.902
is if i try to put those
through the proofer,

00:19:47.902 --> 00:19:49.110
they will unsettle the glaze.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.234
And they'll end up falling.

00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:55.710
And then once they hit the
fryer, you've got a divider.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.185
And if they hit that, they
are going to get stuck.

00:19:58.185 --> 00:19:59.680
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.971
JIA JIANG: If you could make
that, it will make my day.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:17.415
JACKIE: Red, yellow,
green, blue, white, right?

00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:18.040
JIA JIANG: Yep.

00:20:21.864 --> 00:20:23.530
JACKIE: I am going
to see what I can do.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.113
JIA JIANG: OK.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.884
JACKIE: I tried, but
what do you think?

00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:39.680
JIA JIANG: Wow!

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.405
That is really good.

00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:45.856
That is really good.

00:20:45.856 --> 00:20:46.919
Yeah.

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:49.210
JACKIE: That's the best I
could do with what we've got.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.413
JIA JIANG: No, it's good.

00:20:50.413 --> 00:20:51.300
It's good.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.560
It's more than I
thought would be done.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.460
So great!

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.190
All right.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.780
So Jackie?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.360
JACKIE: Yes.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.720
JIA JIANG: All right, I'm a fan.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.480
Thank you.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.960
JACKIE: You're way too kind.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.710
JIA JIANG: No, no.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.070
JACKIE: You're way too kind.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.319
JIA JIANG: You're really good.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.244
All right, so do I pay there.

00:21:15.244 --> 00:21:16.660
JACKIE: Don't even
worry about it.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:16.770
That one's on me.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:17.730
JIA JIANG: Are you serious?

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.230
JACKIE: Get out.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.730
Get out.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.010
JIA JIANG: Are you serious?

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.730
JACKIE: Very.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.230
Extremely.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.940
JIA JIANG: Wow!

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.874
JACKIE: Extremely.

00:21:24.874 --> 00:21:26.650
That's my pleasure.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.322
JIA JIANG: All right, Jackie.

00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:29.930
I'll take it.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.085
But man, you're making
me really happy today.

00:21:32.085 --> 00:21:33.155
All right, thank you.

00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:34.030
JACKIE: Very welcome.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.180
JIA JIANG: See you.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.960
Give me a hug.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.627
JACKIE: Enjoy.

00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:38.960
JIA JIANG: All right, thank you.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.260
See you.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.135
JACKIE: Very welcome.

00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:49.660
JIA JIANG: Wow!

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.540
Sometimes you make
a crazy request,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.860
you get an awesome answer.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:02.550
Jackie who works for Krispy
Kreme in Austin, Texas,

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.150
thank you.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.940
You are awesome.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.990
As for me, I failed miserably
because I did not get a no.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.560
All right, there are
97 more days to go.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.396
Hopefully there are more nos.

00:22:17.396 --> 00:22:20.240
Or hopefully there
are more like this.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.680
It just delights your heart.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.620
This is what it looked like.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.540
That night we had
that for dinner.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.620
By the way, it was
pretty sweet-- too sweet.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.741
But it felt sweeter--
the experience.

00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:40.240
By the way, when
that was happening,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.360
I remember Tracy was calling me.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.170
And she was like,
hey, dinner's ready.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.610
I'm like, hey, just
hold on, honey.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.180
Something amazing is happening.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.170
So I just couldn't believe
the customer service

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.634
or human kindness that
was shown in that movie.

00:22:56.634 --> 00:22:58.175
If you own a business,
don't you want

00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:02.920
to hire someone like Jackie
to run your business?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.580
And the world couldn't
believe that either.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.400
When I uploaded this
video on YouTube,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.930
it got over five million
views in a few days.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.860
And it was on the front page
of like some newspapers-- front

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.150
page of Yahoo.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.080
It was on Reddit.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.170
It was on newspapers--
media across the world.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.510
And "Business Week" even
flew a reporter down

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.660
to find out what I was
doing looking for rejection.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.554
I used to think I
love "Business Week."

00:23:32.554 --> 00:23:33.720
It was my favorite magazine.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.890
I used to think I got to
build this great company.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.080
And I got to become this
famous guy or something

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.860
to actually be on "Business
Week" It happened that day.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:50.090
But the thing is some sort of
internet fame didn't really--

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.190
is not what I wanted.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.340
What I wanted was really helping
myself to overcome my fear.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.320
But also I wanted
to do research.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.470
I want to find out
what is rejection?

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.610
I want to turn this
into a playground

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.510
and to experiment on every
theory I have read in books

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.290
and have heard how to negotiate
and how to communicate.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.970
And, also, I was
hearing stories--

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.990
because this video went
viral, I was getting emails

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.780
and social media comments from
people from all over the world.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.590
And some of them were
sharing their story with me.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.010
And they were
saying somehow what

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.960
I was doing was
inspiring to them

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.060
as if they are living
through this-- their own fear

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.250
through my eyes.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.220
So, for example, there's
an artist in Austin, Texas.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.650
And she saw this video.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.807
And she was like, oh,
that video is nice.

00:24:36.807 --> 00:24:37.640
I love those donuts.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.560
But, hey, I'm a real artist.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.420
She makes art that's
beautiful and profound.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.930
But she didn't share
it with anyone.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.263
She is just like this is my art.

00:24:45.263 --> 00:24:46.100
It's my space.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.470
Then she was like if you
can make that video viral,

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.880
why shouldn't I share my art?

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.690
And she did.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.050
So she shared it was her
friends, family members, even

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.440
the local media.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.130
And it got picked up
by national media.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.390
And she was invited
to go to Washington DC

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.800
to provide a show.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.680
That was really amazing.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.910
And there was this guy-- he is--
he wanted to go on a rejection

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.760
request with me.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.990
He thought this was fun.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.115
He said, can I go with you?

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:14.520
I'm like sure.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.070
So we had this idea
of we go to a bank

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.530
and borrow $100 bills to
play paper plane fight.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.510
It wasn't my best idea.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.240
I had better moments.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.062
But when I-- when I-- so
before going in, he was like,

00:25:29.062 --> 00:25:29.770
hey, don't worry.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.750
I know what to say.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.774
I have a plan.

00:25:31.774 --> 00:25:33.440
At that moment, before
going to the bank

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.280
I just hope that plan
did not involve a gun.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.480
So he went in.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.380
And the teller was like that
sounds fun, let's do it.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.340
So we placed some paper
airplanes in the--

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.980
at a counter.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.850
And I won, I think.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.570
But after coming out, the
guy was telling me wow,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.560
I never thought this
would be possible.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.710
I never tried this
kind of thing before.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.620
And he started
reflecting on his life.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.550
He was like, I wanted-- I
always wanted to have this job.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.200
I wanted to-- I've been
in sales for 19 years.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.890
And I'm really good at my job.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.290
I am one of the best.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.190
But the thing is I want
to try something new.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.340
And I want-- I don't think
I qualify for this job.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.680
But now I want to
try it and just ask.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.860
I want see what happens.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.090
Not only he got a job-- this
is a Fortune 100 company.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.400
Not only he got a
job, he actually now

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.500
he managed the entrepreneur
center of the UK

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.590
for this company.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.350
This is his dream job times two.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.880
So I'm like, wow,
what is rejection?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.980
What is this thing
that, by the way,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.330
I have 100 of these videos
where they're all kind of fun

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.990
if you can get on
my YouTube and see.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.220
I was thinking is rejection?

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.053
What is this thing that
we're all afraid of?

00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:44.880
I thought I was the only one
who was afraid of rejection--

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.040
maybe a few other people.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.240
And it turned out everyone was
afraid of rejection in some way

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.000
no matter how successful they
are or how well they hide it.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.660
But a lot of people were making
some sort of a mindset change.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.460
They started making
some profound changes

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.620
in their lives.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.590
So I started putting
research to work

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.420
and trying to find
out what rejection is.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.870
And it turned out rejection is
more or less a numbers game.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.524
I made some requests that
were totally outrageous.

00:27:10.524 --> 00:27:12.190
And someone of them
would say yes to me.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.230
And I made some requests
that are more like more

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.730
or less borderline OK.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.540
And someone will say no to me.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.300
But the thing is if
you want to get a yes,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.650
I just talk to enough people.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.210
One person will
eventually say yes.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.260
It's almost a as every
rejection has a number.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.160
If I just walk through that
number, a no becomes a yes.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.110
Speaking of numbered,
how many od you--

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.280
do you like Harry Potter?

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.696
How many of you
like Harry Potter?

00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:35.400
Raise your hand.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.752
Good, I like a yes.

00:27:37.752 --> 00:27:39.590
I love Harry Potter.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:44.010
Harry Potter is the bestselling
book in modern history.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.430
I'm not comparing
to the Bible or

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.140
the Koran or ancient history.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.330
But modern history-- Harry
Potter blows every other book

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.560
out of the water.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.660
But you would think a book that
good when it first came out,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.620
it would be something
like a hotcake, right?

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.730
That's not the case.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.860
The author, J.K.
Rowling, she had

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.820
to go through 12
different publishers

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.470
to get her book published.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.000
And every time, they told
her the same the feedback.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.620
they are like, you are trying
to write a children's book

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.730
with dark magic and with
the people dying in it,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.799
and this long?

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.840
Who's going to read that?

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.180
No way.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.110
After the 12th rejection, the
chairman of the publisher,

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.240
I mean, he also gave
her the rejection.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.650
But he handed the manuscript
to his granddaughter

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.400
who could not put it down.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.510
She refused to eat.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.540
She refused to sleep.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.430
She kept reading and reading
until she finished and totally

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.580
exhausted herself.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.370
And the chairman was like,
wow, there's something here.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.170
So he agreed to
publish the book.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.700
And the rest is history.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.410
The thing is to have to J.K.
Rowling given up any of the 12

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.570
tries-- had the
chairman not handed

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.410
the manuscript with those
to his granddaughter,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.770
there would be no Harry Potter.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.719
And there would not be no big
fight between Harry Potter

00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:00.760
and Voldemort at the end.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.590
That would make me really mad.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.450
But think about it.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.275
If Harry Potter had--
if J.K. Rowling had

00:29:06.275 --> 00:29:08.550
to go through 12 different
rejections to get

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.110
Harry Potter published.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:14.940
What about ideas come
up from you and me?

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.750
And sometimes I feel the ability
to fight through rejection

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.220
is almost as important as
coming up with good ideas.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.080
And then rejection
is just an opinion.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.870
I think we need many
things in the world.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.740
Here in California we
need water for sure.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.240
But the world as
a whole-- we need

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.090
love sympathy-- more bathrooms
and free drinks, for sure.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.560
But one thing we really
have plenty of is opinion.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.790
Just get on the internet,
turn on your TV.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.740
Everyone has something
to say about something.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.440
And they can't wait to tell
you about their opinion.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.575
I think opinion is probably
the cheapest resource on Earth.

00:29:52.575 --> 00:29:55.875
It's also completely
renewable too.

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.350
But when it comes
to rejection, it's

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.570
nothing more than the preference
and opinion of the rejector.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.120
It actually says more about
the rejector than the rejected.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.090
So when you make
your request known,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.930
the person sizes you up
and says, yes or no to you.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.370
Or maybe it's a group of people.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:17.441
But that depends a lot
not just solely on you.

00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.690
It says lot about that person.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.760
It could be him or her that
feed-- the mood of the day.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.380
Maybe it's based on
the education that

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.970
come up for a whole lifetime.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.940
Maybe it's his or
her background.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.340
Or maybe it's prejudice.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.936
Who knows?

00:30:34.936 --> 00:30:36.560
But somehow when it
comes to rejection,

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.920
we think it's all about us.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.370
We think it's some
sort of universal truth

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.570
about who we are.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.530
But also it's like an
indictment of our character

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.410
or the merit of our idea.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.080
But it's not.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.920
It's really just an opinion.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.050
And that rejection is a tool.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.390
This is a picture of a dumbbell.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.348
I just have to find a
better picture next time.

00:30:55.348 --> 00:30:57.180
I'm sorry.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.642
But I often tell people if
someone hands you a weight--

00:31:01.642 --> 00:31:03.100
if you don't know
how to handle it,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.550
you're just going to
drop it on your foot.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.258
You're going to hurt
yourself really bad.

00:31:06.258 --> 00:31:08.690
Or you try around and run,
you're going to hurt yourself.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.356
But if you know how
to handle rejection,

00:31:10.356 --> 00:31:13.260
you can safely put it down
on a rack or on the floor.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.550
And better yet, if you
know how to use rejection

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.240
to your advantage,
you can't exercise.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.160
You can use your rejection
to actually gain muscle.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.850
So I did this for 100 days.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.820
Every day I put myself just
outside my comfort zone.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.520
And I went out and asked
and asked and asked.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.970
And gradually my
comfort zone expanded.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.850
And toward the end,
I felt invisible.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.860
I felt I could ask anything
from anyone anywhere.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.612
And so right now
I run online gym

00:31:41.612 --> 00:31:43.070
as part of my
business right now is

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.450
a gym for the mind
where I challenge people

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.210
to go get rejected every day.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.410
And just a couple weeks into
this-- a lot of times people

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.350
can just-- they start
asking weird stuff.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.740
They started negotiating
money off their monthly bills.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.780
They started--
some people started

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.010
changing their hair color.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.490
They started doing things they
never thought they would do.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.720
It just seems pretty incredible.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.780
And they also have ramifications
in their professional career.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.020
They feel they can--
if they are in sales,

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.990
they can sell their
product better.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.370
Or anyone they can sell
their ideas better.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.050
And it's really amazing.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:20.210
I used to think that your
confidence-- your charisma,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.760
or your courage is really
probably born based

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.380
on your personality, right?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.560
But actually,
that's not the case.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.040
In these 100 days, I almost
had a personal transformation.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.980
I became a different person,
I just felt so much more bold.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.470
And I used to hate
the idea of self help.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.520
I still do actually.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.080
I don't think they
do anyone any good.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.930
It's maybe a lot of
late night infomercials.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.050
But in this 100
days, I went through

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.070
a personal transformation that
I didn't need any self help

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.590
book to work with.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.720
And then rejection is also
a source of knowledge.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.310
So that's why I wrote the
book to share the knowledge.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.140
I want to a pretty
good business school.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.380
And I'm sure a lot of you went
to some of the best schools

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:08.921
in the world.

00:33:08.921 --> 00:33:10.790
I thought I learned
a lot about business.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.530
But I can say in this 100
days I probably learned more

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.570
about communication
and human nature

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.810
than I ever did in business
school or any school

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.310
because I put myself out
there talking to real people,

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.120
making really negotiations,
being really weird.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.990
And I learned a whole lot.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.940
So, for example,
I'm share some here.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.070
One thing I learned
is you can actually

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.750
maximize your chance
to get a yes by telling

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.530
the other people a
doubt they might have

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.710
or maybe a weakness
you might have

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.830
in your argument,
in your request.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.710
So I used to be like if I
want to sell a product-- if I

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.040
want to sell an idea or maybe
do a job interview for myself--

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.500
I would just say
how awesome I am

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.500
and how flawless
this product is.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.390
And this idea would be
the best in the world.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.564
But people have doubt.

00:34:02.564 --> 00:34:04.480
And sometimes we don't
even mention the doubt.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.500
They just keep it in their
mind and to your detriment.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.699
And those doubts
will not go away.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.560
But if I mention their doubt
before they would mention it.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.400
Actually, I can totally maximize
my chance of getting a yes.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.070
One day I went to a Starbucks.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.530
And I went in.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.560
And I asked the manager can
I be a Starbucks greeter?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.100
That's from my
days of rejection.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.040
And he was like, what's
a Starbucks greeter?

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.281
I'm like, do you know
Walmart greeters?

00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:31.989
The people who stand
in front of Walmart.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.170
They say hi to you-- make
sure you don't steal stuff

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.370
from them.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.480
I want to try that at Starbucks.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.560
I will give your customers
a Walmart experience

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.540
at Starbucks.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.719
I'm not sure that's
a good thing.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.510
Actually, I'm pretty
sure it's a bad thing.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.777
But he was like,
oh, I'm not sure.

00:34:50.777 --> 00:34:52.110
I mean he was a really nice guy.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.770
He's like I'm not sure.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.719
I could just see his mind is
churning and then asking him,

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.140
is that really weird?

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.350
He was like, yeah, it
was really weird, man.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.440
Then as soon as he said that,
his whole demeanor changed.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.630
Our conversation changed.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.990
And he was like, I think
I'll let you do this.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.840
Just please don't get too weird.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.110
Don't try to sell
stuff to my customers.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.760
So for the next hour, I
was a Starbucks greater.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.620
I said hi to every
customer walking in.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.700
I shook hands with them.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.480
I told them about Starbucks
coffee to my best knowledge.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.610
I gave them holidays cheers.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.640
And by the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.660
But don't be a greeter please.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.890
It was the worst
job I've ever done.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:32.880
It was just boring.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.090
If they have a Google greater
at the cafeteria, please

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.710
don't volunteer.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:43.190
But he was able to let me do it.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.450
And I mentioned, is that weird?

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.630
And the funny thing is by
mentioning is that weird?

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.490
I showed one thing.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:50.390
I wasn't weird.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.070
I showed to him that I'm
thinking just like him.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.350
I know you feel this is weird.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.930
So I can empathize with you.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.760
And over and over again--
this is 100 days of rejection.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.570
If I mention to people I know
I'm asking for a big favor.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.760
I know people don't
usually ask this.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.020
I know this is weird.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.340
If I mentioned that, more than
likely people will say yes

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.590
to me because in a way,
I gained their trust

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.680
by empathizing with them.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.050
Another thing is I learned
I can turn no into a yes

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.520
by asking for some things.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.350
Like, for example, a
magic award is why?

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.400
When people say no
to you, ask why?

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.120
Always.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.060
So one day I went into-- I went
to knock on a stranger's door.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.890
I had a flower in my hand.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.899
And by the way, I
don't know why I

00:36:35.899 --> 00:36:37.190
was knocking on people's doors.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.350
That was fun.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.500
But I said can I plant this
flower in your backyard?

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.380
And he was like, plant
flower map backyard sorry

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.810
could you do that but
before he could turn away

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.330
I said why just
like an mean issues

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.510
this older gentleman
was like, well,

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.820
I have a dog that would dig up
anything I put in the backyard.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.634
And if you want to
do this, I don't

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:00.800
want to destroy your flower.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.646
If you want to do this,
go across the street

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:03.470
and talk to Connie.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.220
Connie loves flowers.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.940
And so I did.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.400
I knock on Connie's door and
talk to her and her husband.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.850
She was so happy to see me.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.599
And I was like, this
is flower is awesome.

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:13.680
Yeah, let's do it!

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.490
So half an hour later, there was
a flower in Connie's backyard.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:21.680
And but the thing is had I left
after the initial rejection,

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.610
I would have thought, OK,
of course she would say no

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.520
because this was really weird.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.840
He probably didn't trust me.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.730
You know, I probably wasn't
good looking enough or whatever.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.640
But it turned out
to be none of that.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.200
It's what I offered
did not fit his needs.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.980
He trusted me enough to give me
a referral, using a sales term,

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.560
and I converted that referral.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.780
So and then I also learned
that you can actually

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:54.230
say no to people in a nice
way that makes them your fan.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.530
I found out that
it's tougher for me

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.321
to say no than get rejected.

00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:01.820
It's tougher for
me to reject people

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.425
than getting rejected
because there's

00:38:03.425 --> 00:38:04.800
a flip side of rejection, right?

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.550
If you say no to people, you
are afraid to feel like a jerk.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.030
You're afraid to be
rejected by them in turn.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.360
So it's the same type
of fear, but just a

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.660
of flip side of the coin.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.550
And so but I learned
that sometimes you

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.360
can say the right thing and
give them the right rejection.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.770
And they can feel pretty good.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.680
So I went through-- tons of--
went though tons of rejections.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.300
Some of the rejections were bad,
meaning will people be mean.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:29.932
But I was OK.

00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:32.140
But there were some rejections
that were really good.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.770
I would just walk
out a huge fan.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.070
So one thing I
learned is you can

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.870
act-- when you reject
people, show them

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.211
an alternative to get a yes.

00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:43.460
So you are showing that
you're not just rejecting them

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.460
as a person, but you are
rejecting their request

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.330
for a reason.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.680
And you're helping them.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.030
And so one day I went to
a Costco-- love Costco,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.816
by the way.

00:38:51.816 --> 00:38:53.690
I went to a Costco and
talked to the manager.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.950
I said, hey, can I speak
over your intercom?

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.880
I just want to say
hi to the customers.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.550
And he said, sorry,
can't let you do that.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.107
But I said, I'm a member--
his membership card.

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:03.690
You can check.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.990
I spent thousands of
dollars here every year.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.370
It was like, wow, you're
a really good member.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.390
But if you want to say
nice things about Costco,

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.482
we can offer you to write a
column in our magazine called

00:39:17.482 --> 00:39:18.190
"Costco Connect."

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.910
I'm sure you get
those in your mailbox.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:23.760
And you can-- we love
the stories from you.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.660
And then so he showed
me an alternative.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.980
And I said, I would really
love to speak on your intercom.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.220
And he's like, are you hungry?

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.320
I'm like, excuse me?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.930
He's like, are you hungry?

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.680
I'm like, yeah, why?

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.050
How about I buy you dinner?

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.570
I'm sorry I can't let you do
this-- speak over the intercom.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.640
But I can buy you
pizza and hot dogs

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.670
and order whatever you want.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.690
And I walk out with a
full stomach that day.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.360
And I became an even
bigger fan of Costco.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.530
And I spent a lot more
money there afterwards.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.710
So I'm sure those pizza
and hot dogs are worth it.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:58.160
Of course, that video got viewed
by tons of people as well.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.350
But the thing is not only
he showed me an alternative.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.480
He also made me a concession.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.270
I mean, concession not--
pizza and hot dogs.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.550
That's not what I mean.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.890
But he made a concession
to give me something.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.850
So how can I feel bad when
I get rejected like that?

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.370
So there are just a lot
of lessons I learned.

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.970
For time-- for reason
of time, there's

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.610
one last thing I
just want to share

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.810
with you is just two words.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.130
Just ask.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.230
This is the most important
lesson I learned.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.050
I remember, I told you flew
someone's plane right once.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.916
It was awesome.

00:40:31.916 --> 00:40:32.540
It was awesome.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.460
When I think about
flying, I really

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.110
think about just going to the
airport, taking off my belt

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.820
and shoes walking through
that security check

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.320
and get scanned by
that bone scanner.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.470
And it will give me
cancer some day for sure.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.750
And just charging my phones--
sitting on dirty carpet.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.930
That's my thought of flying.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.960
That day I flew like a bird.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.090
It was awesome.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.670
And just for one minute,
I was a couple feet

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.180
above the cornfield.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.840
I felt like a seagull looking
for fish above the ocean.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.337
And next minute I was like
1,000 feet in the air.

00:41:06.337 --> 00:41:07.670
There was a cloud all around me.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:08.530
I was kissing it.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.060
I felt like an eagle.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.980
It was the best flying
experience in my life.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.700
I never thought flying
was possible like that.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.120
But then all this
time, there's only one

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.300
thing I could think
about was what

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.150
if I hadn't asked this person?

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.120
I would not have that
amazing experience.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.590
Then in our lives what
if we don't ask stuff?

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.370
Maybe companies
might not be built.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.040
Maybe art may not be shared.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.970
Maybe careers may
not be advanced.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.770
Maybe business
opportunities might be lost.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.070
The reason we don't
ask is because we

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.670
think the rejection is something
so painful and so negative.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.340
And there's a biological
reason for that

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.620
as well going back to our
ancient hunter and gatherer

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.130
days.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.520
But we feel that pain.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.290
We would try everything to
avoid being in that situation.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.460
So we don't ask.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.560
And so by avoiding a negatives,
we're getting positive, right?

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.820
That's actually just a
lie we tell ourselves

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.555
every day because when we're not
going in there getting rejected

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.000
and asking, we're just getting--
we're basically rejecting

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.300
ourselves by default. And we're
getting ignored by the world.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.260
So I just tell you,
no matter what,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.780
don't get ignored by the world.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.180
So what's next for me?

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.350
Remember, I told you about the
story of getting gifts, right?

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.850
Rejection was my
curse-- was my bogeyman.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:33.190
It haunted my whole
life until into my 30s.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.272
But as soon as I stopped
running away from rejection

00:42:36.272 --> 00:42:39.240
and started embracing
rejection, I

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.280
turned this into my biggest
opportunity and gift.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.350
I did my blog.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.270
And the blog I was invited
to speak everywhere

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:52.750
to talk to businesses and
people about overcoming the fear

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:53.660
rejection.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.650
I just published my book.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.330
And then I'm even using
technology right now,

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.090
mobile technology,
to measure people

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.540
how to quantify their fear
and help people to overcome

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.780
their fear of rejection.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.840
So it really became
my biggest gift.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.990
So I want to tell you when you
are getting rejected next time

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:16.240
or maybe when you face a failure
or maybe when you are seeing

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.110
obstacles, just consider this.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.500
This might be your gift as well.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.700
So thank you guys.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.473
Thank you.

00:43:22.473 --> 00:43:24.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:26.725 --> 00:43:28.100
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, so we've

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.740
got some time for questions.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.760
So I'll walk over the mic
to if you have anything.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.510
So feel free.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.700
Just raise your hand.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.040
This has been a great talk.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.915
JIA JIANG: Thank you.

00:43:36.915 --> 00:43:39.890
AUDIENCE: One question I had was
you talked about how rejection

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:41.339
is a numbers game.

00:43:41.339 --> 00:43:43.130
And you tried all these
different requests.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:46.860
It also sounds like
maybe the more outlandish

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.500
the requests, the likelier
it could be granted.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.020
Did you find any trends around
like what types of requests

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.060
usually got accepted
versus rejected?

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.410
JIA JIANG: Yeah, it totally
depends on the other person.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:02.360
Some people are drawn
to the outlandishness.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.200
Some people are
totally risk averse.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.140
They don't want to
deal anything with it.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.734
So it really depends
on this-- it totally

00:44:08.734 --> 00:44:09.900
depends on the other person.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.477
I couldn't make the same request
to so 10 different people.

00:44:12.477 --> 00:44:15.060
And they gave me-- each one of
them gave me different answers.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.410
So I don't have a
statistical analysis

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:21.790
on the outlandish of the
request versus normalness.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.850
And sometimes it is the reverse.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.690
So I think it really
depends on the other person.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.920
But the idea is the same.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.190
If you ask-- one thing I know.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.730
If I haven's asked, I
would have had no yes.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.630
So, all right.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, so
I guess like out

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.320
of all these of your
100 days of rejection,

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.290
which one is like
the most surprising

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.360
or your favorite rejection?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.550
JIA JIANG: I had a
lot of favorites ones.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.311
And also the other
people's favorite ones

00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.560
when they watch all the video
are different from mine.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:03.900
Mine was to one day
I walked into OK,

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.250
so here's some background.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.080
I come from a
family of teachers--

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.780
four generations of teachers.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.300
And it's like my family legacy
is all about being a teacher.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.269
So my grandma once
told me hey, Jia,

00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:17.060
you can be anything
you want in the future.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.330
But it would be great
if you were a teacher.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.680
How about that for pressure?

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.732
And so but the thing is-- I
don't want to be a teacher.

00:45:23.732 --> 00:45:24.940
I want to be an entrepreneur.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.950
I want to do business.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.265
But it's also a dream of
mine to teach a college class

00:45:30.265 --> 00:45:32.140
because I want to teach
something and fulfill

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.370
that family legacy.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.440
So I said in this 100 days,
I can ask anything I want.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.750
This is my playground.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:38.680
This is my chance.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.824
So I walk into-- I walk into
UT Austin-- University of Texas

00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:45.240
in Austin and started knocking
on professor's doors trying

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.540
to teach the class.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.600
And I said, can I
teach your class.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.060
And then a professor
saw-- saw me.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:52.870
He was intrigued.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.080
He first thought I was
trying to sell him something.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.320
I said, no, I'm not.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.530
But I'm trying to
teach your class.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:59.690
He was like what?

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:00.820
And then I showed him.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.220
I came in prepared.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.360
I had my tablet with me.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.640
I had my lecture all loaded up.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.950
I was swiping this through.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.533
And said, here's
what I want to teach.

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:10.830
And he was really impressed.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.710
He was like, wow, I can use
this, no one has asked me this.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.390
I can use you in my curriculum.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.420
This is awesome.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.590
So two months later, he
invited me to give a lecture

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.340
to his students.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.110
And when I walked
out, I was crying

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.550
because I felt this
is something I want

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:32.670
to do maybe later in my life to
build up all of the knowledge

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:38.230
or maybe get a PhD or maybe
I became an accomplishment.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.550
I can do this.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.480
But if I away those
conditioners and just ask,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.250
I made it happen just like that.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:49.210
So it has inspired me a
lot with that experience.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.020
So that's my favorite.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks,
this is awesome.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.615
JIA JIANG: Thank you.

00:46:54.615 --> 00:46:56.160
AUDIENCE: I have a
two-part question.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.720
So the first is
so when you talked

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.710
about being rejection proof,
do you-- did you do anything

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.740
to semi-protect yourself
from rejection so

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.610
to prepare yourself
for the rejection

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:08.885
when it was happening?

00:47:08.885 --> 00:47:10.260
Like you didn't
want to walk away

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.994
from the situation
like so hurt or upset

00:47:12.994 --> 00:47:14.410
that you couldn't
come back to it.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.868
JIA JIANG: Yeah,
the idea is I want

00:47:15.868 --> 00:47:18.800
to be as vulnerable as
possible because I-- OK

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.220
the my whole journey changed.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:25.600
It started with me wanting to
get rejected and feel the pain

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.610
and desensitize
myself from the pain.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.480
Do you know iron fist?

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.620
That was my idea?

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.890
I am going to hit my hand
against the iron stand.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.080
I want to become iron fist.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:42.500
But then I started seeing
the possibility that people

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.400
might say yes to me.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.320
And that changed
my whole paradigm.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.320
That's-- I would just ask.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.010
And I want to see what happens.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:52.040
And by doing that, I started
putting humor in this.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.450
I started having fun.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.620
And I started not
being afraid anymore.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.790
So that in itself--
the curiosity

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.340
actually prepared me for
the rejection that came.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.810
And in the end, also I
learned that rejection is

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.720
not-- is really not personal.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.280
It's personal for that
person more for me

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.510
because it shows everything
about that person.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.050
There are a lot of Jackies.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:18.000
There lot of Coscto
managers, but also jerks.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.990
It's OK.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.430
I just learn to deal with it.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.930
AUDIENCE: The other
part of question

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.700
was did you notice
that initially you

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.310
were leaning towards people
you thought would say yes?

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:30.289
So did you ever have to self
correct as you were doing this?

00:48:30.289 --> 00:48:32.080
JIA JIANG: Yeah,
sometimes I'd catch myself

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.060
because I wanted to make
sure I don't get off too easy

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.050
because you can manipulate
people to say yes to

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.010
by lying-- by choosing
an easy target.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.070
But this is too easy.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.480
I'm just like gaming the game.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.260
Getting yes is
not what I wanted.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.650
What I wanted was to
learn from rejection.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.030
So yeah, sometimes I don't
pick the most nice guy.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.720
And I just go--
sometimes I do this game.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.830
I'll talk to the number six guy
walking up through that door,

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.112
no matter who that person is.

00:49:02.112 --> 00:49:03.320
It could be a police officer.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.450
It could be a homeless
guy-- whatever.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.062
I'll just talk to that guy.

00:49:07.062 --> 00:49:09.520
MALE SPEAKER: All right, we've
got about five minutes left.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.220
I want to respect your time
just so there are probably

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.950
some of you who want Jia to get
your copy of the books signed

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:18.300
So let's go ahead and
give Jia one last round

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.657
of applause. [APPLAUSE]

00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:20.740
JIA JIANG: Thank you guys.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.470
Thank you.
