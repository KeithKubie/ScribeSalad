1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello freak bitches. Amen.

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:08,090
Did you hear that Nate Diaz wants $20
million for the rematch with Connor?

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,990
Is he and he should get 20 to 30
million. Do you think that it's,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,410
how many paper view buys? Do you
think that that fight would be worth?

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,610
1.5 now. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe more now.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,240
Maybe more now. Cause let
me ask you this, Joe. What,

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,680
what let's say Nate fought, let's say
Nate fights the winner of Kevin Lee.

8
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,470
Tony Ferguson, and they're
the main event pay-per-view.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,640
How many paper you biases Nate
Diaz do without Connor? Well,

10
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:38,820
not as many. Not even close.
Not even close, right? It's,

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,290
it's a big kind of thing. But
the big fight for Connor is Nate.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,510
Like if Conor fought Kevin Lee, how
many pay-per-views would he get?

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,730
[inaudible] he might. You're right.
You look up all condoms writes,

14
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,740
he's never done less than a
million ever. You're right.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,210
So he's the Floyd Mayweather
MMA. Now we freeze.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,730
Oh God dammit. Fight. Goddammit.
Fipass son of a bitch.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,010
Conspiracy theory. Snoop
cat, bitch. It's Snoop cast.

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,650
Okay. They fucked us. We're
sitting here frozen outlet persona.

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,950
We will, Oh my God. Oh,
we're back in low. Done. No,

20
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,890
it's dead. It's dead again.
We've got a streaming issue.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,930
Some shit is going down or there's
such a demand for this. It's fucked up.

22
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:31,730
Like Mayweather, McGregor, they don't
know how to handle the overload.

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,290
They'll expect it. 50 people
and they got a hundred total.

24
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,700
How dare you. Yeah, this is
ridiculous. Um, yeah, but I think Nate,

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,060
rightfully so, she gets that fights
can be the biggest paper of all time.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,000
I really do. I think the trilogies
can be because of, for MMA,

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,530
for MMA framing may because of the
commerce. Right? He's bigger than ever.

28
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,730
Biggest combat sports bad.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,650
That's poor guy. The ref gave
him that cut. But with Nate,

30
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,440
I think that the fight that the,

31
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,790
that's the thing with this fight and
that's why I don't think you're gonna see

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,570
it happen very soon.

33
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,040
Cause both Nate and Connor realize how
much power they have and you can't just

34
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,240
go from with the old rules
anymore. They liked the,

35
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:17,090
the Connor is changed the dynamics of
the fight game for the better for the

36
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:20,060
fighters. It's a great
thing. It is a great thing.

37
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:25,010
I just wonder like how much knee
can actually get. Definitely.

38
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,590
Cause what they say. I think
report said between the two fights,

39
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,810
he made around 2.5 million
to fight him twice.

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,100
Now he made 2 million plus to
fight him both times. Both times.

41
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,100
So it's 4 million. So 4 million
total. That's what I'm reading.

42
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,650
I did not talk to Nate. I did
not talk to you. I read this.

43
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,260
So I thought I made two maybe.
Yeah, you might be right.

44
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,620
Maybe I miss quoted that. So maybe
it's two and two or two and a half.

45
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,780
Two and a half. Either way. So
let's say made four minutes, right?

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,230
There's no way in the world you
can say, Hey Nate, fight Connor.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,850
And the biggest fight of all time trilogy,
Tom's gonna get 40 million during it.

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,970
Two and a half. Again,
there's no way that happens.

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,150
Both guys realize the man to have this
fight and he made $4 million in a year.

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,120
So how much money does he have leftover?

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,570
You probably got $1 million plus just
sitting in the bank doing nothing.

52
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,580
So what do you, you know what I'm saying?

53
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,150
So the dynamics have shifted
towards the fighters for first time.

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,500
Now if you the UFC, how do you
make this work with Connor?

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,190
Because he's not fighting guys anymore
for five 10 million. You can't,

56
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,460
when you have over a hundred
million dollars in the bank
and the biggest star of

57
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,550
all time, what do you think the most
Connor's made in a UFC fight is?

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,600
10 mil PRI you think so 10 12 milk max.

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
So now you think he can get like probably
like 30 at least right at leap ends on

60
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,540
how many paper have you buys
otherwise why are you doing it?

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,433
What if he gets like,

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,400
what if Nate and Connor gets 3 million
pay-per-views it's not out of the

63
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,940
question. It's not,
it's a stretch stretch.

64
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,540
But if Nate can talk the
right amount of shit,

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,250
you know, and people get excited
about, honestly right now for Connor,

66
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,950
what else is there that's even close?
The first fight in MMA. What else does?

67
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,960
The only argument is you can
say Connor's the only drawl.

68
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,760
He can fight Billy from Afghanistan
and still get 2 million paper.

69
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,990
You buys are breaking Millie.

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,500
You let Conor fight Pauline
mal and Naji and Dublin.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,170
See if I'm Connor and I have met Gregor
promotions, I'm going, wait a second,

72
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm gonna fight this monster. Nate
Diaz. He won't pay me 10 million.

73
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,250
You wear Reeboks or I'm
just going to go to Dublin.

74
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,820
Me and Polly sell this 70,000 state
amount. I'm just gonna take all of it.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,640
You have to. He goes,
Whoa, Hey, Hey, do that.

76
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:43,180
He's still got some sort of a, they
must have some sites coming up. Boats.

77
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,250
They have some sort of
a deal for boxing too.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,430
You know they have that Zuph a
boxing shirt that Dana was wearing.

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,210
I might be looking at my skeptical
hip eyes, like the shirt.

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,890
I'd rock it myself cause
I do funds. However,

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,630
a McGregor promotions I'd assume
is Connor's thing. Really.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,490
You think he's in cahoots with the, with
the UFC? I would think he has to be.

83
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,450
I don't think he would make a
deal with McGregor promotions.

84
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:11,530
I think he made a deal with what he's
saying. You can buy that suit for Fox zoo,

85
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,970
for boxing t-shirt. 25 bucks. Why does
it say Dana white, Z for boxing tee?

86
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,900
Does Dana white come with it?
It's false. Every teacher of him,

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,640
this is fake news. Um, I'd rock
that Lockton pay by the way. Um,

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,140
I would imagine he has some sort of a
deal. Okay, so let's say you have a deal.

89
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:29,831
Think about this Joe.

90
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,030
So let's say Connor and Dana have a
deal with the McGregor promotions.

91
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,360
They're like, I your next fight
we're going to co-promote with you.

92
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,940
[inaudible] well, how's
that gonna work now?

93
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,460
So then you promote this
huge fight and Nate's like,

94
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:45,340
hold up if he's going
to make all this money,

95
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,200
like I know where we're
in cahoots with him.

96
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,420
That's the way you mean for the UFC? No,

97
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:51,730
I don't think it would
co-promote for the UFC. No,

98
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,820
but I think it would co-promote if you
had a Pauline Mala Naji boxing match and

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,690
doable and in fucking Dublin [inaudible]
me, Britain. Do you want to see that?

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,380
You've been, I want to see everything,
dude. I want to see snail's race.

101
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,800
That's still ridiculous. The, the fight
is then a Diaz fight. That's the fight.

102
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,620
That's the fight. But is it the
fight as far as the business?

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,420
Cause if Kannan learned
anything from Floyd,

104
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,230
you know that when you fight
Floyd Floyd's the businessman,

105
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,170
he's his own promoter. He's everything.
Comma has his own promotional.

106
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:28,400
Now he's the businessman now. So cotton's
going, listen, what are we doing here?

107
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,840
What do you guys want to do?
Maybe if the UFC contract,

108
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,820
the Connor has runs out, maybe they make
some new, crazy, ridiculous look at it.

109
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,390
That contract doesn't matter if it's
out or not. The game has changed.

110
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,990
Interesting. Yeah, you
don't, there's no way you,

111
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,740
you keep going with that
current contract. No way.

112
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,490
Just found this byte. McGregor,
sports and entertainment limited.

113
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,080
The notorious Conor McGregor and
notorious. Why did you pull that up?

114
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,130
I don't give a fuck this little company
that it's officially exists and they own

115
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,970
these things and it's all Connor stuff.
Yeah, it's registered in his name.

116
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,370
Not mean it could be
like a tee shirt company.

117
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,650
It could be, but it's all these
tech, I don't know. Whatever. Sure.

118
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm sure he's got something. I
mean, must have some sort of a,

119
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,880
but also Dana white. I don't know about
the guys that don't meet with Dana.

120
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:23,210
White's not stupid enough to let Connor
do all this and not be involved in it.

121
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,000
He's only really sure. Make your
own thing, man. Do your thing buddy.

122
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,830
There's no way. Hmm. Interesting.
I know. Interesting. Either way.

123
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,820
Whatever he does. Interesting. I know.
I would like to see them box Paul.

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,960
And while Nate just keeps eating tacos
and going to Cabo doing tequila shots,

125
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,390
I really liked the fight's going to
go away. It's not going to go away.

126
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,200
I disagree. Know fights around the
year that you think that it's so,

127
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:48,861
I don't know, man.

128
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:53,210
I think if Nate wants to just chill
and just train and have a good time.

129
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,380
The fights there in a year? I don't
think so. I think if Connor stays active,

130
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:00,590
I guess with Nate, what's, how are you
going to stay in the limelight? Yeah,

131
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:04,970
he's fighting Nate Diaz again. Uh,
they fought over two years ago.

132
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Kind of hikes, not there. Paulie
Malignaggi in a boxing match in Dublin,

133
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,514
Ireland.

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,900
Legit possibility to get a win
over a two time world champ.

135
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,080
World champion in the second poxy
fight ever two boxing fights ever.

136
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,580
Two world champions making bank.
Come on, son balling. How much,

137
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:27,950
say how much ball was stupid?

138
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,350
How much money do you think you
would get for that fight though?

139
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,390
Not nearly as many more money.

140
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,290
They he'd get fight in eight tiers
with a tougher challenge. Right?

141
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,040
So like what do you think the paper view
would be for a Paulie Malignaggi fight?

142
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,120
What would even be a million bars
for sure. See, that's the thing.

143
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,870
Comic con could play fucking in a
celebrity softball game right now.

144
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,760
A lot of people are going to buy
that bitch. You know what I'm saying?

145
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,760
So him fighting Paulie and there's
all this heat, people are like, God,

146
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,290
he did well against Floyd.
We could see him being poly.

147
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,670
I'd say at least a million. And if it's
your own promotion, what do you make?

148
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:03,030
30 30 40 mil, right? Hmm.

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,530
Interesting. Interesting.
Bring your balls.

150
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:12,480
CARNA bring your balls. He, but
now Paul enlist. Everyone knows.

151
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,510
I probably wouldn't help Paul.
He's talking shit to all the UFC.

152
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,680
Well he should shut the fuck up cause
if you wanted to have a UFC fight,

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,140
he can go over there and get
his brain kicked in. Yeah,

154
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,230
you don't want that in his mind.
Stop talking. You're a boxer.

155
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,040
You're very good boxer. Just shut
your mouth. Just just go after.

156
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,090
There's literally a million people in the
world that could grab you and strangle

157
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,580
the life out of you and there's not
a goddamn thing you can do about it.

158
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,910
Correct. Sorry dude. Like the UFC is
not what you want it and you just don't,

159
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,010
your gun don't talk shit. You will.

160
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,300
They will give you a wrestler and he
will punch your fucking face into pulp.

161
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,050
Well he's not a goddamn thing you can
do about it. No, not a God damn thing.

162
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,170
You think he went towards Tony
Ferguson? That's probably way

163
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,790
he's thick right now, but
what's his weight class like?

164
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,000
45 45 47 yeah. How about you?

165
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,430
You give him Ricardo Lopez.

166
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,450
How about you give yai Rodriguez?
How about that? I mean, yeah,

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,510
you don't want that. Yeah.
God, look at the [inaudible].

168
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,880
Give him a guy that's not the top of
the food. Don't give him Frankie Edgar.

169
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,610
Don't give him Josie Aldo.
You don't need to do that.

170
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,830
You know who he could beat
up though? Oh, cm punk.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,330
You'd start seeing punk probably
fucked him up or cut the fuck up.

172
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:32,220
Imagine what max Holloway would do.
The poly Mala Noche in an MMA fight.

173
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,893
Just imagine,

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,860
just try to just try to wrap your
head around the kind of ass fucking,

175
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,550
I think max went at him on Twitter.

176
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:44,790
Like [inaudible] would
literally kill him. He,

177
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:49,560
if he wanted to want it to literally
kill him. I mean, so it comes Watson.

178
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,280
So what a lot of guys are out there
doing a boxing match against not so good,

179
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,860
not so good. Max has the best shot.

180
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,310
I think max has amazing footwork
and he's a good striker. Very,

181
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,090
very good striker.

182
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,330
Is that excellent time and good discipline
and his endurance is phenomenal.

183
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,920
Cody Garbrandt might
have something to say.

184
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,000
Even at 45 you'd come and fight
Pauly. Be interesting. Be interesting.

185
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,140
But Manoj is a legit world champion
pro boxer. He's a fucking smart dude.

186
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,020
He's a very smart guy. He's one
of the best analysts in the gay.

187
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,330
Like you probably doesn't
need to do all this. Yeah,

188
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,250
well that was one of the things that
people were super concerned about.

189
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,270
Him sparring with Connor.

190
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:24,180
Like he did two 12 round sparring
matches with Connor and Connor.

191
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,140
He did a eight round and a 12 round
eight round to him. And Connor was,

192
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,710
you know, landing some, obviously
some fucking hard shots. Just one.

193
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,460
What we know when we definitely
saw that one straight left,

194
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,170
that fucking clanged him right dead
center in the mug and you see the sparks

195
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:43,440
fly. But also to Paulie's defense.
This was telling Paul like, dude,

196
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,370
let's say I'm retired. So let's
say Cain Velasquez was a case shop.

197
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:50,490
I need you to help me tram it. I need
you to come help. Give me some rounds.

198
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,980
That's not a free ride right there. That
punch. Fuck no, that's not a free ride.

199
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,400
That is the only space we can rough
that. That is your face getting crushed.

200
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,350
But here's the thing,
if I got off the plane,

201
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,470
even from LA to San Jose and Cain wants
some rounds, it Ken goes, Hey bro,

202
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,190
I need you to go five fives. That
ain't happening. I'm here to help you.

203
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,520
Ain't no damn you. Five, five,
one realm set on the side.

204
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,530
And coach was a lot of
ego shit going on there.

205
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,150
I think Connor's team brought Paul
in to fuck him up. That's the reason.

206
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,980
And to go, if he does fuck him up,

207
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,440
we're blasted out there cause
the sell the flight more. Yeah.

208
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:23,410
And that was the other thing that
he said, um, about that is like,

209
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,100
Paul was like, you'd never go
12 rounds like that. He's like,

210
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,640
you never heard of why you didn't
go 12 rounds. Never even in MMA,

211
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,590
I've never heard of someone get
off the plane, go on five fires.

212
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,240
What basically gave him a practice
fight. That's it. And it was,

213
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,420
it was smaller cars parked
because confidence builder,
it also solidified him,

214
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,540
shit, I'm gonna fuck her can box a
little bit. And then Dana blasts it out.

215
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,810
You know, I think it was good. It was
very smart, obviously. I'll see it worked.

216
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,280
Obviously it worked. Yeah.

217
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,260
Six and a half million
pay-per-view buys super balls.

218
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,730
You've created an animal. You've paid
an animal for you. The UFC, the hammer,

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,450
the God to what else the fuck
they have. What else do they have?

220
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,130
Strew versus Covello. I want to see
the full video. I want to give Paul.

221
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,053
He has full do.

222
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,390
You can see the full video where you
probably could get it and watch it,

223
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,670
but don't blast it up until
everybody. Because if you do that,

224
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,970
then you don't have a fight in
Dublin town. Everybody. Oh man.

225
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,931
You know what I'm saying? What?

226
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:21,880
It was like you can't cause let's say
Connor starched him for 12 rounds.

227
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,230
Well then that fucks up the paper.
You buy it. Then we're like, wait, no.

228
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,290
Of course he's going to beat
him bullet. If he didn't.

229
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,070
What if Paulie's telling the truth would
if a Polly's getting the most of them.

230
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,280
See that's why we want this
debate. So you buy the paper view.

231
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:36,250
If you're calling me on
Tuesday, that ass kicking.

232
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,600
You know what I'm saying? Like,
you can't that tapes out though,

233
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,370
but you can't release it cause
it's gonna fuck up the fight.

234
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,400
Maybe see when the security guards
were getting in his face, it's like,

235
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,860
relax dude, I'm a fighter. Yeah,
you just come out. I'm a fighter.

236
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,830
That guy kicked him out. That's what
the fuck you do. That's hilarious. Yeah.

237
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,150
He's like, I'm trying to hype up a fight.

238
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,440
Then he almost got in a fight during the,
uh, when we're doing a, uh, pre show,

239
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,870
cause the fans were
just fucking relentless.

240
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,820
Irish fans were just harassing
them. And then the guy goes, Paulie,

241
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll kick your ass worse than Conor
McGregor did. And then finally Paul,

242
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,410
he goes, fuck this, take this things
off. Goes at him. And so then, uh, Brian,

243
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,010
uh, gets between them. Brian, the
calm Taylor with the shaved head.

244
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,800
And so he's like, no, no, probably
don't do this. And the guy's like,

245
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,310
do something. I'll give you a worse
beaten. McGregor did in the, you know,

246
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,890
his Irish accent, poly
can't get, don't buy us,

247
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,780
spit on him. And then it was
chaos. Scary. Scary for sure.

248
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,260
Getting security earlier in that though.
