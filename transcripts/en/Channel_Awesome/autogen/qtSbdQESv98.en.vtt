00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.110
I'm just saying right now I'd say this
does it slightly better but I'm in about

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
does it slightly better but I'm in about
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.430
does it slightly better but I'm in about
the same point of where I'm just like oh

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440

much it why I this sort of thing just as
 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.140
much it why I this sort of thing just as
a it's like I'm used to kind of seeing

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150

this even an animated well I think

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.530
this even an animated well I think
 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.650
this even an animated well I think
because it's it's a twist as a

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:58.660
because it's it's a twist as a
 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.960
because it's it's a twist as a
legitimate legal I I think it's

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970
legitimate legal I I think it's
 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.430
legitimate legal I I think it's
something even if you put together it's

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440
something even if you put together it's
 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.400
something even if you put together it's
still a nice little twist on it and yo

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.410
still a nice little twist on it and yo
 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.100
still a nice little twist on it and yo

but I feel like this is the beginning of
 

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.000
but I feel like this is the beginning of
a story like somehow we'll get hopefully

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.010
a story like somehow we'll get hopefully
 

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.650

those and that is that that is the
difference between this and carcass with

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:42.849
difference between this and carcass with
 

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:44.460
difference between this and carcass with
core that was the end of the story no

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.470

just

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:52.510
just
 

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.530
just
imagine that like honestly I would have

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:55.540

I said I said everyone came to my

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:11.890
I said I said everyone came to my
 

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.520
I said I said everyone came to my
facebook saying this episode happened is

facebook saying this episode happened is
 

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.320
facebook saying this episode happened is
this that episode and the people I

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.330
this that episode and the people I
 

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.270
this that episode and the people I
talked to said yes it was so as far as I

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:18.280
talked to said yes it was so as far as I
 

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.980
talked to said yes it was so as far as I
know this is the one and seeing how

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:19.990

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:14.590
development with that and sacrificed a
 

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.210
development with that and sacrificed a
minute or two off that yeah so again as

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.220
minute or two off that yeah so again as
 

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.700
