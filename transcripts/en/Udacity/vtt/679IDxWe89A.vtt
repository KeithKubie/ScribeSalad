00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.850
We'll now take a quick look at the other three qualities and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.870
their effect on pipe and filter.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.310
For reliability, okay, the reliability of a pipe and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.420
filter system may be reduced because, the reliability of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.810
an overall system is only as good as its weakest, weakest link.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.750
That is, if any of the filters in the pipeline or if any of the pipes break down

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.970
for some reason, the whole application breaks down.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.420
Safety may also be reduced because of the multiple dependencies.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.020
On the other hand,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.360
it's easier to verify because all of the output comes from a single source.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.190
Security benefits because of the simplicity of

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.190
the architecture increases opportunities for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.460
authentication, encryption and implementation of security levels.
