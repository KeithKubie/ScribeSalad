didn't do it my amygdala did and you

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:38.650
didn't do it my amygdala did and you
 

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.560
didn't do it my amygdala did and you
know unfortunately for them that I don't

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:40.570
know unfortunately for them that I don't
 

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.770
know unfortunately for them that I don't

think that the amygdala can actually
 

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.590
think that the amygdala can actually
commit a crime I think that's possible

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600
commit a crime I think that's possible
 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.020
commit a crime I think that's possible
for crimes to be committed for you know

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.030
for crimes to be committed for you know

complex behaviors to be controlled
unconsciously but it's not the amygdala

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680
unconsciously but it's not the amygdala

hardwired responses so I don't think my

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:06.850
hardwired responses so I don't think my
 

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.460
hardwired responses so I don't think my
expertise can really help them but I do

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.470
expertise can really help them but I do

expertise can really help them but I do
think that there is an argument to be

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:10.810
think that there is an argument to be
 

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.630
think that there is an argument to be
made that you know a person can commit a

made that you know a person can commit a
 

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.140

crime of passion that's outside of their
 

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.390
crime of passion that's outside of their
control because either they're under

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:18.400
control because either they're under
 

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.400
control because either they're under
tremendous stress or other factors that

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.410
 

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.390
cause them to do things that they

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.400
cause them to do things that they
 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.700
cause them to do things that they
wouldn't ordinarily do now the bottom

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:26.710
wouldn't ordinarily do now the bottom
 

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.940
wouldn't ordinarily do now the bottom
line problem is how do you prove that in

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:29.950
line problem is how do you prove that in
 

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.710
line problem is how do you prove that in
this particular case that's what went on

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720
this particular case that's what went on
 

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.990
this particular case that's what went on
or is that just a convenient thing to

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000
or is that just a convenient thing to
 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.270
or is that just a convenient thing to
say after the fact and so that's why I

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.280
say after the fact and so that's why I
 

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.750
say after the fact and so that's why I
try not to get involved in in legal

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760
try not to get involved in in legal
 

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.150
try not to get involved in in legal
things because I don't think i could say

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160
things because I don't think i could say
 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.430
things because I don't think i could say
in one you know one way or another in

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440
in one you know one way or another in
 

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.100
in one you know one way or another in
this particular case or in any case that

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.110
this particular case or in any case that
 

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.560
this particular case or in any case that
this is definitely what was going on but

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:49.570
this is definitely what was going on but
 

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.360
this is definitely what was going on but
I do think the court should take that

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.370
I do think the court should take that
 

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.650
I do think the court should take that
into account and be kind of hip to the

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:55.660
into account and be kind of hip to the
 

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.030
into account and be kind of hip to the
fact that the brain can do things

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040
fact that the brain can do things
 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.830
fact that the brain can do things
unconsciously and should weigh that as

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:58.840
unconsciously and should weigh that as
 

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.080
unconsciously and should weigh that as
part of the evidence so in crime of

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.090
part of the evidence so in crime of
 

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.390
part of the evidence so in crime of
passion the the guy catches his wife

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.400
passion the the guy catches his wife
 

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.740
passion the the guy catches his wife
with someone else and you know kills the

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:06.750
with someone else and you know kills the
 

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.470
with someone else and you know kills the
the other guy and so he's kind of

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480
the other guy and so he's kind of
 

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.670
the other guy and so he's kind of
singing to the wife from prison saying

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680
singing to the wife from prison saying
 

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.440
singing to the wife from prison saying
you know you're not worth what I'm going

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.450
you know you're not worth what I'm going
 

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.820
you know you're not worth what I'm going
through and all this stuff so it's not a

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:16.830
through and all this stuff so it's not a
 

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.579
through and all this stuff so it's not a
it's not oh I loved you so much and how

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:19.589
it's not oh I loved you so much and how
 

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:20.750
it's not oh I loved you so much and how
can you do this to me it's more about

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
can you do this to me it's more about
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.850
can you do this to me it's more about
you know why did I do this you're not

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860
you know why did I do this you're not
 

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.770
you know why did I do this you're not
worth it

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:26.780
 

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.050
basically the reason I'm doing what I'm

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.060
basically the reason I'm doing what I'm
 

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.880
basically the reason I'm doing what I'm
doing now which is trying to integrate

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:30.890
doing now which is trying to integrate
 

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.710
doing now which is trying to integrate
the science and the music into kind of a

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720
the science and the music into kind of a
 

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.380
the science and the music into kind of a
seamless whole it's because music is

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:35.390
seamless whole it's because music is
 

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.630
seamless whole it's because music is
such a powerful communicator I've

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:37.640
such a powerful communicator I've
 

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.040
such a powerful communicator I've
written books like the emotional brain

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.050
written books like the emotional brain
 

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.140
written books like the emotional brain
and synaptic South then translated into

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.150
and synaptic South then translated into
 

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.480
and synaptic South then translated into
dozens of languages each and you know

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:43.490
dozens of languages each and you know
 

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.750
dozens of languages each and you know
they've been really good sellers but I

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760
they've been really good sellers but I
 

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.430
they've been really good sellers but I
think we can reach a different audience

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440
think we can reach a different audience
 

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.100
think we can reach a different audience
with music and so I'm not saying I can

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.110
with music and so I'm not saying I can
 

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.990
with music and so I'm not saying I can
convey as much in a song as I can in a

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000
convey as much in a song as I can in a
 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.420
convey as much in a song as I can in a
book or even a book chapter but I might

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.430
book or even a book chapter but I might
 

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.780
book or even a book chapter but I might
be able to trigger an interesting spark

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:58.790
be able to trigger an interesting spark
 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.880
be able to trigger an interesting spark
or an idea in someone that might be

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:00.890
or an idea in someone that might be
 

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.430
or an idea in someone that might be
prone to pick up a book so well what's

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440
prone to pick up a book so well what's
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.530
prone to pick up a book so well what's
that with what is the mind-body problem

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:05.540
that with what is the mind-body problem
 

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.320
that with what is the mind-body problem
are and how do emotions come out of the

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.330
are and how do emotions come out of the
 

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.060
are and how do emotions come out of the
brain or kind of crime of passion really

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.070
brain or kind of crime of passion really
 

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.510
brain or kind of crime of passion really
be committed and to then you know pick

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:13.520
be committed and to then you know pick
 

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.970
be committed and to then you know pick
up a book or do some research on the

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:15.980
up a book or do some research on the
 

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.410
up a book or do some research on the
internet and just it's kind of like

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.420
internet and just it's kind of like
 

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.000
internet and just it's kind of like
raising awareness of the brain through

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.010
raising awareness of the brain through
 

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.570
raising awareness of the brain through
music and so I do think music is this is

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:22.580
music and so I do think music is this is
 

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.820
music and so I do think music is this is
really powerful but personally I've

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:24.830
really powerful but personally I've
 

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.730
really powerful but personally I've
never been inclined to study its I just
