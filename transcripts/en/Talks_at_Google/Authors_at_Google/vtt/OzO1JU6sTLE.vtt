00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.462
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.462 --> 00:00:03.670
PETER BARRON: Thanks very
much, everyone, for coming.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.520
This is the first talk
at the new building.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.370
It's great to have
such a full room.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.360
And I'm told that larger
rooms will be available, too.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.060
It's fantastic to have
Bastian Obermayer and Frederik

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.030
Obermaier, the so-called
brothers Obermayer--

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.540
although they're not brothers--
from "Suddeutsche Zeitung."

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.610
And they were
responsible for, really,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.310
one of the biggest
scoops in modern times.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.430
Certainly, the story involved
the biggest leak of data

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.200
that we've seen.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.500
I think it was 11.5 million
documents and 2.6 terabytes

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.660
of information.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.480
And a really
extraordinary story that's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.144
told in "The Panama
Papers" book, first

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.560
of all, of how
they got the story,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.600
and then how they
worked on the story,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560
and worked and
shared information

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.280
with a whole lot of
journalists around the world,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.500
and then land really,
really big scoop.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.480
So we're going to
talk about that today.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.640
We'll throw it open to
questions pretty soon.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.010
But Bastian, could
I kick off with you?

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.397
Where did it all begin?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.980
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, to be honest,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.060
it was a very bad day because
my kids were really sick.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.078
And there was a lot of
whining and vomiting.

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:16.410
And I was a little tired.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.310
And late at night,
I got this message.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.740
Hi, this is John Doe.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.330
Are you interested in data?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.310
I'm willing to share.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.070
I was interested.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.500
But at the same time, I knew
I had to get back to my kids

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.870
and make tea and be nice.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.975
But you have to be--

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:36.391
SPEAKER 1: We're going to use--
I'm going to pass you this

00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.110
microphone to use--

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.026
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: OK.

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:38.980
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.604
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: And you also
have to be nice to a new source

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:44.810
because you have to have him--
give him or her the feeling

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.240
that you're really interested
in what he or she wants

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.060
to give you.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.930
So it was a lot of running back
and forth and writing messages.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.930
And in the end, we
got a first batch

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.090
of documents that looked
really interesting, not exactly

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.150
great or huge, but interesting.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.380
And it became more and
more over the next days.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.410
And so it started what is now
the biggest leak of all times.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.395
And it started with only a batch
of documents on a bad night.

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:17.770
PETER BARRON: And when did
you know that you had a story?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.120
Actually, could we
get one more mic here?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.996
That would be great.

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.030
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, I think we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.240
knew that we had
another good story when

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.200
we found the name of the
best friend of Vladimir Putin

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.750
in the data, the godfather
of his first daughter.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.390
And he was in the midst of three
or four Panamanian companies.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.670
And we saw hundreds of millions
of US dollars moved in there.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.560
And we found an interview of
this guy, Sergei Roldugin,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.750
in "The New York Times"
where-- he is an artist.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.460
He plays the violin.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.440
And he told "The New York
Times," I'm not a businessman.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.890
I don't own millions.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.150
So we were sitting
there and seeing

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.960
these millions of US dollars
running through the companies.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.434
And we were like, well,
either he lied or he lied.

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:17.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.880
This is when we knew we
got a really good story.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.630
And it got better
when we started

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.320
finding those heads of states.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.970
In the end we had
like, 13, I guess,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.130
that were directly
named in the papers.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.605
And we had leads, meaning the
[? bankmen, ?] the brothers,

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:37.300
sisters, sons of
heads of states,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.507
in the number of around 70.

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:40.340
PETER BARRON: Right.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.030
So Frederik, normally--
you obviously

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.980
went-- Bastian took the
story, the initial story,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.010
to your editors.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.350
And they put both
of you on the story.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.740
I think you'd worked on
investigations in the past.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.300
But the normal course
of events with a scoop

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.410
is that you keep the scoop to
yourselves and then publish it

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.946
and whatever else happens.

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:06.070
In this case, you went down
a very different route.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.350
Why did you decide to
share it internationally?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.130
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Well, that's
a question some colleagues

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.380
asked us at that time as well.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.140
And they asked us in a
not-that-polite way, more

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.070
asking, are you crazy, guys?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.240
But we have been part of formal
investigations of the ICIJ that

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.180
was stuff like Offshore
Leaks, Swiss Leaks,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.150
and some investigations,
especially--

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.490
Google may know
there was Lux Leaks.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.240
But at that time, we profited
from other media organizations

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.570
handing over data to the
ICIJ, sharing it and giving us

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.560
the possibility to work on this.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.860
And for this time,
it was like, we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.380
were convinced that it's
not only about taking

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.650
but also about giving.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.070
And furthermore, in
this set of data,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.935
we saw that there are so
many links to scandals

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:00.810
all around the world.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.970
Because in the beginning,
it was like, when

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.410
we found a new name, a new
company, well, we googled it.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.610
And sometimes we found
some hits involved

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.720
in a scandal in,
let's say, Mozambique.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.430
And we were pretty
sure from the beginning

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.080
that we wouldn't be able to
report on all these stories

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.420
because the German
readership, for example,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.090
would maybe not be that
interested in a story

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.500
about a scandal in Mozambique.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.810
But it was maybe an important
story for Mozambique.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.390
So we decided to share
it to give, then,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.280
in this case-- or
in this example--

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.570
a journalist in
Mozambique the possibility

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.520
to write about this because the
data may be the missing puzzle

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.664
piece in a huge scandal.

00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.330
PETER BARRON: And at
that stage, did you

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.899
have all the data in order to
keep coming in in extra bursts?

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.190
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: I'm sorry--

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.070
PETER BARRON: Did you have
all the data at that point?

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.660
Or were you-- you continued to
receive more as you went along?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.900
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
That was at a stage

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.720
when we had some hundred
gigabytes of data.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.670
And we really thought,
well, wow, this

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.390
is a huge amount of data because
at that time, the biggest leak

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.040
we knew about was
Offshore Leaks.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.040
And that was, I
think, 260 gigabytes.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.920
And we had about 700 or
800 or something like that.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.290
And we thought, wow, this
is such a big amount.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.150
And the data keep
growing and growing.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.512
So we had to buy new hard disks.

00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:26.970
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Again and again.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.470
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Again and again.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.250
I learned that a hard drive
from two terabytes on you

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.835
need a special plug for
because it doesn't work well

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:37.840
with electricity.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.590
And in the end, we turned
up with 2.6 terabytes.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.780
And for me, it's still-- I'm
not that-- as you may know,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.260
you're tech guys.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.070
But I'm not.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.580
I really had to look up
what 2.6 terabytes was.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.140
And for me, it's like,
still-- well, it's big.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.760
But I still have no
feeling for it-- how big.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.260
PETER BARRON: And
so talk us through

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.470
the whole process of
keeping things safe

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.450
and using encryption
and secure channels.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.920
Because the John Doe-- you've
never met John Doe, have you?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.270
And you don't even
know who he is.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.624
But you talked very, very
regularly to him, Bastian.

00:07:14.624 --> 00:07:16.790
You were talking to him
every day for a long period.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.770
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Yeah, we had
a long-standing relationship.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:27.820
We encrypted communications,
which we switched several times

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.690
to be more safe.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.220
And we got the data in a
way that we obviously fully

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.430
can't tell now.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.890
But it was very
complicated for me,

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.300
a guy who has no clue about
what I was doing there.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.170
And we took all
kind of precautions

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.220
that we could learn about.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.480
So we talked to many
people who helped us.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.020
So we had an
air-gapped computer.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.196
All of the information were
only stored on this one.

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.730
We had a special room
where our bosses weren't

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:10.200
allowed to get in, no security,
nobody except our team.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.190
And we had a safe where we
stored all the hard drives

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.890
in it.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.500
And we even had this nail
polish, this glitter nail

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.610
polish, to put on these
screws of the computer

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.210
so we could see if
anybody tried to get in.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.460
PETER BARRON: Very James Bond.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.376
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Yeah,
it sounds ridiculous.

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.140
And my kids loved
the nail polish.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.610
But we really tried hard
to do all to really protect

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.440
our source.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.070
PETER BARRON: So did your family
know what you were working on

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.690
at the time?

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.220
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Not exactly.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.400
But if you say, my family,
I didn't tell my kids.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.930
They are three and
five years old.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.670
I could have told them--
no, thinking back,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.620
they wouldn't have
understood it.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.810
My wife knew some
because she had to know.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.280
If you're investigating
Vladimir Putin and his buddies,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.120
you better tell this because it
could change your life, I mean,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.700
honestly.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.020
And I think in your case,
it was the same, wasn't it?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.560
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Yeah,
I mean, I really tried

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.330
to keep it as a secret
as long as possible

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.490
because my girlfriend
was working

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.030
in the same business as me.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:27.930
And we are-- journalists are
normally very talkative people.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.550
But in the end, some
months before publication,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.060
it was sure-- we
were both convinced

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.940
that we had to tell our partners
what we were doing because we

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.720
had to speak about security
measures, what even

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.070
our partners had to take
before publication, and even

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.240
after publication.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.360
So, for example, in
my case, my family

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.020
was not in town when this
whole stuff broke loose

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.370
when we published it
because we, at that time,

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.360
we had no clue
what could happen.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.870
In the end, everything
turned out fine.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.725
Well, we had to take
precautions for the worst case.

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.600
PETER BARRON: And this
took many, many months

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.640
to come together.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.030
So how-- what were
the precautions

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.730
that you took to make sure that
the story didn't get leaked

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.990
or that the journalists that
you shared the story with

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.940
would scoop you?

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.750
I mean, you had hundreds of
other journalists involved

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.750
around the world.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.380
That's a scary process
over many months, isn't it?

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.160
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Yes,
and the basic measure

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.200
for us was being
a pain in the ass

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.610
because we always told
them, every colleague

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.350
who was invited to this project,
well, this is very important

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.610
to keep it secret.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.896
Don't tell your girlfriend.

00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:39.020
Don't tell your colleagues.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.380
Don't even tell your
boss what is in there.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.150
And that was not that easy.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.220
And the ICIJ was
even more repetitive.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.890
They repeated it so many times.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.270
But in the end, I think
all of our colleagues

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.970
realized what this
story's about,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.880
and that it's not only about
some very technical issues--

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.470
tax havens, trusts,
limiteds, nominee directors--

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.380
but it's about the lives.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.350
There could be lives in danger,
the life first and foremost

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.070
of the source,
John Doe, but then

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.760
also about-- of journalists
that worked with us on this

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.110
in the Middle East, Latin
America, and Africa, saying,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.010
in countries where it's not
that easy to investigate stuff

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.700
like, well, the best friend
of Vladimir Putin or some drug

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.810
cartels.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.810
I mean, because all
those guys, for them,

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.639
it's not that hard to harm
a person and a journalist.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.430
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.047
And the whistle-blower
came to you guys.

00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:39.630
It was obviously a
German publication.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.842
But he was very keen that
the story would land right

00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:43.550
around the world.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.329
Isn't that right?

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.370
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Right.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.840
One of the first-- well, it
was not really a condition,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.660
but it was a wish
that this person said,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.020
maybe you don't only
publish in German,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.949
because nobody reads German.

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:00.990
PETER BARRON: So why did
he come to "Suddeutsche"

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.810
in the first place?

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.476
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
We don't really know.

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:04.390
We don't really know.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.770
We know now because we have
published his manifesto,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:14.150
as "The Guardian" did, too, that
he or she approached other news

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.610
outlets, too, and didn't get
the real attention of the people

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.500
there.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.680
And Jurgen Mossack, one of the
founders of Mossack Fonseca,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.400
the Panamanian company,
he's from Furth in Bavaria,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.570
in Germany.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.320
So maybe this person
may have thought, well,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.890
if nobody is
listening to me, I'm

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.510
going there where I see a local
connection between this company

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.970
and that country.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.640
And once you're
looking in Germany

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.300
for somebody who was involved in
leaks or in tax haven stories,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.320
you would maybe go to
"Suddeutsche Zeitung"

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.530
because, as he said, we get
Offshore Leaks and Luxembourg

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.100
Leaks and Swiss Leaks.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.380
So this-- if you're
looking in Germany,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.690
it's kind of rational
to talk to us.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.671
But we don't know why he
chose to go to our country.

00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:06.920
PETER BARRON: So tell us a
bit more about Mr. Mossack,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.440
because he's a pretty
secretive figure.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.990
What was his background?

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.184
And what's he doing now?

00:13:15.184 --> 00:13:16.850
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Well, his background

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.050
was pretty strange
for us as Germans

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.900
because we looked at how
this German ended up there

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.760
in Panama.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.730
Panama is very far from Germany.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.950
And we saw that his father, who
was a member of the Waffen-SS--

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.720
so he was a Nazi.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.050
And we ducked into the
archives and found out

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.520
that his father ended up
working for this-- I mean,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.910
he emigrated after the war.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.710
And he ended up in Panama
working there, it seems like,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.090
being an informant for the CIA.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.850
And, well, his sons--
there's not only one,

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.290
but there are
two-- they studied.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.380
And Jurgen Mossack became a
pretty famous person in Panama.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.202
I mean, I went there-- and
if you speak to the people

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:06.910
there in the financial
district, they all

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.030
speak about El Aleman, "the
German," because he's famous,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.990
because he has very
influential friends.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.930
His partner, his partner
in business, Ramon Fonseca,

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.280
was an adviser to the president.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.890
He was a member of the
ruling party in Panama.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.380
So they are people you
don't mess with in Panama.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.380
But at the same
time, in Germany,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.480
they've been pretty unknown.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.760
I think if you would have
asked somebody in Germany one

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.470
year ago, "who is Jurgen
Mossack?" it would be like,

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.770
"Jurgen who?"

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.086
But now, I think some
people may know his name.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.460
PETER BARRON: So
Mossack Fonseca,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.950
what was their business model?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.391
What was their approach to
selling offshore companies?

00:14:54.391 --> 00:14:56.140
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Well, officially, they

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.110
are a law firm.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.270
But their business is they are
setting up offshore companies

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:07.890
all around the world in
whatever tax haven you name.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.420
And then they're
selling secrecy.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.990
So you can talk to them--
well, I want it secret,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.930
I want it very secret, or
very, very, very secret.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.470
And then they put in
nominee directors,

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.540
people that can pretend to
be the real owners if they

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.950
are asked.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:32.100
So it's like, they are helping
you to hide your money.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.250
And it depends on how much money
you do have to hide your money

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.360
and how much you want
to put into this.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.526
They are offering very,
very complex structures.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.400
PETER BARRON: OK, well,
let's talk about some

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.450
of their famous clients.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.480
You mentioned Mr.
Putin's best friend,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.960
also David Cameron's father,
senior executives at Siemens.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.275
How did you discover
who these people were

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.598
and where your stories lay?

00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:05.890
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Well, In the beginning,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:10.170
it was really like
trial and error.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.395
Because when we received the
data, we processed it like,

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:16.820
OCRing it and making
it searchable.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.300
And then it was like,
well, I put in a name.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.710
Bastian is a soccer fan.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.460
And he's a fan of a
soccer team in Germany

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.690
that is not that famous.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.510
It's from Munich, but it's
not the big one in Munich.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.490
So he always googled the
players and former presidents

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.050
and presidents of
FT Bayern Munich.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.730
And we, of course, looked for
Angela Merkel, Helmut Kohl,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.920
and the politicians.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.880
But then we soon realized
that we have to do it

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.120
in a more structured way.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.730
We put up lists like--
the simplest one was well,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.970
all members of parliament
since the founding

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.960
of the German-- of
Germany, so the founding

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.570
of the Federal Republic.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.150
And with this, we
did it on-- we'd then

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.450
look for all the major scandals
in the history of Germany

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.540
after World War II and looked
for the people involved,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.890
the companies involved,
and we had many, many hits.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.280
And so it was a
mixture of making

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.514
fun searches and fun was like,
well, we are here at Google.

00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:18.930
So who are the
bosses from Google?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.660
Then let's search for them.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.160
And--

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.880
PETER BARRON: Zero.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.838
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: We
haven't found it yet, OK.

00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:24.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.940
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: --and doing
the structured way as well.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.840
PETER BARRON: OK, then
let's talk about the impact.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.920
So when the story-- you
kept everything safe

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.690
and then launched the
story internationally

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.850
on the same day.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.042
Tell us a little bit
about what happened next.

00:17:42.042 --> 00:17:43.750
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, we have to start

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.250
with what happened before
this because, I think,

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.710
13 minutes before we
broke it, Edward Snowden

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.430
had it on Twitter,
which we, until now,

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.390
don't know how he did it.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.040
But he learned his job, so
he knew what he was doing,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.230
I think.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.060
And so after this,
it was like a tsunami

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.735
that broke because it
was so many reactions

00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:05.610
from the whole world.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.870
And I mean, you're
used to write something

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.300
if you did Offshore Leaks
and Lux Leaks before,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.800
but we were not used to
having mass demonstrations

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.050
in several countries
because of your story.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.640
And Vladimir Putin
accused us of being

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.260
owned by Goldman Sachs,
which is just a blatant lie.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.950
And you know, the Prime
Minister stepped back

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.610
from Iceland, and
all this stuff.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.060
And we were for three
weeks, we were in a tunnel

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.100
and didn't have the
time to read anything

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.360
or to watch the
films that were made.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.970
It was really a
completely crazy time.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.680
And if you see Barack Obama
in the White House talking

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.320
about that after
Panama Papers, he

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.570
has to [INAUDIBLE] his nation.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.880
It's all like, did
he really say this?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.655
And now, it gets
a little calmer.

00:18:57.655 --> 00:19:00.140
So we can look back
at this, and we can

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.790
start [INAUDIBLE] pieces done.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.840
Our colleagues had
written back by then.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.210
So it was really
very interesting

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.720
what happened there.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.807
PETER BARRON: And have you
heard from your source?

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.390
Have you heard from
the whistle-blower

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.530
since the story broke?

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.030
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Well, as we
have published the manifesto,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.170
we can say that there
has been a contact.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:28.700
And we know that this person is
quite happy about what happened

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.030
and how it played out.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.730
But we do not comment if there's
still any kind of contact.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.133
PETER BARRON: OK, right.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.310
And Mossack Fonseca,
what of them?

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.550
They were rid by the police
from a number of countries

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.420
shortly after the
revelations were made.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.250
Have you heard from them?

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.504
Is there-- are they
continuing to do business?

00:19:51.504 --> 00:19:52.920
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
They're trying.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.220
They had to close
down six offices

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.760
in six tax havens and the
private banking department.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.820
But we don't know
what will happen

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.820
after the raids in
Venezuela and El Salvador

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.010
and in the main
quarters in Panama.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.570
The raid, I think,
took 28 hours.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.490
But we would not
be very surprised

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.140
if their friends in government
will tell us in a month

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.620
that they have
really checked all,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.252
and it's all perfectly legal
and fine and no harm being done

00:20:27.252 --> 00:20:29.970
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Well,
and closing down the offices

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.310
has-- as far as Mossack
Fonseca claims-- nothing

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.930
to do with the Panama Papers.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Sure.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:35.983
PETER BARRON: Pure coincidence.

00:20:35.983 --> 00:20:36.750
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Sure.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.350
PETER BARRON: Tough times.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.772
OK, questions from
the audience--

00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:40.730
who would like to ask
the gentlemen a question?

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.402
Over here.

00:20:42.402 --> 00:20:44.110
SPEAKER 1: Please wait
for the microphone

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.560
on this-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:50.930
AUDIENCE: So
firstly, I would like

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.060
to say that I think this is a
great thing that this leaked

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.890
and that you wrote about this.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.506
After these papers were leaked
out, I think a lot of people,

00:20:58.506 --> 00:20:59.880
including me, were
really excited

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.050
that things might
change in this respect

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.810
and that these people
would have to be taxed.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.820
But it seems that
since the publication,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.950
nothing has happened
on the global scale.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.740
So it seems that-- I'm
assuming Mossack Fonseca is

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.790
going bankrupt slowly.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:19.640
But overall, there's no
changes in taxes or anything.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.260
Or maybe I am wrong,
and they are happening?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.780
So what's your view on this?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.960
Are you happy with
the things that

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.310
happened since your publication,
or were you expecting more?

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.020
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Well, I mean, we

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.620
are journalists, not activists.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.020
So for us it was like,
well, we published it.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.390
And now let's see what is
happening and report about it.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.880
But I'm not that pessimistic
because we have already

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.040
seen some changes.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.080
We have seen Panama
agreeing to be

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.040
part of the automatic
exchange of information.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.500
That's something they
denied in the past years.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.750
We have the US
leaders discussing it.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.600
We have an Inquiry Commission
from the European Parliament

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.280
now.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.330
There are investigations
in dozens of countries.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.860
So I think that's some
movement going on.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.830
And we do hear from
the offshore business

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.920
that they are not
feeling really good.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.600
Because it was-- also, we
reported only on one law firm.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.850
And there are many companies
offering the same services

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.090
all around the world.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.610
We do see that they are feeling
a little bit nervous because I

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.190
think now they realized after
all these leaks-- I mean,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.120
Offshore Leaks, Swiss
Leaks, now this one--

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.970
they realize that they
cannot feel safe anymore.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.012
So if your business
is selling secrecy,

00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:38.470
and you do see that
there have been

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.070
several leaks in
this field, well, you

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.260
should think about if it's still
possible to keep your stuff

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.370
secret.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.570
And I think we have to
look closely now what

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.480
is going to happen.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.670
And it's not only to us as
journalists, it's to all of you

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.880
to stick to this
topic, where I must

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.920
admit that may be,
at first glance,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.940
not that sexy because
speaking about tax havens

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.690
seems technical at
the first glance.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.840
But you always have
to be aware that's

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.980
an issue that regards all of
us because there are billions

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:26.370
of dollars or pounds missing for
all of us if taxes are evaded.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.950
And at the same time,
it's not only about taxes.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.930
Its about criminals
hiding their wrongdoings

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.280
using offshore companies.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.140
It's people like the cousin
of Bashar al-Assad evading

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.780
sanctions by using
those companies.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.360
So this is something
that is very

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.702
important for every one of us.

00:23:46.702 --> 00:23:47.868
PETER BARRON: Next question.

00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:56.740
AUDIENCE: Well,
thank you very much.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.730
I wanted to ask about--
because, I guess,

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.220
that the first impression-- or,
I don't know, for many of us--

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.480
was that this
whistle-blower was kind

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.910
of a hero that revealed this.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.200
And now, because of him, we
can know about the whole issue.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.680
Did you consider the
possibility that the guy maybe

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.650
didn't have the good intentions,
like, he was whistle-blowing

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.350
the bad guys, but there were
even worse guys behind him

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.820
or something like that?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.090
I mean, how do you consider
whether this is a good thing

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.710
to do or not, if
you care about it?

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.110
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, first of all,

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.380
we look at the documents.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.276
And if you see a
public interest there,

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.840
and we think they're
not falsified,

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.200
then we know we have to do the
story because it's important.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.710
And the motivation
is secondplace.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.890
And still, I mean, we
talked more than a year

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.680
with this person.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.900
And we have the
impression-- and that's

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.090
what we've been told-- that this
person feels a moral obligation

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:07.800
to do so because he or she is
in the-- is capable to do it,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.020
to give this data away.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.830
And we talked a
lot now to people

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.430
who have very good insights
in secret services.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.806
And they all say, nobody would
give away a weapon like this

00:25:24.806 --> 00:25:26.430
because you don't
know what's in there.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.140
It's 11.5 million documents.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.870
No secret service would
know what's all in there.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.820
And we got it in real time.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.490
So we got a bunch of stuff-- 100
gigabytes-- and we found emails

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.740
from the day before.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.590
So it was not really
possible to go through it

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.520
and clear it for documents you
don't want us to have, maybe.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.300
So I don't think that
there is some bad intention

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.560
from the secret service.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.230
We have been accused that
we are working for the CIA.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.320
We've been accused we've
been working for the KGB.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.730
There have been some accusations
the Mossad, because Mossack

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.164
and Mossad, it's so close.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.840
And so we cannot be sure,
of course, because we--

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.990
if it's the secret service,
you never know who's behind.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.430
I don't really know if the
secret service is here is

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.649
secretly paying this guy here.

00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:24.190
I don't know.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.550
He says no, but I don't
really know because it's

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.707
the secret service.

00:26:29.707 --> 00:26:32.040
PETER BARRON: But did you
cooperate with the authorities

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.814
in any way?

00:26:32.814 --> 00:26:34.230
If crimes were
committed, is there

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.030
any responsibility to hand over
documents to the authorities?

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.860
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: No,
no, we don't do this.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.870
They have their chances
and their possibilities.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.200
They can do raids any time.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.550
They can do better laws.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.390
They haven't done their
homework for years.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.600
And you know, if they
want to go after offshore,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.350
well, they can do it.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.220
This is not a problem.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.530
They have special police.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.350
They have all kinds of
weapons that we don't have.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.080
And you know, if
the whistle-blower

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.330
wants to have it done, he can
give the data to authorities.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.032
But this is not our job.

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:16.490
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: But, I
mean, what we are actually doing

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.730
is that the stories we
published on our website--

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.440
that we are trying to put
as much original documents

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.660
on our web page so the
authorities can, of course, use

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.150
them to start their
investigations.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.860
AUDIENCE: So this is Google.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.160
And one of our missions
is to kind of look at data

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.350
and analyze and understand it.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.550
And the forefront
of that right now

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.940
is artificial intelligence
on computers, where computers

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.900
can go and understand the
structures of documents

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.950
and find meanings
and things like that.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.830
And have you guys
considered or approached

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.340
anyone that has machine--
artificial intelligence

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.400
expertise that
could do automated

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.020
analysis of the Panama Papers?

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.350
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: I'm glad
that you didn't ask, well,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.600
can Google have it over there?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.190
Yes, actually, we had
somebody approaching us

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.430
on that in a rather
abstract way when we already

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.302
worked on the Panama Papers.

00:28:18.302 --> 00:28:20.510
But at that stage, we couldn't
tell the person, well,

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.840
we have something on there,
let's go in and try it.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.380
But I had heard a
lengthy discussion

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:31.320
with this expert--
it was a German one--

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.820
in an abstract way,
already knowing,

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.610
well, we would have something.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.730
And I didn't get the
impression that it's already--

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.910
I'm not the tech guy-- this
is a field that is already

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.280
so far developed that it would
be very, very useful to analyze

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.688
the Panama Papers.

00:28:48.688 --> 00:28:51.020
AUDIENCE: We have some
machine translation

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.260
that you can take things and
translate it into other spaces

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.340
and things like that.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.840
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
That's something

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.510
that some colleagues
of ours already

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.970
used, for example, to
analyze the documents, some--

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.660
it's no secret.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.959
It's our Swiss colleagues who
have a very great tool on that.

00:29:05.959 --> 00:29:07.750
PETER BARRON: But if
you look at WikiLeaks,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.875
they took the decision to
put everything out there,

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:12.745
and people could make
of it what they would.

00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:14.036
Did you consider that approach?

00:29:14.036 --> 00:29:16.090
I mean, you cherry-picked
the stories.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.310
You didn't put all of
it out there, did you?

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.140
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
No, I mean, of course,

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.270
we thought about that as well.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.390
But for me personally,
it would feel--

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.140
and it is, in my opinion--
it wouldn't be responsible

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.840
regarding the source because
I personally could not

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.980
be 100% percent sure that
in this bunch of documents

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.040
that there are no links to
the source named John Doe.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.310
And if somebody is
looking for John Doe,

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.200
and I'm sure that there are some
guys out there who really would

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.880
like to meet this person and
not meeting for a drink, that,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.650
in my opinion, that
wouldn't be responsible.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.250
And furthermore,
according to German law,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.290
this would not be possible
because in Germany, we have

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.930
a rather strict law of privacy.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.400
So putting all these documents
in an unredacted way out there

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.950
would get us in court nearly
every day for the future years.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.680
And redacting this bunch
of documents, I mean,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.630
that's too much.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:22.670
So as much as I would really
like to do something like that,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.200
I tend to-- I want to
investigate stories

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.604
and not redacting documents
for the next years.

00:30:27.604 --> 00:30:28.770
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Millions.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.320
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Millions.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.653
PETER BARRON: OK, next question.

00:30:35.849 --> 00:30:37.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for the talk.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.550
And thank you for the
excellent journalistic work.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.390
I'm wondering if you are at
all worried a phenomenon that

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.300
seems to happen
where since the leak,

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.800
there has been an increasing
support for fringe

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.150
and extremist political
movements, sometimes

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.232
financed by exactly the
people involved in the leak,

00:30:56.232 --> 00:30:57.190
somewhat paradoxically.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.185
And if you're worried
about this, what can

00:30:59.185 --> 00:31:02.630
the press do against it?

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.334
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Well, I
haven't linked Boris Johnson

00:31:05.334 --> 00:31:06.250
to the Panama Papers--

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:06.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.260
--yet, but if you say so.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.970
No, I haven't seen a
relationship between this yet.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.820
We have to think about it.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.592
But what do you
mean, for example?

00:31:21.592 --> 00:31:23.300
AUDIENCE: It seems
that, since the leaks,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.010
there has been-- support
in most institutions

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.060
has eroded because
people trust it less.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.370
And they think that
all the governments

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.970
have people in them who are
appearing in the papers.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.550
And that drives people to
vote for extremist parties

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.560
or right-wing parties,
sometimes financed by people

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.698
who appear in the leaks.

00:31:43.698 --> 00:31:46.620
What happened in
UK-- there seems

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.850
to-- that Arron Banks
appears in that list.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.230
And he's a backer of UKIP.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.970
And UKIP is using
the Panama Papers

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.407
to get their support,
somewhat paradoxically.

00:31:59.407 --> 00:32:00.990
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, I don't think

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:06.580
that we started the erosion
in trust of politicians.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:13.800
Maybe it's one more small
piece that many people

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.220
think, you know, the elites, the
1% is having a separate life.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.700
And the powerful and the
rich, they can really

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.270
decide if, when, and
how much taxes they

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.390
want to pay, for example.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.450
And we cannot change it.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.170
This is what we see
in the Panama Papers.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.600
And this is what you see in
many places, if you look there.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.020
And so we need the
big parties to fight

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.050
against this phenomenon
and not saying,

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.890
the others are using this now.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.750
They should be
using it themselves

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.820
and should be
illegal, for a change.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.300
That's my opinion, at least.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.890
PETER BARRON: Next question.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:55.830
Over here.

00:33:00.754 --> 00:33:03.420
AUDIENCE: So obviously, the kind
of investigative journalism you

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.830
guys did is hugely-- it's
a huge public benefit.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.310
But I would be curious to
know if you see anything

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:15.040
you can share about whether it
actually kind of financially

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.179
works for newspapers, which
I think is often a concern.

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:19.970
Obviously you spent
months working on this.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.428
You probably had to hire lawyers
and technical consultants.

00:33:22.428 --> 00:33:26.010
It was a very expensive thing.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.850
Does this result in-- do you
see a higher circulation?

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.020
Does it pay for itself?

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.835
Or is basically a loss leader
for a newspaper to do this?

00:33:33.835 --> 00:33:35.210
FREDERIK OBERMAIER:
Well, what we

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:39.890
did see was actually
a higher circulation.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:45.580
We did have by far more
access to our web page.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.260
It's no secret that our servers
broke down in the first 24

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.750
hours because there were
so-- been so many people

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:56.550
reading the articles of
this newspaper in Germany.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.370
And it was the first time in
the history of a newspaper,

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.790
for example, that
the English articles

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.700
had more access and more clicks
than the German articles.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:16.320
But regarding facts and
figures in regards to money,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.699
we don't have any figures
if it really pays off.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.199
And I really hope
that our bosses do not

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.949
start this calculation.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:26.550
Well, this Bastian
worked more than a year.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.880
He did cost that, and
then the computers.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.460
Then we, well, we
see some more clicks.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.920
Because we really believe that
investigative journalism is not

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.750
something you should value
with, well, more clicks and more

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:41.370
circulation.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.300
It's about the duty we
have to do to society.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.130
And we want to uncover
wrongdoings and stuff that

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.270
should be out there.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:53.451
And if we only value journalism
in regards to clicks and stuff

00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:54.909
like that, in the
end, we will only

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.930
be publishing pictures
and videos of cats.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.642
And that's not
what I want to do.

00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:01.100
PETER BARRON: Is
there something in

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.580
the collaborative international
model of journalism

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.370
that signals how the
future of journalism

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:12.880
might work in a more
sustainable way?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.570
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Well, I
think that what we all saw,

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.120
and [INAUDIBLE] especially,
is that it really

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.660
boosted our reputation.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.350
And so the name was not
really out there before.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.200
And if our colleagues,
our co-subordinates,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.014
were asking for interviews,
they mainly heard, where are you

00:35:31.014 --> 00:35:33.760
from? "Suddeutsche
Zeitung," this

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.950
is the country next to Albania
that has free press, too?

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.650
Cool.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:41.544
And so now they can say,
you know the newspaper

00:35:41.544 --> 00:35:42.710
that made the Panama Papers?

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:43.293
And it makes--

00:35:43.293 --> 00:35:43.900
[SNAPS]

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.630
And we see this on
many of our colleagues

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.260
that Swiss leaks
and Panama Papers

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:57.800
have really helped them to
further develop their ideas

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.320
and what they were doing.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.550
But it's not a fear where
you make high profits

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.890
from many things.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:12.650
It's more something that you
can help build a good name

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:17.230
for your newspaper or for your
media, whatever you work for.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.396
PETER BARRON: Next question.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.860
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that Panama

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.910
has agreed to exchange
information for the first time

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.480
after many times asking.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.120
What do you think this means
for tax havens everywhere?

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.420
Do you think this is going
to send a signal that this

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.570
is probably
information that they

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.500
should have publicly available?

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.320
Or do you think
there won't be much

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.122
of a difference in the future?

00:36:50.122 --> 00:36:52.580
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Well, it
all depends on our politicians.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.900
And while being the UK, there
are the British Virgin Islands.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.570
And there's Guernsey and Jersey.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.840
So there's a lot of work to do.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:08.590
And I think the pressure
has never been this high.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.840
It's a little sad that
Mr. Cameron left office

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.850
because he was, especially
in a [? branchement, ?]

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.400
as his father was included.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.200
But I think that
we will see change.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.930
But we cannot easily
judge know how much.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:30.670
And I think that the very
easy way of using offshore

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.160
with all of the banks
or the big German banks

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.940
used in the last year that
you go there to, for example,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.920
Deutsche Bank in
Switzerland, and you say,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.950
I have this 500,000 euros,
and I really hate taxes.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.880
And they would say,
yeah, I've got this idea.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.900
You just buy a
Panamanian company,

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.396
you get a bank account in
Switzerland, and that's it.

00:37:55.396 --> 00:37:57.520
And this doesn't work
anymore because the banks are

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.490
really afraid of bad publicity.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:05.400
And nobody knows who's next
in terms of being leaked.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.370
So what is happening now-- if
you go there with your 500,000

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.510
euros and say, I hate
taxes, they look at you

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.060
and say, well,
that's your problem.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.310
But we cannot help you.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.240
But if you go there, and
you say, I have 50 million,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.350
and I don't like
taxes, they say,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:22.810
well, we'd find a solution.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.740
And you'll have 15
lawyers setting up

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.280
a very complex
structure involving

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.420
production work in Ireland
and I don't know what.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.990
And in the end, the
government needs 50 lawyers

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.830
to really decide,
is it legal or not?

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.020
It's on the edge.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.255
This is-- you will never
stop this, I think.

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:46.830
AUDIENCE: Have you
exhausted the 2.6 terabytes,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.101
or is there much more to
investigate within the data

00:38:49.101 --> 00:38:49.600
set?

00:38:52.877 --> 00:38:55.150
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Yes,
we didn't have it exhausted

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.000
because it's so many documents.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.270
And I'm sure that there
are thousands of documents

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.555
still in there where no
journalist of this 400 even

00:39:05.555 --> 00:39:08.120
clicked on once.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:13.201
But I hope that we have at least
the biggest stories already

00:39:13.201 --> 00:39:13.700
found.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.380
But there are so many
stories and leads

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.950
we are still following.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.290
And there are
fields that have not

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.370
been covered that much as they
should have been in the past.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.980
So that's the reason why we
added-- and the ICIJ added

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.600
more reporters on it from
countries, for example,

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.430
recently from Mongolia
or from Turkey.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.060
So our Turkish colleagues
published their first Panama

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.140
Papers story today.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.510
And I'm pretty optimistic
that there are still

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.060
some great stories
coming out of the data.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.300
And we still have to say
that there is so much data

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:56.540
coming from the 70s or end of
the 70s, 80s, and early 90s,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.290
what is basically facsimiles
or handwritten documents.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:06.810
And although we believe we
have a pretty good OCR systems,

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.210
I'm pretty sure
that there are so

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.780
many names in
there that have not

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.134
been OCRd in a very good way.

00:40:12.134 --> 00:40:14.300
So there could be the pope
and his brother in there.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.890
And we wouldn't
have found him now.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.770
And, I mean, I hope
that in the end,

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.110
there are so many journalists
working on it that we will find

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.470
the real big stories in there.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.895
But that may take some time.

00:40:28.895 --> 00:40:31.520
PETER BARRON: And are you still
both working on this full time?

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.540
Is this your job at the moment?

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.480
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: When we are
not speaking to you, then yes.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.740
Yes, we don't do any other
stories apart from it.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:40.640
PETER BARRON: And
that, presumably,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.370
is going to carry on for some
time to come, is that right?

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.240
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Well, I
hope that our boss will let us--

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.710
and don't remind him that there
may be other stories out there

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:50.704
as well.

00:40:50.704 --> 00:40:51.870
PETER BARRON: Next question.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.750
AUDIENCE: You said you
had to tell your family

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:11.830
about the story before, like a
month before, because you were

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.640
worried about their security.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.020
Since the story broke,
have you ever felt

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:21.070
you were in actual danger,
or was it all good?

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.770
BASTIAN OBERMAYER:
Well, we felt in danger

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.890
while we did all the research
because this is the phase where

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.340
you're most vulnerable,
where nobody knows out

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.940
in the world what are you
doing, and when people think

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.580
they might be able to stop you.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.790
After we published, nothing
happened in Germany.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.270
So we didn't have any
threats, no calls, no emails,

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:54.010
no letters, aside from
legal letters from lawyers

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.922
who said they want to sue us.

00:41:55.922 --> 00:41:57.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.590
But nothing really happened.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:06.680
And we had worldwide-- our
Russian colleagues had to leave

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.550
the country for a time.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:12.970
And a colleague in
Venezuela has been fired.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.180
Others have been intimidated.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:19.012
But nobody was harmed until now.

00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:21.260
So this is really good.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:28.560
And we have-- the biggest
protection of all of us

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.270
is that we are so many.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.850
Because we can say the
sentence that now, I think,

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:37.910
460 colleagues have
access to the data.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.870
So if you want to
stop one of them,

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:45.090
you'll have 459 very,
very angry colleagues

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.910
doing exactly this story.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.990
So it's not possible
to stop it anymore.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:57.340
It's like a life assurance, at
least we hope so for many of us

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.323
because it's so decentral
and so globalized.

00:43:02.323 --> 00:43:04.500
PETER BARRON: And are
you being sued by anyone?

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.065
Are there any active
cases against you?

00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:09.190
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Yeah,
there's one guy in Germany

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.220
who is crazy.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.560
And he's suing against the
newspaper and the book,

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.380
the book again, and a
broadcasting station.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.050
It's a private
investigator, and he thinks

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.290
that we put his life in danger.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.980
And we don't think so.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.030
And this is before court now.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.950
But it's-- he's fighting
very small sentences,

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:43.810
like which car he drove back
then, back like, 30 years--

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.350
it's not really important.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.930
It's not a big problem for us.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:55.880
And we really had the big fear
that some broad billionaire

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.030
would sue us in
London or New York.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.370
So we would really need to pay
a lot of money to big lawyers,

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.150
to expensive lawyers.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:08.040
And if a billionaire's
in the mood,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.460
he can sue us in
London and in New York.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.910
And this would have
been really a problem,

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:18.718
especially if we would had
make a lot of mistakes.

00:44:18.718 --> 00:44:24.550
Our biggest fear was to make
any real mistake that we

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.850
have to go to court for.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.840
But we haven't found one yet.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.779
And if we don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:30.779 --> 00:44:31.570
PETER BARRON: Fine.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.069
So given that you're
not being sued,

00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:35.477
can you say a little bit
more about Mr. Putin?

00:44:35.477 --> 00:44:38.060
Because that case-- that was an
extraordinary case, wasn't it?

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.960
So we have a cello player who
is moving hundreds of millions

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.000
of dollars around the world.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.600
And he happens to be the
godfather of Putin's child.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.180
Tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.180
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: Well,
first and foremost, it

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.200
was interesting to
see that not even

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.820
Putin questioned the
authenticity of the documents.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.310
He said he thinks
they're authentic.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:01.772
He doesn't like
our interpretation

00:45:01.772 --> 00:45:04.230
And then he came up with the
story of "Suddeutsche Zeitung"

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.350
being owned by Goldman Sachs,
what was actually wrong.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.280
And his spokesperson had to
admit that mistake, which

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.610
was a great page one for
us because the Kremlin

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.750
doesn't say sorry
to "Suddeutsche

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.540
Zeitung" every day.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.030
And it was funny to be--
to see that the wife

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.630
of the spokesperson was in
the Panama Papers as well.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:31.320
So I mean, still,
apart from fun,

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.220
it is still an
extraordinary story,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.870
in my opinion, because we do
see that it's still developing.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.140
We published the story.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.770
And afterwards, we
find more links.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.530
We found links, for
example, to the biggest tax

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.590
fraud in Russian history in it.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.110
And we didn't see it at once.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.950
And there are still colleagues
of ours working on this case.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:58.130
And the explanations
of the Kremlin,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.390
of this musician,
Sergei Roldugin,

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.310
they are not the best ones.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.580
And, I mean, we do
see him in the center

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.916
of a network of companies that
funneled around $2 billion

00:46:10.916 --> 00:46:13.190
in not that many years.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.780
And the explanation was
that, well, this guy's

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.250
buying some instruments.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.920
And with that
amount of money, you

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.140
can really buy an
army of instruments.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.290
So I think that's not that
good of an excuse for it.

00:46:29.509 --> 00:46:30.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:31.519
Yes, thanks for
the presentation.

00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:33.810
And thanks for the amazing
work that you've done there.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.110
Just regarding the procedure of
the release of the documents,

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:40.310
do you have a feeling
that John Doe learned

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:42.730
from the lessons of
previous releases,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.424
like thinking of Julian
Assange and Ed Snowden?

00:46:46.424 --> 00:46:47.840
Surely he must
think, I don't want

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.410
to end up in somewhere
holed-up, in an embassy

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:54.490
in a foreign country
or elsewhere.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:58.110
Did he feel-- or did he
insist on certain protocols

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.160
to keep him safe?

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.850
FREDERIK OBERMAIER: The answer
is, I had the impression, yes.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:05.300
I mean, we do see Chelsea
Manning being imprisoned.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.720
We saw Snowden being
trapped in Moscow.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.110
And I think-- at least
I had the impression--

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:17.080
that John Doe learned the
lesson from them by not

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.980
telling anybody who he is.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.690
I mean it was not only keeping
it secret from the public,

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.470
but also keeping
it secret from us.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.060
Because you can put a
pistol on our heads,

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.110
and we won't be able
to say the identity

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.080
or the name of the John Doe
because we don't know it.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.620
And I think in
these times, I think

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.500
this was the best way of
staying alive and staying free.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.600
And I think, unfortunately,
it is the only recommendation

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.450
I can give a whistle-blower
in these times

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.670
because we do see so many
whistle-blowers being

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.170
in trouble.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.860
We saw just recently this week,
the Lux Leaks whistle-blower

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.670
facing court in Luxembourg.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.270
And I think
whistle-blowers should not

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.580
be the ones facing court.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.650
They should be the ones
we all should applaud to.

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.920
And I hope we will
all-- politicians

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.800
will learn the
lessons and realize

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.050
that there is a
need for a better

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:21.300
protection of
whistle-blowers because it's

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.920
all of us benefiting
from whistle-blowers that

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.430
run-- that risk their lives
by handing over documents

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.490
to journalists or
to authorities.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.290
And that's the reason
why we should really

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:37.680
fight for a better protection
of whistle-blowers.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.940
PETER BARRON: Last
couple of questions.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.150
Sir?

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:50.520
360.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.570
AUDIENCE: So the
stories that really

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.940
make the headlines are,
of course, the ones where

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.100
a major public figure, such as
a head of state, is involved.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.060
But for every major
public figure,

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.790
there must be lots of
not well-known names

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:06.750
in those papers.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.150
To what extent have
the stories that

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:11.050
have come out just--
do they just represent

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.810
the tip of the iceberg?

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.910
Or is it really mostly
sort of major figures

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.870
who are involved in
this tax evasion?

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.670
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: No, it's
the upper tip of the iceberg

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.790
because you have
the many persons who

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.880
used Mossack Fonseca
and are not famous,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.230
so we are not
allowed to name them.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.950
And then you have the many other
companies like Mossack Fonseca

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.740
having the same kind of client.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.700
So it's really depressing
if you think about it.

00:49:46.292 --> 00:49:51.690
But still, we
would, in some way,

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:57.180
like the authorities to have the
data because then everybody can

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:57.980
be looked after.

00:50:00.232 --> 00:50:01.690
But we don't know
what will happen.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.160
Maybe John Doe wants
the same thing,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.900
and maybe he gives it away.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.660
And if not, we just
have to look for stories

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.730
with certain public interests
so we can publish it.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.668
PETER BARRON: Final question.

00:50:19.668 --> 00:50:20.656
Right here.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.320
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.610
From reading the papers,
do you have the impression

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:37.430
that everybody working
at Mossack Fonseca

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.930
was aware of what
was going on there?

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.310
Or only a few people
in the company

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:48.136
were actually aware of all
the bad stuff happening there?

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.130
BASTIAN OBERMAYER: Well, I
think that most people knew

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.430
because it's, I mean,
what do you think

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:04.680
the anonymous companies in
Panama are used for if not

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.780
for people who want to hide
their traces in some way?

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.300
And we see a lot
of stuff where they

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.070
were talking about the
cousin of Bashar al-Assad.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:19.190
And they were like,
hey, he's sanctioned--

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.920
shouldn't this be a red
flag for everybody here?

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.050
Yes, it should have been.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:27.130
But they just
ignored this red flag

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.800
and kept him as a customer.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:35.170
And we see many examples
where they just didn't care.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.810
And they did so because they
were really sure that nobody

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:41.060
could get them because
it's all so secret

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.180
and nobody can look into it.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:48.650
So there weren't
in each case really

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.450
another way around--
they didn't want

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.269
to know a lot in many cases.

00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:54.560
They weren't really interested.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.860
They were just giving
away the company

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.300
with its name, made
a bank account,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.540
and didn't ask many questions.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.680
But we see many
examples where they

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.560
saw what the money was used for,
like in a big famous bribery

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.490
scandal.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:13.740
And they completely knew
where the money came from.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.570
And they just didn't care.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.020
And we have many
examples of this.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:24.450
And I think the whole fear--
the many people working

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:29.570
in the offshore
companies, they know

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.930
what it is used for because
it's common knowledge.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:38.840
So it will not come as a
surprise for the people

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.810
working there that they
are used for tax evasion.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.320
That's what it is for.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.610
That's what it was made for.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.880
So I don't think
that we have to be

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.790
very careful about the
people working there.

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:53.470
Although the smaller
guys, of course,

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.358
they are not as guilty
as the big guys.

00:52:58.935 --> 00:53:00.310
PETER BARRON:
Thank you very much

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.270
indeed, gentlemen,
Bastian and Frederik.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:03.170
And congratulations.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.670
Thank you.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.120
[APPLAUSE]
