00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:05.685
Music videos are a weird art form.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:11.785
They're often just a promotional add-on to a medium that works just fine on its own. In fact i think

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:14.755
most of the time music works better without visuals.Videos seem

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.805
To limit song somehow.For me

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.045
Atleast.They close down the possible ways i can experience the music.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:22.335
Most of the time

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:23.325
Ayyyyy

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.685
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin' 
Auntie on my telegram,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:29.205
like, "Be cautious!" 
I be hangin' out at Tam's,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:32.495
I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:32.995
Compton

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.075
Kendrick Lamar's new video for his song element is a powerful

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:40.065
example of a music video actually expanding

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.900
my experience of the song rather than collapsing it

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.580
And it's got me thinking about what exactly makes for

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:48.520
compelling work in this in between medium

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:51.355
Watching this, I think the answers has something to do with

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:53.239
Collaboration.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.315
Kendrick is known for a lot of things.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.780
He occupies a really rarified place in popular culture

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.620
Celebrating for quality and integrity. Pretty much across the board, with a couple notable exception

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.580
This is why I say that Hip Hop has done more damage

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.545
to young African Americans than Racism

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:09.825
in recent Years.

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:13.395
But we'll get back to that in a little while

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.085
One of the things that's less talked about is Kendrick's ability to work seamlessly

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:17.760
with Other artists

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.705
Of course

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.695
Collaboration is sort of a prerequisite for Hip Hop.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:24.695
Good rap music depends on the fusion of lyrics and production

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.820
Kendrick's role as a marked artist in hip hop

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.625
Is a lot like

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:30.875
That of a film director who acts in his own work

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.365
He can control the lyrical content and it's delivery

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:34.780
himself but it's also up to him to choose

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.135
Other artists

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:40.075
According to their strengths and help them realise their own creativity

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.580
In the service of his vision.
Working with him

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.120
throughout the process for me it was like very

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.880
it was like

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
being needed like

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.315
like a piece off dough you it felt like somebody was like

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:53.405
bending and stretching and like pulling different things out

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.315
It's this kind of skill For directorial collaboration that

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.345
makes Kendrick's music videos so strong.

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:01.755
To understand the Element video, you have to understand first

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.105
The collaborators. In this case there are two : One living and one dead.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:08.075
The first is Jonas Lindstroem

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.125
a commercial fashion photographer from Berlin
Lindstroem

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.465
directed the video alongside

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.475
the little homies which is the pseudonym for Kendrick and

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:18.345
Dave Free the President of Top Dawg Entertainment

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:21.025
Element is highly reminiscent of Lindstroms previous

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:22.625
work namely his short film

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.695
Truth or dare which features twenty one performances

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.045
or "Vignettes" , and elevated version of the

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:30.115
content found on Mobile phones

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.055
Interested in the boundary between photography

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.865
And film. Lindstroem is great at creating These slow moving

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.965
"Tableaux" that serve as a reference point for

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:41.685
a larger environment. In Element, Kendrick has him apply

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:44.835
To his own, namely to the violence that's been

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:47.745
an inescapable fact of that environment  for his whole life

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.345
Violence has always been a preoccupation of Kendrick's work

00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.295
He's examined it from every angle. Looking at the violence

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:54.615
That ...he's endured

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.035
Sometimes at hands of those closest to him
"I been stomped out in front of my Mama

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:01.135
"My daddy commissary made it to commas"

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:02.245
"Bitch, all my grandmas"

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.765
"dead, So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy"

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:09.095
The violence he's caused and the he used to

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:12.015
Oppress his race. And the violence his friends

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:15.015
And family visit on themselves
Each of these facets

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.975
of violence is distilled into a photographic

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.145
moment.Some of them..connect.

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.335
But they're scrambled, drawing you into this turning cycle

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:26.085
Of violence that is the result of all these

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:27.085
distinct images

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:30.265
Kendrick can't be sure that he himself

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.535
hasn't contributed to this cycle. He's

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:35.815
Deeply conflicted about his violent past and about his position as

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.555
Rap's "Savior"

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.985
Following the rapturous reception of his last album

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:44.005
"To pimp a butterfly" . In many ways "Damn" is

00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:46.985
a review to that perceived divine status. And "Element"

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:49.965
Is a prime example of that review showing that he's not

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:52.275
Above Hip Hop's competitive 'shit talk"

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.385
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh? 
Niggas thought that K-Dot

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:57.415
real life. Was the same life they see on TV, huh?

00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.305
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:02.255
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.985
The one thing Kendrick Lamar is sure about

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:07.575
Is that the music itself is not the

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.355
Problem.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:12.915
Bla

00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:15.715
Bla

00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:18.845
Kendrick plays this sample elsewhere on the album. Clearly it's something he's russled with

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:21.505
But for Kendrick, Music is way to cope with

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.725
and understand his world.
Not the cause of it's ill.

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.745
And this is where his second collaborator comes in.

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:30.745
Three of the shots in Element are direct references to

00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:33.585
the work of Gordon Parks.One of America's all time

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.435
Great Photo-Journalist and Film-makers

00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:39.405
Parks was the first prominent commercial Photographer to capture the

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:42.385
the Black Experience for a nation wide audience

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.105
His focus on the inner cities for Life Magazine

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.295
Was hugely important during that period

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:50.325
And the power of his Photography is that it forces people to "SEE"

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:53.275
What would otherwise remain

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.175
Invisble to them. Parks was heralded for his ability to

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:58.365
Get close to his subjects, to earn their trust

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.455
So that he could illuminate the intimate truths of their lives.

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:04.515
Here we go.
I don't give a f#ck, I don't give a f#ck

00:05:04.755 --> 00:05:07.065
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a f#ck

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.105
By citing parts , Kendrick aligns their

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:16.225
Artistic goals. He, like Parks , commits to depicting the realities

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:18.815
Of his community with clear eyes.

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:21.885
Even if that means depicting himself as the product

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:24.985
Of violent culture or a violent country,

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:27.855
or sometimes as someone who perpetuates those things.

00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:30.505
I'm not a big fan of Music videos but the way Kendrick

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:33.725
Brings the vision of Lindstrom and Parks to sink

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.615
With his own is masterful.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.645
The result of this collaboration is Music video that operates as

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.765
Alot more like a poem that

00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:42.975
Connects the song and the album content

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.975
With more touchdowns , not less.

00:05:45.975 --> 00:05:47.845
Element is a video that let's you look into Kendrick's world

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.715
And in the end for a brief terrifying moment ,

00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:53.875
Forces you to see through it's eyes.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:57.815
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:03.800
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.900
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.720
Hey everybody thank you so much for watching this episode was brought to you by

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:18.035
Casper Mattresses

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.355
There is a mattress in that box right now

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:23.375
Its actually a really cool sponsorship for us because

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.585
We needed a new mattress in out bedroom and Caspers are really comfortable

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.655
I had one when i was living in San Francisco

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:31.555
and i have been meaning to get one anyway its a foam mattress

00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:34.575
that comes delivered in a box just like this one when you open  it expands

00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:37.480

i ama show you how it works
OK so this is insanely easy you take

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.425
the mattress out of the box like you can see me doing right here

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:46.525
you unfurl on the bed frame and then just remove the vaccumm filled plastic wrap

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:47.525
and it expands

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:49.875
The mattress is obsessively engineered to have

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:53.165
