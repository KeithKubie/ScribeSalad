00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.680
Two positive integers
differ by 60.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.810
The sum of their square
roots is the square root

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.930
of an integer that is
not a perfect square.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.465
What is the maximum possible
sum of the two integers?

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:12.340
So the second sentence
is a little confusing,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.810
but let's take a step-by-step.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.360
So two positive
integers differ by 60.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.620
So let's say they're a and b.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.670
So we have a and b.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.840
They're both greater than 0.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.964
They're also both integers.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.550
And they differ by 60.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.346
So a minus b is equal to 60.

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:34.970
Or we could add b to
both sides, and we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.830
could get a is
equal to b plus 60.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.780
They're 60 apart.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.960
Fair enough.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.060
Now this second sentence, the
sum of their square roots--

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.030
the square root of a
plus square root of b--

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180
the sum of the square
roots is the square root

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.490
of an integer that is
not a perfect square.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.240
So it's equal to the square
root of some integer.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.390
So c is an integer, but
it's not a perfect square.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.709
So square root of c
is not an integer.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.960
So that's the second part.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.130
What is the maximum possible
sum of the two integers?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.130
So if we could maximize b
and find an a that fits it,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.010
or an a and a b that
meet these constraints

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.551
we could get them
as big as possible,

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:18.665
then the sum of a and b
will also be maximized.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:20.249
So let's think about
that in a second.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.748
But just to simplify-- this is
actually the really confusing

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.850
part because c is an
integer and square root of c

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.826
is not an integer.

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:27.450
And to make it a
little less confusing,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.770
let's just square both sides
of this equation over here.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.630
So square root of a
squared is-- so we're just

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.760
going to square both sides.

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.080
So this is going
to be square root

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.538
of a times square
root of a-- which

00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:46.230
is a-- plus 2 times the
square root of a times

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.970
the square root of b-- which is
2 times the square root of ab--

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.110
plus the square root of
b squared-- which is just

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.970
going to be b-- is equal to c.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.070
Now, we know that
a is an integer.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.410
We know that b is an integer.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.610
And we know that
c is an integer.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.277
We know that these are integers.

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:09.860
So if I have an
integer plus something

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.749
plus an integer equaling
another integer,

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.665
this thing in the middle
has to be an integer.

00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:21.620
And actually, I'll show you
right now that not only does

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.906
this thing have to be an
integer, square root of ab

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:25.780
has to be an integer.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.634
And you might be saying, wait,
wait, wait, wait a second.

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:30.300
If this thing just
has to be an integer,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.591
can't I just say-- let me do
it over here on the side--

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.570
can't I just say that 2
times the square root of ab

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.320
has to be equal to some integer.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.940
You could divide
both sides by 2.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
And you could say, well,
maybe the square root of ab

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.630
is equal to k/2, where
this is not an integer.

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:51.620
I claim that this thing
does have to be an integer.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.220
But you say, hey look, just
straight from the math,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.520
this could be an integer.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.050
But maybe divide
both sides by 2.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.100
And this doesn't have
to be an integer.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.320
And if this is not
an integer, that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.140
means that k is odd,
because otherwise it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.960
would be divisible by 2.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.530
Now, if we square
both sides of this,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.256
we would get ab is equal
to k squared over 4.

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:15.187
Well, this is going to
be an odd times an odd.

00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:16.520
It's going to be an odd squared.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.360
So this is still
going to be odd,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.150
which is not divisible by 4.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.650
So this thing on
the right hand side

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.320
will still not be an integer.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.930
But remember, a
and b are integers.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.450
So a times b, this
is an integer.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.570
So if a and b are
integers, there's

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.010
no way that the square
root of its product

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.437
can be something divided by
2, where this doesn't reduce

00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.020
any more, where this
doesn't simplify,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.220
or some odd number divided by 2.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.720
So we just get a
contradiction here.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.380
Or another way to say it
is the square root of ab--

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.920
because this whole thing has
to be an integer and both a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.190
and b are integers,
the square root of ab

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.755
has to be an integer.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.930
But if the square root of
ab has to be an integer,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.670
then that means that ab
has to be a perfect square.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.986
So then I'll start over here
so I don't run out of space.

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.610
Actually, let me do
it right under that

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.290
because it's a straight result.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.635
So that means that a times
b is a perfect square.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.810
So let's see how we can
deal with this a little bit.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.075
We can actually do a
substitution for a. a

00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:43.910
is equal to b plus 60.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.060
So this means that
b plus 60 times

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.650
b is equal to a
perfect square, so it

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.205
could be equal to some number n
squared, where n is an integer.

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.220
And let's see if we can play
around with this a little bit,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.450
put some constraints
on what we're doing.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.020
So if you multiply
this out, you get

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.650
b squared plus 60b-- I'll
leave some space over here--

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.191
is equal to n squared.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.440
And let's see, we could
complete the square over here.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.460
And maybe we could
subtract this over

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.345
and we'll have a
difference of squares.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.970
So we want to complete
the square here.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.180
You take half of this.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.770
So half of 60, half
of the coefficient--

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.580
that's 30-- and square it.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.034
So this would be
plus 900 minus 900.

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:33.950
We haven't changed it.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.270
We're adding and
subtracting the same thing.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.970
But what that does for us
is that this part over here

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.780
becomes b plus 30 squared,
and then we have the minus 900

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.220
is equal to n squared.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.390
And then we could subtract
n squared from both sides

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.270
and add 900 to both sides.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.642
And we get b plus 30--
and you really just

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:01.100
have to play around
with this thing

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.690
and see what
constraints you can get.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.010
b plus 30 squared minus n
squared is equal to 900.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.930
And this is just a
difference of squares.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.930
So this can be factored.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.440
This is b plus 30.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.380
This is a plus b.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.730
Or, I shouldn't use a and b.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.810
But it's the square root of this
plus the square root of this,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.131
so plus n.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.630
Times the square root of this
minus the square root of this.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.150
So, b plus 30 minus n.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.669
So we can factor
it just like that.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.960
And that's about as good of
a constraint as we can get.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.760
Remember, we want to
be able to maximize b.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.390
If we're maximizing b,
a is only 60 above b.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.010
So we're also going
to be maximizing a.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.610
And so we'll also be
maximizing the sum.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.540
So we want b to be
as high as possible.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.305
So b plus 30 plus n is going
to be some factor of 900.

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:56.987
And b plus 30 minus n will
be the other factor of 900.

00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:59.320
And we could actually do a
little bit more of an insight

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.820
here.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.170
We have two factors.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.070
Their product is an even number.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.095
So it's an even product.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.820
And if we were to take the
sum of these two factors,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.460
if you were to take
b plus 30 plus n

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.640
and add it to b
plus 30 minus n--

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.180
so we're just taking the
sum of these two factors--

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.940
we get 2b plus 60.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.330
And these cancel out.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.160
And so this is also even.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.340
So if I take two numbers,
and their product is even,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.130
and their sum is
also even, that means

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.640
the two numbers have to be even.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.330
So both this guy and this guy
over here have to be even.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.430
Both of them have to be even.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.430
And at this point, I think we've
used up all the information

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.100
in the problem.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.580
We really just have to try
out factors of 900 that

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.680
meet these constraints
where both are even.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.150
And let's try with the most
extreme things in an attempt

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.625
to maximize our b.

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.760
So let's think about
the factors of 900.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.040
You could do 1 and
900, but remember,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.250
both factors have to be even.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.670
1 is not even.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.549
We could try 2 and 450, where
this will be the higher factor.

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:09.340
This will be the lower
factor because we're

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.920
subtracting a number here.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.780
So let's try that out.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.239
Actually, let me
do it over here.

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:17.530
Actually, I'll do it over here.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.400
Maybe this is 450 and this is 2.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.440
So we have b plus 30
plus n is equal to 450,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.260
and that b plus 30
minus n is equal to 2.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.775
And now we can solve for b.

00:08:31.775 --> 00:08:33.380
We can add these two equations.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:40.539
You get 2b plus 60-- these
cancel out-- is equal to 452.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.669
Subtract 60 from both sides.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:49.237
2b is equal to 392,
or b is equal to 196.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.570
So let's see how this works out.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:57.640
If b is equal to 196, then
a is just 60 plus that.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.060
So a is equal to 256.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.670
And let's see what it does
to this equation over here.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.070
Square root of a is 16.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.920
So we would have the
square root of 256

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.520
plus the square root of 196.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.230
Well, that's equal to 16 plus
14, which is equal to 30.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.570
So it looks like it might work.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.380
But remember, this thing over
here, the square root of c,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.260
is not a perfect square.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.290
This value right over here.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.440
That's the square root of c.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.850
Or I should say the square
root of c is not an integer.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.960
It cannot be an integer.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.660
If it was, then c which
in this case would be 900,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.370
would be a perfect square.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.960
But they told us in the problem
c is not a perfect square.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.850
So this one actually does not
work because this would give us

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.510
a c that is a perfect square.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.770
It gives us 900.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.800
Square root of c is 30.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.629
So we have to cross
these out too,

00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:52.420
although it was a very
tantalizing solution

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.530
since it gave us
nice clean numbers.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.210
So let's keep trying
factors of 900.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.270
So remember, you
could try 3 and 300,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.110
but we know that they
both have to be even.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.750
So we could just reject
this because 3 is not even.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:14.877
So maybe it's 4 and-- 4
goes into 900 125 times.

00:10:14.877 --> 00:10:16.460
You might be tempted
to try these out.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.550
But 125 is not even.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.879
So we could keep going.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:20.920
So then we could go to 5.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.810
Well, once again 5 is not
even so that won't work.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.850
We could try 6.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.130
6 goes into 900-- it
goes into 90 15 times.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.790
So it goes into 900 150 times.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.580
They're both even numbers.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.390
So maybe, just maybe
these will work.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.990
So let's try it out again.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.510
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.100
So you could have
b plus 30 plus n--

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.656
that'll be the larger
number-- is equal to 150

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:52.030
because we're
adding the n there.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:58.340
And then you have b plus 30
minus n would be equal to 6.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:08.320
You add both equations, you
get 2b plus 60 is equal to 156.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.520
Or subtracting 60
from both sides 2b

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.430
is equal to-- this
is equal to 96.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.640
Or b is equal to 48.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.080
So here's our next candidate.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.660
Our next candidate
is b is equal to 48.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.610
Then a would be
60 more than this.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.450
a would be equal to
108, 60 more than that.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.450
If I were to take the
square root of 108

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.900
plus the square root of
48, what does that give me?

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.351
108 is 36 times 3.

00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:43.850
So this is the square root of
36 times the square root of 3,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.160
or 6 square roots of 3.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.900
Plus-- this is 16 times 3.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.290
So it's going to be the
square root of-- well 48

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.206
is 16 times 3.

00:11:51.206 --> 00:11:53.580
So it's the square root of 16
times the square root of 3.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.150
So it's 4 square roots of 3.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.620
So when you add
these two together,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.080
you get 10 square roots of 3.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.050
So this fits our bill
for the square root of c.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.550
So over here we
have the square root

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.410
of c is equal to 10 roots of 3.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.090
It's definitely not an integer.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.150
So it makes that.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.900
And if you square
it, you would get

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:19.460
c as being equal to 100 times
3, which is equal to 300.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.470
And it's an integer.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.960
So it works.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.270
So our best shot, our best
values for a and b, b is 48,

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.470
a is 108.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:37.500
If we take the sum, 108 plus
48, we get 16, 5, and 156.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.300
And you can see when you
keep trying-- obviously we

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.080
didn't have the best result
when we had b being 196.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.985
But as we get our factors
closer and closer together,

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:49.276
the b is going to go
lower and lower and lower.

00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:50.650
And we're obviously
going to have

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.640
a less of a maximum
value for a plus b.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.990
So as we got from the most
extreme factors of 900,

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.750
we keep going until
something met.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.210
This met our constraints.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.782
If we kept going, if
we tried eight and-- I

00:13:04.782 --> 00:13:06.740
don't know if that would
even work as a factor.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.360
But if we just tried and kept
looking at the other factors,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.380
we actually would
have gotten numbers

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.630
that are closer to each other.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.970
And that would have led
to lower values for our b.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.800
So this right here
is our maximum b--

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.980
or the b that will
maximize our result.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.170
And the sum is 156.
