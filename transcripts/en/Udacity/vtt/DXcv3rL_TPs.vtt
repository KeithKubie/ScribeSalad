00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.100
The next few principles make use of a device called a dependency structure

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.140
matrix or DSM. This device was devised by Baldwin and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.050
Clark, to deal in general with management of design changes.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.250
A DSM is a Boolean matrix in which the rows nad columns correspond to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.830
components with a one in a cell indicating that the component in a given row

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.720
depends on the component in the given column. Note that the order of rows and

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.820
columns doesn't matter to the information conveyed. So

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.340
we can feel free to permute them, in order to produce more meaningful views.
