00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.783
Now, previously we had spoken about

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:06.963
just the basic idea of verb aspect,

00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:11.305
which is kind of like tenses for tenses,

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:12.862
and I know that's a little blah,

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:17.064
wheels-within-wheels ridiculous,
but we'll make sense of it.

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:20.942
What aspect allows you to
do is situate, more exactly,

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:23.124
your verbs in time, so
if you're telling a story

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.203
and you wanna indicate
when something happened

00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:27.815
in that story, then you
would use verb tense

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.671
to indicate when it
happened, and the next layer

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.806
of complexity after that
in terms of being specific

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:37.324
about when stuff happens
in time is aspect,

00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:40.145
but I'm gonna teach you today
about the simple aspect,

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.467
which I don't really need to
teach you about to be frank

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.046
because you already know what it is.

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:46.066
It's been staring at us this entire time.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.408
The simple aspect is
really just the bare tense

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:53.670
of whatever conjugation you choose to do,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.480
so if you're talking at the
present tense, right here,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.986
so you say, I walk,
that's it, that simple.

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:01.873
It doesn't indicate anything else

00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:03.406
about whether or not the walking

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:06.192
is completed or the walking is ongoing.

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:08.886
It's just, I walk, same
thing with the future,

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:13.309
I will walk, same thing
with the past, I walked.

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:14.743
If it doesn't have any helper verbs

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:17.100
for the past or the present
and the only helper verb

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.164
it has for the future is
will, then it's simple.

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:23.224
That's it, that's the
bare minimum required

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:27.019
to express the idea using that tense.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.218
That's the simple aspect.

00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:30.596
You can learn anything.

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:31.566
David out.
