00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.970
Once again scientists prove that there's literally
no problem in the world that food can't solve!

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.250
Well....except for the ones it can't, I guess.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.759
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.580
It's a phenomenon described by the DNews team
(and now the mainstream media) as "hangry"

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.500
-- that terrifying onset of hunger-induced
anger.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
You know -- you're really hungry, you haven't
eaten all day, and everything is terrible.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.050
Then when you eat, the world is fine again.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.980
A new study published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences found that

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.039
low blood sugar may indeed make people touchy.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.640
Lead scientist on the study Brad Bushman said
that this is because people need glucose for

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.260
self control, and anger is one emotion that
humans have a particularly tough time controlling.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.230
He said that angry people are more impulsive,
tend to lash out verbally and physically,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.350
and he also aptly noted that anger is the
leading cause of homicide...so, there's that.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.620
The study itself is....ummmmm....let's just
say his approach is a little creepy.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.320
The guy ordered 200 voodoo dolls and gave
them to 100 couples for 3 weeks.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.280
Each night, they were asked to jab pins in
the voodoo doll based on how they were feeling

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
about their spouse.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.560
The participants also had their glucose levels
taken.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.130
The scientists found that the lower the blood
sugar, the more pins people had put in their

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.130
voodoo dolls.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.860
70% of the time, people didn't put pins in
at all.....but there were some outliers.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.530
3 people put all 51 pins in the doll at once.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.460
One person did so on multiple occasions.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.210
I hope they checked in to make sure everything
was.....goin alright with those ones.....

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.090
It kind of confirms something ancient wisdom
always told us is true, right?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.770
Being hungry makes you straight unpleasant
so please eat something.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.170
However, the study has been heavily criticized
by the scientific community.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.409
Because, for one, the author suggests hunger
can lead to violence in the publication.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.850
Quite the claim there!

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.939
Scientists from Harvard and a Diabetics Institute
in Boston are saying that Bushman went too

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.829
far -- that there's no good evidence that
low blood sugar causes physical violence.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.619
But there is evidence of moodiness, which
is where the study may have some validity.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.899
Another criticism is that pins in a voodoo
doll isn't a very reliable to measure irritability

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.649
and aggression in the first place.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.039
I gotta say....they have a point there...

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.810
In the meantime, it can't hurt to take Bushman's
advice - when it comes to important discussions

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.180
with a lover, do it when everyone's been fed.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.010
And of course, keep your relationship going
strong by feeding yourself.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.319
This also has the advantage of keeping you
alive.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.840
Thanks for joining me for DNews peeps.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.019
Do you think being hungry affects your mood?

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.150
Tell me about it down below and I'll see you
next time with more science updates!
