00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One of the tasks in this course was to specify tokens like numbers in quoted strings.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here I'm giving you a slightly different kind of number--submit via the interpreter,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
define a variable regexp that matches numbers with one or more leading digits 1,2,3--1,1

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and an optional dot followed by zero or more digits.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Here's the dot and then here it has one digit, here it has zero digits after it.
