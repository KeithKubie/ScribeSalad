00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:03.540
In Objective-C,
the class is the principal mechanism for

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.230
bundling together data and
functionality.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.054
Whereas Swift might employ
a diversity of types,

00:00:09.054 --> 00:00:14.760
including classes, strucks, and eNUMs,
Objective-C primarily uses classes.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.640
In this lesson, we'll write
a class from top to bottom, and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.560
then do it again and then do it again.
