1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,611
Hey,

2
00:00:00,611 --> 00:00:03,800
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's
time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:08,050
Monday, June 11th, 2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:11,200
How are Ya?
How's everybody doing?

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,680
I'm a fucking old man.
It's 50 year old. Oh,

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,690
I remember when podcasting
started back in 2005

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,540
I just want to throw that out there cause
I know there's going to be a bunch of

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,330
fucking old podcast people going.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,990
Well it should. The puck
is, it's been ruined.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,320
Japan since 1968 and I
studied my poor kid asleep.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,400
Full use before years in [inaudible]. When
mind is you get these many, many hits.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,610
His Huish judge on who gives a fuck.com
I actually look at the numbers every

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,300
week
and I feel them.

14
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,300
We put [inaudible] [inaudible]
come on chanted. I'm, I'm providing

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,860
computer. Will you shut
the fuck up? I love people.

16
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:59,480
Look at their fucking podcast numbers.

17
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,620
You notice everybody seems to
be in the top 10 everybody,

18
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,930
you know it's like five talked
about this before. It's like a,

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,120
it's like back when I
used to do college gigs,

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,230
every college I went to
somehow they figured out a
way to fudge the numbers that

21
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:13,520
they were number one in something.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,180
You know the number one a
fucking school for mathematics,

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,480
the number one school for engineering's
doesn't have to have mathematics in it.

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,600
I don't know.
Right.

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,360
And then we're just so you get down to
a community college and they'd be the

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,870
number one commuter college, uh, you know,

27
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:32,690
with fucking the best deal with
triple a or some shit. I don't know.

28
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:37,280
Some other one. Number one is something
you got to hang your hat on something.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,540
If you're a college to try
and get people to go there.

30
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,150
If I, if I was a dean, do they have
deans at like community colleges?

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,230
I would just,
I would go on fucking TV and say,

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,910
listen,

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,230
why the fuck would you go for years
when you can only pay two years?

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,040
You know, you want to go to Harvard, fine.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,450
All you have to go as your junior and
senior year go your freshman and sophomore

36
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,040
year over us over us.

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,070
We are number one and being fucking
10 times less per year than Harvard.

38
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,580
You got the grades,
you know you're in.

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,380
Come on down and teach us dummies,
my dumb students.

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,250
How do we have fucking loafers with
those socks? Whatever the fuck it is.

41
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:30,170
You smart people to do your freshman
and sophomore year here translate,

42
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,140
translate,
fucking transfer over to Harvard.

43
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,070
And then you go and you can
graduate from Harvard wide a dad,

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,500
Ya de judge you or whatever they'd fucking
school song is. What is this school?

45
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:47,501
So my dad is rich and I
did real bad in school,

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,300
but he has money. So, um,
fuck in here now, let's see.

47
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:56,870
That's a stereotype. I searched.
Well, I knew, I knew a I,

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,460
one kid in my high school,

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,370
he got into Harvard and he did it with
fucking grades and no social life.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,090
He made the sacrifice. The rest of
us didn't want to do it. You know,

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,160
like that little fable there with the
fucking ants saving all the food and the

52
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,030
other animals like, hey man, I'm just
jumping around having a good fucking time.

53
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,520
You know, you know who wrote that story?
I bet somebody who couldn't fucking,

54
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,800
who was really socially
awkward at a party.

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,560
So he was looking at the fucking,
was it a rabbit toward us in the hair?

56
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,490
That's not the story. I don't
know what it is. But you know,

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
people who are outgoing,
they,

58
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,260
they get fucking annoyed
by people who are outgoing,

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,390
who are out there having a good time
talking some shit, hooking up, right.

60
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,510
Sing songs.
They in the life of the party,

61
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:51,190
they stand on the side and the
fucking wall and they write scripts,

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,960
you know, so that's why now, I dunno
what the fuck happened back in the day.

63
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,310
Used to have cool people movies.

64
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,120
Now I'd be cool person has this underlying
insecurity that they're trying to

65
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,380
overcompensate for.
That's all right. Shit.

66
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,030
I think,
you know what I mean?

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,750
Some people just are
the life of the party.

68
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,020
So anyways,
now that I'm a senior citizen,

69
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,310
I banged out 54 pushups on my birthday,
a boy,

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
and then immediately just
fucking collapsed onto the
carpet and was like out of

71
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:34,450
breath. Like, I ran 54 flights of
stairs, but I did it, man. I did it.

72
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't know what it means.
It's still means I'm 50,

73
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,180
but it made me feel pretty
good about myself. Um,

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,430
I had a great birthday. I want
to thank my lovely wife. Um,

75
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,610
she surprised me with tickets to the
French Open Roland Garros module to Limu.

76
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,270
Um, we fucking, we went
there and I got to see, uh,

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,220
what the fucks his is his name there. He's
the only one left. He just won his 11th

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,430
Rafael Nadal. That's right. I'm
not the biggest fucking tennis guy.

79
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,010
And I knew that he had won
this thing a couple times.

80
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,680
I didn't realize he'd already
won the fucking French Open.

81
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,610
You'd already won it 10 times.
And I saw him when his 11th.

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,990
And what's really interesting is that guy,
um,

83
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,650
he wanted oh five oh six oh seven oh
eight and then Federer, one oh nine,

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,100
then he wanted in 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

85
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,820
So he won it four years in a
row, Mr Year. And then when it,

86
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:41,500
five years in a row and then two
years, 15 and 16, he didn't win it.

87
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,620
So people probably all thought,
all right, his run is over.

88
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,090
He's one of the greats of
all time, but now that he's
older, blah, blah, blah, blah,

89
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,650
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,100
And he fucking comes back last year
and this year to go back to back again,

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,980
winning 11 and I was talking to somebody
last night and we were trying to say

92
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,140
how, how, what, what do you compare
that to in a different sport?

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,013
You know,

94
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,980
you can't really say it's like winning
an NBA championship because there's only

95
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,900
one of those
where with tennis majors there's,

96
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,770
there's four. So it's like they
have four sort of Superbowls.

97
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,080
So we kind of said,
I guess you'd have to go to golf,

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,980
compare it to golfers were, um,

99
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,120
you know, there's four majors in
that sport. I don't fucking know.

100
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,010
It was kind of saying, well, maybe it's
like Lebron going to the NBA finals eight,

101
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,350
nine years in a row.
And it's like, well, no,

102
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,040
because this guy actually won the thing.
Um,

103
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,950
I can't believe people give Lebron
Shit after losing to them. They,

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,890
people forget so quickly.
You know,

105
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,910
how ridiculous it was that Kevin Duran
went to the warriors and then the very,

106
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,950
you know, and then he wins a
championship. People like what the fuck?

107
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,460
And they need to scan and say, ah,
this is how it is. This just how it is.

108
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,080
Like when they first put led a little
fucking TVs in the back of cabs and people

109
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,600
like get these things the fuck out
of there and then making me car sick,

110
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,920
then I got right.

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,890
And then later on they just put them
back in again and nobody said, oh yeah,

112
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,410
I guess this is just how, I guess
this is just how it is. Right.

113
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,710
Um, all right. Uh, I don't know what
the fuck I was going with that, uh,

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,630
tennis golf majors to shit.
But I mean,

115
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:31,130
just the fact that this guy won 11 in
a row and I basically got to see on my

116
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,520
birthday the greatest,
um,

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,120
I guess you'd have to say the greatest
player ever on clay. I got to see him.

118
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:45,830
I got to see the fucking Wayne Gretzky,
the Bobby will, uh, uh, tennis and, uh,

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,420
he was playing this other kid.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Now he broke him his first game of both
sets and the kid had a bunch of unforced

121
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,580
errors and uh,
you know,

122
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,070
you could see he kept that the guy who
lost it seem like he was a kid and he

123
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:02,630
just had to go there, experience it, lose,

124
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,350
make a bunch of unforced errors for
the next time when he comes back.

125
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,660
And in the end, right, these English
dude comes out who won the French Open?

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,370
Uh, I dunno it from the way he
was talking was like late fifties,

127
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,450
early sixties.

128
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,740
And he came out to say a bunch of great
shit about Raphael and they dowel.

129
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,400
And then when he talks about the other
kid, he was just like, go. And, you know,

130
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,240
we would have liked to see more, we
ought to say more tennis said, uh,

131
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,050
I'm sure he's,
uh,

132
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,170
a little disappointed in his game
today as were the rest of us.

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,460
And everyone's just sitting
there going like, dude,

134
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,690
you didn't need to fucking say that.

135
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,420
I couldn't tell if the guy was nervous
that he just sort of talked himself into

136
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:48,830
a corner and he meant to say, um, he
has nothing to be disappointed about.

137
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't what I'm trying to give
him the benefit of the doubt,

138
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,620
but everybody's just kind of sitting
there like, Eh, I kind of, uh,

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,980
of put a fucking damper on things. I mean
minutes about done here. Right. Sorry,

140
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,530
got the bootleg recorded here. Um,
which I have on my stomach too soft.

141
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,520
He started hearing grumbling.
I apologize. Um, anyways,

142
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,450
um,
I was able to watch

143
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,480
game,
uh,

144
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,440
was at game three of the NBA finals
when I was in London at about two in the

145
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:24,400
morning. I was able to watch
and I was able to watch my God,

146
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,410
the fucking Washington capitals.

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,913
Okay.

148
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,640
Win The Stanley Cup
through Josh Adam Meyers.

149
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,580
Cause I couldn't get it on my phone cause
I couldn't remember my password from

150
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:38,050
fucking, um, you know, my cable company.

151
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,670
I could've just gone on to NBC sports and
just sat there and watched it. But my,

152
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,120
my daughter and my wife were sleeping,

153
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:47,530
so I was laying a bed while in bed
wide awake with the lights out,

154
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,550
just hitting refresh on my phone,
looking at the score.

155
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,760
And uh, when there was a few minutes
left, I text Josh Adam Meyers and he goes,

156
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:02,480
dude, he goes for fuck it. He was the one
to tell me was just going to NBC sports.

157
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:05,270
And of course it didn't work out for me
because I knew my password. And he goes,

158
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,260
oh, call me up. I'll answer
my computer, I'll facetime
and, or some shit. So I said,

159
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,130
all right,
but here's the thing,

160
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,150
I'm going to be in the dark and
I can't say anything because my,

161
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,750
my daughter's sleeping in the same room
and everything. So he goes, all right,

162
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,111
call me.

163
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:21,770
So I snuck into the bathroom lights
still out because the only way to turn on

164
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,220
the lights in that fucking hotel room
as I had to have the bathroom door open,

165
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,240
which would have woke my kid up.

166
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,510
So I'm sitting in there that like
a dark in the dark, like a creep.

167
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:33,590
The only thing that's lighting
me up is off of my fucking phone.

168
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,510
It looked like a horror movie and Josh
was just laughing at me and he's like,

169
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,880
can you see, can you see it?
And I just put my pasty white,

170
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,550
the hand up to the screen,
given the thumbs up.

171
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,630
And I actually watched the final
three minutes of the Stanley Cup. Um,

172
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,030
and I have to tell you, uh, this
guy on the Internet put it best.

173
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,150
He said in talking about Alexander
Ovechkin, he goes, I don't,

174
00:10:56,151 --> 00:11:00,320
can't remember the last time. I was
just happy for a complete stranger. Um,

175
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,670
that was watching the capital's when
was everything that you fucking watch

176
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,990
sports for? It's everything that
I love about sports. And, um,

177
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,520
do you know anybody that says,
you know,

178
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:17,950
Russian players don't give a
shit about the Stanley Cup?

179
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:22,390
Just all I need to do is just watch him
walking around with that thing in Vegas.

180
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,141
And how cool is it?

181
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,510
Like they actually know it would've
been great if they wanted it at home,

182
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:27,640
obviously,
but like if you got a win it on the road,

183
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,350
Las Vegas has to be the place you want
to be if you're going to go party. Right.

184
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,790
And,
um,

185
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,990
I say it every year at the Stanley Cup
is the greatest fucking championship

186
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:43,600
trophy and all the sports
simply because there's only one.

187
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,770
And you grew up as a kid watching all
your heroes hoists in that thing up.

188
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,530
And when you're in the
million to one odds,

189
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,680
whatever the fuck it is that you actually
went in, when you hoist thing up,

190
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,870
you're holding the same cup. You know,
Maurice, which Shard Gordie Howe,

191
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:03,340
Bobby or Wayne Gretzky,
Mark Messier, Mario Lemieux,

192
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,710
all of these great big,

193
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,160
same fucking Cup Eisenman
all of those guys,

194
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,280
you hoist that fucking thing up, said
Dave, you know, Ciara, right? Tries.

195
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,280
I had to throw another Braun in there.
Um, it's the coolest fucking thing ever,

196
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,940
you know, however, I would not drink out
of it. I can tell you that right now,

197
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,070
because I didn't spend enough
guys who've, uh, you know,

198
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,390
over the years,
hockey,

199
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,670
former hockey players that
have told stories about some
of the shit that happens

200
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,130
to the Stanley Cup. He
goes, yeah. And one of them,

201
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,190
I've vaguely remember somebody saying,
I would not drink out of that thing.

202
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,700
This stories of strippers sitting in the
top of the fucking thing and bending it

203
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:51,380
or some shit like that. Um, I dunno.

204
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,120
And then each player gets it for
like a week. It's so fucking crazy.

205
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,220
So crazy.
And then there's this guy,

206
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,380
there's gotta be a fucking
movie about that sometime.

207
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,750
The poor bastard who has to
follow the cup around all year.

208
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,780
Somebody must have done
a documentary on it.

209
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,080
Vaguely remember seeing some shit
like that where you get a follow what,

210
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,190
you know, go up to fucking
a titty bar and Saskatoon,

211
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,020
whatever the fuck that cup ends
up for the week. Um, but anyways,

212
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:22,340
congratulations to the Washington
capitols in their first Stanley Cup

213
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:27,200
championship. And, uh,
what is it, 44 years,

214
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:31,340
45 seasons. Um, and as I tweeted,

215
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,020
one other great thing is,
uh,

216
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,650
NHL has another great
hockey city in Las Vegas.

217
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,120
And after all those years of taking
these cities that just, you know,

218
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:45,440
there was the initial excitement and
then it just kind of fizzled. Um,

219
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,700
they kind of hit a home run in Nashville,
in Las Vegas,

220
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,930
and I got a feeling that Seattle's going
to be huge just because those fans are

221
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,310
maniacs,
you know?

222
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,370
And I'm sure they'll build a stadium
to make him sound even louder.

223
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,110
Why

224
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,520
do I always give them shit? You know
what? Because it's fun because it's fun.

225
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, I heard Edelman got
busted for something. PDS is
something like that. And, uh,

226
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,380
now they're gonna,
he's gonna appeal it.

227
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,920
And what I'm going to love about that
and is now everybody's going to be like,

228
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,870
she, that's why they beat Atlanta
and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

229
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:23,160
and all this fucking shit
because of the Patriots.

230
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,901
That's how it works.

231
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:29,730
You'll just look the other way when 30%
of the Legion of boom tested positive

232
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:33,350
for fucking steroids. Ah, that's all
right. That's all right. That's Seattle.

233
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,640
That's okay. I At pee, Dee sent to my
house in my wife's name did for my wife.

234
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,080
She was taking a pop tart out of the
toaster and she hurt her shoulder and she

235
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:46,440
needed a fucking steroids to get back
in shape again so she could make some

236
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,930
fucking lemon Marangu Pie.

237
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,380
Anyways. Um, if I had to guess, you know,

238
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,230
we had that horrific injury and
he's doing the Andy Pettitte thing.

239
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,790
He's fucking trying to get back.

240
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,470
He took some fucking roids and you go
kite took something and go kite is what

241
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:08,060
I'm thinking. Um, but I do know anytime
anybody seems to appeal these things,

242
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,190
I don't think that ever
goes back the other way.

243
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,840
But I'm glad that I'm not in the u s
to listen to ESPN and all these fucking

244
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,430
guys. And they'll say, oh yeah, yeah,

245
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,940
they should take away all their titles

246
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,370
because they got caught there to play
or get caught doing what a player got

247
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:30,300
caught on. Every other fucking team
has done. Um, so anyways, enough,

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,770
uh, enough with the sports
shit. I am in Patty,

249
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,270
Amy and Patty and I am
bombing with my French.

250
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,620
They didn't brush up as enough as I
wanted to and it's making me discouraged,

251
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:44,380
but I'm hanging in there. I
got my, uh, I got my fucking,

252
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,220
uh,
what do you call it?

253
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,180
Rosetta stone in that
Shit I'll do when you,

254
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:53,870
when you go to the fucking French Open,
all right? And you have your ticket,

255
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,180
you go in and you got to have
the fucking thing scanned.

256
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,310
And then after he gets scanned,
you get this little fucking,

257
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,750
it's like a ticket the size of the, then
they put in your fucking wiper when you,

258
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,110
when you pay for parking. All
right? And then everywhere you go,

259
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:09,290
you have to take that thing out and they
have to scan it to know where the fuck

260
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,650
you are at all times. You know, I
went into the Goddamn gift shop,

261
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:16,160
bought a little fucking
2018 Roland Garros Mug,

262
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,540
and he goes, I need to, you know, let
me scan your ticket. And it's just like,

263
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,990
I wish you just said no,
you're not scanning my fucking ticket.

264
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm paying for that.
So now what does that add?

265
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:31,370
Does that add to my whole
fucking information online?

266
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,570
He's into drums. He does this.
He drinks too much whisky and he,

267
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:41,150
he can't lay off of a mug when he's
in some touristy fucking place.

268
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,010
Now I'm going to get
all these fucking ads.

269
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:47,690
Now I'm going to get all these ads in
the side when I go to fucking porno sites

270
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:52,691
and shit about mugs can be funny if there,

271
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,480
why don't they have a gift shop on online?
Poor porn.

272
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,040
Why go there were good.
Um,

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,180
actually they'd probably
do. Um, so anyways,

274
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,780
every fucking place you
went yet to keep taking out,

275
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,820
keep taken out and put it away, whatever.
So now, finally I'm going, you know,

276
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,860
I bought like a fucking still water in
a crepe for my wife and I had to get the

277
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:21,050
things scanned. You know
what? I'm in another country,
so I'm on my best behavior.

278
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,240
Normally I would be like,
why the fuck do I have to scan this?

279
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,980
But the only reason why I didn't say
this is I didn't know how to say,

280
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:29,390
why the fuck do I have to get
this thing scanned, you know,

281
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,690
in French on Francais, right?
So now I go to walk in,

282
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,110
it's five or three French time and
uh, the match starts at three o'clock,

283
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,944
right?

284
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,360
So we go to go in and guess what I can't
find because they've had to take it out

285
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,030
of my pocket 58 fucking times.
I can't find a ticket.

286
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:51,660
I need to get into the goddamn match.
But I have that other thing.

287
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,870
And the ladies that come
starting, sir, you could not
get into the bay, but it's a,

288
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,030
but dude, I was fucking shit. And
I'm just like, are you serious?

289
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,560
Then she got mad at me. She's
like, yes, yes. I had to go
all the way the fuck back,

290
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,930
wade through all of these goddamn people.
Then go to customer service. Oh my God,

291
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,820
the fucking Tourette's that was going
on with me as I walked all the way back

292
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:16,680
past all of these fucking people. Um, I
got to give it up to the French people.

293
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:20,580
You know, you guys, you know, you
don't smell as bad as everybody says,

294
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:22,590
but I will say this when you do.

295
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,910
Holy Shit Dude.
When we walked out of the stadium,

296
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,290
there was this guy like fucking,

297
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,160
he was probably really good six feet in
front of me. And I said, Jesus Christ,

298
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,740
we actually made,
he went left down the stairs.

299
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,090
After one flight I would write and I
tried to get away from the guy. I said,

300
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:43,920
can I have my shirt up over my nose so
bad? This guy smelled. I said to me,

301
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,030
and because she's closest guy
smells like fucking plate.

302
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,020
How do you smell that bed?
Sitting watching people working out?

303
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,180
Maybe because he was walking down the
stairs fast. Who's creating a breeze?

304
00:18:56,181 --> 00:19:00,290
And it was passing through his fucking
French arm pits. But Holy Shit.

305
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,460
Did that guy stick?
Yeah,

306
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,783
yeah.

307
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,920
Not as bad as a homeless guy, but
like he smelled like he, you know,

308
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:12,360
freshly homeless, good.
Three, four days, you know,

309
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,170
maybe a tornado hit his fucking house and
Fema hadn't come over to help them get,

310
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,530
that's what this fucking guy
smelled like sitting, you know.

311
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,790
And tennis is a really snobby
fucking rich person's sport,

312
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,570
especially down below, you know,
up top, it's a bunch of animals.

313
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,930
That's where we were sitting
in. If you ever go, uh,

314
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,170
we got front row in the upper deck,
get the second row upper deck,

315
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,330
cause front row they had this glass thing,

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,900
but you know that you partition
that you look through.

317
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:45,250
But on top of it they have this solid
thing that all holds it together.

318
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,770
And I was like in America this
would have been clear plastic.

319
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,920
So I had to look over and duck under it,
the whole fucking match,

320
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,960
which was still fine.
Um,

321
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,770
okay.

322
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,680
So anyways, but down low is
where all the fucking, you know,

323
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,900
the coaches are the super fucking rich
people and they go there and like fucking

324
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,890
outfits and they're big dumb
hats and all of that shit.

325
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,640
But all the animals were up top,
you know,

326
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:13,641
doing the wave and shit when nay dow had
some problem going on with the servant

327
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,020
hand or his arm. I don't know
what the fuck happened. And, um,

328
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,490
but anyways, I always, it was,
it was an amazing fucking time.

329
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,380
So I had to go all the way
back and I got the ticket.

330
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,510
Then I came walking up and I,
you know,

331
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,480
after all that flipping out and
all of that fucking bullshit,

332
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,380
I still made it in the time
to see the match as always.

333
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,850
99% of the time I flip out
later on if there's a solution,

334
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,940
whatever I thought was going to
happen because of the inconvenience,

335
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,580
never fucking happens. And, um,

336
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,920
I thought I was going to leave
all of that behind in my forties,

337
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,100
but evidently it's to continue. I started
strong the day I turned 50. Fucking,

338
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,360
it just continued on. So, um,

339
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,730
I'm going to rent a fucking bicycle
today and I'm going to ride around Paris

340
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,210
with my, uh, my daughter goes to
sleep and we just been having the, uh,

341
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,520
the best time here.
As always.

342
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,150
I'm going to take a well deserved
fucking little vacation here.

343
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,860
And,
um,

344
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,400
the hardest thing for me on vacation is
not to just plant a bunch of shit every

345
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:22,630
day. Um, you know,

346
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,430
then, then it just becomes a
thrash. It's funny, like we, uh,

347
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,431
we drove by,

348
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:35,320
was it that Notre dam or some shit like
that and the guy driving us was going,

349
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:39,160
you go, you know, it's beautiful.
You got to go in there and blah blah,

350
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:43,270
and I swear I'm just not into that shit.
Those old churches and stuff,

351
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,750
you walk in and I just look around
and just say, yeah, you guys,

352
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,700
you guys really decorated the shit out
of this place, didn't you? You, uh,

353
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,720
no negative space scenarios all
just filled up with the most gaudy.

354
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,090
Um, you know, you know, like,
you know, like the Migos dress,

355
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,150
that's like the Church version of that
where you just can't have enough fucking

356
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,800
precious stones and or
like how those, you know,

357
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,760
that new thing where
you get a Lamborghini,

358
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,810
then you do the fucking shiny wrap
that you put around it. It's like,

359
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:20,380
it wasn't enough that it was
a fucking Lamborghini. Those
old churches, it's like,

360
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,100
it's not enough that you have
90 foot fucking ceilings.

361
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,541
All right.

362
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:29,440
Then you got to have a bunch of sad
broken hearted people painted up there in

363
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:30,640
like real gold

364
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,110
and all of this crazy hocus pocus shit up.
They're like,

365
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,910
I don't have any desire to
do that, but um, you know,

366
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:44,200
if there's no line, I'll poke my
head in and be like, wow, wow,

367
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,120
this old church looks exactly like
every other old church. It's creepy.

368
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,990
I'd feel like I'm going to
catch tuberculosis because
it's cold and damp in here.

369
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,480
And uh,

370
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,890
the vibe in here is not the
vibe where good things happen.

371
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,740
So I'm going to leave now. Um, yeah.

372
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,210
So I'm going to, I'm going to fucking
ride my bike around today. Uh,

373
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,880
like the big fucking Nancy boy that
I am maybe burn a few calories. Um,

374
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:19,480
I brought my little exercise
bands over here cause I'm old. Uh,

375
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,290
my shoulder feels fucking great.
Uh,

376
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,590
but I got a problem with my
fucking left foot. You know,

377
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,320
it's just always something. It's always
something. I'm an old, I'm an old man,

378
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,480
people, I'm 50. How the
fuck did that happen?

379
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,900
You know,
it's actually got to be kind of,

380
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,950
be honest with six kind of a cool age
to turn in a lot of ways. You know,

381
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,650
God knows I had a bunch of friends
that didn't make it this far.

382
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:48,050
So how the fuck can I sit here and
bitch and I like a nice round number,

383
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,450
you know, 30 sucked. 40 was
like, Whoa, fifties been cool.

384
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,990
Um,
but I'll tell you 60 is going to crush me.

385
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,360
You know what's great about 50 you
can lie to yourself to your forties.

386
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:06,410
I'm a young 40 something and blow blow 50.
It's like, no dude, you're fucking old.

387
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,440
So I am old and uh,
I've got to embrace it.

388
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,460
Maybe I'll start dressing a
little more dapper on stage.

389
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,350
Give myself a little pocket
square, hanging out on my
button down. Um, all right,

390
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,530
let's read a little bit of
advertising here. Oh look who's here.

my forties dollar shave club. Dude,

00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,220
match. They should just have
that in a miss for someone.

455
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,120
any of the guys that move with, they
just say, just don't make great watches.

456
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,160
If you thought that was the
only good thing they did,

457
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:46,530
they also make awesome
sunglasses or Lou nets.

458
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:53,060
So sewing all a solar and just
reached a ton of new styles.

So they thought screw it.

sunglasses at a fair price?

463
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:09,590
Why is screw it in quotes?

549
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:45,290
I always think when
the moon hits your eye,

550
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,920
like a big pizza pie,
that's Italian.

where the late hits, when
you go to look to the left,

554
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,510

I'm just like, there it
is. We had a great time.

556
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,530

freedom of my single life. We
had an awesome time lesson,

557
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,540
so fun.
And we ended up meeting up with friends.

558
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,270
We ran into a friend at
the royal and gals. Uh Oh,

559
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:23,450
that was so fucking random.
So random.

560
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,680
There's about a hundred gift
shops at the Roland Garros.

561
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,390
We just happened to run into them,
but we went into the bad one.

562
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,360
The one that everybody goes into this.
Yeah.

563
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:36,320
You want to go to the boutique
boutique once there's an Adidas store.

564
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:40,380
I saw that the way up, but I was trying
to beat the crowd. Oh, how funny was that?

565
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,920
Were like, we gotta get away from the
crowds so we can get a fucking Uber and,

566
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,730
and I went right when everybody
else went left just to, you know,

567
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
get a few blocks over it.
It gives somebody a chance and you know,

568
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:51,630
all the streets are blocked off.

569
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,170
And we ended up going from Roland
Garros and just walked past,

570
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,370
I thought it was a parking garage
to another. It was another stadium.

571
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:02,520
And I looked at soccer magical
yet I was like, oh fuck.

572
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,100
And then next door was
another soccer stadium.

573
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:08,510
Like this is like stadium row over here.
Um,

574
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,310
and of course we call the Uber and the
guy couldn't come down the street and it

575
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:15,200
just was a whatever it was. Yes, we did.

576
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,410
And we went out to dinner and had a
lovely dinner and then we ended up meeting

577
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:22,370
up with the friends that we ran into
at Roland Garros plus another friend of

578
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:27,260
yours, plus some friends of mine.
So we all met up in a, uh, yeah,

579
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:31,760
it was four couples and we just ended
up having this table at this cafe.

580
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,840
Late night. We shut it down,
sang me happy birthday. Yes,

581
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,840
we've got some champagne.
Oh, it was awesome.

582
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,270
It was so much fun.
By the way,

583
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,600
one of the only times anybody's ever
sung happy birthday to me and I haven't

584
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:50,260
been embarrassed. It's happened
three times in my life. All right,

585
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,810
there it Royal Albert Hall.
So it was twice the same birthday.

586
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:55,830
And then,
uh,

587
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,240
last year when I was onstage in Montreal,

588
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,740
uh, they all sang happy booms. One of the
coolest things that ever happened to me,

589
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,670
the crowd all saying it, and the fact
that they sang it to a Bruin fan,

590
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,940
that we could set aside our differences
to celebrate one bald heck in that

591
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,380
moment,
you know,

592
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:21,381
which gives me hope that when Donald Trump
goes to talk to old petty fucking fat

593
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,330
face over there,

594
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,520
can you imagine like you be in that
fat when all your people are starving?

595
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,430
Now granted, I know is people are
starving because of our frigging embargo.

596
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,030
They tried to make it seem like he's,
but he is like a dictator.

597
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,590
So of course he's going to be like,
oh,

598
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,900
fat and eat lobster and Doug and
drinking the best wine every night.

599
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,230
We're talking about Kim Jong, right? Keep
going. You've got to have the right name.

600
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,073
That's there.
All Kim,

601
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,330
John [inaudible] and
his dad was Kim Jong Il.

602
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,700
I was going to say, imagine his wife
calling for dinner. You uh, yeah.

603
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,820
Um, Hey Kim. Jon. Hey Alyssa.
I'm Tryna tell you something.

604
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,510
That picture that I posted of you
on my Instagram for your birthday.

605
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,790
Go over 5,000 likes. That's what
you're really into that I you, yeah,

606
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,440
like certain tweets. Yes I do.
I am. I meant to all of that.

607
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,440
I'm an influencer so I
honestly I'm into it.

608
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,720
Do you want to tell the story
why you want to tell a story?

609
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:27,040
Why you marked that whole
influencer thing? What is my story?

610
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,850
You don't remember when we
first heard the term influencer,

611
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,140
you are going to do something and
then you couldn't because they wanted

612
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,770
influencers. Oh yeah. I was asked to
be a part of a name. Any names I won't,

613
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:43,690
I was asked to be a part
of a storyteller show. Um,

614
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,850
and what was the saying?
Yes.

615
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:51,090
And the theme was like cultural
diversity and families and stuff.

616
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:55,560
So it was like, oh sure. Right
up the oil. We there. Yeah. Yeah.

617
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,990
We have an interracial relationship
with a biracial child is kind of, yeah,

618
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,310
I can come up with something for that.

619
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:05,311
And then the person who asked me said
that they had to disinvite me because they

620
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:11,410
wanted more influencers.
So network wanted more network,

621
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,590
wanted more influencers and you know,
so they got,

622
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,420
they replaced me with someone who had
apparently more quote unquote influence

623
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,080
and effect just means more friends
or whatever the fuck it is.

624
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,970
People on social media. Um, and I didn't
even really dig into this person was,

625
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:32,200
but apparently they were terrible and
the whole show was like kind of awkward

626
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,970
and not that great.
So it's fine.

627
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:39,270
But I was so offended that I wasn't
seen as an influencer when I have like,

628
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,060
you know,
I,

629
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I'd healthy following on Twitter and
Instagram that I just decided that I was

630
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,940
going to be an, and I'm one
of the greatest influences
ever. I am an influencer.

631
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,510
Like that's,
that's the bottom line.

632
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:55,780
Like I feel like at this point I don't
even need to keep telling people anymore.

633
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,370
It's just who you are coming
out of your pores. Yeah.

634
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,080
Like naturally people want to be like me.
So

635
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,620
it's weird for some reason.
I don't know.

636
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,280
Just looking at your firm is I want
braids right now. Well that's the thing,

637
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,630
like if I have it,
you want it wouldn't influence it.

638
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:18,040
And what is is you didn't even tell me to
get it. You just had it and I was like,

639
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,090
I want that. Could you see how good it
looks on me? And so you're like, wow,

640
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,930
can I look like that? There's only
way to find out. It's just to get it.

641
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,360
And then you're like,
oh I don't.

642
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,080
But I tried and it's like that's
really what it's about justice,

643
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,080
what an influencer does. Yeah,
exactly. You just exist in this space,

644
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,950
like your own site guys. Like you are your
own movement. You are your own moment.

645
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,510
It's just something could, could you teach
this to somebody else? Oh God, no, no, no,

646
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,100
no. You either have it or you don't. So
I, if you want to become an influencer,

647
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,790
I'm not really quite sure what to tell
you because it's like you already have

648
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,630
some sort of falling. Is it
a, is it a gift? Well, how
would you describe like, yeah,

649
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,720
it's just, it's a, it's a state
of being, you know what I mean?

650
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:02,200
It's like you're just always influencing
all the time, so I can't teach it.

651
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:06,820
I can't explain it to Zika
texting or tiring. It'll,
you know, it really doesn't,

652
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,890
you know,
because it's like breathing

653
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,910
[inaudible] you go people and some
inside tips on how to be a fucking

654
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,620
influencer. Yep. I can't believe that
people walked away from a, you know,

655
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,760
you just influenced me to try to read
up more on influencers. All right. Hey,

656
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:32,290
people giving me a, send me
some parish tips here. Okay.

657
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,300
By the, did you read that
thing about the wine country?

658
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,250
The email that I forwarded you,
one of our listeners wrote in maybe.

659
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,170
When did you send that off? Evidently,
I'm not an influencer. All right.

660
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,810
It's just an email from your
husband that says wine country.

661
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,940
You know, you'd think that one
wouldn't you? At least open.

662
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,190
I know you don't open the ones that I
send you that they have the subject.

663
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,750
Are You mad at me?
All right.

664
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,970
Paris chips,
they go right into the,

665
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,730
the junk bugs right in the
fog in trash or were there,

666
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,800
hey, thank you for the best birthday.
That was the best birthday I've,

667
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,010
I've ever had.

668
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,100
I've had two back to back
last year it was the, uh,

669
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,750
was the selfish one where I was,

670
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,950
I was in Montreal and I went to an f one
race who I don't even know who won that

671
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,010
the Lewis Hamilton wanted again. I gotta
look that up. I'm a little behind here.

672
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,190
Um, but this year was
the best. Uh, all right.

673
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,440
You know what it's about the song
happy birthday. It's really long.

674
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,140
And it almost sounds like
people are making fun of you.

675
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,440
Happy Birthdays are the Yarra
douchebag.

676
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,880
Yes,
you are.

677
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,300
And then in the end it's always
speech, speech. So I actually,

678
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,050
I thought what I said at Royal Albert
Hall was really nice and I was like,

679
00:42:57,051 --> 00:43:00,740
I did it, I got through it, knocked it
out, thanked everybody and I'm done.

680
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:04,940
And then as I'm walking away, people
would go speech, speech, and then I go,

681
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,750
I try, I should just fucking
gave one. I still get angry.

682
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,250
Let me long God I Paris tips.
Hey Bill,

683
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,900
I am a fan from Perry.

684
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,310
I heard you were visiting
our lovely city soon. Uh,

685
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,020
this is my French accent. Uh,
makes sure that you start by,

686
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,930
let comp twice in Sasha Ma,
uh,

687
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,560
Metro Audi on as we get
our for a nice meal.

688
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,800
Then take your lovely lady to the cafe

689
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,040
Laurel in Rue dauphine for a league
drink and some jazzy entertainment.

690
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,870
That sounds good.

691
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,530
They have a nice garden where you can
smoke a cigar and sip on some scotch.

692
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:50,480
Slash. Wine. Also, don't
learn French. It's useless.
Better learn Chinese instead.

693
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,750
Uh, enjoy your stay and go fuck
yourself. Let's go do that. All right.

694
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,230
Thank you. Thank you for that tip. Now I
want to try, was that guy in influencer?

695
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,640
Now he's more implemented
in former suggester.

696
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,960
Can we please label everybody
that if I can. He's a suggestion.

697
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,090
Wasn't yesterday. That'd be funny
if that was in a shop. No, I am not.

698
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,700
I not a suggestion. I was
mute. I am a presenter.

699
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,830
I was presenting information that
you can do. You know, I mean,

700
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,490
it was a suggestion. That's really what
it was. Not Bad does adjust things,

701
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,460
but you're suggesting even
in this age of me too, Hey,

702
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,570
I suggest you come over here and
you ride.

703
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,220
It was just a suggestion.
My associates, um,

704
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,540
crazy lawsuit. Crazy law suit. All right.

705
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,190
Hey there Billy birthday cake.

706
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,300
Wondering if your friends in the comic
community passed this on to you. Oh,

707
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:55,920
please don't let this be performer getting
sued and Oh, oh, this is a long one.

708
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,700
You know what? I'm going to go take
a shower, take a shower. Uh, I see.

709
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,880
Take a shower and something Douche.
Um,

710
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,020
all right. Wondering if your, uh,

711
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
friends in the comic community
of Wa Nini of why influence out,

712
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:16,980
uh,

713
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,870
wondering if your friends in the comic
community pass this onto your backstory.

714
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,660
This guy, oh my God, he touched
my hair and then you hit it. Uh,

715
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,670
this Guy Matt acts like the TV show who
started a page in the 90s called the

716
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:36,120
best page in the universe.
Um,

717
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,660
he became famous for calling out
Christopher Reeves for not caring about

718
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:44,640
paraplegics. Tilly
became one himself. Well,

719
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:49,440
I mean, Jesus Christ, if out of all
the things to call people out on, uh,

720
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,220
basically lambasted him for
being a selfish piece of shit.

721
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,200
Jesus Christ,
I don't understand.

722
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:01,890
He never sold me on the aggressive
manner of hating Reeves.

723
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,660
The only way he keeps, he does this
without looking like an asshole,

724
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,680
just as if he was also in a wheelchair,
you know,

725
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,700
and live at the top of a flight of stairs
of some shit and nobody never made a

726
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:17,640
ramp for him. Then I could see him
being mad at Christopher Reeves,

727
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,220
but even then it would
still be misdirected.

728
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,850
It's still should be aimed at people
like myself that then go over there and

729
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:28,080
help build them a fucking ramp anyways.
But I appreciate it.

730
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:32,810
A different point of view on topics.
No one questioned. And so I had,

731
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,780
okay, but I appreciate a different point
of view on topics. No one questioned.

732
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:38,550
And so I had some respect for this.

733
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:44,310
He also had a post called something like,
I can draw better than your kids.

734
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,050
And then posted pictures,

735
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:50,040
kids made and trash them are I like this
guy now because this guy's just being a

736
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,230
cunt. Um, he's just,

737
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,360
maybe he's the original troller I like it.
He's going to,

738
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,700
that was like 15 years ago.

739
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,580
I hadn't heard of him since college
until I read about this lawsuit.

740
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:03,840
Apparently this same guy who made a
career trolling the people on a personal

741
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:08,430
level across the Internet became offended
by a comic who decided to troll him.

742
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,350
Oh No, no. We had no sense
of humor about himself.

743
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,700
Or is this more trolling? Is this
guy the Andy Kaufman of the Internet?

744
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,670
He's sued the comic for $20 million,

745
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,460
which is basically way to
bankrupt the comic for whatever.

746
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:26,820
Literally had the judge
essentially threw out the case.

747
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,240
Um,
on the advent of your 50th birthday,

748
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:36,200
I just want to thank you for not turning
into a huge hypocrite like Maddix.

749
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:40,580
I'll do it. I want the most hypocritical
people you ever gonna meet doing yoga,

750
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,720
meditating, and then slipping out?
Cause I, cause I lost my ticket

751
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,630
saying this whole system
is fucking stupid. Dude.

752
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,650
Did you really build a system that makes
sure that when you get to your seats

753
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:56,630
that mother fucking assholes not sitting
in it? You fucked up, take your medicine.

754
00:47:56,631 --> 00:47:59,470
And I didn't act like a big fucking baby.
Um,

755
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,360
even if he thought he was being wrong,

756
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:06,830
he should have taken it
like a man realized that he
had to come in after years

757
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,780
doing the same thing to others.

758
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:11,570
You don't feel like this is the
final act of his performance.

759
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,330
And now he's gotten you up in arms.
Uh,

760
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,720
you're a fewer years older than me and
I've definitely taken a page on your book

761
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:20,360
in terms of allowing myself
to stay true to who I am,

762
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,780
but also allowing myself to grow
into a more well rounded person.

763
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm an o and a fan or
a from back in the day,

764
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:29,390
and it's my favorite content ever.

765
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,530
But when I see comments
online that sounded like they
came from the crowd at the

766
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:37,160
virus tour,
I just feel bad for these miserable cunts.

767
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,260
Thanks for everything and happy birthday.
All right.

768
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:42,390
That went a little left there. But
I know what you mean about the, um,

769
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,130
that happens with everything, by
the way, not just fans of the OB.

770
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,260
And Anthony showed this,
I mean, go on Youtube,

771
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:53,240
there's always going to be the initial
thing that you like and then you look at

772
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:57,650
the comments and I forget what comic
did that Pitt, but he was just like,

773
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:58,484
you know,

774
00:48:59,710 --> 00:48:59,940
yeah.

775
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,260
You scroll down like three
or four comments before it
spins into like somebody

776
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:08,040
dropping the n word or some,
you know, thanks a lot. Obama,

777
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,670
like somehow that'll be
watching like slap fights.

778
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,140
At least that's the shit that I watch,

779
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:18,060
which I do not understand those
for the legs of me. First of all.

780
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,193
MMM.

781
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,150
The fact that if they hit your ear,
what that's gonna do to your hearing,

782
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,350
you know? Do you know that was a
thing that like, I gotta look this up.

783
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,100
Moms used to do that. That was like a
disciplinarian thing back in the day.

784
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,880
You block she mothers box

785
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:39,923
boxing.

786
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,320
Okay.

787
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,590
Their children's is just too specific.
I don't think I'll get anything. Ears.

788
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,850
They would just, you know, it was like
kill a con how he used to do that.

789
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:55,350
That screen well, Huh? Oh
Man. Just hit boxing the ears.

790
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,310
Okay.
Boxing hears the other Victorians.

791
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,911
Uh,
Anthony.

792
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:06,640
Joshua says there's nothing wrong with
parents giving them which one should I

793
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:08,800
click on here?
World champion boxer.

794
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,060
Antsier said there's nothing wrong with
parents giving their children a clip

795
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:17,440
around the year.
Boxing child's ears can cause deafness.

796
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,274
Yes it can.

797
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,513
MMM.

798
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,840
That's, look, this one up here. Oh,
unable to open this because of legal.

799
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,460
The fuck does that mean?
All right. Boxing ears.

800
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:35,770
Let's see if this one will
open up. Come on, come on.
Come on. There we go. Alright.

801
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,060
I'll phrase it confused me while reading
Alice's adventures in wonderland was

802
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:45,440
the rabbits explanation of why the Queen
order the Dutches to be executed in

803
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,790
chapter eight.

804
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,640
What that I've never seen
Alison wonderland is a queen
in Dutchess and La Shit.

805
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,200
People get an executed I,
you know something, you know,

806
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,300
I think there's so much death in old
fairy tales, the original ones too,

807
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,510
because so many people just
fucking died back then. Anyway,

808
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,510
so it really was a part of
life. Um, the rabbit, I mean,

809
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,720
it's still a part of life, but it's,
it's way down the fucking road.

810
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,260
But everybody had like a brother
who died of like a fucking appendix,

811
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,430
ruptured appendix or some Shit,
get some sort of flu, a, all right.

812
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:21,080
The rabbit explains to Alice,
she box the Queen's ears.

813
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,380
The actions of boxing is,

814
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,470
is something I had never heard of.

815
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,990
So I decided to look into
the meaning of the term.

816
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,740
I found that boxing of ears is a hard
simultaneous slap of both of yours.

817
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,140
Yet the violent act was a popular form
of child punishment during the Victorian

818
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,700
era.
Oh my God.

819
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,230
In an 1878 issue of the London
reader of literature, science,

820
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,890
art in general information,
the punishment of boxing ears is debated.

821
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,010
The article warms is 1878 people like,
dude, what the fuck are we doing here? Uh,

822
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,440
for not only his deafness caused by boxes,

823
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:01,100
which ruptures as they continually
do the drum of the ear,

824
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,580
but the inflammation of the internal
cavity, which is so frequent,

825
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,280
a result may be followed by disease.

826
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:12,281
Of the bone giving rise to absent to
abscess of the brain and having a fatal

827
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:16,970
termination. I like how they took pick
the euphemism. They're on the same year.

828
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,310
Kids are going to fucking die.
The article explains,

829
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,600
school boys is suffering from the chest
dies meant by school masses and fears as

830
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:28,280
noted above, that the effects
of the slabs may be longterm.

831
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:32,630
I swear to fucking God if my,

832
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:36,980
if I have had a teacher that
boxed my ears, oh my God.

833
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,690
I mean how angry with children back then.
Oh my God.

834
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,430
Like I literally have to
walk away from this article.

835
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,400
Ah, man, I wish they was, you know,

836
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:52,910
some fucking kid back
then just fucking snapped

837
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,360
was just big enough.
You know,

838
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,670
it just beat the shit out of his teacher
and boxed his ears like nine times.

839
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,340
Made him a deaf fucking bastard. Um, yeah.
So whenever I watch those slap fights,

840
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:09,230
it's just like you're going
to make somebody deaf.

841
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,970
They put something in their ear.

842
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,100
Forget about just taking a concussion
for no goddamn reason. I mean, we'll,

843
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,640
we'll slap fight competitions like
what is the fucking prize money?

844
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,540
Um,
anyways,

845
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:27,270
continuing on a Bayer and Monsanto.
Whoa.

846
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:31,550
Jesus didn't, uh, I guess see what
time I've done here. 53 minutes, right?

847
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,570
It didn't mean Santo changes their name,
like Jefferson airplane or some shit. Um,

848
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,090
bear in Santo. Hey there,
you over the counter cunt.

849
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,980
So bare and Monsanto are merging and
reminded me of the time you mentioned an

850
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:51,090
article where bare admitted to knowing
and allowing the distribution of some

851
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:55,320
aids infected shit. Found the
article for this sounds official.

852
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:58,110
First of all came from me and
then you described the Arctic,

853
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,880
the subject of the article
as aids infected shit. Well,

854
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:06,870
let's check out the link.
It is from CBS news.com.

855
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,383
So all right.

856
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,690
Bear admits it paid millions in HIV
infection cases just not in English.

857
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,140
Oh my God.

858
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,223
Yeah.

859
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,230
Dude, I swear to God. At what point,

860
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,820
how much money do you have to pay
politicians where they feel like they have

861
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:31,710
enough money and they don't
need the corporate dollar
and that they can actually

862
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,100
start to dismantle or a restructure?

863
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,010
These corporations,
these corporations are going to kill us.

864
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:45,770
Not Isis, not fucken, uh, the Russians.

865
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,390
None of this fucking shit.
All right. When I say kill us,

866
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:54,410
I mean no human beings left are
going to be the result of because of

867
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:59,030
corporations. All right? And
what, how they view people,

868
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,590
how they view the environment, how
they view money in their whole idea of,

869
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:08,090
of what is a is worth.
I mean,

870
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:11,570
I know I've just never heard a corporation
ever being like, you know what the,

871
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,530
the,
the,

872
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,260
the costs to innocent people or the
environment is too high for us to do that.

873
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,130
Maybe they do.

874
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:23,120
It'd be refreshing if you have an article
like that that wasn't actually written

875
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:25,430
by someone from that corporation
that's lying. All right.

876
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,460
Turn to the read the
English speaking media.

877
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:34,050
You'd never know that bear just paid tens
of millions of dollars to end a three

878
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:39,641
decade long scandal in which the company
sold HIV contaminated blood products to

879
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,870
haemophiliacs thousands of
whom later died of AIDS.

880
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,060
They just killed thousands of
fucking people or admitted to it.

881
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,780
But that doesn't mean they actually
said that they did it. You know,

882
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,090
that fucking legal thing.
Um,

883
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:01,150
ironically bears new hemophilia who feel
your iPhone app got some coverage ads.

884
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:04,850
Did bears hemophilia research grant,

885
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,480
are they covering their tracks to
the University of Florida? Go gators,

886
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,110
but you have to pick through the French
and Italian news meeting to find out

887
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:15,770
that bear is finally writing
checks to people who got aids.

888
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:21,140
I've got HIV that turned into aids
in the 1980s the cutter biological

889
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,710
unit of bear ignored
federal law to recruit

890
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,070
prisoners,

891
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,240
intravenous drug users and
high risk game in is donors.

892
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,520
I'll they ignored that of the blood

893
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:41,600
cutter then used to make factor eight and
nine the clotting product that he will

894
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:46,370
feel the x need to order, need in
order to not bleed to death. Oh,

895
00:56:46,371 --> 00:56:48,800
so they pulled the Bella check
whether they were like, all right,

896
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,680
you guys are all filling.
Need the team on the sidelines.

897
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,210
You can no longer do that.
And they just ignored it.

898
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,213
MMM.

899
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:58,641
All right.

900
00:56:58,641 --> 00:57:02,780
The German group bear in three other labs
will pay tens of billions of euros to

901
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:07,280
hemophilia ex who accused them of
having sold in the 1980s blood products

902
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:11,450
contaminated with HIV. A source
close to deal told them. So did it,

903
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:16,451
was it that they knew that it had HIV
in it or did they just went to high risk

904
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:17,630
people to get blood?

905
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:22,580
The figure of tens of millions of euros
in compensation is not totally wrong.

906
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,680
She had it bear in the U S company.

907
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:28,040
Baxter are the two main parties
to the agreement. She said,

908
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,630
a company spokesperson said,

909
00:57:29,631 --> 00:57:34,370
how are the company accepts
no responsibility in this
case and continues to

910
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:38,510
insist and it always acted responsibly
and ethically that's how they get out of

911
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:43,070
it. It's like, all right, we'll
admit that we did that shit.

912
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,720
If you say it wasn't our fault and
that we always behaved above board.

913
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,250
You know what that's like?

914
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:53,840
That's like when they send somebody to
jail and innocent person to jail and then

915
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,820
they're like, all right,
we're gonna let you out.

916
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:59,180
But the only way we can let you out as
if you sign this paper saying you won't

917
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:01,190
sue us because we fucked up.

918
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,233
MMM.

919
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,120
Anyways, found the article.
I might just read some of it.

920
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,720
They're still in business. They're still
in business. Can't bring down bear.

921
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:15,950
That's our medicine, but
maybe our food supply. Nope.

922
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,140
Then you got, I don't know what
this guy's talking about now.

923
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,840
MMM.

924
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,460
Then you've got Monsanto who can't be
sued because Obama signed that laws saying

925
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,860
that you can't soup and Santo now there
was super team corporations are like NBA

926
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:34,130
team side.
You got room in the chopper for me,

927
00:58:34,131 --> 00:58:36,800
Bill just guy was all over the place.
All right,

928
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:40,940
and why did Obama sue that sign that,
so that, why did he sign that bill?

929
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:41,774
Everybody?

930
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:47,410
Is it because he's a liberal targe snow
flake or whatever people get wears a

931
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:52,541
blue tie or is it because he's grossly
underpaid for his fucking job and,

932
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,930
and I bet those guys
funded is fucking campaign.

933
00:58:57,931 --> 00:59:01,520
So then he had to do them a solid,
it's all the same shit.

934
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,300
They all make 500 grand grand a year and
then come out of office worth hundreds

935
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,990
of millions of whatever. Fucking 70 80
million bucks. How does that happen,

936
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,833
everybody?

937
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,780
Although recently I saw Bill Clinton when
that fucking piece of shit brought up

938
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:22,430
the me too thing. You know with
Monica Lewinsky. I love level.

939
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:27,110
They tried to make that a me too thing.
You know what I mean?

940
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,470
It's like she was in her twenties.
She was a college graduate.

941
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,630
She never learned that she should.
That's what I was saying on stage.

942
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:36,050
She never learned that you shouldn't
blow a married guy in his house with his

943
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:38,570
wife and kid down the fucking hall.
She didn't know that.

944
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,150
Now she's coming back being influenced
by his power and it was, you view people,

945
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,360
people,
we get the fuck outta here.

946
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,480
You are a driven young adults who somehow
in your 20s got a job in the fucking

947
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:56,030
White House. Okay. You weren't some
dopey founded a bus station. I Nia.

948
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,800
Hi.
Um,

949
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
some of them monocle Wenski thing where
now that she's trying to like turn it

950
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,260
around that he used his
power and influence.

951
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:07,730
It's like you were a college graduate
working in the White House. Right?

952
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't know.
I thought we had dealt with all of that.

953
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,900
I know and he got punished for it,
but in that thing he said Clint was like,

954
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:20,020
I left the White House. I was $16 million
in debt. You know what I mean? He's,

955
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,880
if that's true. I think he's the
only fucking president ever did that.

956
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,950
Oh Geez. She's, she's getting
ready for nap time. Alright.

957
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,490
Um, big band drumming. Dear bill,

958
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,970
I'm 17 years old and I played
drums every day. That's awesome.

959
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,590
It's my life and I'm in every band,
jazz concert and marching. Good man.

960
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,180
And I play percussion for the
chorus and for the school place.

961
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,270
Kenny Aronoff is my era. Well, that,

962
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:54,110
I was going to say that sounds like his
autobiography. Uh, how we started out.

963
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,760
Thank you for that dream interview.
I have it on a playlist with music.

964
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,030
That's how much I listened to it.
Oh, let's go. I'm glad you liked it.

965
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:07,220
You know Nia not for nothing. People say
actually do a good interview. Oh yeah.

966
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,260
From Kenny Aronoff to Danica
Patrick to my lovely wife. You know,

967
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,620
I said to you guys up, no, no.

968
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,070
Let you guys, I love it over the plate.
I learned that by going on Cronin.

969
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,800
That's what he does. Amy and
Andrea, they, they, they just,

970
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:29,420
they just lob it over to
you. All right. Andy Rector.

971
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,270
My Day was telling me about,

972
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,110
my dad was telling me about
the scar movement in the 90s.

973
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,910
I just watched swingers and discovered
this band, squirrel, nut zippers.

974
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:46,400
Oh my God, let's say takes
it back to your college days.

975
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,860
It's really takes me back to my early
thirties and I was in my late twenties.

976
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,290
It's really different
than anything I've heard.

977
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:58,670
I discovered that I don't like all scar
but I like these guys cause it's more

978
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:03,500
big band than scar. I really
think you uh, enjoy the drumming.

979
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,960
It's really a cool mix
between big band drumming,

980
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,550
punk and almost some premise tape drumming
stuff because at the time work, uh,

981
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,260
did you get ever get into any of that?

982
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,020
I remember that big bad voodoo
daddy and that type of stuff.

983
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,770
I liked it a little bit but I was
a little too old at that point.

984
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,510
That was actually kids music to me.
Um,

985
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,290
this is what our lovely daughter does
before afternoon that she screams bloody

986
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:32,310
murder. Um, and then falls asleep though.

987
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:35,490
Then talks to herself when she comes
down and then falls asleep. Anyways,

988
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:38,910
I doubt this will get read
because it's too nerdy,

989
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:43,260
but maybe just maybe thanks for
the laughs. All Billy rim shot. Um,

990
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:48,150
no, I like all that stuff. I
mean, I like when Robert Plant
book, Jesus, I liked him.

991
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,200
Robert Plant did that. The honey
drippers same with Paul Shaffer. Um,

992
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:56,790
I've always liked big bands in that type
of stuff and I really liked the way all

993
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:00,000
of that music is the score on
that separately and all that.

994
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:03,180
I just liked the way it was produced.
It sounded really live.

995
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:07,410
And um, and also, you know,

996
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,110
when you get that many people
in a band and they can all play,

997
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,910
it's always sounds great.
So

998
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:19,550
I'll be back in the day, he was also in
swingers. Okay. I did not know that. Um,

999
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,390
where make a gun out? I'll goes, oh yeah.

1000
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,970
Oh yeah, they were, uh, they were great.

1001
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,450
They are great, I should say. Right. What
did they figure out? A plea. All right.

1002
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,190
Being rude to wait.
Staff. Alright man. Hey,

1003
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,720
their ability bath salts.

1004
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,230
Your YSI talking about Nia being
slightly rude to wait staff.

1005
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,630
And it made me

1006
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,380
a heads of word got cut off something,
a podcast.

1007
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,420
I've heard years back about raising kids.

1008
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,410
Essentially a group of economists gave
their opinions on what you can and can't

1009
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,170
change in children supported
with studies and evidence.

1010
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:06,660
One person suggests with evidence that
there are only a small number of habits

1011
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:11,070
that kids pick up from their
parents. Those adverts are
drinking, alcohol, smoking,

1012
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:15,030
and how we treat others. Wait,
staff, family, et Cetera.

1013
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,610
Well,
those are kind of big things.

1014
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,240
As a former bartender who's dealt
with incredibly rude patrons,

1015
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:24,930
I would love to hear you and Nia debate
if she is actually being rude or not.

1016
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,330
If she feels she's not being rude,

1017
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:31,320
which she'd be okay if she
saw her daughter treating
a family member the way she

1018
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:34,150
treats waitstaff,
absolutely she would love in the air.

1019
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:38,430
Can't wait to hear her thoughts.
Here's a link to a podcast as a new data.

1020
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:42,180
I think you'll dig it ab a great
summer and I hope you get sunburned.

1021
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:44,820
You some of them on vetch,
um,

1022
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:50,190
near do you feel as an influencer,

1023
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,850
why can't you just influence them
to make better, better service?

1024
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:58,380
I am not rude ages and
something goes wrong.

1025
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:02,700
I just let them know and underrated
that and that like, I'm so sorry.

1026
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:03,301
I'm so sorry.

1027
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:07,730
I asked for his actions that I don't do
that cause what am I apologizing for?

1028
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:12,400
Unlike no out of this. Can
you change it? Thank you.

1029
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,150
What do I had to,
I had with like,

1030
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,970
you want me to fucking the weight
or because he did something wrong,

1031
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:21,550
like he's blowing me.
No,

1032
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,180
I'm just saying it's throws a
little sugar on it in the end.

1033
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,860
I feel like I'm very sugary.
I'm not no terrible.

1034
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:32,620
Take it back right now.
Like, no, it's not like that.

1035
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:36,220
You did one time it was
called and you said,

1036
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,580
can you have them go back and heat this
up? And they say, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1037
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:43,240
You and you're like, yeah. Cause it's
like, yeah. As they went to take it away.

1038
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:44,470
And I was just like,
Jeez,

1039
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:48,250
you remember everybody was at the table
like God damn near know everybody.

1040
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,660
Who was everybody at the table? I got
Danny. And what have been your family now?

1041
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,640
That didn't happen? Nope, I
don't, I don't remember it.

1042
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,760
So maybe it didn't happen, but
like what? That didn't happen.

1043
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,920
I don't remember it. Maybe it
did happen. That was hilarious.

1044
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:11,260
Or the pork course that didn't happen.
I don't remember that.

1045
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,700
Yeah. Maybe it did happen.
I don't recall ever being,

1046
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:20,110
behaving in such a manner that it
would be like so, so freaked out.

1047
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,510
You're adorable. But
even when you live, um,

1048
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,140
yeah. Um, I, I go the other way.

1049
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:32,141
I'm too nice and we'll eat fucking
whatever the fuck they send me.

1050
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,970
You're not seeing when,
and they send me the wrong thing.

1051
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:38,300
I still eat it because I don't want, cause
they don't want them to throw it out.

1052
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,130
Oh,
who was I going to throw it out?

1053
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:44,760
They may put it to the side and maybe
somebody lunch and the later on.

1054
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:46,930
No.
Yeah.

1055
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:50,240
You're telling me if somebody brought a
plate of food out into public and they

1056
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:52,250
said that's not what they want and
brought it back, you'd be like,

1057
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:54,640
Oh fuck it needed somebody may it.

1058
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,560
Why do you know they haven't put their
fucking mouth on it and was like, oh,

1059
01:06:57,561 --> 01:07:01,070
this isn't Ravioli. This is French
toast. I thought it looked weird.

1060
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,790
And then you go over there and
you get the old breakfast. Herpes.

1061
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,280
That's the podcast.

1062
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:15,140
I get to find out where my lovely
little blueberries crying downstairs.

1063
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,780
She's phones. Oh, she's in the bedroom?

1064
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,863
Yeah.

1065
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,910
Okay. Alright, well I gotta
get off my day here of what? To

1066
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:25,860
Lamont Jumbo Belguim

1067
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:25,860
home.
