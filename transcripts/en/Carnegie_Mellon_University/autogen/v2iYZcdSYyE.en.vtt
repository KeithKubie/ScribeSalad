as a black sludge and you can't just put

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540
as a black sludge and you can't just put
 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.240
as a black sludge and you can't just put
it into your car or put it into an

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250
it into your car or put it into an
 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.639

means molecules have to be changed from

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020
means molecules have to be changed from
 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.619
means molecules have to be changed from
one form into another and that's the

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629
one form into another and that's the
 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.150
one form into another and that's the
essence of what we do is to try to

technologies and putting them together

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099
technologies and putting them together
 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.370
technologies and putting them together
but working with systems people to put

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
but working with systems people to put
 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.350
but working with systems people to put
them together properly and then working

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360
them together properly and then working
 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.410
them together properly and then working
with policy people to understand how to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420
with policy people to understand how to
 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.940
with policy people to understand how to
get technology from the laboratory into

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
get technology from the laboratory into
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.190
get technology from the laboratory into
society because the policy part of it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
society because the policy part of it
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.330
society because the policy part of it
really dictates to a large extent how

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340
really dictates to a large extent how
 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.960
really dictates to a large extent how
the country and society accepts new

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
