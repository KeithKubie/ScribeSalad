Hey guys, I just made a couple of exploding bottle targets for Slingshots, blow guns and pellet guns. So lets go have some fun!

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.780
That was a lot of dust and check out the damage total carnage.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.050
So it's really cool is all that dust powder.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.000
