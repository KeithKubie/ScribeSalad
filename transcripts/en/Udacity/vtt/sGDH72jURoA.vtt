Now let me say you've done amazing work if you've made it this far.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You know everything there is to know about objects moving in a straight line. That is pretty cool.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now you should go ahead and take a breather maybe go outside and drop some balls

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
off of leaning buildings or go to the forums and ask any of the questions you might have.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I said amazing questions, but really I should have said any because in the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
world of questions every question is an amazing question.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There's plenty of people in the forums who would love to help you out and once you're done there,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you can come back and learn about two dimensional motion where you'll finally know

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
how to kick a soccer ball to get it past the goalkeeper, where to aim your arrow

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so it hits the bulls eye and any other question that involves motion in two dimensions.
