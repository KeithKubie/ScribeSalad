00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.720
Given that he’s mostly famous for playing
a “more brawn than brains”, emotionless

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.180
robot who speaks in fractured English (both
in politics and on the big screen…), Arnold

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.510
Schwarzenegger isn’t exactly thought of
by the general public as a very shrewd, intelligent,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.750
and calculating businessman.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.320
But, it turns out, Arnold was (and is) just
that; through a heck of a lot of hard work

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.830
and savvy business dealings becoming a self-made
millionaire long before he ever made it big

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.580
in Hollywood, and doing this at an age when
most of us still center our lives around binge

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.540
drinking with our friends and generally trying
not to think about all the student loans we’re

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.540
presently accumulating.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.950
Though the exact circumstances under which
Schwarzenegger grew up have been subject to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.949
embellishment over the years, it is definitively
known that he was born in the tiny Austrian

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.379
village of Thal in 1947 into a household that
has been variously described as having neither

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799
hot water nor electricity.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.670
Exactly how true this is, is up for debate
but one thing that is abundantly clear is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.409
that Schwarzenegger grew up in a home of incredibly
modest means.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.990
For instance, in his own words:

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.190
We had no flushing toilet.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.190
No refrigerator.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.190
No Television.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.600
What we did have was food rations — and
we did have British tanks around to give us

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.259
kids the occasional lift to the elementary
school.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.140
A popular anecdote Schwarzenegger likes to
tell from his youth is about the time his

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.890
family bought a refrigerator, prompting them
to stand around it in awe taking turns opening

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.340
and closing it to feel the brush of cold air
against their hands and faces.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.500
Yes, as a kid, Arnold Schwarzenegger was more
impressed by a refrigerator than a tank, which

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:52.149
maybe says a lot about his childhood.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.990
In his youth, Schwarzenegger was known to
have displayed an uncanny affinity for physical

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.780
fitness and as a result, threw himself into
and excelled at a number of sports including

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.470
but not limited to soccer, gymnastics, boxing
and swimming.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.980
However, it was during an impromptu trip to
the gym at age 13 that Schwarzenegger’s

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.760
life was changed forever.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.130
His soccer coach at the time had taken him
to the gym so that he could work with the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.909
rest of the team to strengthen their legs,
but Schwarzenegger, who’d never seen bodybuilders

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.739
before, was incredibly intrigued by the physique
and power of the men working out there.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.709
He began weight training in earnest at about
age 14 and was reportedly so dedicated to

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.430
the craft that he’d break into his local
gym on the weekends so that he could get in

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.569
extra workouts.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.440
Schwarzenegger began competing in body building
competitions shortly thereafter, placing as

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.080
a runner up in the Steirer Hof Competition
in Graz, Austria in 1963.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.030
His first victory came just 2 years later
in 1965 when he was crowned Junior Mr. Europe,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.319
a victory that famously cost him a week in
military prison.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.870
You see, at the time of the Junior Mr. Europe
competition, Schwarzenegger was right in the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.599
middle of fulfilling his mandatory year of
military service for the Austrian government.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.120
Unwilling to miss the competition, he went
AWOL to compete.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.879
After fulfilling his obligation to the military,
he once again threw himself into body building

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.230
and spurred by his victory the previous year
was able to secure himself the prestigious

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.579
title of “Best-Built Athlete of Europe”
in 1966.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.550
He then was able to parlay this victory into
an offer to compete in London for the title

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.200
of Mr. Universe, a competition he would eventually
come to win four times, starting with a historic

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.140
win at age 20.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.560
He also won the equally distinguished title
of Mr. Olympia an astounding seven times along

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.310
with a multitude of other titles and bodybuilding
honors throughout his lifetime.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.360
You might be thinking at this point that it
was all of these wins that made him rich.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.580
In some sense, that’s true, but not directly.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.719
What Arnold did do with his winnings up to
this point was shrewdly save and invest them

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:59.469
so that by the time he arrived in the states
in 1968 at age 21, he had about $27,000 to

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:00.469
his name.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.780
One such investment was a gym in Munich that
Schwarzenegger was able to turn into a success

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.799
by using his body building celebrity to advertise
it.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.859
He similarly used his status as one of the
foremost body builders in Europe to start

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.440
a mail order company, through which he sold
various pieces of exercise equipment, supplements

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.570
and leaflets to the public, something he was
inspired to do after many fans wrote to him

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.840
asking for tips on working out and he realised
that they’d probably pay to hear the answer.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.690
Funny enough, unlike many similar services
offered by other body builders, Schwarzenegger

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.920
was particularly successful at this because
he didn’t just take the money and send nothing

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.760
or at least nothing of value; he actually
delivered useful product and advice to those

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.890
who sent him money.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.230
Upon arriving in the United States, Schwarzenegger
quickly set about putting his modest amount

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.190
of money to work; once again investing it
in a mail order business which he would later

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.750
note was much easier in the U.S. than in Europe
since it only required paying “$3.75 for

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.750
a permit“.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.780
To help make ends meet during his first few
tentative years in America and also to help

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.080
keep his physique in tip-top condition, he
also started a brick laying company with fellow

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.220
bodybuilder Franco Columbu.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.550
Although the pair offered rock bottom prices
and the chance to have the work done by a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.950
man who was literally crowned the perfect
specimen of manliness four years running,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.591
few people ended up actually hiring the pair.

00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:16.570
That was until Schwarzenegger and Columbu
doubled their prices and started telling people

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.290
that they were “speciality European bricklayers“,
at which point they became inundated with

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.290
work.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.610
So up to this point he was managing to make
a decent living, but we implied earlier that

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.530
he became a millionaire in his 20’s.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.660
So how’d he go from middle class to the
1% so rapidly?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.230
In a word (or two in this case): real estate.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.200
After heavily researching the market, he started
with a down payment on an apartment complex

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:49.620
worth $214,000, which he was able to quickly
flip for a cool $360,000, netting him a $146,000

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.800
profit just a year after buying it.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.660
Rather than blowing it all as most early 20’s
males might be inclined to do, he doubled

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.890
down, reinvesting the profits back into another
building.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.020
Once again, his investment proved a wise one,
with him selling it for a tidy profit a short

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.200
while after buying it.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.330
Each time, rather than spending the money
on cars, alcohol, women, etc. as most early

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.610
20’s males with his physique might have
been tempted to do, he simply rinsed and repeated,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.260
one upping his investment every time.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.360
A few years later, he was a millionaire.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.830
If you’re wondering how a once poor bodybuilder
from Austria with a tenuous grasp of English

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.350
was able to display such an incredible level
of business acumen, one of the first things

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.730
Schwarzenegger did when he arrived in the
states was enroll himself in Santa Monica

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.050
college and begin taking English and business
classes.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.630
Add a good amount of brain power and using
the discipline he no doubt learned from years

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.650
of making his body into the best impression
of the mythical Hercules possible, by his

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.490
mid-20s he had achieved the American dream.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.800
So by the time 35 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger
was busy becoming a household name with his

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.200
first Hollywood blockbuster in the 1982, Conan
the Barbarian, he’d already been a millionaire

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.990
for almost a decade and had continued his
savvy investing and career as a body builder

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.990
in the interim.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.080
Later, of course, he’d also become the Governor
of the great state of California, and even

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.270
has aspirations for running for President,
despite the legal hurdle of not being a natural-born

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.440
citizen.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:34.040
Not bad for a person whose major highlight
to his childhood was opening and closing 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:08:15.210
a refrigerator.
