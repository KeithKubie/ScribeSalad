00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.170
Braille was invented by a nineteenth century
man named Louis Braille, who was completely

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.170
blind.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.630
Braille’s story starts when he was three
years old.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.810
He was playing in his father’s shop in Coupvray,
France, and somehow managed to injure his

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810
eye.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020
Though he was offered the best medical attention
available at the time, it wasn’t enough—an

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.180
infection soon developed and spread to his
other eye, rendering him blind in both eyes.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.180
While a tragedy for him, had this accident
not happened, we wouldn’t have braille today.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.640
There was a system of reading in place for
the blind at the time, which consisted of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.660
tracing a finger along raised letters.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.999
However, this system meant that reading was
painfully slow and it was difficult to discerning

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.260
by touch the relatively complex letters of
the alphabet.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.010
As a result, many people struggled to master
the embossed letter system.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.999
braille-alphabetIn 1821, Braille’s teacher,
Dr. Alexandre Francois-Rene Pignier, invited

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.489
a man named Charles Barbier to speak to a
classroom of young blind students at the National

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.329
Institute for Blind Youth in Paris.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
Barbier had developed a “night writing”
system for the military using raised dots

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.090
after Napoleon requested a system of communication
that soldiers could use even in darkness without

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.850
making any sound in the process.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.409
Barbier’s system was too complex for the
military and was rejected.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.610
However, it was thought that it might be useful
for the blind, which led Dr. Pignier to invite

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.710
Barbier to come demonstrate it.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.570
As it stood, the Barbier invention wasn’t
quite up to functioning as a system of touch-based

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.380
reading and writing, being overly complex
(using a 6×6 dot matrix to represent letters

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.380
and certain phonemes).

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.409
Further, this large dot matrix made it so
unless you had very large fingertips, you

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.610
couldn’t feel all the dots in a single matrix
without moving your finger.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.409
Still, Braille was inspired and, as a young
teenager, he began experimenting.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.020
He took a piece of paper, a slate, and a stylus,
punching holes and attempting to find something

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.020
that worked.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.049
In 1825, Braille was just barely sixteen,
but he thought he had hit upon something that

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.909
was functional and superior to the existing
embossed letter system.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.200
His original code consisted of six dots arranged
in two parallel rows, each set of rows representing

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
a letter.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
This configuration was simpler than Barbier’s
system, but still versatile enough to allow

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.710
for up to 64 variations, enough for all the
letters of the alphabet and punctuation.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.210
It was also easily adapted to languages other
than French.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.110
Most importantly, rather than needing to trace
out a whole letter, it was much easier to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.630
feel the configuration of dots, making reading
for the blind significantly faster and easier.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.020
Dr. Pignier was pleased with Braille’s work
and encouraged his students to use Braille’s

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.020
new system.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.480
Unfortunately when Dr. Pignier introduced
The History of France written in braille for

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.610
his students, he was dismissed from his position
as headmaster, due to his insistence on pushing

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
Braille’s system rather than the standard
embossed letter system of the day.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.610
Nonetheless, Braille himself became a teacher
at the Institute and taught his code to the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.400
students who passed through, spreading the
knowledge.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.670
In 1834, when Braille was in his mid-20s,
he was invited to demonstrate the uses of

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.290
braille at the Exposition of Industry, which
was being held in Paris that year, further

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.760
spurring its popularity.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.430
By this time, Braille had also published a
book about how to use the code.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.750
It was mostly written in embossed letters
with braille thrown in to demonstrate its

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.750
use.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.960
Despite this, the National Institute for Blind
Youth that Braille worked at still refused

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.330
to officially adopt his system.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.180
It wouldn’t be until 1854, two years after
Braille died and eight years after a school

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.600
in Amsterdam started using it as their primary
reading/writing system, that Braille’s former

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.880
school finally adopted braille due to students
overwhelmingly demanding the change.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.290
By the late nineteenth century, braille had
been adopted throughout most of the world,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.230
excepting the United States, who held out
until 1916.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.390
These days, books for the blind in English
are typically written in Grade 2 braille.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.040
It is a system that combines letters and substitutes
letters for words.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.130
For instance, the letter “y” is used to
represent the word “you” and the letter

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.850
“b” represents the word “but”.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.720
In some respects, Grade 2 braille is a lot
like “chatspeak” and takes shortcuts to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.980
make for an easier reading and writing experience.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.400
In addition to taking a shorter time to read,
it also takes up less space, saving paper

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.810
used on braille books.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.820
Today, English speaking blind children are
mostly taught Grade 2 braille, though Grade

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:25.520
1 braille (every letter written out) is still
sometimes taught in early elementary school.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:35.021
There is also a Grade 3 braille for any non-standard
shorthands.
