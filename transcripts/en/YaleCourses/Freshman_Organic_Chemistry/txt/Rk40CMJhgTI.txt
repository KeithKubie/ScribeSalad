Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, so this is what we looked at last time. We looked at an acid base reaction from a new point of view, from the point of view of bringing up some homo to overlap with this unusually low Lumo. Why is it unusually low? The Lumo sigma star of c of h f why is it unusually low? Is the overlap bad?

Speaker 2:          00:27          Does the hybrid orbital on fluorine and the s orbital on hydrogen, does that have bad overlap or is they overlap? Well points right at it. Good overlap. So that's not the reason. It's unusual. What's the reason that the energy of this vacant orbit always unusual Dana? Right? Cause blue rain started very low, so that went down

Speaker 1:          00:51          well, that mixed with hydrogen. Hydrogen went up but didn't go up very far because the energy match was bad. So that's this Lumo the unfavorable, a combination of fluorine and hydrogen, which is at big on hydrogen or, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Fleury the one that went up hydrogen, right? The good one is mostly on

Speaker 1:          01:10          fluorine, the bad one. Sigma Star, mostly on hydrogen. And it has that node shown as an anti-bonding node. Sigma Star. The Star means anti-bonding. So when Ooh minus with it's high energy occupied orbital. Now wait a second. Why is it unshared pair on oxygen? High Energy. I thought oxygen had a big nuclear charge, which would make electron stable, not have them be high. Why is o h minus? Hi. Oh Vena, do you have an idea about that?

Speaker 2:          01:43          What is it about o h minus the unshared pair that makes the electrons unusually high in energy is it didn't matter. It didn't matter cause it did mixed with anything else, right? It's not like a bond that went down. We're comparing it to

Speaker 1:          01:58          c h r I s, e c Sigma Bonds that wet down in energy. So even though oxygen started low, it didn't go down right? So it's on your left, unusually high. And there's actually another reason that this one is unusually high. Josh.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Negative charge on oxygen doesn't make electrons happy. Okay, so let's tell them as long mixes with that in the process of putting electrons into that

Speaker 1:          02:23          orbital, it makes the bond, but also it makes it anti-bonding between hydrogen and flooring. So we draw that second curved Arrow that shows the fluorine leaving with the electrons that it already had. Most of the electrons that leaves with, not that you can really label electrons and say, this one is this, this one is this. But remember, flurry mixed with hydrogen went down. It already has most of those electrons that came from hydrogen. Now it has the mall. When it breaks away, breaks away is that I am f minus. Okay? And that's an acid base reaction. The more general interpretation of base than just h plus reacting with Oah minus. Okay? Now let's generalize a little bit further. So notice that besides creating a new bond, which would happen with h plus mixing the homo with this Lumo can break a bond, right? If the Lumo shown there has an anti-bonding node, putting in electrons means that those electrons will be more stable if flurried moves away, right?

Speaker 1:          03:29          So, so you can, to not only make a bond, you also break a bond. So it's a make and break situation, whereas h plus plus o h minus is just to make situation, okay? Now let's look at FCH three, right? And look at the orbital and I'm going to super impose on it the corresponding Lumo of f c h three watch it. Change the carbon carbon bond as long or the carbon fluorine bond is longer than the carbon hydrogen bond. So it moved away, but the shape, especially around the fluorine is almost identical. I'll back up and do it. Do the change again, right? So it's going to have very similar properties to what HF did. So if I move it over, you see it's going to be attacked by something coming here to overlap with that orbital. Some high homo will mix with the low Lumo and here we show o h minus doing it, and then what will happen?

Speaker 1:          04:34          Remember we have this anti-bonding node here. What happens when electrons go into that orbital Katie? Okay, yeah. The fluorine will take electrons and move away like that, right? So we get fluoride and methanol, right? And this reaction, which we'll study at the beginning of next semester, and we'll mention a little bit more as we go along this semester, but systematically we'll talk about it next semester is called sn two substitution. But notice it's from the point of view of orbitals exactly the same make and break situation that you had with Oah minus reacting with Hf. It's the same reaction, just the names have been changed, right? So you could in fact have called the reaction of Ooh, minus with Hf. You could have called that a substitution. It could have been sn two substitution. The difference would be that the atom on which the substitution takes place, the one that gets attacked and then loses the f minus is hydrogen rather than carbon. So you could call both reactions, substitution, or you could call them both acid base reactions. Right? So that's the way science, as I said last time, progress by seeing generality, right? Where things were thought to be before. Okay. So we have these two reactions, acid based reaction, sn, two substitution. What would happen if we had Ethel fluoride, sometimes known as ethanol, improperly properly labeled. Right earlier today.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Okay. So that's, that's the Lumo of ethanol. Now that doesn't look exactly like the Lumo we just calculated of ethanol, but it's, remember it was the Lube oil plus three wasn't that it? That we found is either plus two or plus plus three wasn't that the Lumo plus three remember, had this characteristic that it's a favorable mixture of two simple pairwise orbitals. That one is what?

Speaker 2:          06:44          What's that orbital if you just saw that same thing, it's the same thing that's up there, right? It's sigma star c h instead of CF

Speaker 1:          07:03          or w uh, uh, it's certainly a sigma star, but it's an HC not of FC. Right? Everybody got that? So it's, but it's sigma star. That's the important thing. It's the anti-bonding combination. Sigma Star C H. Okay. And what's the other thing that goes into this? Lumo or actually the Lumo plus three. It's this, what's that?

Speaker 2:          07:30          All right, Angela, can you give it the name? It's like if you then just to Adam's what is that? You speak up loudly. So everybody from Sigma Star. So yeah, everybody say that. Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          08:00          And I say it's the favorable mixture of these two because they're put together so as to be bonding between them. Right? So there were two vacant orbitals, Sigma Star, CF and Sigma Star C H. Right. And they mixed. And the favorable combination where they overlap favorably between those two is the one we're looking at. It's still vacant. That's an unoccupied molecular orbital. But that's the one we're looking at here. Okay. Now, uh, how should it react? Well, that one looks like the top right except that the colors are changed,

Speaker 2:          08:37          right?

Speaker 1:          08:38          So how about doing sn two substitution now Russell cringed when I did that. What's wrong with doing sn? Two substitution? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:49          Aha. What's hidden in here is that Bin, it's going to be hard to overlap with the blue on top without heavy, an unfavorable overlap with the red on the bottom. So there's another way you could

Speaker 1:          09:01          do it. You could attack here, right? And get a big orbital, a big lobe all have the same sign. So there you're going to get good overlap. So might it do that? So there are two possibilities that could do the same as the topic could do sn two substitution, or it could put electrons into this Lumo by attacking from this second Arrow position. And how do you know which one it does?

Speaker 2:          09:27          You do experiment. So this is lore, right? And what we get to see

Speaker 1:          09:32          studying these reactions systematically, you'll see that both things can happen. They're both possibilities and you can make little tweaks, insolvent or based and things like that. What Homo you're using. That'll make it go a little more one way or a little more of the other. But that of course takes time to do all the experiments and to hear about them. But anyhow, there are these two possibilities. Now let's suppose it does the second one, uh, now how do, how did I set it up so that that would be favorable? I didn't use the true Lumo have the lowest energy of the molecule, which I just calculated for you at the beginning of class. What I did was used that Lumo plus three, but made it the Lumo. And the way I made it, the Lumo was to stretch bonds. I stretched the ch bond and I stretched the CF bond, right? And then if I, this particular phase of vibration of the Adams, this one is in fact the Lumo. Okay, now why did I want to show you this? Look what happens if you do that bottom thing. Okay, so we bring o h minus up and the electrons go into this and make a bond between h and no, but there's a note here that anti-bonding node. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          10:51          If you put electrons into this orbital Lexi, what are you saying? It'll break where? Between the hydrogen and the carbon. Okay, so we're gonna, we'll draw a second curved arrow that shows

Speaker 1:          11:07          those electrons pulling out. Okay, now where do they go? Look at the, here, there's an atomic orbital node there. That's not an anti bonding node because it's the node of the p orbitals on the carbons. Everybody see that? That's not anti-bonding because it doesn't go between the atoms that goes through the Adams. So in fact, if you look at that blue and red lobe in the middle there a little bit distorted. But what do they look like

Speaker 2:          11:36          if you look just at the red and blue in the middle of Lucas Dot. P Greek. It's the Pi orbital made up of two P orbitals to p orical at the carpet on top of p orbital department on the bottom for electrons in that

Speaker 1:          11:53          got a double bond between the carbons.

Speaker 2:          11:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          11:59          Okay, so there's a pie bonding between the carbons. That means we can draw a second Arrow that takes the electrons out of the bond that's breaking and puts them between the two carbons to make a double bond.

Speaker 2:          12:12          Okay?

Speaker 1:          12:13          But now there's another node in this Lumo there that anti-bonding node. What happens with respect to that? When we put electric

Speaker 2:          12:21          transit in this Lumo, Rick, what are you saying? The bond between CNF we'll break. How will we draw curved Arrow shows not starting at the seat, which are the electrons that are leaving. You started with the electrons that are changing, right? So where are they in this diagram here? Here. Tell me when to stop. When I hit the lifestyle out here, that's the one that's building up electrons. These are the electrons that are leaving and where do I draw on the curved Arrow to where are they going? Okay. Onto the APP. So that's what happens when the, Ooh,

Speaker 1:          13:23          that you get water, you get ethylene, the double bond and fluoride. So this is called, as you'll see just after we talk about sn two substitution, we'll talk about e to elimination, right? And that's what this reaction is, right? Uh, but that's just a cat. An old category, right? If we want to make it, what it is is the same kind of Homo Lumo interaction. Except this time we make two bonds and break to bonds because of where the nodes were in the Lumo that was being attacked, right? There were two anti-bonding nodes. We break to bonds. Okay? Is anybody have a question about this

Speaker 2:          14:06          to see how it works? Lucas, why? Why did I do it? Because I knew the answer. I knew that this reaction does this eat to elimination. Because when I studied organic chemistry, we

Speaker 1:          14:21          did eat to elimination and never talked about or bowls at all. Okay. So I knew where I was going. I knew what really happened. So I said, how does that happen that this is the orbital that actually gets attacked and it's in fact the Lumo plus three, right? Why do the electrons go into that? And then I saw that in a certain phase of vibration of the molecule, when this bond is long and when this bond is stretched than it is the Lumo. So the, when the Oah is attacking, the Oah minus is attacking, it's attacking you at a time that those bonds are stretched at the same time. Right? And then they break, okay. It's a little bit of chicken and the egg as to whether the electrons going in make them stretch or they're stretching allows the electrons to go in. Right? But at anyhow, that's, I knew what the answer was, which you wouldn't have known if you had just looked at the orbitals for the minimum energy geometry of the molecule. Okay. Now let's look at, let's generalize this to a complicated, are fairly complicated reactions scheme, at least by our lights. So three ammonia molecules react with chlorine. That's called oxidation of ammonia, and it generates hydrazine the nitrogen nitrogen bond, or actually hydrazine IOM. It's a cad I and chloride and ammonium chloride. That looks pretty complicated. There's a lot of changes going on. How does it happen? Could we figure it out? I think you can. Okay. So in the starting material, I want to find a high homo. Where do I find it?

Speaker 2:          16:05          Sherwin, could you help us? What do I love? I want to find the high volume only is starting with Geraldine Hunt, starting Joe's or ammonia and the chlorine molecule. So what about them could give you a high, unusually high occupied or goals? Say, say clear. Yeah, the unshared pair of ammonia. Alright. And has a bigger nuclear charge than c. So you might expect the electrons to be low in energy. Never mixed with anything. So it didn't go down to become a sigma bond. So unshared, bear on, I think that that's okay.

Speaker 1:          16:47          Now we have to react that with some, uh, so, and unshared payers are often denoted n I actually the little n and I actually don't know why that is. It'd be fun to find out, okay, now we need a low Lumo. Anybody got an idea

Speaker 2:          17:02          for what a low Lumo might be in the system? Yeah. What kinds of things give rise to low lumos Sam electro negative electronegative nuclei, right? Big nuclear charges. You know, people always say electronegative, but that's the cart and the horse. Why is something electronegative that means it's a good place for electrons to go because right. It's because the nuclear charge is big. That's what's fundamental. Okay. Where do we find that here in the chlorine, the chlorine now, which orbital associated with the chlorine is going to be unusually low in energy. Does it have a, does it have a vape at the atomic orbital in mind? What's called chlorine is in the last column, right? So it just missing one electron. So a chlorine atom has three unshared pairs and one odd electron, which is common with the other chlorine to make that bond. Right? So after the cl two forms, where's the vacant orbital? Anybody see we had two chlorine's each with this, with this odd electron. They came together and you got a sigma bond. Where's the low Lumo Chris? No, six Sigma Star, right? They each had one electron come together. They went down, but there was a sigma star that went up. Sig Sigma Stars.

Speaker 1:          18:44          Really high energy, but not in this case because of Sam pointed out the, the nuclear charge is big, so it's low. So Sigma Star on chlorine.

Speaker 2:          18:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:55          So what kind of reaction are we going to have

Speaker 2:          18:58          if we mixed sigma star of glory with the unshared pair on nitrogen? Have you ever seen a reaction like this before? Where are you at the Sigma Star mixing with an unshared pair. Kaitlin, on the last slide we saw lots of examples, right? And so Katelyn, what happens will tell me how to draw curved Arrow here. Okay. Electrons on the untrimmed bear nitrogen. That's the high home. Well, between one, between the nitrogen and the chlorine. They mixed with that vacant ornamental, but the ones that the glory, now that's an empty bonding. Orbitals sigma star. So a chloride leaves. So it's exactly the same reaction, make and break that we saw before.

Speaker 1:          19:58          Okay. There. So we get, uh, ammonium chloride and cl minus plus minus net neutral. We started neutral. We're still neutral. Okay. And now we have one of the products, the chloride up above we have. Okay. But we also have this molecule. Now it has a low Lumo, so it's reactive. What is the low Lumo?

Speaker 2:          20:40          That's not what I would've said. Turns out to be right, but it's not what I would've said they're going to be. Nah, it's gotta be vacant. So what's the name of the orbital Sigma Star? Nh. Are there any other Sigma Stars here? Russell cl, which is, which is going to be lower sigma star in cl or Sigma Star and age. I would add too. So the most like the lowest flew mo is for that,

Speaker 1:          21:25          for some homo. Now what are we gonna use for a homo? We have to have another reagent for this to react with. Well, fortunately that sigma star and h is what we're actually going to use. Okay. It's the high homo. We had three ammonias to begin with so we can use another one. Same deal again. Right? So the best reaction I think would be for the unshared pair to attack the chlorine. At least that's something that you could imagine. If that happened, what would the product be

Speaker 2:          21:58          if Nh three attack cl, it would make an Nh three cl bond and lose one. What? Russell. So what about this? It could happen till the cows come home, but the product is the same as the starting material and no one cares. It would exchange

Speaker 1:          22:18          which, which caloric, which nitrogen is attached to the chlorine. But unless you label them with isotopes or something, you'd have no way of knowing. So that, that probably does happen or at least that I suspect that happened some of the time. Right. But you don't care. So now we resort to une Jews suggestion that we'll use a different one. So we get a different product. Okay. So we'll attack the, the Nh bond. Now, uh, uh, Corey, tell us how

Speaker 2:          22:46          draw curved Arrow to show this. Where's the curved Arrow going to start on the lone pair? The nitrogen. And where will it end in between? In between the end of the age and what else will happen? Which one? What's going to take off with the electrons? Can you see nothing? Well, that is what you Lou, it becomes an unshaded pair on nitrogen. Dan was in plus right now he gets the electrons that formerly it was sharing with age. So it ends on nitrogen, right? So there's the

Speaker 1:          23:30          product and now I've highlighted in blue another one of the ultimate products, right? So now we've made ammonium chloride,

Speaker 2:          23:41          right?

Speaker 1:          23:43          We've made one of the products, but we need the other, but we have this product from the second reaction. Now what do we have for a low Lumo here?

Speaker 2:          24:00          Maybe you have an idea. You have only sigma bonds at an unshare fair on nitrogen and three unshared fairs on Flory, right? No, but those were all occupied. What's a vacant on? But I'll hear what kind of vacant orbitals you get in molecules that have only sigma bonds. [inaudible] no, the p roles are filled with electronics here, right? So they're not vacant. Sigma Star. Which segments you have to sit in each sigma star and you have the sigma star. Which one do you think it's lower? No, it wasn't the one that reacted last time was the Nh, but it wasn't the lowest. The MCL was the lowest. Why? We're quite ever, we care last time because the product one that reacted, you got the starting material back. So the care. All right, so this time it's the MCL.

Speaker 1:          25:07          Alright, what's the hot high Hobo we're going to use?

Speaker 2:          25:16          Ah, Wilson. Oh, we got a third one that will bring it in and they're the curve there owns, there's the product hydrazine high resilience. It's got a proton and as a plus charge. Hi Laura. Hi Laura.

Speaker 1:          25:36          All right, so that is the last product. So we've done it. So there are three of these reactions that take place. Three cycles of Macon break and notice the difference among them, right? It's always Nh three that attacks, but first that a tax chlorine, none of the tax hydrogen then at the tax nitrogen. But it's the same reaction we talked about on the previous slide. Right? Making break. Okay. Now we're going to look at for functional groups, the c double bond o carbon eel amid carboxylic acid and Al Lithium. And after that we'll have done what we wanted to do about functional groups, although it will still be in your court to do functional groups because you have these wikis to do the same kind of analysis on the functional groups that we're doing here on these four functional groups and those are due Thursday and almost all of them are signed up for, they're just a few more to do. So if you want a choice, get there quickly cause I'll assign them this afternoon I think because we're almost at the end and I have to make sure everything gets covered.

Speaker 1:          26:44          Okay, so the Carbondale group, c o double bond. This is probably the most important functional group in organic chemistry. Why is it so important? A, because it strong, so it gives stable compounds, low energy compounds. So you have a lot of Carbondale groups, but paradoxically it's not only strong but it reacts easily. So it's easy to make things from carbon eels. Okay. That sounds contradictory, that it should be both stable and reactive, but it is. And we'll see why. So let's look at the shape of the frontier. Orbitals there six valence electron pairs in the, uh, in formaldehyde shown here from the side. And we could show the molecular orbitals, right? The Claude knees style plum pudding, molecular orbitals. So the lowest, uh, so the lowest one is one s or two s if you want to count the core, right, which is at, which is mostly on the oxygen, a little bit on carbon.

Speaker 1:          27:49          And then there's a two Px, two p y n two P, Z as plum pudding, orbitals. And then there's this three s orbital and this three d x, y orbital. But let's look a little more closely at that. Uh, from the point of view of Pairwise Interactions, what things interacted with one another to give these, so let's do the kinds of pairwise mixing we've been talking about. There's the Homo [inaudible], an older style picture of the Homo, the one that's called three d, x, y on the right. And this is drawn at a w was based on a different calculation and it's drawn a different contour level, but you can see what it, what is it? Mostly

Speaker 2:          28:32          the whole bone. If you had to give a simple name to it, what would you call him? If you have neglected the little tiny pieces on the right, what does the look like, chairman? It's a p orbital on oxygen and unshared Parabox which is mostly, although it is mixed a little bit with something else. Now to see what else it's mixed with. We can go down the list by three steps and look at that. Or

Speaker 1:          29:01          the one that's called two p y because it also has that little bit of oxygen in it, but more of the other stuff. Now let's look at nodes in these things. There's nodes that are nodes of atomic orbitals of the oxygen and the carbon. They bisect the molecule. Those don't have to do with bonding, right? But the one on the top also has an anti bonding node. Can you see where that is? Shy,

Speaker 2:          29:33          maybe between the carbon and the oxygen is anti-bonding node. So this is a favorable

Speaker 1:          29:41          and

Speaker 2:          29:42          an unfavorable combination of in the front oxygen, the front left his oxygen and in the back right as some sort of ch bond. So we're those molecular orbitals are made by combining two p of oxygen with Sigma Chi. In fact, two Sigma Chi is okay now, which one is lower in energy? The unshared pair on oxygen or Sigma Chi. Notice that the oxygen has something going for it, which is a big nuclear charge, but the CHS has something going for it, which is the bonding of the CH, which lowered it from where carbon and hydrogen atomic organism, which one is lower? The two P of oxygen or Sigma Chi, which wins. Can you tell by looking at this and all the favorable combination, which looks mostly like the lower one looks mostly like Cah and the unfavorable one, the one that went up looks mostly like, oh, so clearly the

Speaker 1:          30:59          Sigma Chi is lower in energy than the two P of oxygen. Okay. Now let's look at the Lumo up on top and the plum pudding column, right? And here's another version of that, and you can see what it is. It's made up of a p orbital on oxygen and a p orbital on carbon. Those are atomic orbital. That's an atomic orbital node has nothing to do with the bonding, but there is an anti-bonding node between them, right? So this is the Pi star orbital, not the occupied one, but the vacant orbital, the Lumo, right. There's poor overlap because as Pi Star, that's why it's unusually low and it's also unusually low compared to see cc because it's got an oxygen in it high nuclear charge. So poor energy match to Po is lower in energy than the two P of carbon. Okay? And there, we're going to show this on the next slide, those two. But the top one you see is the favorable combination of two po and to peasy the one of which this is the unfavorable combination, but it's not the homo, right? The homo is that unshared pair on, on, uh, oxygen, which is the dominant thing in three d x y. Okay, so now let's look at these. There's the CEO, Pi bonding or bundle. Now, which one should that be big on? Don't look at it.

Speaker 2:          32:28          Which one should it be? The Pi, the favorable combination of pee on oxygen and fee on carbon, which should it be big on? There's pee on oxygen, P on carbon. They mixed pie overlap. Not Too much overlap so they don't get so much up and down. But what does this most of the bonding, the bonding would, what does it mostly look like? Should look mostly like oxygen. When you're looking at this picture, it doesn't look

Speaker 1:          32:52          that way. That's because of which contour tour we drew because oxygen holds its electrons closer, so by the time you get out to a certain low you you, so you get through the most of the electron density of oxygen as you go out one contour by the other of the onion. That's the oxygen it. They're more electrons inside. So indeed it does have more electron density on oxygen than it does on carbon, but it doesn't show well in this particular contour. Anyhow, that's the pie bonding, and this one is an unsafe, a different unshared pair on oxygen. That's mostly a p rich hybrid, atomic orbital of oxygen, but it's got a little bit of the ch bonding and it's a favorable combination. There's a little bit of favorable bonding between there. Okay, and but, but the nodes that you see in this, it neither orbital are the nodes anti-bonding. They're always the nodes that go through Adam's. They're part of atomic orbitals. These are bonding orbitals, the occupied winds as you expect them to be. Okay, but now let's look at that Lumo, that vacant orbital, the Pi Star orbital. What direction should a high energy homo approach this in order to mix with it?

Speaker 2:          34:08          So it has to get good overlap as it comes in and not run into the other nuclei or the other electron density associated with other oracles on the way yet. Okay, well, here are three possibilities. You could have

Speaker 1:          34:22          attack from within the plane, from the oxygen end, from within the plane toward the carbon, or from straight up the halfway between carbon and oxygen. How do those look as ways for an orbital to come in and overlap?

Speaker 2:          34:37          Suppose it came from the right.

Speaker 1:          34:39          Suppose you had a big ball like Ooh, minus coming in along that Arrow from the right, you're going to get good overlap.

Speaker 2:          34:47          What would you call that situation? Orthogonal. Right? So you're not going to get over. How about the left? The Arrow on the left, that's also going to be orthogonal. How about if you come from the top? It's not precisely orthogonal, but it's pretty close to her thought and all you have both positive and negative overlap. So in fact, none of those are good. Now here are two other possibilities. You could attack the oxygen

Speaker 1:          35:15          or on the top or you could attack the carbon on the top. Which of those do you think looks better?

Speaker 2:          35:22          Carbon wire on Jolen cause it's bigger. Okay, so I'd say that one smaller. So forget that. So come in from the car and then, okay, so here's a better drawing of that orbital and we want to come in actually from that direction at a certain angle, not 90 degrees. With respect to the oxygen carbon bond. Now, why come in from that angle? Why not come straight down on top? There are the nodes, right? This is furthest from the node. So you can overlap the load you want to overlap with without getting near the blue ones. I'd say you shouldn't come into the certain angle. Now there's a prediction. Is it true? So what we're going to do is rotate this. So the orientation

Speaker 1:          36:16          corresponds to a graph that appeared in a paper, uh, buy donuts and Borghi in 1983 when they were analyzing this, now what did they do? They looked at ex-ray crystal structures of many, many crystals that had both a nitrogen in it. So the unshared pair, and they had a carbon oxygen double bond and they looked to see in many, many different structures how those atoms are arranged because they must be arranged in a low energy way next to one another. Okay? That's the way they would pack it in the crystal. Okay, so now how's this diagram made? Well, notice that the carbon and oxygen are drawn there. So that's the carbon and oxygen and they're made. So all these different crystals, some have the group oriented this way, some this way, so this way some this way. So you rotate all those crystals so that their carbons are super imposed with one another and all the structures, the carbons are all there and the oxygen is along this particular line, which lies in the plane of the screen.

Speaker 1:          37:25          Right? And then there are things attached to it, which are our groups and our, our group too, that vis whatever group, hydrogen or carbon or something attached to the, to the carbon. There's one in front of the plane and one behind the plane. Okay. So we rotate all of these different structures around that carbon oxygen bond. So those things are all one, Heidi and the other one, the R in front hides the are behind. And now we look with that orientation to see where the nitrogen is nearby and those dots up on the top show in many different structures labeled a, B, c, d, e, f, g, H, I, j, k, l. Okay. In all those different structures. Where's the nitrogen? So in structure, uh, g of particular compound, the nitrogen is where the blue.is on top. The carbon is all, all the carbons are always there. That's the origin right here. The oxygens are along this line. So the oxygen's along that line and at that position, that distance and the art groups are bent down a little bit from being, one is here and the other one is behind. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          38:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:40          Okay. But now look, let's go. G, h. I. J. K. L. G. H. Hi.

Speaker 2:          38:49          Hey. Hello.

Speaker 1:          38:53          Do you see what happens? Let's go back. Okay. I h. G these are five different crystal structures. Look again. So the nitrogen comes down from one structure to the next. What happens to the RS

Speaker 2:          39:12          as the night as the night comes down, right? The RS bend down. So the nitrogen, the carbon, pardon me, in the middle becomes a pyramidal rather than planer. Back Up. What happens to the oxygen as we do this? There's g H. Okay, now. All right. Okay. So here's what happened. The nitrogen moves down, the RS bend down and the oxygen away. Why does the oxygen move away from the carbon? From a theoretical orbital point of view, where are you putting electrons? Where are you putting the electrons here? When you put them into this Lumo into an orbital, that's Auntie bonding between carbon and oxygen. So the oxygen stretches away from the car nowadays on the screen, the units, what does that that's on? So it's zero is the origin. That's where the carbon is. And there's one offs from 1.0 2.0 3.0 so they start three the nitrogen starts three on the carbon and comes in and gets to be within about 1.6 or something. And I forget my, I'm guessing that that could an actual bond between that nitrogen Carmen's probably the order of 1.3 or something. I'm not actually sure it is. So they haven't quite bonded, but it's following the pathway

Speaker 1:          40:48          of reaction when you look at a lot of these different structures. Okay. Now that angle a 110 degrees, the along the path that they follow is called the Borges Danette's angle. That's the guys who did the paper hotspot. Bergie and Jack Donaldson in Switzerland. So, so there is a, a bunch of what we might consider snapshots of a reaction actually taking place. And you can see that there's a well defined angle from which the nitrogen approaches that Lulo as it mixes with it. No resonance is in trauma, like Eular, Homo Lumo mixing. We've looked here at intermolecular, which is reaction. But next time we'll go onto this slide and look at the analogous thing that happens within a molecule. Okay.
