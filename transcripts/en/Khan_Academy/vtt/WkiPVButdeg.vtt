00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:01.512
- [Voiceover] You are graphing rectangle

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:03.560
ABCD in the coordinate plane.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.962
The following are three of
the vertices of the rectangle.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.249
They give us the coordinates.

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.211
What are the coordinates of point D?

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.230
Alright, well a good place to start,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.202
let's just plot these, the three
vertices that they give us.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:17.605
So it looks like they're
on the first quadrant, so

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:21.491
I'm going to focus my coordinate
axes on the first quadrant.

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:24.807
So that's going to be my y-axis.

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:29.288
And let me now, this is
going to be my x-axis.

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:31.179
And let's see.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.648
The highest x value that I have,

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:35.521
I have a two, I have
a five, I have a five,

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.723
it looks like it goes up to five.

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:38.852
So I could say one,

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:43.814
two, three, four, and five.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.571
So that's five, I can just do

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.621
one, two, three, four, and five.

00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.565
Let's see, the highest y value,

00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:51.793
I have one, one, and a six.

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:52.866
It goes up to six.

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.482
So one, two, three,

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.609
four, five, and six.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.145
I can number them.

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:05.818
One, two three, four, five, and six.

00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:07.439
Now let's plot the points.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.327
So let's first point A,
which is at two comma one.

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:14.057
X equals two, y is equal to one.

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:16.319
So that's that point right over there.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.209
Now let's plot point B.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.006
Point B is at five comma one.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.912
So x equals five, y is equal to one.

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:26.655
That's right over there.

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.084
Now let's plot point C.

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:32.017
Point C, maybe I need to
find another color here.

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:35.387
Point C is at x is equal
to five, y is equal to six.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:39.239
X is equal to five, y is equal to six.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.291
So that sticks us
roughly right over there.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.878
And so we need to figure
out what D is going to be.

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.726
Well D is going,

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:48.806
this is a rectangle.

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:50.611
The sides are parallel, all the vertices,

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.784
we have right angles at all the vertices.

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:57.045
So point D is going to
have the same x coordinate

00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:58.728
as this point right over here.

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.784
So this is going to have
the same x coordinate.

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.988
So it's going to have an x
coordinate, so let me write this.

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:06.270
D is going to have an x coordinate of two.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.471
And it's going to have
the same y coordinate

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.620
as this point up here.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.674
So it's going to have
a y coordinate of six.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.785
Of six.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:18.339
So D is going to be at
the point two comma six.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.267
And you see when we do that,

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.390
we have set up a nice rectangle here.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.946
We can draw the rectangle,

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:26.234
so that's one side, that's the top side,

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:29.351
that's another side, another side.

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:32.479
And then we have that just like that.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.799
There you go, we have our rectangle,

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.334
but most importantly we
answered our question,

00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.876
what are the coordinates
of point D. Alright.
