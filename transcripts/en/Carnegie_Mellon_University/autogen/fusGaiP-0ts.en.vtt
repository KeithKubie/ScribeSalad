third grade of them just things like
 

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.750
third grade of them just things like
that just having these opportunities to

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760
that just having these opportunities to
 

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.789
that just having these opportunities to
meet so many different kinds of people

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799
meet so many different kinds of people
 

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:41.110
meet so many different kinds of people
and being so many different

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120
and being so many different
 

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.759
and being so many different
organizations that may not really have

00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:42.769
organizations that may not really have
 

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:45.159

anything to do with each other but learn

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:45.169
anything to do with each other but learn
 

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.690
anything to do with each other but learn
things from all of them and I think

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:46.700
things from all of them and I think
 

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.540
things from all of them and I think
that's definitely the most valuable

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:51.550
 

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.360
this might sound a bit nerdy but so I

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.370
this might sound a bit nerdy but so I
 

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.350
this might sound a bit nerdy but so I
guess what I learned what I've gained

00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360
guess what I learned what I've gained
 

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.300
