00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.160
I know.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.050
This looks pretty freaky, but what you’re
looking at is actually a monumental step forward

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.580
for medicine.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.599
Researchers have now created an artificial
womb that can successfully keep an extremely

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.130
premature fetus alive and developing normally.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.830
A lamb fetus, that is.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.900
The latest development in artificial placenta-based
life support technology is an update to something

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.390
called the ‘ex vivo uterine environment’
or EVE.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.750
It’s a bag that acts as an external womb,
providing all the physical support an animal

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.140
would receive in utero.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.040
The hope is that it could provide a more natural—and
therefore also more successful—alternative

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.460
to the incubator, the standard clear plastic
box used to hold babies in healthcare environments

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.350
like neonatal intensive care units.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.750
See, a typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks,
and any baby born before the 37 week mark

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.970
is considered premature.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.960
Babies are technically able to survive outside
the womb at about 21-24 weeks, but that’s

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.710
the extreme edge of viability, those babies
are considered extremely premature.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.020
And there’s a reason that one of the leading
causes of death in newborns is being born

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.790
prematurely,—babies are really hard to keep
alive outside the womb before a certain stage

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.150
in their development.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.920
Even with the advances in healthcare we’ve
seen throughout the last several decades,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.390
like artificial airways and better ways to
administer IV fluids to infants, infant mortality

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.119
for babies born before 28 weeks remains as
high as 50%.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.859
And for babies born on or before the edge
of viability, which is about 24 weeks gestation,

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.220
mortality after premature birth is even higher.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.869
Those who do survive premature birth are likely
to still suffer from life-long disabilities

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.470
or chronic health conditions as a result of
stunted organ development, so it makes sense

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.160
that we’re looking for a better way to keep
babies alive and healthier when really, they

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.520
should still be in the womb.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.800
One of the main barriers to a successful artificial
womb, which has been the subject of study

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.770
for over 50 years, is that babies in utero
are surrounded by amniotic fluid.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.000
That’s why their lungs don’t work properly
before 37 weeks, and instead of breathing,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.200
they benefit from a complex shared circulatory
system—they’re attached by their umbilical

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.090
cord and the placenta to their mother, whose
own heart function keeps blood flowing between

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.590
the two, keeping the fetus oxygenated and
taking carbon dioxide away.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.060
Which is why helping premature babies ‘breathe’
outside the womb is such a struggle.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.319
Existing pumps that keep gases flowing through
the baby’s body present the problem of damaging

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.870
its heart—one of the many challenges in
healthcare for premature babies.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.160
So successful artificial wombs, like EVE,
take inspiration from nature—they look like

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.220
a transparent, pillow-shaped plastic bag,
filled with sterile artificial amniotic fluid

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.120
that gets cycled out, gets filtered, and gets
cycled back in.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.770
It relies on a novel, gentle oxygenator that
uses just the fetal heartbeat to create successful

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.030
circulation without causing any damage.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.959
The fetus receives essential amino acids via
IV to replace the nutrients that would normally

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.610
be provided by the mother’s body, and antibiotics,
also via IV, to protect it from infection

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.830
the way its mother’s immune system would.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.470
Basically: we’ve discovered that there’s
no beating the original, so we have to design

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.660
something that’s as close as possible.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.462
A team in 2017 kept premature lamb fetuses
alive and developing normally for up to four

00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:32.660
weeks in an artificial womb, and one of the
lambs that was not euthanized for further

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.840
study was instead bottle-raised, and is still
alive, over a year after emerging from the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840
bag!

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.310
And in 2019 a joint research team between
the University of Western Australia and Tohoku

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.830
University Hospital in Japan successfully
kept extremely pre-term lamb fetuses—at

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.500
the equivalent of 24 weeks of human gestation—alive
for an unprecedented 120 hours.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.170
The lambs even continued to develop wool,
just as they would have normally in utero.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.470
You may be wondering why scientists are using
lamb fetuses.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.500
Sheep are a commonly-used model organism when
studying prenatal development because they

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.860
go through many of the same processes in the
womb as human babies, but they also grow faster

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.350
than the typical nine months, so we can study
the same stages and mechanisms of development,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.120
but at a slightly faster pace.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.299
If this artificial womb stuff is sounding
science fiction-y to you, it’s important

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.089
to remember that we shouldn’t get ahead
of ourselves: I mean for starters this artificial

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:28.869
womb has only been tested so far on sheep,
and only on already developing fetuses.

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:33.939
To grow a whole animal from scratch—that
is, from an embryo—is an entirely different

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.780
story and something we’re quite far off
from achieving.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.569
But hopefully, this technology isn’t too
far away from being implemented with premature

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.259
human babies, improving outcomes for preemies
and their families all over the world.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.499
We have a brand new series that we're stoked
to share with you that's all about what goes

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.680
on in your body when you get sick.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.009
And it’s called...well...Sick.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.400
Beyond treatments and symptoms, we're curious
about how exactly viruses, parasites, and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.169
other invaders wreak havoc on our health.
