of the festival again this year.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.743
Before we get started
I need to inform you

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.496

in the back of the pavilion.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Thank you.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.783
It is my great pleasure

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.950
to be introducing Margaret
Peterson Haddix today.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.750
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.030
&gt;&gt; Margaret grew up on a farm
in Ohio and after graduating

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.410
from Miami University
worked for several years

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.263
as a newspaper editor and reporter.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.196
Her years as a journalist who
covered fact helped pave the way

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.283
for her fiction in a
number of ways not least

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.990
by making her an astonishing
fast productive writer.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.483
Today she is the author of more than
twenty books for kids and teens.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.140
They include <i>Running
Out of Time</i>[HC1], <i>Mrs.</i>

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.343
<i>Dunphrey</i>, <i>The Shadow
Children </i>series and <i>Found </i>,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.136
which is the first book in a
new series called <i>The Missing</i>.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.516
Her books have been honored with The
International Reading Associations

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.810
Children's book award

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.886
and The American Library
Associations Best Book

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.700
and Quick Pick for Reluctant Young
Adult Readers Notations among other

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.300
awards and citations.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.860
Her two most recent books are
<i>into the Gauntlet</i>, the tenth

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.973
and final volume in the thirty nine
clue series and <i>Claim to Fame</i>.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240
<i>Claim to Fame</i>.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.873
<i>Claim to Fame</i> tells the story
of Lindsey Scott, a teenager who,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.966
as a young child, was the star of
a hit TV show, but who withdrew

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.253
from the public eye after what
looked like a nervous breakdown.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.773
Now at 16 she's back in the news
with a tabloid newspaper claiming

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.430
that shes being held
hostage by her Father.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.823
The truth turns out
to be quite different.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.573
Reviewers have hailed
the <i>Claim to Fame</i>

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.946
as a thought provoking story laced
with themes of transcendentalism,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.986
self-centeredness and in the
importance of connectivity.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.700
The bulletin in the center for
children's books has this to say.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.966
Haddix's characters are
as usual superbly drawn

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.876
and Lindsey's struggle to
shape her identity independent

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.973
of what others think of
her will surely resinate

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.140
with many young readers.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.316
Please join me in welcoming
Margaret Peterson Haddix.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.803
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson
Haddix: Thank you.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.623
I actually have an even newer
book, which somehow I think

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.373
that information was neglected
to be given to somebody

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.853
but I'm no promoting <i>Sabotage</i>,
which is the third book

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.156
in <i>The Missing series</i> and I'm
discovering that its very difficult

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.776
to talk about a third
book in a series

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.046
when sometimes people
don't know anything

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.246
about the series as a whole.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.846
So I'm kind of backing up
and explaining a little bit

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.600
about the first book, which is
called <i>Found</i> and the way I got

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.626
that idea for that particular book
and the series as a whole was all

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.660
because I feel asleep
on an airplane.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.496
And I woke up just as the
plane was starting to land.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.540
And because I had been very tired

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.673
and it was along trip I was
totally disoriented when I woke up.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.406
I could not remember where I
had been, couldn't remember

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.420
where I was going and in that
very first instant of waking

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.040
up I really wasn't even sure of
who I was so I was really confused.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.640
Now fortunately it was not
a case of long term amnesia.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.826
In a few minutes, once I was fully
awake, I remembered who I was,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.756
were I was going, were I'd been, I
was fine but I was really fascinated

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.320
by that moment of just total
disorientation and total confusion.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.386
And as an author anytime
that there's something

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.770
that really fascinates me, I kind

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.070
of automatically think how
can I put that in a book?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.263
And so I started thinking about the
fact that as an adult any time I fly

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.820
on an airplane I have to have
some form of identification,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.113
either a passport or a driver's
license or something like that.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.930
But kids are allowed to fly on
airplanes without identification.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.100
And so I started thinking that there
could be a kid or an entire group

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.566
of kids who were disoriented
and confused on an airplane

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.946
and if there weren't any
adults with them who knew

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.140
who they were how would
anybody know?

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.380
And the more I thought about this
idea the more it evolved and changed

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.363
and pretty soon I wasn't just
thinking about as kid or group

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.270
of kids being lost and disoriented
on an airplane I was thinking

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.140
about a bunch of babies
showing up out of nowhere

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.840
and nobody knowing who they were.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.666
And so that is how the first book
in this series <i>Found</i> begins.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.560
A plane lands at an airport in
the midwest and its not scheduled

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.473
to land and nobody knows what its
doing there and they try to talk

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.673
to the pilot, pilot doesn't respond
so finally somebody just walks

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.053
onto the airplane and discovers
that there's not a single adult

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.326
on the entire plane but every seat
in the passenger section is full.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.830
Every seat contains a baby.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.700
And then the action skips
ahead thirteen years

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.733
and there are these two thirteen
year old boys name Jonah and Chip

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.950
who in the course of talking to
each other discover that both

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.603
of them were adopted as infants
and neither of them knows anything

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.343
about their birth parents.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.753
And in Jonahs case he doesn't
think that's a big deal.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.200
He's always known he was adopted,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.733
his attitude is kind
of like well so what.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.366
But then he and Chip both start
getting these mysterious letters.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.250
And the first letter that they get
says, "You are one of the missing,"

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.766
and that's all it says and they
don't know what this means.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.693
They don't know if it's
a prank, they don't know

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.113
if they should take it
seriously, they're just kind

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.473
of freak out by the whole thing.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.086
Then they get the second letter
and the second letter says,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.510
"Beware they're coming
back to get you".

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.550
And then a lot of other
things happen in the book

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.056
but I won't tell you what they
are because it would ruin it

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.603
if you haven't read the book.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.446
I will tell you that after that
<i>The Missing</i> becomes a time travel

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.560
series and in the second book, which
is called <i>Scent</i> Jonah and Chip

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.070
and Jonahs younger brother Katherine

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.010
and another boy whose
name is Alex all go back

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.063
to the year 1483 together.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.476
And I can tell you having done a
lot of research about the year 1483

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.463
that that is not at all the year
that I would choose to go back

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.803
to if I had the power
to travel through time,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.713
mainly because I happen
to like indoor plumbing.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.510
[ Laughter ]

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.376
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.776
And the middle ages were just not
a very pleasant time to live in

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.443
and very dangerous including
dangerous to my poor characters

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.643
and then in this book I'm
moved to another time period

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.650
and another story of
children in danger.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.780
And it revolves around the Virginia
Dare story and I'm just curious

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.843
if anybody would raise
their hand if you learned

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.486
about Virginia Dare
when you were in school.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.340
Okay I saw this boy back here
had his hand up immediately.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.413
Let's see the hands,
who learned about it?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.560
This is very interesting because I
just started my book tour promoting

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.040
this book in California
and evidently

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.046
that Virginia Dare story is not at
all in the curriculum in California.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.066
So I'm saying does anybody
know who Virginia Dare is?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.566
And I have classrooms full of
blank looks looking at me so I have

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.513
to tell the whole story
but I can tell here many

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:39.896
of you already know this story.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.430
It's a fascinating story

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.296
that Virginia Dare was the first
English child born in North America

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.590
because she was born in
the first English colony,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.183
which was not terribly far away from
here in what is now North Carolina.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.583
And the funny thing about her is
I kind of think of it as being

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.673
like if now a days we had
a colony started on Mars.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.063
And I think that if there
was a colony started on Mars

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.990
if there were a child who
was the very first child born

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.723
in Mars we would know everything
about this child's entire existence.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.163
That pretty much every minute of
her life would probably be filmed

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.356
and recorded and when it got

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.966
to be the little Martians baby's
first birthday it would be

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.546
like oh the first child born
on Mars is now one year old

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.823
and then you'd see her fifth
birthday and when she graduated

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.216
from high school you'd
know exactly how that went.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.220
Well in 1587 when Virginia Dare
was the first English child born

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:44.523
in the Roanoke Colony it
was a little bit harder

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.990
to keep tract of people.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.590
In fact we really only
know two things about her.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.430
We know that she was born, we know
that she was baptized and that's it

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.960
because the main person who
was keeping tract of her

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.910
and everything else in the Roanoke
colony was her Grandfather who left

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.350
when she was only about nine
days old went back to England

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.146
to get more supplies and intended to
come right away to help his colony

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.800
but because of various problems
including the Spanish Armada it was

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.500
three years before he
was able to come back

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.030
and see how his colony was doing.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.386
And so finally he got back to
Roanoke Island to see his colony

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.000
and nobody was there and there was
only one word as a clue the word

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.063
"croatoan" carved into a
post and from that he decided

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:47.900
that it probably meant that
his entire colony had moved

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.993
to a nearby island called Croatoan.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.313
And it is amazing to me that in
after that nobody went to check

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.786
on Croatoan to see what
happened to his colony.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.653
So for the past four hundred years
people have wondered what happened

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.933
to Virginia Dare and the other
hundred or so colonists who were

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.000
in the Roanoke colony and
as the more research I did

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.460
about this the more
I really, really,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.880
really wanted to know
what really happened.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.853
And I think at the distance of four
hundred years it's pretty impossible

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.373
to know for sure so I got to make
up all sorts of different things

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.933
as possibilities and my explanation
is sabotage includes things

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.573
like time travel as an
explanation for what happen.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.176
So I'm guessing that its probably
not the most plausible explanation

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.983
for what happened but I had a great
deal of fun making all of that up

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.343
and really hope that readers that
will also enjoy the story a lot.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.383
So I think an adequate amount
of time that if people want

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.936
to start coming up to the
microphones you can do that

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.960
and you are welcome to
ask about any of my books.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.686
You can ask about this
series or anything else.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:02.846
And I will kind of bounce back
and forth between the microphones.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.860


00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.403
So I'll start right there.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.060
&gt;&gt; What was the inspiration for
<i>The Shadow Children's</i> series?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.006
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
What was the inspiration

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:22.806
for <i>The Shadow Children's</i> series??

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.796
I first started thinking about
that idea because my husband

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.033
and I were trying to decide
whether to have a third child

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.866
and this was a hard
decision for us to make.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.050
When our kids were being
very sweet and loving

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.423
and you know wrapping
their arms around us

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.890
and saying we love you Mommy we
love you Daddy we'd think oh its

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.723
so wonderful being parents
lets just have twenty kids.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.560
And then other times and
I'm sure all the parents

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.133
in the crowd can perhaps
identify with this moment.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.540
When our kids were doing things
like throwing temper tantrums

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.513
because Mommy my socks are
on crooked make it stop.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.526
We would think it is
really hard being parents.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.256
There is no way we could
have a third child.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.730
If we had three kids we'd be out
numbered that would be impossible.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.036
So we'd go back and forth and it's
really hard to make a decision

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.056
under those circumstances
so we started looking

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.766
for something factual and rational
to help us and so we started talking

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.160
about over population and in
the context of trying to make

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.030
such a personal decision
myself thinking about the fact

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.070
that in some countries in the world
people are told how many kids they

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.383
are allowed to have that made me
start thinking about how awful

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.600
that would be and it so it
made me think of the society

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.340
where people are only
allowed to have two kids

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.140
and so Luke the main character has
to hide because he's a third child.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.730
&gt;&gt; In <i>The Missing series</i>
you were doing people

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.020
like Virginia Dare would you do any
of the books on Anastasia Romanov?

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.033
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: The
question is in <i>The Missing series</i>

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.693
since I'm looking at
mystery children of history

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.170
like Virginia Dare would
I consider doing someone

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.003
like Anastasia Romanov?

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.190
That is actually someone that at
the beginning I very much intended

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.083
to explore that story
and in-between the time

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
that I wrote the first
book <i>Found</i> and the time

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.153
that I'm thinking I would be writing
that book there was this major news

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.636
that came out of Russia, which was

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.190
that they have positively
identified her bones and determined

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.863
that yes she was killed defiantly
they know that for a fact and so

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.776
that really complicates
things for me.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.700
And I'm trying to figure out I think
I may have a way to work around that

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.823
but I haven't totally decided
how that's going to work

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.730
so that would probably be
the sixth book in the series.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.806
I've already actually written the
fourth book, which is called <i>Torn</i>.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.806
The fifth book I'm working on
now, which is called <i>Cot</i> I think

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.033
and that would be the sixth book

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.500
and the seventh book
will be the final one.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.360
But I still got a little bit of time
before I have to make that decision.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.090
&gt;&gt; I'm thirteen and I
love reading your books.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:16.996
When you were my age what
stuff did you like to read?

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.876
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.143
I pretty much read anything
I could get my hands

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:23.623
on when I was thirteen
including cereal boxes

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:25.910
if there wasn't anything
else available.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.083
Oh really that's in there!

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.140
Who knew? So I enjoyed reading a lot
of older books because they belonged

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.950
to my Mother or my Grandmother
things like <i>Little Women</i> and <i>Anne</i>

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.503
<i>and Green Gables</i> one
of my favorite books was

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.380
from <i>The Mixed-up Files of
Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</i>

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.483
by E.L. Konigsburg, which I
think must be a favorite book

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.010
of many people but I probably read
that book about eight or nine times

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.883
because I just loved it so much.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:55.760
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book that you've written?

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.473
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: What is
my favorite book that I've written?

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.673
I actually do not have a
favorite book out of the ones

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.656
that I've written because its kind
of like trying to pick a favorite

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.710
between my kids and I couldn't do
that and its kind of the same way

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.576
with the books that I
feel like if I picked one

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.570
of the books then the other books
would get their feelings hurt.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:18.930
[ Laughter ]

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.730
&gt;&gt; So I heard you just said
that you're doing seven books.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.133
How do you decide to stop?

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.926
Instead of like the 36 missing
children you're stopping at seven.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.793
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
You know I have had a lot

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.060
of people ask me since I do
mention that there were 36 babies

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.860
on this plane why aren't I doing
36 books because that makes sense.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.513
And I'm thinking at a certain point
it would get very difficult to write

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.866
that many books so I defiantly
know that I want to stop before 36

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.860
and I would much rather stop
when people are still saying,

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.860
"Wow we love this series,"
instead of, "Oh no,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.593
not another one of those books".

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.323
So I kind of arbitrarily settled
on seven and I'm trying to figure

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.003
out the best way to work it so you
get information about all 36 kids.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.236
I did in <i>Sabotage</i> it tells the
story of three of the missing kids

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.273
so I kind of worked it that way.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.023
I don't think I'm going to manage
you know I needed a quick math here

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.923
to figure out if I got three more
books left and I've still got

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.453
like thirty some people left.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.540
That's ten kids per book, I'm not
going to succeed in doing that

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.843
but I'm going to kind of throw in
some information at a certain point

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.983
so you do get to know
what happens to all 36.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.726
&gt;&gt; Is there any advice you
would give a kid who wants

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.546
to be an author when she grows up?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.946
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: There
is advice that I would give somebody

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.146
who wants to be an
author when she grows up.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:50.510
I would say two things that seem
very obvious but its surprising

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.410
to me how many adults don't
know to follow this advice.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.956
I would say read all that
you can because the more

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.373
that you read the more
comfortable you are

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.266
with words the better you
are with dealing with them.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:06.723
Its fun too so it's
kind of a painless way

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.103
to get better as a writer.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:11.920
I would say start writing now and
write all sorts of different things.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.020
I actually wrote a lot more poetry
when I was a kid than anything else

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:20.990
but I think that helped me
playing around with words

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.293
and gave me a lot of experience.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.206
Keeping a journal is a
wonderful thing to do

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.076
because that gives you a lot
of practice with taking things

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.166
from real life and getting
it down in the words

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.000
and you'd be surprised even

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.520
if you think your life is really
boring now I can pretty much

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.420
guarantee that you know in ten
or twenty years if you go back

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.473
and reread a journal that you
kept as a kid you'd be like, wow,

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:48.130
I'm so glad I wrote this
and I still have this

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.063
to know what my childhood was like.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.596
So that's a very good thing.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.300
In general I would also just say
pay attention to things around you

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.080
and think because thinking is
pretty essential to writing.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.710
&gt;&gt; I can't believe
you're giving me advice.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.010
Thank you.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.556
&gt;&gt; What books and TV shows and
movies inspire you to write?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.143
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
Any time I read something

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.876
that is really, really,
really good it inspires me

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.443
to write even though I
think okay there's no way

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.896
that what I'm writing is going to be
that good but there's a great idea

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.513
out there that makes me want
to be more inventive myself.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.333
&gt;&gt; I was wondering
if you were planning

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.366
on starting any more series.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.130
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
Right now I'm kind of focused

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.060
on finishing this series and I have
to admit this is the second series

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.266
that I've done that's all mine.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.466
I also did <i>The 39 Clue</i> book that
I just did one of the ten books.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.200
And I really had a hard time
in-between the two series coming

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.693
up with the idea for this one

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.523
that I was thinking well maybe I'm
just a one series person I'm not a

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.730
two series person.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.883
So I'm really not trying not to put
that pressure on me to try and think

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.710
about what that third
ones going to be yet.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.183
&gt;&gt; I read all <i>The 39 Clues</i>
books and I just love them.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.260
Are there going to be any more, was
book ten the last one or is there?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.833
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
That is a excellent question

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.246
and if you would ask me that
before Wednesday I would have had

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.046
to be very mysterious and kind
of hem and hawed and pretend

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:21.940
like I didn't really know the answer

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:23.650
because on Thursday it was just
announced that they are going

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.960
to another series that's related
to <i>The 39 Clues series</i> with Amy

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.900
and Dan still as the heros.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.796
But its going to be called
<i>The Cahill's vs. The Vesper's</i>

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.410
and it will be six
books in that series.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.886
So it's not like the continuation
of <i>The 39 Clues series</i>

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.300
but it is defiantly another way to
find more about what's happening

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.046
to Dan and Amy and
the other Cahill's.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.580
&gt;&gt; Where I live there's something
called Battle of the Books,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.140
it's where they pick the best
books that are more interesting

00:20:59.500 --> 00:20:59.673
to children and they use
them to battle the questions.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.000
And the book that they choose
by you was <i>Among the Hidden</i>.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.506
What do you think was the best fact
in that that made them choose that?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.066
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.266
I'm sorry I didn't quite catch
the last part of that question.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.000
&gt;&gt; What do you think was the
best fact in <i>Among the Hidden</i>

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:16.400
that would make them choose that?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.000
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
What do I think is the reason

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.000
that they choose <i>Among
the Hidden</i> for that?

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.490
I think one of the things that
I have heard from lots of kids

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.766
over the years about what makes
<i>Among the Hidden</i> popular is

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.363
that it is something that
appeals to both boys and girls.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.463
And a lot of times I know
schools have trouble finding books

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.220
that both boys and
girls will like so

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.080
that was probably something
that helped it.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.373
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for <i>Uprising</i>?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.896
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
<i>Uprising</i> was the first book

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.846
that I had ever written where
I was not the person who came

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.253
up with the original
idea for the book.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.586
It was actually suggested
to me by my editor

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.506
that he thought there should
be a young adult in that novel

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.026
about the triangle shirtwaist
factory fire in the early 1900's

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.136
in New York City, which
was a very tragic event

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.590
where 146 people were killed,
mainly teenage girls who worked

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.686
in this factory where they generally
would lock the doors as soon

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.570
as the workers got
there in the morning.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.836
So when a fire broke
out a lot of them died.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.026
And it was an important event in
history that made a change in a lot

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.303
of laws that deal with how
employers can treat employees.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.083
It was a very important event
but obviously also very tragic

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.540
and my editor had suggested that
I might want to something about it

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.763
because he thought
it was so important.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.303
The kind of funny thing is

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.313
by the time I actually wrote the
book another author had written a

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.160
novel about it as well for young
adults called <i>Ashes of Roses</i>

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.586
by Mary Jean Ash and I have heard
that that's a very good book

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.733
but I had gotten so deep
into the research for this

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.733
that I think maybe ten
years or so I might be ready

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.216
to read something else about
it that somebody else has done

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.536
but I think I need a break
for awhile before that.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.180
&gt;&gt; What gave you the idea
for <i>The Palace of Mirrors</i>?

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.726
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson
Haddix: What gave me the idea

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.193
for <i>The Palace of Mirrors</i>?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460
Let me double check something.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.393
How much time do I have left?

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.326
Are we down to five minutes?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.726
I've got time okay.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.926
It's a long story so that's
why I have to check that.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.460
The inspiration for <i>The Palace</i>

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.106
<i>of Mirrors</i> actually dates
all the way back to when I was

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.213
in high school and I grew up
in a very rural area of Ohio

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.563
and the big deal every summer where
I grew up was the county fair.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.203
So I was very proud my senior
year in high school because I got

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.230
to be one of the county
fair Queen attendants,

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:47.356
which meant that every day for
that week I got to wear a tiara

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.846
and a sash and a frilly dress and
high-heeled shoes and then walk

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.560
through hog manure to give kids
ribbons for their prized hogs

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.723
or cows or chickens or whatever
they brought to the fair.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:04.150
And now that I'm an adult
thinking about that, I think,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.120
why did I wear open
toed high healed shoes?

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.343
Eww, that was gross.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.483
But at the time it
was just a fun week.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.213
The week ended, I packed stuff away,
went off to college very shortly

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.283
after that and really stopped
thinking of myself as the type

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.570
of person who would ever
wear a tiara and a sash.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:28.793
So then years after that
when my daughter was

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.953
in kindergarten she came home
from school one day and announced

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.256
that she was going to be a
fairy princess for Halloween.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.340
And so I was thinking how we'd
carry this costume off and I thought

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.853
that tiara that I wore
as a county fair Queen

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.766
that would be perfect
for her costume.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.053
And my next thought was I have
no idea what ever happened

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.540
to that tiara and this
sentence just jumped

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.316
into my mind and the sentence was.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.556
Somewhere in the world I
have a tiara in a little box

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.466
and I'd really like that sentence.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.260
I wrote it down in this
writer's journal that I keep

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:12.606
and periodically I would look
at that sentence and think

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.273
that would be a really good
first sentence for a book.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.703
I just have no idea what the other
sentences in the book would be.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:24.906
And eventually I figured out that
the book needed to have nothing

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:28.616
to do with county fairs but
needed to be about a girl

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:31.916
who was the true royalty of
her kingdom but was not allowed

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.960
to tell anyone because
her life was in danger,

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.880
which as you know is what
happens in <i>Palace of Mirrors</i>.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.480
&gt;&gt; I read <i>Found and Sent</i>
and I haven't read <i>Sabotage</i>

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.296
so I'm not sure if it's in
that book but I was wondering

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.350
if you had written it in <i>Sabotage</i>

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.740
or if you had already decided
what Jonahs identity was?

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.063
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix:
That is a very good question

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.223
and that's a question
that I get asked a lot.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.550
What is Jonahs identity?

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.083
I do not reveal it in <i>Sabptage</i>
and at the moment my plan is not

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.960
to reveal it until the seventh book.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:20.000
&gt;&gt; How did you decide not to use
-- like to use babies on the plane

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.633
and not like children or something?

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.110
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: Well
the question is, how did I decide

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.476
to use babies on a plane, instead
of just leaving it as children.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.543
As I thought about it unless I
wanted to write about a whole group

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:41.070
of children who suddenly got
amnesia all at the same time,

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.560
which would be a little
bit difficult to explain,

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.820
I had to figure out someway

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:47.803
to explain why they didn't
remember where they came from.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.936
And baby's very fortunately for me
don't remember where they came from.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.916
So that was part of my rational

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.650
and actually I think its more
mysterious that it's babies.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.150


00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.146
&gt;&gt; Why did you do some of the
different things that you did

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.310
in <i>The final 39 Clues</i> book?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.583
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: Was
the question why did I do some

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:19.670
of the things that I did
in <i>The 39 Clues</i> book.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.816
Well it's kind of a mix of some of
the things I was told I needed to do

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.493
because the series needed to be
consistent with the things earlier

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.240
that I was told that it needed

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.973
to take place part of
the time in England.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:33.470
I was told that I needed
to work William Shakespeare

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.210
in as the historical figure and
there were a couple other things

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:40.420
that I was told that I needed to
do and other than that it was kind

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:43.853
of what I wanted to imagine and
how I could work things out.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.080
And I kind of played
off the idea of things

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.680
that I thought would be interesting
to throw in there in England

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.940
and things that I thought would
be interesting to throw in there

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:56.333
from William Shakespeare's life.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:58.786
And one of the things
that I thought was fun

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.413
when I was doing the research about
William Shakespeare getting ready

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.026
to write this book was

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.260
that I discovered even though
William Shakespeare's pretty much,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.460
that everybody almost
entirely agrees

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.786
that he's the greatest
writer who's ever lived.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.686
But evidently he really could not
spell and they have six signatures

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.170
that he has done that they are
pretty sure he was really the person

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:31.556
who wrote them, none of them are
spelled exactly the same way.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.003
So it's pretty funny that you know
here's the greatest writer ever

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.176
and he couldn't spell.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.820
Now, in his defense, during his
time period there was no such thing

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.666
as standardized spelling.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.103
You know pretty much everybody
just spelled things however they

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.030
felt like.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.830
So for you kids that
meant no spelling test

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.100
in William Shakespeare's time, which
would have been really nice I'm sure

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.026
but it also meant that
it was very confusing

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:55.550
when people tried to read things.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.633
So I thought that was a fun
[inaudible] so I put that in there.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.906
There were lots of
other things like that

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.506
as I was doing the research I
discovered that I wanted to put in.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.153
&gt;&gt; Where did you get your
idea for <i>Just Ella</i>?

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.310
&gt;&gt; Margaret Peterson Haddix: Where
did I get my idea for <i>Just Ella</i>?

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:12.890
Well that dates back to when
my daughter was really little

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:16.740
and she's a senior in high school
now so this was many years ago

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.666
and she was obsessed with
fairy tales when she was

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.930
about two, three, four years old.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.673
And so she could sit there for hours
having me read fairly tales to her,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.900
which I was very proud that
she had such an attention span

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:32.330
and I was glad that
she loved books already

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.456
but reading those fairy tales to
her they started really bugging me.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.186
It really bugged me that it seemed

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.453
like in every single
fairy tale I read to her

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.063
at some point there could be a
sentence that was something like

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.893
and then the prince took one
look at her and fell in love

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.733
because she was so beautiful.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.243
And I felt like saying
to my daughter okay honey

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.670
if this strange guy that you've
never met before comes up to you

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.826
and gets down on bended knee
and says, "Will you marry me"?

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.863
Do not say yes right away.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.003
If he seems like he might be a
decent guy, maybe you can say maybe

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:18.920
but this whole love at first sight
idea was a little bit scarey.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:22.453
So writing <i>Just Ella</i> was kind
of my way of dealing with that

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.923
and because I couldn't say all that
to my daughter when she was only two

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.036
or three years old so I
wrote the book instead.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.416
Okay I think were done then.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.083
I'm being told by the
time keeper here.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.333
So thank you very much
for your great questions.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.266
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming up though.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.666
So close, so close.
