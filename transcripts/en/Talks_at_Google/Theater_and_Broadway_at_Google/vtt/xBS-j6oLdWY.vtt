to come because he

The story we are telling
today is also true.

has been three days

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.530
since I have been robbed of
literally everything but a Neil

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.520

the back of our mother's car.

And at this point
in the story, it

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.460
is a time to go back to work.

STEVE ROSEN: And oddly enough,
it felt like Neil came with me.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.120
I had listened to him
for 72 straight hours,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.050
and it made the journey
from overwrought and corny

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.100
to comforting and awesome.

the third letter

is a sketchy little envelope
with no return address.

unfolds with me

telling the story of what
happened to me one year ago.

And he's living in
it as I'm telling it.

opportunity to kind of know

there's a happy ending coming,

much movement in this.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.440
I mean, I'm serious.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.690
It's like a workout.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.580
I would have to do
so much work just

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.580
to stand in the right place that
you guys are standing on stage,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.470
much less sing once I got there.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.450
STEVE ROSEN: One of my greatest
skills is putting on weight.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.597
So thank you for that.

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:57.680
But it's a natural talent.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.395
It was god-given.

00:19:58.395 --> 00:19:59.460
You should meet my family.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.300
We've all been graced with it.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.540
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, no, I--
not to name drop a little bit,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.178
my friend Steve Boyer, who was
in the show "Hand to God"--

00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:05.470
DAVID ROSSMER: I know him well.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.330
MARK DOUGLAS: He--

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.460
I went to visit him after
a show and he was, like,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.940
chugging Ensure or
protein shakes because he

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.920
couldn't-- because he was just
sweating so much every night.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.420
And--

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.120
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.730
MARK DOUGLAS: --but
so, it's really--

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.390
very talented.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.348
STEVE ROSEN: Thank you.

00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:20.098
Thank you so much.

00:20:20.098 --> 00:20:21.598
MARK DOUGLAS: This
might have-- this

00:20:21.598 --> 00:20:24.005
might have been because I
was too close to the stage,

00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.130
but I don't know if this
was a detail that I should

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.720
or shouldn't notice,
because I felt

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.340
like Josh changed
a lot in a year,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.980
but his fashion sense
didn't change too much.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.430
And previous Josh
had on New Balance,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.010
and then present
Josh had on Skechers.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.150
I feel like that's at
least a lateral move.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.680
But maybe I was just too close.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.130
DAVID ROSSMER: Those
are the little Easter

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.547
eggs you get when you sit in
the front, that and our spit.

00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:50.750
It's really, it's--

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.060
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, I did--

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.320
DAVID ROSSMER: There's a
lot of perks to sitting

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.210
in the first few rows.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.350
MARK DOUGLAS: I got
to see the spit,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.900
but I was kind of
off to the side.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.648
So it was nice to just
see the poor victims.

00:20:58.648 --> 00:20:59.940
DAVID ROSSMER: It's like Shamu.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.980
It's like the first
few rows may get wet.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.105
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I'm a--

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:06.840
I'm a sucker for any kind of
immersive, interactive stuff,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.530
where the audience comes out
at you, spits on you, whatever.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.443
I just, like, oh, my god.

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:13.110
He's over there.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.943
Now he's over there.

00:21:13.943 --> 00:21:16.020
And how did he get a bass?

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.670
Are there any
people that are not

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.890
as enthusiastic and
receptive to that,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.940
like when you interact with them
and they were just like, no.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.810
Or any good stories about that.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.390
STEVE ROSEN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.723
JANE BRUCE: Oh, there's-- in
Samuel Cohen which you just

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:32.990
saw, there's a moment where I
try and find basically as many

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.615
women in the audience as
I can to flirt with me.

00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:38.240
And there have been a couple of
shows where I go over to a lady

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.260
and she does not want it.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.450
And it's really--
that's a bummer.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.200
But I keep trying.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.617
MARK DOUGLAS: She's insane,
whoever that woman is.

00:21:47.617 --> 00:21:48.950
JANE BRUCE: I just find another.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.520
It's great.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.645
MARK DOUGLAS: There you go.

00:21:50.645 --> 00:21:54.170
And you are-- you and
Cathryn are both pretty new

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:54.788
to the show--

00:21:54.788 --> 00:21:55.580
JANE BRUCE: Indeed.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.830
MARK DOUGLAS: --which was a
shock because I felt like,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.070
watching it, the choreography,
just being in the right place

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.690
at the right time,
I saw somebody

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.990
throw a prop in the
refrigerator at one point

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.413
and then get it later.

00:22:06.413 --> 00:22:08.330
I just felt like, OK,
this is a company that's

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.020
just been doing this for years.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.100
And I would have never known
that you guys just started.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.677
What was the learning process
for both of you like for this?

00:22:15.677 --> 00:22:18.260
JANE BRUCE: Well, to start, it
helped that we're, like, really

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.070
talented, you know?

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.903
MARK DOUGLAS: Right.

00:22:19.903 --> 00:22:20.800
Sure, sure.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.020
That you're a Jedi, OK.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.060
STEVE ROSEN: And modest.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.768
JANE BRUCE: I'm--

00:22:23.768 --> 00:22:24.820
I'm joking.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.490
It was really daunting.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.600
It's definitely hard work and
learned mostly by watching.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.790
I watched the show,
like, 14 or 15 times,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.370
and had a couple rehearsals,
and fortunately, everyone's

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.580
really, really, really
nice, except for Steve.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.860
And-- and--

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.240
MARK DOUGLAS: And you get
to play Neil Diamond, which

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.450
is the best.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.290
JANE BRUCE: I know.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.370
It's really fun.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.037
MARK DOUGLAS: It's--
I actually wanted--

00:22:45.037 --> 00:22:46.985
like, I always play a
game when I watch a show

00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:49.360
and when I pretend I'm as
talented as the people on stage

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.390
where I go, what's my part?

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.015
What's my part?

00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:53.560
And I was like,
OK, Luke, oh, yeah.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.110
That guitar solo
is too hard for me.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.060
Yeah.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.760
And-- and actually, your part,
I was like, I want that one.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.260
Which is--

00:22:59.260 --> 00:22:59.810
JANE BRUCE: Yeah.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.477
MARK DOUGLAS: --which
is nice, you know?

00:23:01.477 --> 00:23:04.070
That the woman part is
the one that I want.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.050
That it's that well--

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.940
you know, it's not
just a white guy just

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.550
talking about himself, right?

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.380
I don't know.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.290
Let me just go
back to these here.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.170
Sorry, any questions
from the audience?

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:17.960
JANE BRUCE: It's a blast though.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.627
And I know Cathryn
had a lot because she

00:23:19.627 --> 00:23:21.050
had to take over the drums.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.200
I mean--

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.530
MARK DOUGLAS: I know.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.040
JANE BRUCE: --that's
an enormous job.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.410
MARK DOUGLAS: And had you
played the drums before?

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.950
CATHRYN WAKE: I had a kit in
my basement when I was 12,

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.040
but no, I took over for
Hannah Ellis who is just

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.470
this incredible lady
drummer, and definitely

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.190
had her blessing.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.050
But I played drums incessantly.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.020
And apologized to all of
my neighbors and roommates,

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.630
but I didn't stop playing
drums for two weeks.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.588
MARK DOUGLAS: Was that--
was that the main sort

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:44.360
of challenge, or--

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.110
CATHRYN WAKE: That
was definitely,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.902
like, a hurdle to get
over, but again, this

00:23:46.902 --> 00:23:51.730
is the most welcoming,
incredible family to fall into.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.280
Yeah.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.405
MARK DOUGLAS: One thing I
have to say that I really

00:23:54.405 --> 00:23:58.070
noticed about when
you played Aunt B was

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.530
how much-- it was like an
acting lesson of don't act old.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.710
If it was like-- act--

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.760
old people act young, they just
can't quite do the movements.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.190
I was just-- I was kind
of blown away about just--

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.270
CATHRYN WAKE: I think
she's got some moves.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.630
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.480
CATHRYN WAKE: I really do.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.010
I think she's nimble.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.427
MARK DOUGLAS: What's the-- is
there a dance move that kind

00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:16.640
of gets you into that, or--

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:16.940
CATHRYN WAKE: Oh, god.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.360
You know, I don't call
myself a dancer at all--

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:18.820
MARK DOUGLAS: I feel like
it's a shoulder thing.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.090
CATHRYN WAKE: --but
there's a lot of shoulders

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.050
and there's a lot of hips.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.440
MARK DOUGLAS: Sassy shoulders.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.790
CATHRYN WAKE: And whatever
else happens, all bets

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.590
are off, honestly.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.570
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.480
Who is probably the
busiest in the show?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.620
Is there-- is
everybody equally busy?

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.120
Everybody,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.210
CATHRYN WAKE: Everybody.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.460
STEVE ROSEN: I think we're
all busy in different ways.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.335
I mean, I-- I don't play
a lot of instruments

00:24:34.335 --> 00:24:36.050
but I handle a lot of props.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.700
So papers, and pens, and
things, are my instruments,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.550
but I think that between
everybody on stage,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.000
I think we play 53 characters,
and I want to say--

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.750
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.750
STEVE ROSEN: --something like
more than two dozen instruments

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.738
over the course of 90 minutes.

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:50.780
So we're all pretty busy.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.590
It's like a thrill ride.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.450
Once you get on, it's
just you're on the ride

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.590
and you get out of its way.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.632
It's going to keep going.

00:24:55.632 --> 00:24:56.580
It's really fun to do.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.788
MARK DOUGLAS: That's awesome.

00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.850
So now when you bring new
people into the show, I noticed,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.327
like-- so are the tracks
kind of set in stone?

00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.910
Would you ever bring
somebody in who's

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.980
like, look, the drums
just aren't happening.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.176
So can we do a--

00:25:09.176 --> 00:25:11.598
you know, I-- no?

00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:13.640
DAVID ROSSMER: I think
the show would sound worse

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.680
without drums, but
we could try it.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.438
MARK DOUGLAS: No, I'm
saying could you move,

00:25:16.438 --> 00:25:16.760
could you change the tracks?

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.420
DAVID ROSSMER: Like a beatboxer.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.370
Maybe if someone was like,
but I beatbox really well.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.450
MARK DOUGLAS: Could you be
like, hey, for this one,

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.740
can I play the bass instead?

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.823
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:22.823 --> 00:25:23.630
Well, it's-- no.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.620
We would never do that.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.580
That would be crazy.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.090
But what we-- what
we have done is

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.690
while we were in rehearsal,
right up to literally

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.340
our previews, people
were changing instruments

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.340
because this cast is
so incredibly talented.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.320
The director, Hunter
Foster, the day--

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.503
I think the day of our
first preview was like,

00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:42.920
you know, I think
this scene would

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.040
work better if
Louis played guitar

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.810
and Luke played the bass.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.640
And we were like, that's crazy.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.510
You can't make them switch
instruments right on the spot.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.240
And 10 minutes later, they
had switched instruments

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.975
and were playing totally new
parts, and new instruments,

00:25:58.975 --> 00:26:00.350
and new blocking,
and everything,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.450
and we were like, OK, I
guess they can do anything.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.050
And that is really-- this
company can do anything.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.550
They will pick--
they're like, oh, I

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.133
don't know how to
play this harmonica.

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:10.300
Badoo, badoo, doo, doo.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.900
It's unbelievable.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.420
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, I think
Louis had the best bass

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.275
face, though.

00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:15.620
LOUIS TUCCI: Thank you.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.365
MARK DOUGLAS: I don't know if--

00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:16.940
LOUIS TUCCI: Thank you.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.280
MARK DOUGLAS: --if that's
something you work on.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.405
LUKE DARNELL: Can you give
us the bass face, Louis?

00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:21.470
LOUIS TUCCI: Bass face.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.340
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, at one
point you came during the show--

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.640
LOUIS TUCCI: It's on
the poster, isn't there?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:24.910
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.270
LOUIS TUCCI: Yeah,
the bass face.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.687
MARK DOUGLAS: At one point,
you were, like, right up close

00:26:27.687 --> 00:26:28.810
to me, just--

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.910
and I get nervous when there's--

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.503
make eye contact with a
performer, so I kind of just

00:26:34.503 --> 00:26:35.270
was--

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.806
but in my head, just
know that I was like--

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:39.620
just Neil--

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.370
LOUIS TUCCI: Cool.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.745
MARK DOUGLAS: No,
not Neil Peart.

00:26:41.745 --> 00:26:42.520
Geddy Lee-ing out.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:42.710
LOUIS TUCCI: Oh, yeah.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.955
He's Canadian, by the way.

00:26:43.955 --> 00:26:44.720
STEVE ROSEN: So is Louis.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.012
MARK DOUGLAS: You must be, too.

00:26:46.012 --> 00:26:47.840
LOUIS TUCCI: I am, too.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.360
MARK DOUGLAS: Canadian pride.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.277
Let's see, what else?

00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.610
Anybody else have any questions?

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.110
No?

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.170
OK.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.045
So I feel--

00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:58.040
I kind of came
into this blindly.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.380
Sometimes I don't
like to know anything.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.880
And I totally thought
that it was all true.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.022
I thought, well,
that's Josh Cohen,

00:27:07.022 --> 00:27:08.480
and these are his
actor friends who

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.790
are helping him tell the story.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.960
But let me tell you why.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.300
Because I've lived in New York
since 1996, which makes me old,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.650
but a version of just about
everything that happened

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.000
happened to me.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.392
Like, I was a bellman.

00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:26.600
And I'm not going to make
this about me for too long.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.410
But I was a bellman, and
once some woman checked in

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.525
and she went up to her
room and was waiting for me

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:34.400
to bring up her bags.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.420
I looked out and on the
curb, there was an envelope,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.615
and I went out and looked at
it, and it was all hundreds.

00:27:41.615 --> 00:27:43.740
And I just kind of flipped
through and I was like--

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.610
and I looked around, and it was
one of those rare moments where

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.950
nobody was seeing me.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.500
And I was like, what to do?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.510
And so I was like, I don't know.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.970
And the woman was
kind of bitchy.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.677
So this ties in with
his whole moral dilemma.

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:00.260
I'm not just--

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.940
DAVID ROSSMER: This is
actually not a performance.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.700
We actually are
here to arrest you.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.450
Here he is, folks.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.110
STEVE ROSEN: He admitted
to it, everyone.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.180
DAVID ROSSMER: Take him away.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:06.950
MARK DOUGLAS: I
wrestled with it.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.370
DAVID ROSSMER: Finally.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.640
MARK DOUGLAS: I
wrestled with it.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.970
Didn't even count it because I
was afraid of how much it was.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.060
And I was like, I can't--

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.790
I am at work.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.230
So I went up and I said, hey,
did you by any chance drop

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.550
an envelope?

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.710
And she looked in her
purse and was like,

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.358
I saw the look of panic and
I just went here you go.

00:28:24.358 --> 00:28:25.400
I found it on the street.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.490
And she-- she literally
went thanks, and handed me

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.860
the dollar she was
already going to tip me.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.050
I thought at least she'd peel
off one of those hundreds.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.970
So that's what happens
in real life, bub.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.240
But a lot of it is about
the non-appreciation

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.272
of the other Josh Cohen.

00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:45.230
But anyway, I thought--

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.147
I thought it was real.

00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:50.900
How much was it taken from
real life, not to quote

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.585
the song, but--

00:28:51.585 --> 00:28:53.210
DAVID ROSSMER: We
always-- no, it's OK.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.290
We always say that the show is
under the umbrella of truth.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:02.038
When we started writing it, we
were actually in Los Angeles,

00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:03.580
and we had a TV
meeting the next day.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.700
We were very nervous.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.760
And Steve suggested
playing a video game

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.470
in the sublet apartment he had.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.720
And they had-- I think
it was Mario Kart.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.490
And we never ended
up playing the game

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.470
because the opening screen--

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.860
the music sounded like a
long lost Neil Diamond album.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.560
And so we grabbed the
guitar off the sublet wall,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.460
and by the end of the night, we
had written five or six songs

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.850
to lyrics of takeout menus.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.150
I think "Samuel Cohen's
Family Tree" was like--

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.780
STEVE ROSEN: It was like
"Angel's Korean Barbecue."

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.613
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah.

00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:34.200
And--

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.110
STEVE ROSEN: (SINGING)
Angel's Korean barbecue.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.820
DAVID ROSSMER:
(SINGING) barbecue.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.540
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, I want
to see that musical.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:37.980
DAVID ROSSMER: That's--

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.110
[INAUDIBLE] mean something.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.830
STEVE ROSEN: Very
different musical.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.663
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah.

00:29:40.663 --> 00:29:42.843
But we just were
having so much fun.

00:29:42.843 --> 00:29:45.260
And we started to write all
these fake Neil Diamond songs.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.840
Like, what would be on a
long lost Neil Diamond album?

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.610
And by the time we
were done, we were

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.340
more interested in this idea
than we were in the TV thing.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.340
And we said, what
musical would justify

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.610
having the entire score
feel like an album inspired

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.540
by Neil Diamond?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.630
And we thought, well,
Steve, you were once robbed.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.160
What if this
character was robbed

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.490
of everything but this CD?

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.073
And so that's all
he had to listen to,

00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:09.500
so his whole world becomes
sort of Neil Diamond.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.630
And then I brought
up a story that

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.700
happened to me that was true.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.340
And we said, oh, that
would really connect well.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.890
And then we started to put
together all these true stories

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.750
from our lives that
made each other laugh.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.480
So the show is comprised
of a bunch of stories

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.450
that are true from our lives.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.180
And it's fun to sort of
relive them every night,

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.280
and horrifying, too.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.760
But it's-- and that was
really where we started.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.710
We knew we always
wanted-- we always

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.610
talked about sort of telling a
Job-like story of someone who

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.860
gets something they
think they want

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.460
and by losing it ends up
finding what they really wanted,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.090
which in this case is love.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:53.330
But speaking to your point about
feeling like this is universal

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.190
and that this has
happened, right

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.870
when we first did the show--

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.360
we met at summer
camp, you know, where

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.770
all Jews do in the summer.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.880
And-- and this guy who
went to camp with us named

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.190
Josh Cohen had left a message.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.592
And he said, please
call me back.

00:31:08.592 --> 00:31:09.300
It's very urgent.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.610
And I called him back.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.470
And he said, I just
wanted to talk to you

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.560
because I'm very upset that you
would write a musical about me

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.330
and not tell me.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.540
And I said, Josh, we both
knew you as an acquaintance.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.380
We liked you.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.570
We were friends, but we
don't know a ton about you.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.450
We would never write a
show without asking you

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.300
for permission.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.500
And he said, oh, oh, that's
interesting because I'm broke,

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.197
I'm alone, and I
like Neil Diamond.

00:31:34.197 --> 00:31:36.030
MARK DOUGLAS: He's got
the flannel shirt on.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:36.905
Like, come on, buddy.

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:37.863
DAVID ROSSMER: Totally.

00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:40.190
And so we thought, this--
we may have a show here

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.440
that speaks to more
people than just us.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.670
And we had written it to
kind of cheer ourselves up.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.862
We were single at the time.

00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:48.320
And we've always said since
then, if you come see the show,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.000
it's sort of like
a good luck charm

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.610
because it has birthed couples.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.150
And the stage manager and
the associate stage manager

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.730
of one production are
now married with a kid.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.160
And people, whether it's
love or just having bad luck

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.080
in their lives, when
they come see the show,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.460
something happens
and they always

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.100
write to us afterwards and say
that their lives have somehow

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.640
changed.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.110
And so we're kind of like this
weird somatic rabbit's foot.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.720
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, it did-- it
did have a great sort of theme

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.350
of just putting-- if you
put yourself out there,

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.720
no matter the
weirdest possible way,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.770
just writing angry letters
to the other Josh Cohen

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.440
and then someone finds
those and likes those,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.840
and then that happens to be
the woman that-- not you, Mary,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.980
which I thought it was.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.790
I totally bought it.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.510
But yeah, I love
that idea that--

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.440
I felt like it really
captured New York

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.390
in a way that didn't overdo it.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.380
I think that first line about--

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.070
I'm going to butcher it--

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.670
about burglary being a rite
of passage in New York.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.560
Like, I remember
when I got mugged,

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.050
and I wanted so much
sympathy from everyone,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.460
and I happened to
speak to people

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.252
who had lived in the
city their whole lives

00:33:00.252 --> 00:33:02.290
and they were like,
yeah, I've been mugged.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.770
And I was like, yeah,
but did you get hit?

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:04.240
I got hit.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.880
And they were like,
not the first time.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.560
And then you're just like,
that's what New York--

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.080
it's just brutal,
brutal, brutal.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.780
And then out of nowhere,
it turns out OK.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.710
That's and that's why
I really thought, yeah,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.460
this all happened.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.500
I totally bought it.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.055
And I wish you weren't
a liar is basically--

00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:22.430
STEVE ROSEN: It's
so nice to hear

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.050
but I think that
what it speaks to

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.930
is sort of the universal
experience of getting crapped

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.560
on.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.435
And I think that that's
something that we all

00:33:29.435 --> 00:33:31.040
can sort of relate to.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.910
And to speak to David's
point, his story about camp,

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.470
NPR did a piece this weekend.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.130
There was another Josh Cohen
at that camp who also thought

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.760
the musical was about him.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.450
So people wind up
leaving this story--

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.880
MARK DOUGLAS: Josh Cohens
are inherently narcissistic.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.800
I don't know if you know that.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.992
They tend to think
everything is about them.

00:33:50.992 --> 00:33:53.450
They tend to think they're the
first one to wear the shirt.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.530
STEVE ROSEN: Totally, totally.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:54.740
MARK DOUGLAS: But--

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.570
DAVID ROSSMER: It doesn't
help that Josh Cohen is

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.840
literally like the John
Smith of Jewish names, too.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.965
MARK DOUGLAS: Right, right.

00:33:59.965 --> 00:34:00.860
Exactly.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.360
So you-- you had to learn the
most instruments, did you not?

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.777
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE:
Yes, I think

00:34:04.777 --> 00:34:05.860
that is probably accurate.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.985
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, how
many-- how many instruments

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:09.690
did you have to
start from scratch?

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.409
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE: Well,
I had played piano, and so 5

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.960
of the 11 instruments I
play are piano related.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.929
We have piano, accordion,
keytar, glockenspiel,

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:18.830
and melodica.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.030
CATHRYN WAKE: That's
a keytar, everyone.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.629
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE:
That's correct.

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.929
CATHRYN WAKE: Keytar.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.804
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE:
We're back to the '80s.

00:34:22.804 --> 00:34:23.480
You're welcome.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.449
So those were all
familiar enough,

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.590
but then I also learned acoustic
guitar, and electric bass,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:36.460
and violin, and clarinet, and
I do some auxiliary percussion.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.997
And at earlier
versions of the show

00:34:37.997 --> 00:34:40.080
as we were talking about
with the preview process,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.159
we also had saxophone,
oboe, and trumpet

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.491
in there, which were cut between
previews and opening night.

00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:48.449
MARK DOUGLAS: So you
learned those for nothing.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:49.520
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE: So I
learned those for nothing.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.270
But you know what?

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.960
Now I can do--

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.460
I can teach my Intro
to the Symphony class.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:53.960
You know?

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.190
I've got a little bit of every
instrument in my bones now.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.940
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.840
So has there ever
been any mishaps

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.450
where I'm supposed
to have a bass

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.820
but I have a ukulele
someone handed me?

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.210
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE:
Well, we've

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.220
had moments where
something is going wrong,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.340
a guitar doesn't get on fast
enough, and so I'm like,

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.860
oh, I'm holding a
baritone ukulele.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.008
What chord is that that
he's about to play but he

00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:16.050
doesn't have the answer--

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.370
OK, cool.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.850
I'll play that on
this instrument.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.710
So we do a lot of in the moment
fixing, saving, tweaking.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.938
If a bass goes out,
we have a bass sound

00:35:23.938 --> 00:35:24.980
we can use on the keytar.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.460
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, wow.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.085
ELIZABETH NESTLERODE: So we try
to think of as many contingency

00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:31.320
plans as possible as well as
having backup instruments.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.910
Yeah.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.800
MARK DOUGLAS: Louis,
that opening bass line,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.590
what's that from?

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.740
Is that influenced by something?

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.580
I feel like--

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.350
LOUIS TUCCI: Well,
David and Dan--

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.230
MARK DOUGLAS: I just
wanted to ask you

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.650
because I haven't spoken
to you in a while.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.210
LOUIS TUCCI: --and
Steve wrote that.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.740
I mean, it's a fun bass part.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.010
It's a very fun bass part.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:44.630
MARK DOUGLAS: You play
the hell out of it.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.755
LOUIS TUCCI: Oh, thank you.

00:35:45.755 --> 00:35:46.430
Thank you.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.210
It's not really
easy, but it's fun

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.363
to play once you
get it in your body.

00:35:52.363 --> 00:35:54.530
MARK DOUGLAS: But you were
talking about Mario Kart.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.920
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.587
MARK DOUGLAS: That--
that bass line felt

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:59.000
very video game inspired to me.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.070
Is that-- is that something
I'm making up or--

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:01.987
DAVID ROSSMER: No, no.

00:36:01.987 --> 00:36:04.490
It was probably
inspired by that game.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.840
Funny enough, it was--

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.490
I think the song
that was our lead

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.310
in for that particular
bass was a Billy Joel

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.660
song, strangely enough.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.320
He has one--

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:12.740
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.282
DAVID ROSSMER: --country-esque
song called "Traveling Prayer"

00:36:15.282 --> 00:36:17.330
that, like, Dolly Parton
covered or something.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.538
And that opening number
you're talking about actually

00:36:19.538 --> 00:36:21.890
was the last song we
ever wrote for the show.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.830
We always knew that the show
needed an opening number

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.792
and we weren't quite
sure what it was.

00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:28.250
It was a really
tough nut to crack.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.262
Like, how do you
introduce this character

00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:31.720
and let the audience
know that he's

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.970
going to be OK without
telling them how?

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.870
And so that was--

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:35.890
STEVE ROSEN: And that
they're the same person

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.190
at the same time, too.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.490
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah, that
they're the same person.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.740
And so we had gone through
a bunch of versions.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.940
And that was, for some
reason, this is weird,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.420
obscure Billy Joel
song spoke to us.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.580
And so that was really where
that bass line came from.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.630
Don't tell Billy.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.130
MARK DOUGLAS: You
know, I actually--

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.080
I felt like I heard a little
bit-- there's one song,

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.690
I can't remember which one now,
that almost has "it's my life"

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.740
little doo dee, doo dee.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.900
DAVID ROSSMER: That's right,
the beginning of "Neil Life."

00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.680
It is my life.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.180
MARK DOUGLAS: See, the other
thing about thinking it

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.097
was a true story, I'm
like, what if they found

00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:06.220
a Hootie and the Blowfish CD?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.250
Would all the songs have to--

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.220
(SINGING) real life.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.392
So did you have to
audition as Neil Young?

00:37:14.392 --> 00:37:15.100
Did you have to--

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.220
I mean, Neil Young.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:16.900
JANE BRUCE: That's so funny.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.000
MARK DOUGLAS: That
would have been--

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.040
Neil Young.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.707
DAVID ROSSMER: We
actually made people--

00:37:18.707 --> 00:37:21.010
yeah, we threw a
curveball at them.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.490
That's funny because I-- they
said bring in an instrument

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.780
if you do, and I play guitar.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.350
And I cover a Neil Young song,
so for my initial audition

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.922
where I had to play a not--

00:37:30.922 --> 00:37:32.880
they were like, now sing
something of your own.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.776
I was like, I'll
do the other Neil.

00:37:35.776 --> 00:37:36.760
But yes, I did.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.310
I watched some videos and
I had some hip thrusts.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.610
I think one of our producers
said, you did your research.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.595
Because I had it
in my hips already.

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.720
MARK DOUGLAS: I feel like
it might be difficult to,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.470
like-- you want to
take care of your voice

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.030
while trying to do a
Neil Diamond voice.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.602
It's a lot of (VOCAL FRY).

00:37:53.602 --> 00:37:54.310
JANE BRUCE: Yeah.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.935
MARK DOUGLAS: You
know, I feel like you

00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:58.240
could get a little graveled
out and maybe blow it out.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.000
Does that ever happen?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.310
Does anybody ever hurt
themselves doing it?

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.852
JANE BRUCE: Well, I'm only two
and a half weeks in to my run,

00:38:02.852 --> 00:38:05.980
but yeah, it's something that
I'm still definitely figuring

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.172
out.

00:38:07.172 --> 00:38:08.630
DAVID ROSSMER: How
does Neil do it?

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.370
That's my question.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.150
JANE BRUCE: I know, yeah.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.440
DAVID ROSSMER: And Tom Waits.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.967
MARK DOUGLAS: I don't know.

00:38:12.967 --> 00:38:15.300
Yeah, and I'm thinking, what
if he found a Tom Waits CD?

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.250
Would everything have
to-- (VOCAL FRY).

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.750
Let's see.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.317
What else?

00:38:22.317 --> 00:38:23.650
Any questions from the audience?

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.150
Oh, yes.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.850
We have one.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.220
AUDIENCE: Hello,
thank you for coming.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.890
So I bought my
tickets for the show.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.770
It's in a few weeks.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.990
And it was because
specifically I

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:35.260
think one of the reviews
compared it to Seinfeld meets

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.580
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.080
But obviously,
that's a reviewer.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.430
I was wondering if
you had any actual

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.790
either comedic or
musical influences

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.730
that sort of drove you
to where you are today,

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.590
or if anyone in
the cast recognizes

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.740
any comedic or
musical influences.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.245
Thank you.

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.870
DAVID ROSSMER: That's
a great question.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.412
STEVE ROSEN: That's
a great question.

00:38:54.412 --> 00:38:55.540
Yeah, we have a lot of--

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.930
David and I have a lot
of comedic influences.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.930
Since we've known each
other since we were kids,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.730
we make each other laugh a lot.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.310
And we watch a lot
of the same stuff.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.780
We love some of the same
old crazy movies like--

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.190
there's that Neil Simon
movie "Murder By Death"

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:14.180
which makes us laugh a
lot, a lot of Seinfeld,

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.120
that type of humor.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.260
I think also just culturally,
growing up in a Jewish family--

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.290
we both grew up in a similarly
styled Jewish family,

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.150
so our senses of
humor were shaped

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.740
by a lot of the same stuff.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.810
DAVID ROSSMER: And there's
a lot of pop culture

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.990
references in the show of things
we love and were influenced by.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.807
There's a ton of Willy Wonka
references, which is probably

00:39:32.807 --> 00:39:34.640
fun for anyone who knows
it and other people

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.145
are like, what are
they talking about?

00:39:36.145 --> 00:39:36.420
MARK DOUGLAS: No,
those were great.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.750
DAVID ROSSMER: Because we
literally do scenes from--

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.220
the show sort of
morphs into scenes

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.668
from Willy Wonka, Star Wars,
what are some of the others?

00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:45.710
STEVE ROSEN: Yeah, we have
Neil Diamond in there,

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.160
we have that song,
(SINGING) nobody

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.868
going to break up my style.

00:39:49.868 --> 00:39:50.660
DAVID ROSSMER: Yes.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.010
STEVE ROSEN: Yeah,
there are a lot

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.635
of references in "The
Other Josh Cohen"

00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:55.400
that come up in
our everyday life.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.043
But yeah, we love popular
culture like anyone else

00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:01.460
and so it feels-- the show
feels very current because it's

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.870
based on the stuff that we see
and love and watch every day.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:04.490
DAVID ROSSMER: And
because of that,

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.290
it's kind of a
musical for people

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.780
who love musicals, but also
for people who don't normally.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.940
Like, I love when people are
like, oh, I don't want to come.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.630
I hate musicals.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.640
I was like, have we
got a show for you.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.320
Because star-- Darth Vader
comes out of a refrigerator.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.530
That doesn't happen in--

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.755
MARK DOUGLAS: Come on.

00:40:18.755 --> 00:40:18.830
Yeah.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.120
DAVID ROSSMER:
--"Phantom of the Opera."

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.880
I mean, it should.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.340
STEVE ROSEN: Yet.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.810
MARK DOUGLAS: Unless you're
on hallucinogenics, no.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.500
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.027
I saw the show, loved it.

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:30.860
And it's one of my
favorites I've ever seen.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.260
And I've seen a lot of shows.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:31.820
DAVID ROSSMER: Thank you.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.210
STEVE ROSEN: Thank you.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.180
DAVID ROSSMER: Thank you.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.280
AUDIENCE: So I'm in
big theater nerd,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.290
so I have a little bit more
of a specific question.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.123
I've listened to the
album a bunch of times.

00:40:38.123 --> 00:40:40.040
How did you get them all?

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.180
How did you get them?

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.460
MARK DOUGLAS: That was on
my list, good question.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.900
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah, so she's
referring to the CD we made.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.690
And we don't have the cast on
because we made it before we

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.310
ever even cast the show.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.758
We knew we wanted to have an
album ready to go to, you know,

00:40:52.758 --> 00:40:54.800
have for the lobby, and
for people to sort of get

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.070
a sense of the music.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.910
So Steve and I had co-created
with Dan Lipton and Sarah

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.580
Salzberg this show called
"Don't quit your night job."

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.170
and we had done
it for many years

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.450
and we had raised a ton of money
for charity called Open Doors

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.110
that Wendy Wasserstein, a
wonderful playwright, started.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.880
And it was an improv show.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.770
And we would do crazy stuff.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.200
We would do, like,
musical mad libs.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.773
We would have Sting come.

00:41:16.773 --> 00:41:18.190
And no one would
know he was there

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.780
and we'd come out and get a
mad lib, adjectives, and verbs,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.240
and nouns, and no one would know
what the song was going to be.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.740
And out would come Sting singing
"Every Breath You Take" to,

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.675
like--

00:41:26.675 --> 00:41:27.800
MARK DOUGLAS: Actual Sting?

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.330
DAVID ROSSMER: Actual--

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:28.590
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, wow.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.923
DAVID ROSSMER: The actual Sting.

00:41:29.923 --> 00:41:32.630
Huey Lewis, we had every
Broadway star, Kelli O'Hara,

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.510
and all these people would come
and do these ridiculous skits.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.750
It was like Saturday Night
Live for theater, in a way.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.820
And we had made a lot
of friends that way.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.660
And so we have everyone on
this album from Kelli O'Hara,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.680
to Chita Rivera, to Sutton
Foster, to Brian D'Arcy James,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.440
to James Roday, to Hank Azaria.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.940
Thank you.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.975
Jimmy Simpson, James Monroe
Iglehart, Lindsay Mendez,

00:41:53.975 --> 00:41:55.100
all of these insane people.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.680
Because the theater community,
like working on this show,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.250
there is a strong sense
of community and support.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.553
And so all these people had
seen the show over the years

00:42:03.553 --> 00:42:04.970
or had heard about
it, and when we

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.637
said we have a chance to
participate in this, and Chita

00:42:07.637 --> 00:42:09.470
Rivera's like, well, I
don't play the drums,

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.780
but maybe I can
sing on the album.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.613
And so we got a chance
to use them that way.

00:42:13.613 --> 00:42:15.988
MARK DOUGLAS: Didn't you say
Brian D'Arcy James nailed it

00:42:15.988 --> 00:42:16.615
in one take?

00:42:16.615 --> 00:42:18.740
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah, One
Take James, we called him.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.490
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:20.750
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.750
MARK DOUGLAS: Anyway,
you've won a lot of awards,

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.670
but I think the most prestigious
honor is that you guys made it

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:33.140
to page 6 because of a
bundt, a stolen bundt cake.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.850
I mean, talk about Seinfeld.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.970
That is like-- somebody
stole the bundt cake.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.300
I mean, it's just--

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.790
talk to me about the bundt cake.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.895
STEVE ROSEN: Well, the show--

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:47.270
so when you come in to see
the show, if you see the show,

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.395
as you're coming into the
theater, you're coming in

00:42:49.395 --> 00:42:51.355
and the set is a fully
furnished apartment.

00:42:51.355 --> 00:42:53.480
And during the half an hour
before the show begins,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.870
you are inadvertently
watching a burglar steal

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.840
every single thing out of
the apartment so by the time

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.820
the show starts
it's totally empty.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.730
And the last thing that
he steals is a bundt cake.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.480
And our theater, like an office,
has a community refrigerator

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.220
where we kept the bundt cake.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.380
And someone in--
someone somewhere

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.380
thought that that was an open
call bundt cake for anyone

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.340
who wanted bundt cake.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.590
And so one night we had to
run out and grab more bundt

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.240
cake because there
was no bundt cake.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.590
DAVID ROSSMER: I think,
like, three times

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.420
they went for the bundt
cake, and they were like--

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.837
you would just see
someone running

00:43:24.837 --> 00:43:27.710
across the street to Little Pie
Company to get the bundt cake.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.132
MARK DOUGLAS: Serves him
right, though, the thief.

00:43:31.132 --> 00:43:32.840
Yeah, well, I knew I
was going to like it

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.820
right away because when
I came in I don't think

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.300
I saw the entirety
of the burgling.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.170
But I noticed that Kenny
Loggins was playing.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.960
"Heart to Heart," and then it
kind of went from one yacht

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.170
rock song to the next.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.620
And I was like, I--

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.730
I made this playlist.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.310
STEVE ROSEN: You
and Bart Fasbender.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.720
MARK DOUGLAS: It's
very white, but--

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.000
but was that supposed
to be Josh's music?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.708
Did I miss a part where
the burglar was like--

00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:01.500
did he put that on?

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.670
Or was that just house music?

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:03.587
STEVE ROSEN: I think--

00:44:03.587 --> 00:44:06.052
I think the idea was there
some-- a very traumatic event--

00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:07.510
our sound designer,
Bart Fasbender,

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.520
is a wonderful genius.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.400
It's such a challenge to
make the sound of a rock

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.853
band come alive in a show.

00:44:12.853 --> 00:44:14.520
But the idea that
something so traumatic

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.150
was happening to this person
that we haven't met yet

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.505
to such innocuous music like
Kenny Loggins and Chicago.

00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:23.380
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, it
was supposed to be lame.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.897
I get it.

00:44:24.897 --> 00:44:25.980
DAVID ROSSMER: No, no, no.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.430
It's good.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.630
STEVE ROSEN: And we
want it every night.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.540
Every night is different.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.520
We knew you were there.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.440
We go to everyone's
playlists and we find out

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.410
what they're listening to.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:33.560
We want to make it
your experience.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.050
MARK DOUGLAS: OK, good.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:34.550
Good.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:35.320
That's nice.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.415
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:44:36.415 --> 00:44:38.040
I was talking about
something other day

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.243
and then it got suggested
to me in an add.

00:44:40.243 --> 00:44:42.660
Somebody in this building is
responsible for it, I'm sure.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.540
They're listening.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.100
DAVID ROSSMER:
Speak into my lapel.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.560
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.190
I love the song "One CD,"
which I thought at first--

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.350
because they leave you with
only one CD, and I thought,

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.050
I wonder if there's,
like, a temptation

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.050
to update the technology
as time goes by.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:58.950
And then I thought--

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.860
then I realized as
it went through,

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.990
the more obsolete CDs get, the
sadder and funnier that gets.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.260
So it's kind of nice and it
sort of put it in a time.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.390
Was it supposed
to be, like, '90s,

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.720
or was it just that,
no, it's like yesterday,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.037
and this guy still
has a discman.

00:45:18.037 --> 00:45:20.370
STEVE ROSEN: Well, he has to
go out and buy the discman.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:21.450
I think it takes place today.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:21.870
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, right, right.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.860
STEVE ROSEN: I think
it sort of is--

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.270
we're put in this
situation where

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.160
we live in this digital
age where all of a sudden

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.410
this guy's robbed of everything
and is sort of forced,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.767
like Job, to go back
into an analog existence.

00:45:30.767 --> 00:45:31.600
MARK DOUGLAS: Right.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.330
STEVE ROSEN: And so that's
what he has to listen to.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.413
And then when his phone
dies, he has to figure out

00:45:35.413 --> 00:45:37.050
how to use a landline phone.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.430
It's like the guy is-- he is--

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.940
MARK DOUGLAS: The greatest
landline phone ever.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.790
It's a Darth Vader head
that you speak into.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.137
DAVID ROSSMER: It actually
moves and breathes.

00:45:47.137 --> 00:45:48.720
STEVE ROSEN: It did
until we broke it.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.345
DAVID ROSSMER: Yeah,
until we broke it.

00:45:50.345 --> 00:45:53.880
But yeah, he actually-- at
one point he calls 4-1-1.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.720
There's a lot of little secret
things along the way, Easter

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.670
eggs and things like
that, because he's

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.145
the underdog in the story.

00:46:01.145 --> 00:46:02.520
What no one would
probably notice

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.340
is that everything in the
story that he has is always

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.630
the underdog product.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.900
Like, he likes Turkey
Hill ice cream,

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.677
and he's a member of HSBC Bank.

00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:14.010
MARK DOUGLAS: I did notice that.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.586
I was like, he just said he's--

00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:17.010
DAVID ROSSMER: He
likes the Mets.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.818
MARK DOUGLAS: He
finished a turkey--

00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:20.610
yeah.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.860
He finished a Turkey Hill
vanilla pint of ice cream.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.110
DAVID ROSSMER: French vanilla.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.290
MARK DOUGLAS: I was
like, wow, that's a--

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:26.640
DAVID ROSSMER: Not
your go-to, yeah.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.800
MARK DOUGLAS: Really
living it up, huh?

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.170
No chocolate in there, nothing?

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.448
Just--

00:46:31.448 --> 00:46:32.490
STEVE ROSEN: It's French.

00:46:34.822 --> 00:46:36.030
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I think--

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.297
I think we're about up.

00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:39.630
Anybody else want to ask--
anybody else have any burning

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.140
questions?

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.122
No?

00:46:42.122 --> 00:46:43.830
Well, I just want to
thank you guys again

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.130
for bringing your talents
to us on Valentine's Day.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.040
And I just love the show.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.040
You guys are incredible.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.060
Please see it.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.530
You will not regret it.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.380
And let's give another
warm, warm round of applause

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.770
for The Other Josh Cohen cast.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:57.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.220
DAVID ROSSMER: Thank you.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:58.630
STEVE ROSEN: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:59.130
DAVID ROSSMER: Thank you.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.460
This place is amazing.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.900
Thank you for having us.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.550
[APPLAUSE]
