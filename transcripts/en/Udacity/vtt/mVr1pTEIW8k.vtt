00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have to ask myself how to remove outliers.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me ask you a question.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Can we use the quartiles method? Yes or no?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I'm not asking whether there is in principle a variant of the method that can be used,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but the way you've learned the method--can we just go through both lists

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and independently in both lists remove the lower and the upper quartile?

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Yes or no?
