00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.570
The type of debt that most
of us are most familiar with

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.960
are mortgages that we might
take out on our homes.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.376
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:07.376 --> 00:00:10.240
clarify how a mortgage is
different than the type of debt

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.910
that many corporations
would take on.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.560
So if I were to take out a
million dollar mortgage, what

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.390
happens is is that the bank
figures out a fixed payment

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.130
that I could pay,
really, every month.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.320
And as I pay that
payment-- and that payment

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.840
will not change over the course
of the term of that mortgage,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.900
so maybe it's a
10-year mortgage--

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.660
the payment won't change.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.360
But as I pay that mortgage,
some part of it is interest,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.200
and some part of it is actually
paying down the mortgage.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.100
So early on in the
life of the mortgage--

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.020
maybe this is the first payment
here-- most of the payment

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.030
is going to be interest, and
a little bit of the mortgage

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.110
payment is going
to be principal.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.660
And when I say principal, that
little pink part right there,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.460
that's actually being
used to pay down

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.800
the debt on the mortgage.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200
So after this first payment, now
the debt is a little bit less.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.660
I'm going to make the same
total mortgage payment.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.682
But since the total
debt is now less,

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.140
I'm taking the same
interest rate--

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.112
I'm assuming it's a
fixed interest rate here.

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:16.570
But the amount of
interest is going

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.069
to be less, because I paid off
a little bit of the principal

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.574
already.

00:01:19.574 --> 00:01:21.490
So on the next payment,
the amount of interest

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.500
is going to be a
little bit less.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.870
And for that fixed
payment that I'm making,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.600
I'm now going to be able
to give more principal.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.030
And we keep doing that.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.980
I want do that in
the same color.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.690
So the next payment after that--
that's not the same color.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690
The next payment after
that, even though it's

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.140
the exact same
payment, it's going

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.885
to have less interest, because
I've paid down more of the debt

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:45.540
now.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.040
So it's going to
have less interest.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.873
And it normally doesn't
happen this quickly,

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:50.470
but hopefully this
gives you the idea.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.850
And it's also going to
have more principal.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.080
So that you fast
forward all the way to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160
near the end of the term, so
this is many payments later.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.950
This is the end of the 10 years.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.850
I think I said this was
a 10-year mortgage loan.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.860
On that last payment,
even though every payment

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340
was exactly the same
amount-- the mortgage payment

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.770
was the same dollar
amount every month--

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.560
that last payment is going to be
very little interest and mostly

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.680
principal.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.000
And then after
that last payment,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.530
you would-- or if I'm that
person taking out the mortgage

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.340
loan, I would have
paid off the loan.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.160
So loan paid off.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.800
And I own the house outright
in a traditional fixed rate

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.070
mortgage.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.390
With corporate debt it's
not always like that.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.380
In fact, it's not
usually like that.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.750
Corporate debt is usually
interest only debt.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.379
And there usually might be some
things where the corporation

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.920
has to pay off certain amounts
of the loans at certain times,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.310
but it isn't the model where
you have a fixed payment

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.960
and you pay off the debt over
a certain amount of time.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.790
Most corporate debt-- let's
say a corporation takes

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.690
a million dollars in
debt, and let's say

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.440
it's a 10-year loan as well.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.070
But the corporation is just
going to pay the interest only.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.550
It is going to pay the
interest only the entire time.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.710
So whatever this
amount was, roughly,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.000
is what the corporation
will pay every month.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.220
So they'll pay exactly that
much every time period,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.120
maybe every quarter, every
year, whatever it might be.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.730
And then you fast forward to
the end of the term of the loan,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.930
so they continue paying
that same amount.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.690
And at the end of
the term of the loan

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.500
they have to pay that amount,
plus all of the principal

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.045
at once.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.040
Now, most companies won't have
all of that principal sitting

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.810
around, whatever it might be.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.030
They have to pay all of
the principal at once

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.120
at the end of the
term of the loan.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.570
Well, if they have the cash,
they could pay off the loan.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.470
But if they don't have the
cash-- and most corporations

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.990
would not have the
cash in this situation.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.198
That's why they borrowed it
in the first place-- what

00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:00.996
they would do, is they
would take out a new loan.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.370
So they would take
out a new loan

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.590
for the same amount
of principal,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.590
maybe to the same bank,
maybe a different bank.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.339
But it might now have
a different interest

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.080
rate, different loan
terms, whatever.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.650
So they'll now
take out a new loan

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.680
at the end of the
term period, use

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.910
that to pay the principal
on their old loan.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.620
And then they'll
continue paying interest

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.579
for the term of this new loan.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.230
So it's a slightly
different process,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.390
and I just wanted to make
sure you understood that.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.515
And the other thing, this
isn't all corporate debt.

00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:29.070
They could be fixed interest
rate, floating interest rate.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.300
There's often things
called covenants

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.310
that the bank will
place on the corporation

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.210
to make sure that the
corporation isn't doing

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.500
dangerous things that will make
it less likely that they'll

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.010
eventually be able
to pay off the debt,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.010
or less likely they could
eventually get a loan

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.820
to pay off the current loan.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.260
So there are controls
that the bank

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.750
has to make sure
that the company is

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.524
good for this near
the end of the term.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.940
But as you can see, it's a
fundamentally different process

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.400
than most mortgage loans.
