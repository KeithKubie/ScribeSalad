00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600 position:78%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: I am thrilled by that...


00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.000 position:61%
FLORENT MASSE: I am thrilled by that...


00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000 position:78%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: I am thrilled by that...


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:70%
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: Open your mouth to
pronounce the 'A'

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500 position:78%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: I am thrilled by that...


00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.350 position:78%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: I am thrilled by that...


00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.950 position:78%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: and doubtless it will be
sweet to me, Madame.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.270
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: Yes!


00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.000 position:77%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: But it's a transport of
zeal that seizes me

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and a profound affection...


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.800 position:61%
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: A transport.


00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.670 position:83%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: A transport.
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: That's right, a transport.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.520 position:56%
TOMER YAVETZ [in French]: Transport.


00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.190 position:69%
FLORENT MASSE: We were doing a what we call,
what I call a text lab.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.310
Text lab.


00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.000 position:67%
So I worked on the pronunciation one on one
on their lines and their scenes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.500 position:75%
And this is a great way to really make sure they
improve their pronunciation with a careful

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.770 position:66%
attention to the text.
So there are different types of text labs.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.220 position:73%
Some are just on the pronunciation and
some are on the...also the meaning of the text.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.520 position:64%
Sometimes they have a hard time
understanding everything, so we make sure

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.260 position:77%
they understand this way. And
the pronunciation today was only focused on that.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.140 position:81%
CHRISTINA BOTT: French 211 was without a doubt…
it has been one of my favorite courses at Princeton.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.000 position:81%
Florent really takes the time to work with
each student individually and you really get to know

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.470 position:67%
the individual works that you are studying.


00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.010 position:81%
So, each student performs either two or three
scenes throughout the entire semester and you get to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.500 position:88%
work with different partners and also examine
not just your particular scene, but the work in general.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 position:72%
CHRISTIAN DAVID MARTIN [in French]: No! You're
not going to take a walk in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.000
your room with a night shirt and
a hat on!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.860 position:81%
CHRISTINA BOTT [in French]: Yes, okay! First would
you please explain? I'll take my hat off right away.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.250 position:89%
CHRISTINA BOTT: You learn about the intricacy of language
and just how important pronunciation is.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.330
It is a very different concept than
American theater.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.000
French theater is much more
about the text and a lot less about

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.060 position:56%
what you’re doing with your arms and
all that jazz,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.000
which took a lot for me to learn.


00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.500 position:75%
DAYNA LI: Basically, we’re covering all kinds of
French theater from classical to contemporary.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
We’re doing Feydeau which is
is something more contemporary,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.570 position:69%
but there is also Racine which is classical.


00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.000 position:66%
OLIVIA NICE: Berenice, Andromaque…
a lot of really really great French plays.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000 position:81%
DAYNA LI: I think it’s really cool how we have these
private rehearsals because he is an amazing teacher

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.320 position:77%
and he really is putting a lot of effort into our
diction, which is especially important.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.570 position:72%
It’s kind of underestimated because it is
acting that we put as our number one priority,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.000
but then obviously if you can’t
understand what we’re saying,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.270 position:63%
that is a disadvantage. So, he is really
really helpful in diction.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.500 position:66%
DAYNA LI [in French]: What is that to you?


00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.230 position:59%
OLIVIA NICE [in French]: It annoys me,
I still want to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.670
deceive him, but the idea that


00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.000
he would deceive me, that
is going too far!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000 position:63%
DAYNA LI [in French]: You have exquisite
morality.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.560 position:80%
OLIVIA NICE [in French]: What, you think I'm wrong?


00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.020 position:69%
DAYNA LI [in French]: Yes, yes, yes. Only...
all that you are

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.000
bringing to light doesn't
prove anything.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.020
OLIVIA NICE [in French]: Really,
I'm not proving anything?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.270 position:88%
OLIVIA NICE: Something that I really loved
about this class is that I do a lot of theater on campus

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.240 position:64%
and I also study French in the classroom.
And this class really gave me an

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.750 position:56%
opportunity to combine both of them.
And something that was really

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.000
really special about this class is
that our professor, Florent Masse,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.690
he brought in a professional actor…
one of his friends from France…

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.520 position:59%
to come meet with us for a week.
We got to rehearse with him and he got

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.730
to talk with us about his projects
that he is doing in France.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.160 position:81%
CHRISTINA BOTT: It’s a great study of the history of
French theater and I loved every second of it.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.240 position:61%
I took it in my freshman Fall
and it was an amazing course and it was

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.820 position:63%
one of the best ways for me to start off
at Princeton.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
And now I am a French major!


00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.210
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: A!…U!…
STUDENTS [in French]: A!…U!…

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:44.000 position:78%
FLORENT MASSE [in French]: Five times...A!…U!…
STUDENTS [in French]: A!…U!… (repeated five times)

00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:03.000
