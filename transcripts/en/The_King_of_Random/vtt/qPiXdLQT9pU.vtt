00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey guys, I brought you out to the mountains today. To show you a cool little camping hack

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
You can do with only three to four tent pegs. So if you're hiking backpacking or camping and forgot your stove

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.939
Here's a simple little hack that just might save the day now the idea here is really simple

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.610
We're just gonna push three to four tent pegs down into the ground

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.660
You can really go as deep as you want. You can see already a couple inches in it's really firm

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
Ihnihnihhjnbjo job u B bunih hnWe just need enough of a gap that we can build a small fire

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Or put some hot coals in there to cook our meal

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.519
And I like the tent pegs facing inward here now the key really is to getting them all about the same height so in this

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.229
Case you can see it almost makes like a triangle shape and that's going to be just enough of a platform to put some kind

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.489
Of a cooking container on there, you could cook a can of beans, or you know a small meal

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.069
Just by building a small fire under here which we're gonna do right now

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.149
A lot of wrappers these days are made of aluminum foil

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.718
And you can use these to make a makeshift bowl for cooking in the wilderness as well

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.159
Here's how you do it start by laying out your aluminum. Foil the more layers you can get out of this the better

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.099
It's going to work, but essentially we want to just make some squares

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.050
And I'm going to use three layers of foil by folding it in on itself to make a nice aluminum

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.438
Square like this now if we flip it over with this side facing [down]

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.319
We can push our hand in and just very gently move the sides up around it to form a bowl shape

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.150
It's very important not to puncture the bottom while we're doing this but just like that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.400
We end up with a pretty cool-looking little aluminum

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.860
Bowl

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.129
Now if you want you can use something like a tuna can or a cup as a mold to form your bowl a little bit

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.390
Better and when you pull that out, you've got a nice little cooking base. It should fit perfectly right on top

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.849
So just like that you got yourself a little Makeshift Bowl

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.189
And you can put soup water stew anything you want in there and light a fire and because it's made of aluminum

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.249
And it's three layers thick it should not burn through it shouldn't poke any holes

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.860
So let's put that to the test and see if you can boil an egg

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.019
So you can see we got our fire built in going the tent tapes are still in there?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.220
But I'm letting them sit there for now because we've got a lot of heat those are going to burn down to coals and then

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.559
We just stoke the fire from underneath in the meantime

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.570
Let's fill up our little aluminum container with water and try using some of these farm-fresh eggs

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.110
And see if we can get them boiling these eggs are straight from my wife's chicken

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.610
And they're called easter layers because they lay a different color eggs, so it's kind of like an easter egg hunt every day

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340
Just enough to cover the eggs is fine

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.270
Hopefully, we don't have any leaks in there, and we're going to find out here in just a second

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.449
So I just got the eggs off of the fire let them cool down a little bit

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.399
I got some river water here that I'm just going to drip over them to cool them down and a really cool thing about this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.670
Guy is we boiled our water for probably a good [ten] to [fifteen] minutes

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.709
I'm really confident that we've got nice boiled eggs

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.378
And I don't expect you to have eggs with you when you're hiking or backpacking

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.420
But this is just to demonstrate that yes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.759
It will boil water not a problem and look the water still holding up in there very well very cool hack guys

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Let's crack these eggs open and see how they turned out

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.349
Beautiful. That looks amazing

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.640
Mmm. That's good. That's really good.  Now another cool trick

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.479
I learned is [that] if you don't have a spoon you can hack one like this. I have a 2-liter bottle

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.079
I'll show you how to make this in another video

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.889
So the really cool thing about having a little tent peg fire stove

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.549
Is that you can actually build the fire around it and it can be permanently set in place

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.889
And this way you can use things like cans of beans

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.459
Tuna cans you can boil water you can cook your food cook your stew

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.299
You can even use tinfoil if you have it to make a makeshift bowl and boil eggs

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.139
We've showed you how to do that, and it works really really well so all in all this is really cool

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.769
Hack to know if you're out hiking

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.939
Backpacking or camping and you don't have a stove and you need to boil water

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.109
We were able to boil our water long enough to boil my wife's eggs, and so now we're going to go enjoy

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.819
So there you have a guy it's a simple little stove that you can hack out of tent pegs in tinfoil

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.289
Thanks so much for joining me for this project video, and I'll be looking for you in the next video document
