00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.120
When people think of abuse, they often equate it to physical violence

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.840
but that isn't where abuse starts or ends.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.880
Abuse can be physical, mental, or emotional

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.000
and everything in between.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.540
It is important to understand what constitutes as abuse

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.880
and what you can do about it if you come to the realization that you are being abused.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560
What follows is a list of ten red flags

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.680
you might run into if you are in an abusive relationship.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.320
This list is not meant to be the only red flags of abuse

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.800
and if you feel that you are being abused, please seek out help.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.400
There will be a short list of resources in the description for this video.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.960
Number One: Controlling Behavior

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.420
In many abusive relationships, the abuser will want to control every aspect of their victim's life.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.640
They might want to know who their victim is talking to, who they are planning to meet up with,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.780
or where they are going.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.980
This can even flow into them controlling what their victim wears,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.740
how their makeup looks, or how they carry themselves.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.100
Number Two: Humiliates You

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.520
This behavior is often done in front of other people,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.780
perhaps his or her friends, and is used as a way to keep their victim down.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.420
The abuser's goal is to make them feel weak and small

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.620
so that the victim doesn't stand up for themselves.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.360
Number Three: Guilt Trips

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.220
This is a method employed by abusers when they want to get their way.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.320
They might say something like "If you loved me you would or wouldn't do this"

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.860
or "I thought this meant something to you, but apparently I was wrong"

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.540
The hope is that the victim will feel bad for letting their abuser down

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.960
and just give in to whatever it is they want.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.580
Number Four: Forces You to Take Responsibility for Their Feelings

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.100
The abuser will use this tactic as a form of manipulation.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.600
They may say "You make me angry" or "You've done this. You've done that"

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.080
as a way to make their victim feel responsible for anything bad.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.440
This is meant to push that victim to work on making the abuser happy at all times.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.260
The abuser wants to keep their victim in line

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.720
and making them feel like it's all their fault, helps the abuser control their victim's actions.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.900
Number Five: Ultimatums

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.400
With ultimatums, the abuser is trying to get what they want by force

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.320
without laying hands on their victim.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.140
With an ultimatum, the abuser might hold something over their victim's head,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.280
perhaps a child, or even their home,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.560
in an attempt to gain absolute control over the situation.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.320
The abuser might say something like "If you go out with your friends, I'll take away your credit cards"

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.300
or "If you leave me, I'll kill myself"

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.060
Number Six: Physical Violence

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.060
If the abuser can't get their way with words, they can and will resort to violence.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.380
This can start off as small things, like holding their victim's arms during an argument,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.980
and lead up to completely beating their victim

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.120
or even killing them.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300
Hitting, choking, tripping,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.100
pushing, or throwing things

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.220
are all forms of physical violence in a relationship.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460
Number Seven: A Bad Temper

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.400
The abuser might have a short fuse or just blow up over something that doesn't look like a big deal

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.440
to anyone else.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.360
This isn't just a symptom of having anger issues.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.980
It is also yet another form of manipulation.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.200
The goal of this is to scare the victim into being subservient and obedient

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.780
by doing anything they can to stop their abuser from getting angry.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.060
Number Eight: Forces You To Do Things You Don't Want To Do

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.060
This can mean anything, from making you go to the movies when you'd rather stay home

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.380
to making you do something physically that you don't want to do.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.120
It is another way for the abuser to gain control over their victim.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.980
Some might even find pleasure in watching their victim feel uncomfortable.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.420
Number Nine: Constantly Checks Up On You

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.020
An abuser might employ this as a way of keeping their victim in line.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.860
They may demand that their victim text them at certain intervals while they are out

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.700
and can even request that the victim send specific pictures

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.020
like them holding up a peace sign or a selfie with the friend they said they were with.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.540
Number Ten: Picking A Fight

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.100
An abuser might do this to test your limits.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.600
They will want to know how far they can take a fight

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.400
and see what all you might be willing to apologize for.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.680
They won't take responsibility for anything and will instead make you feel as if it was all your fault.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.560
Once the fight is over, they may forgive you right away

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.360
or they may keep up a cold vesaude

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.080
to see what you might do to win back their favor.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.280
If you feel like you might be in an abusive relationship,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.000
please seek help.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.960
If you are actively being abused, call 911 as soon as you can

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.080
and report it.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.960
There are also many options based on where you live as well.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.900

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240
