00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.520
Alright.
Welcome back to computer vision.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.070
Today we're going to continue.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.870
Well actually we just
introduced tracking and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.510
now we're actually going to do some.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.960
So, remember last time

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.680
we talked about the difference
between detecting and tracking.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.230
Detecting, we have some operator and
we just find or

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.430
whatever our target is in every frame.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.040
In tracking, we're going to predict
a new location of an object.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.560
Or the, the expected distribution
location of an object using estimated

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.890
dynamics, so somehow we're estimating
the velocity, accelerations, whatever.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.070
And then we're going to update based
upon the measurements that we take.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.500
So that's sort of the shall we say
the intuitive way of describing it.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.760
What we're going to do this lesson,
the next lesson, the lesson after that,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.510
the le, I don't know.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.970
Probably for the next eight or
seven, 12 years or so.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.000
What we're going to do is, we're
going to make this, much more formal.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.800
And basically,
tracking as a form of inference.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.020
And what we mean by that is, we're
going to have some state of the objects.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.210
Some state we're trying to estimate.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.320
We're going to call that x.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.780
That's the parameters we care about.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.550
But we don't actually know that.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.540
So we refer to that as being hidden.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.030
And we have a sensor.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.680
Typically, it's going to be a camera for
the stuff we're talking about.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.140
And what it's doing,
it's taking some measurements.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.990
It's, it's measuring, like, our raw
detections that we're doing before.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.230
And we're going to refer to
those as noisy observations

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.140
of whatever the underlying
state actually was.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.500
The system that we're assuming is
that every time step t, the state,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
the underlying state changes
from x of t minus 1 to x of t.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.210
So here we have x of
t minus 1 to x of t.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.230
And then at time t,
we get a new observation.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.420
We get a new measurement.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.260
And our goal, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.680
is to recover the most likely state,
time t.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.650
Now I was thinking about that,
its actually, that's not quite right.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.250
What you want to do is you really want
to estimate not the most likely state.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.270
I'm going to cross that out and
say the distribution or density.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.870
So, if I have the density, that is I, I
have some belief about where x might be,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.280
I can tell you the most likely place
that would be the highest probability.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.000
I can tell you the average guess.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.950
That would be the expected value but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.390
the idea is that we're
going to have a density.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.580
And, so your goal is to recover or

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.360
estimate this distribution given first
of all everything you've seen so far.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.910
Right?
So you've been taking measurements all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.230
along since last Tuesday.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.960
Where is this thing now?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.690
And the other thing that was given
to you was some knowledge or

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.200
some model of the state dynamics,
that is how this thing moves.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.930
Then you may have to estimate some of
the parameters but you may know that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.610
you know, I'm, I'm going to assume that
this thing has a particular velocity and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.500
the acceleration is just some noise.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.335
That would be a, a model that
you're going to assume is known.
