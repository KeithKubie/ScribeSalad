BRADY ENSTAD: Hi,
everybody, we're Team Paul.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.389
I'm Brady Enstad,
and I've primarily

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:41.930
been the interviewer
for the project.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.110
LEXI DIEN: I'm Lexi Dien, and
I've primarily the videographer

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.875
and video editor.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.000
YI ZHONG: And I'm Yi Zhong.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.061
I've been the lead
scribe for this project.

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:55.561
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.170
So the first thing
we started with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.755
is contextual inquiry using
the HAAT model so just

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:05.900
a quick review of what
the HAAT model is.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.480
We are looking at the
human activity assistive

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.360
technology and then the
context, and then trying

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.090
to get all the
aspect of the problem

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.897
that we're trying to solve.

00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:16.730
So the first thing we're
going to talk about

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.930
is Paul, our client.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.410
He has been an amputee
for the past 30 years.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.230
He worked in IT before, but
for the past two or three years

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.660
he had a really
severe hip problem.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.420
He couldn't really get around,
and he had to stay home a lot.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.940
And he had a surgery
in June, so he's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.274
able to walk again but
with reduced arm strength.

00:01:35.274 --> 00:01:37.690
So that means he wouldn't be
able to walk a long distance.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.370
He wouldn't be able to
carry really heavy things.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.420
And this is the AT he uses.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.500
It's custom-made
forearm crutches.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.160
It's really expensive, and
it's customized to Paul.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.370
And so some of the
activities that he

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.060
wanted us to do a project on
are self-standing crutches,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.230
a mechanism to pull
a suitcase, something

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.280
to carry a slice
of pizza, something

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.380
to carry a cup of coffee,
a self-standing umbrella,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.490
so he doesn't get
wet in the rain.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.360
So all of these activities
just kind of show

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.897
that Paul really just wants
to do things that people do

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.480
and that he really wants to get
out there again after this hip

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.410
problem isn't bothering him.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.090
And we narrowed it
down to this problem;

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.860
this is a quote by
Paul, "it would be nice

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.330
if I can bring my way
of a cup of coffee.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.360
Wouldn't that be nice?"

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.235
And we think, yeah, so
this is the problem we

00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:27.570
that ended up pursuing.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.792
And then we dove into the
context of this problem more.

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:33.500
So looking at it from
a few perspectives,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.570
so culturally he doesn't
want to use a wheelchair.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.278
Like I said, he had
a hip problem before,

00:02:37.278 --> 00:02:39.220
so he had to be on
an electric scooter,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.030
and he actually
didn't like that all.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.675
He wants to use crutches.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:42.930
He wants to be able to stand.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.590
But because of the
nature of his injury,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.480
he couldn't use prosthetics,
so he had to use crutches.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.761
And socially his wife helps
him with many activities,

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:52.010
including bringing him coffee.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610
But his wife does have
work, so he needs to do this

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.580
by himself when he's at home.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.210
And physically he just wants
to do this in his apartment.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.085
When he brews a cup of
coffee in the morning.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:03.780
He wants to be able to
carry it to the living room,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.113
something like simple like that.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.340
And looking at it one
statement, so this

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.190
is our problem
statement-- a design,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.770
a mechanism, that help him carry
a cup of coffee around his home

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.690
without spilling,
and such that he

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.130
doesn't have to grab onto it.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.100
And this is the way he
carries it right now.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.032
It's kind of a grip
and then while trying

00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:29.240
to use crutches at the same
time, so you can imagine,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.530
it's really tough.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.870
And we kind of break it down
to two main problems, which

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.562
is how do we do it hands-free,
so he doesn't have to hold it,

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:37.770
and how do we do no-spill,
so he doesn't spill coffee

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.320
on his hands.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.380
And I'll let Lexi talk
about the success metrics.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.620
LEXI DIEN: So right
now, basically, Paul

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.430
can carry a cup of coffee
around with that claw grip,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.080
and he can only fill
it about a third

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.450
full if he doesn't want to
spill it all over his hands

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.260
or on the floor.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.210
We'd like to make that a
larger amount of coffee,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.600
and we'd like to make sure
that it isn't spilled.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.896
So for a livable goal we
decided that maybe the coffee

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:13.940
would be 2/3 full and
he could not spill it.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.610
And then as an
ambitious goal, we

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.930
would say 3/4 full
and also no spill.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.779
Some other additional
things we talked about

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.550
were making it easy to
remove from his crutch

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.795
or from whatever it is;
the technology is just

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:32.500
easy to use and take away.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.190
And so we said 20 seconds for
a livable and then 10 seconds

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.820
preferably.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.360
We want it to be
as quick possible.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.080
We also decided that
we wanted to take

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.180
Paul's perspective into this.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.060
I think that's very important.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.860
We wanted, especially,
him to rate

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.420
it, and we're hoping ambitiously
to get an 8 out of 10.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.260
More livably, we
think a 6 out of 10

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.240
will be something
that we'd accept,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.360
but we really want to get as
high as possible on his rating.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.060
And the last thing we
wanted to make sure

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.400
is that we actually are
able to use it with a mug.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.060
He uses his own mugs, and wants
to be able to use his own mugs.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.710
So we want to make sure that
it works for at least that mug,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.870
and preferably it works
for a lot of his mugs

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.190
or all of his mugs.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.600
So we're going to show you
the video that we put together

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.271
that gives you a little bit
more background into Paul.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:40.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.109
-You know, it would be
just nice if I could

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.173
bring my wife cup of coffee.

00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:45.423
I mean, wouldn't that be nice?

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.020
My name's Paul [? Nershimski. ?]
I'm 62 years old.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.180
I've been disabled
since I was 24.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.520
-Paul uses forearm crutches
because his imputation

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.000
doesn't allow for a prosthetic.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.180
Despite the fact that his
forearm crutches don't really

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.540
let him carry things while
he's walking, for Paul,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.240
the most important
thing is to be

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.975
able to move around
and go places.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:19.720
-And one the big
dreams of my life

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.936
has been to be able to
carry around a coffee

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:25.335
cup around the house
like a normal human

00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:28.430
being with burning my
fingers and ruining the rug.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.900
-What really drew me to Paul
was just the very simple nature

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.910
of what he wanted, something
that you and I take

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.070
for granted, just the ability
to transport food and even just

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.735
a cup of coffee from his
crutches to his living room

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:46.150
without spilling it
all over his floor.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.446
-Cup full of water,
not far from the brim,

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:52.220
I would have to carry it like
that, with my hand wrapped

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.400
around the crutch handle.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.240
And maybe you can realized
that would be a horror show.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.140
-He wants to carry
a cup of coffee

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.380
around without burning himself,
and that's very, very different

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.167
from other people, other
clients, had in mind.

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:07.625
But this project's
very mechanical.

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:10.476
It' very simple, yet a
really challenging problem.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.690
-That may seem like not
much to most people,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.620
but it's huge to me.

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.010
-There are many, many
ideas floating around,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.150
but one of them is a
gyroscope, something

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.780
that would with the
gyroscopic motion

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.234
that can keep the coffee level
while he's with his crutches.

00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:32.010
And this is one of
the designs that we

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.460
saw online that kind of
resembles what we want to have.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.174
It's basically a cup
holder that allows

00:07:40.174 --> 00:07:42.590
motion, that allows it to stay
level when there is motion.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.345
-There's a kind of silicon cover
that goes over the coffee mug,

00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:55.305
and if it gets a good seal, then
it works really, really well.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:03.060
-Silicone cover does
wonders-- nothing.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.469
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:05.635
-So you have water in there?

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:09.030
-Yeah, it's pretty full.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.485
-Wow, that's great.

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.455
-That really works.

00:08:11.455 --> 00:08:13.360
I mean, that's full.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.465
I try no to over think things,
get like a real simple thing

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:18.910
that I couldn't do.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.160
And you're making it so I'm
going to be able to do it.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:29.220
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.960
LEXI DIEN: So, as
you saw in the video,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.165
we've been trying out a
lot of different prototypes

00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:38.390
with Paul, mainly things
that we found online,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.630
some things like this on-stage
cup holder, which is basically

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.850
a cup holder that can
statically be just clicked

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:53.770
on to his crutch, and it
doesn't help tipping at all,

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.890
so if it was an open cup,
it would just pour out.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.690
But it's something that
helps the hands-free aspect.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.020
And something like the
water bottle holder

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.740
would also do this maybe,
except for it might not

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.800
fit a mug very well.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.700
So right now we're looking
into some snap-on clamps,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.250
like this one.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.330
It would just be easy to
snap on and off of his crutch

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:29.040
so that he could take
it off and on the crutch

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.160
very easily and very quickly.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.535
So I'm going to
pass these around

00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.910
for people to look at it.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.830
Some ideas for the
no-spill solution-- as you

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.370
saw, we were thinking
gyroscope maybe.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.950
It turns out that that's a
little bit more complicated

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.300
than we thought it would be.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.200
It's a little touchy.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.250
So we're trying to look a
little bit in a different way.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.860
The second thing we
did was the CoverFlex,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.209
which we showed in the video.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:59.500
It takes a little bit of time
to put on and off though,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.370
so we were looking into some
other ways, which one of them

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.730
is this suction cover.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.950
So this is a mug, very easy.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.843
I'm going to pour
some water into it

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:20.340
and then put one of these
section covers on top of it,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.200
and no water will spill out.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.060
So we're hoping that this will
be able to work for his mugs

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.180
as well, and work on
that a little bit.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.100
Another thing that we're looking
into, which is coming in today,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.190
is this Spill-Not, which is
a device that's specifically

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.290
made to counteract movement.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.370
When you place a mug
on it, basically, that

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.070
would make it so that it
wouldn't spill hopefully.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.000
So we're looking into
that a little bit more.

00:10:56.817 --> 00:10:58.400
BRADY ENSTAD: So at
our client meaning

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.941
for the first
prototype, like I said,

00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:04.320
we showed Paul the
on-stage microphone clip,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.500
and we showed him the
CoverFlex silicon cover,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.450
and we left those with
him this past week,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.600
and we're going to go back
on Wednesday after class

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.970
and get is feedback on those.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.210
He was actually more
excited because we told him

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.770
that the Spill-Not was coming.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.649
He was more excited about
that than anything else.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.440
But the CoverFlex, as
you saw in the video,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.300
actually worked
really, really well.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.190
The only difficulty with
it is that once you have it

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.209
on and take it off,
like if there's

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:36.250
been any spillage at all,
it's a little difficult

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.930
to get it back on again,
which is why we decided to go

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.240
with these suction covers.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.932
The only problem with those is
they might not fit his mugs.

00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:45.390
So there's a
possibility that we'll

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.120
have to do a little bit
more shopping around

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.880
to find larger covers that
will probably fit his mugs.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.920
That's honestly the biggest
problem is his mugs are huge.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.880
So coffee addict, or
something, but yeah,

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.390
like I said he's super, duper
excited about the Spill-Not.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.540
And honestly one of
our biggest visions

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.942
for what will end
up happening is

00:12:10.942 --> 00:12:12.900
that we'll be able to
incorporate the Spill-Not

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.220
with a quick on-and-off
clamp, like the one that's

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.970
going around.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.535
Like I said, the clamp, it
works really well on-stage,

00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:24.160
but it doesn't really
prevent spilling,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.780
and it's pretty slow because
it's a screw-on/screw-off type

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.750
mechanism, as opposed
to just a quick clamp.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.770
He liked the CoverFlex,
but if there's

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.480
something that's easier,
like those suction covers,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.140
then he would prefer that.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.570
So for future work,
as I said, we're

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.440
going to be testing more
off-the-shell prototypes,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.010
different suction
mug covers maybe.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.160
The bike cup holder,
we haven't entirely

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.326
abandoned that idea yet either.

00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:53.700
And then obviously,
the Spill-Not

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.075
is what we're most
excited about.

00:12:56.752 --> 00:12:58.460
We're going to go get
feedback from Paul.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.602
And if he has some
feedback for us

00:13:01.602 --> 00:13:03.810
that we can't meet with any
off-the-shelf prototypes,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.920
then we're just going
to do some customization

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.350
for his final prototype.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.850
PROFESSOR: So first
of all, you guys

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.440
have scoped this really well, in
the sense that this is a really

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.410
well-defined problem that
you've worked out with Paul.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.960
And it seems like you're
finding a lot of pieces

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.940
to the solution that are already
out there, that maybe you

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.080
can combine to make something
that's really good for him.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.555
So I would encourage you, or
have you thought about-- let

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:35.610
me phrase this as a question.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.170
Have you thought about
the sustainability

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.180
of your solution?

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.170
So these cover flex things,
for example, how do they fail?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.210
And how will things break?

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.450
And what is going
to have to replace?

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.360
And sort of what is
the lifetime of what

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.984
you're building for him?

00:13:52.984 --> 00:13:55.150
BRADY ENSTAD: So the great
thing about the CoverFlex

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.730
is that it's actually
oven and dishwasher safe.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:03.100
So presumably, it's got a
relatively long life cycle,

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.250
and we're thinking, honestly,
on the order of, hopefully,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.400
years because it is oven
and dishwasher safe,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.030
unless he somehow super-duper
heats it beyond what it's rated

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.696
for, which I don't
really know how you'd

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:20.230
do that because it's oven safe.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:26.387
And as far as the clamp, the
hands-free solution goes,

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:28.095
frankly it's a purely
mechanical systems.

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:31.340
So unless he finds
some way to snap off

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.100
the clamp, which it could
happen, don't get me wrong,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.900
but the great thing about
these components that we found

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.900
is that they're actually
relatively inexpensive.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.120
And so the idea we have
is that after the class

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.880
is over we would leave him
with these part numbers.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.210
Because he has a computer
at home-- he's tech savvy.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.400
He used to work in IT-- so
if something were to break,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.990
he could just purchased
himself another one,

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.990
assuming that there's not a
great deal of customization

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.080
that goes into it.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.620
And we don't actually know the
scope of customization that's

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.622
going to have to go into it
just yet because, as I said,

00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:09.580
what we're most excited
about is the Spill-Not,

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.080
and we're not really
sure how that's

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.029
going to be incorporated
with the clamp just yet.

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.945
PROFESSOR 2: So I would
just kind of encourage

00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:19.111
as you're thinking about
the failure modes, not just

00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:20.980
the individual failure
modes, but kind

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.130
of the cross-coupled
failure modes--

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.110
as I was looking at the
seal, one of the ways

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.550
that you release the seal is
by kind of flipping that edge,

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.230
so you want to be careful
that that edge isn't actually

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.660
going to be affected by
whatever your mechanism is

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.636
for holding it.

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:37.260
So think about the
kind of the coupling

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.115
that you get between
your solutions,

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:42.780
and not just the independent
issues that you have with them.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.530
One of the questions that
I had for you was regarding

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.610
your performance metrics,
how you selected those on/off

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.280
times, and how that
related to his function

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.920
versus the mechanical
structure itself?

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.670
And kind of from looking
at some of your video,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.960
I'm wondering--
I couldn't really

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.090
tell if he had any additional
tremors or other issues

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.000
as well that might
affect his function that

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.160
might affect that timing.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.950
So if you could just talk on
that generation of timing?

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.890
BRADY ENSTAD: Yeah, sure, so
honestly, we just asked Paul.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.480
We said, Paul, how quickly do
you want this thing be put on

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.090
and be taken off?

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.720
And he said, well,
relatively quickly,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.710
and he wouldn't give
us a solid number.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.260
So we were just
like, OK, you know,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.030
20 seconds is a little long.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.470
10 seconds seems like
a reasonable time.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.770
The great thing about Paul
is the only disability

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.470
that he has is the fact
that his leg is amputated.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.980
So doesn't have any
tremors or anything

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.320
else, any other
sort of disability.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.930
So I mean, as we talked
about actually in lecture

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.890
earlier today, it's
possible as he gets older,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.672
those hands might start
shaking and that sort of thing.

00:16:52.672 --> 00:16:54.880
But that's actually why
we're excited about the clamp

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.840
is because there's less
precision involved.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.446
It's just a pretty
simple snapping motion.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.260
So as far as like
generating those numbers,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.030
it was just basically a
kind of a general feeling

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.730
we got from Paul, and
we went with, well,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.670
what do you think
about these numbers?

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.800
And the great thing
about Paul is also

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.160
one of the worst things
he's incredibly laid back,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.890
so he wasn't particularly
zealous about giving

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.170
us had numbers.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.760
So he was pretty
willing to along

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.710
with anything that we suggested.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.251
PROFESSOR 2: What are ways that
you think that you guys might

00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.730
be able to validate those
numbers a little bit more

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.480
as you keep going
and looking at some

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.340
of these different designs?

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.880
BRADY ENSTAD: Sure, so if
you take a look at the clamp,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.880
between positioning
it and snapping it,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.820
I think you're probably looking
at realistically probably

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.090
less than five seconds.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:50.570
It's not real picky about
where you put it on the crutch.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.940
So obviously, we're
just going to keep

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.450
adjusting those
numbers as what's

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.937
realistic becomes more apparent.

00:17:59.937 --> 00:18:01.770
Like I said, we don't
really know the degree

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.480
of customization we're going to
have to go to yet, especially

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.120
if we're going to
incorporate the Spill-Not.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.265
So once we get that and we do
a little bit more prototyping,

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:13.820
I'd be able to give you
more solid answer for that.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.800
But as of right now,
we don't really know.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.050
PROFESSOR 3: I am a
coffee aficionado,

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.097
and I just am OCD about
the cup that I have.

00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:27.610
I have two or three
mugs that I just love.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.090
I can press the Keurig twice,
and it fills it up just right.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.080
So I get that.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.320
But I'm wondering,
have you talked

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.830
with this gentleman about
his ability or willingness

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.240
to negotiate?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.330
To me, one of the
obvious solutions

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.060
would be to have-- because
he has good hand function,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.300
presumably-- is to
fill up a thermos mug

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.050
and have a simple clip that
you can put on his foreleg

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.320
crutches, walk to a
table, and pour the coffee

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.805
into his delightful cup.

00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:04.430
BRADY ENSTAD: So that's actually
one of the very first thoughts

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.780
that we had, and we
asked Paul about that.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.100
And his reply honestly
surprised us a little bit.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.990
He's not honestly
concerned about carrying

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.340
the cup of coffee
so much for himself,

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.830
as it is that he wants
to help his wife out.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.590
Because while he was stuck in
the wheelchair, he was really,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.500
really reliant on
her, and so he wants

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.536
to be able to carry a cup
of coffee for his wife.

00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:27.910
And his whole
thing about that is

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.840
that I want to be able
to carry it in the mug

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.320
and just give it
to her, and I don't

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.182
want have to pour it out at the
table or anything like that.

00:19:36.182 --> 00:19:38.598
PROFESSOR 4: One or two quick
questions from the audience.

00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:43.977
AUDIENCE: So his Paul willing to
have something on his crutches,

00:19:43.977 --> 00:19:48.097
or is that [INAUDIBLE],
like the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:48.097 --> 00:19:50.680
BRADY ENSTAD: So that's why we
were talking about quick on/off

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.800
times, and the answer to
that is, no, not really.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.860
He's OK with using it for
the short period of time

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.260
that it takes to transport
the cup of coffee.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.760
But once he gets
to the couch, he

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.515
wants to be able to take
it off because the way

00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:05.640
that he stores his crutches
when he's sitting down,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.270
is he puts them on the floor.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.930
And so if there's
anything attached to them

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.880
that might possibly get in
the way was his concerned.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.980
So the quicker on/off
time, the better.

00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.132
PROFESSOR 4: [INAUDIBLE]
last question,

00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:21.800
then we can have Team Margaret
also begin to set up as well.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.883
PROFESSOR 3: The other
quick thing I wanted to ask

00:20:23.883 --> 00:20:26.480
is, have you consulted
an occupational therapist

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.930
at all, someone who deals
with these kinds of approaches

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.890
on a daily basis?

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:38.220
There might be some other simple
solution that-- or maybe not so

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.280
simple solution,
but an established

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.890
solution that someone
has already dealt with.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.420
Because obviously, amputation
and this kind of injury

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.000
is fairly common and ubiquitous.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.340
BRADY ENSTAD: And the answer
to that is, no, we haven't.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.930
But that sounds like
a really great idea,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.950
so we'll look into that.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:01.372
PROFESSOR 4: Thank you.

00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:02.247
BRADY ENSTAD: Thanks.

00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:09.730
TANYA TALKAR: So, hi, everyone.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.080
We're Team Margaret.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.825
I'm Tanya.

00:21:11.825 --> 00:21:13.254
LAURA D'AQUILA: I'm Laura.

00:21:13.254 --> 00:21:14.920
TANYA TALKAR: And
Beth his third member,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.980
but she's unable to get make
it to the presentation today.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.039
So this is the team.

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:22.330
I think we might have shown
you this picture last week,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.927
but this is
Margaret, our client.

00:21:24.927 --> 00:21:26.510
Interesting story
about this picture--

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.093
she was actually the
one who suggested

00:21:28.093 --> 00:21:30.370
that we take a selfie.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.510
So she's a great person.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.562
So a little bit about
her as a person.

00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:37.020
She is an artist, so she loves
to paint, loves to make arts

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.519
and crafts.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:40.100
Her room is filled
with a bunch of crafts.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.350
She's also an advocate, so
she's on the Safety Council

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.141
for The Boston Home,
which means that she's

00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:46.450
talking a lot with residents
to make sure that they are

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.080
comfortable with their
position at The Boston Home

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.390
and everything that's going on.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.017
And Laura will talk a little
bit about The Boston Home.

00:21:54.017 --> 00:21:54.850
She's also a friend.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.060
She FaceTimes a lot on her
iPad with friends and family,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.310
And she's an immensely
helpful mentor,

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.445
not only to us, but also
all of the other residents

00:22:02.445 --> 00:22:04.800
of the Boston Home.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.740
So about her
disability-- she was

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.660
diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis,

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.590
and she decided on her own
to live at The Boston Home.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.220
So she has been
at The Boston Home

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.321
for about eight years, gotten
during admission process.

00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:19.070
She gets around on a
motorized wheelchair.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.970
All of the resonance
have wheelchairs,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.410
and she's relatively
independent.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.560
She has some fatigue in terms
of trying to sign documents,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.255
or after using her iPad for a
while, she will get fatigued,

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:31.110
and her fingers will drag.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.050
But she is still
relatively independent.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.950
And she was a social
worker before she

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.910
came to The Boston
Home, which means

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.752
that all of her thoughts and
actions are really altruistic.

00:22:40.752 --> 00:22:42.460
She's always thinking
about other people.

00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:46.550
LAURA D'AQUILA:
So this over here

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.050
is a picture of The Boston Home.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.180
It's located in
Dorchester, Massachusetts.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.300
And Beth, Tanya, and I
go visit it every Friday

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.940
to meet with Margaret,
other residents, and staff

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.460
members of the home.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.390
To tell you a little
bit more about the home,

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.570
it was founded in 1881
as a long-term care

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.330
center for adults with
multiple sclerosis

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:11.070
and other progressive
neurodegenerative diseases.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.510
The average resident in The
Boston Home is 58 years old,

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.950
and The Boston Home
places great emphasis

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.844
on independence of residents.

00:23:18.844 --> 00:23:20.260
So we'll see later
on that there's

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.650
a lot of assistive
technology that does

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.180
exist within The Boston Home.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.420
There's 96 residents in the
home and approximately 200 staff

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.260
members.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.750
And it's a really
nice place to live.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.990
They have activities,
meetings, other social events,

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.140
and it's known nationally for
providing exceptional care

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.035
to residents.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.020
And this over here is a picture
of Don, one of our panelists.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.320
He's done a lot of
great work in the home

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.040
for making sure that
residents do have access

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.780
to assistive technology.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.530
For example, he mounts iPads
on the motorized wheelchairs

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.700
of residents.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.940
He also has a 3D
printer that he's

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.690
used to design pieces
of assistive technology.

00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:10.366
TANYA TALKAR: So
specifically, the activity

00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:13.630
that we've been working
with for the past month has

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.470
been the nurse call system
or the call light system.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.890
And so what this is,
is that residents,

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.530
if they're in their room, can
press a button-- we'll show it

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.370
in a bit-- to call a
nurse and call and aide

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.120
to come and help
them in their room.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.860
So there's a wired-in
call light system.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.520
It's a button that it has
been wired to the wall,

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.290
and nurses are currently
trained to place this button

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.800
in the middle of bed.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.500
Many times though,
it's forgotten about.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.320
So it's either not placed
in the middle of the better,

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.030
or it's placed in
an unreachable spot.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.520
So Margaret sometimes
has to come up to a table

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.300
and has to either
pull on the wire

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.500
or pull on sheets to
try and get the button.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.610
And there's also just no
way of using the system

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.370
if the resident is
outside the home.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:51.870
So.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.960
For example, there was a
resident who had gone outside,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.220
got stuck in a ditch, and
his wheelchair tipped over,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.260
and he was unable to call
The Boston Home to let them

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.570
know that this has happened.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.640
So they had to have someone
who was passing by tell them

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.830
that that happened.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.640
So this is the
call light system.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.160
The button is pretty
easy to press.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.400
It's just like a simple press.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.210
But, again, it's placed in
this kind of inconvenient spot,

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:16.346
where Margaret can't reach.

00:25:16.346 --> 00:25:17.720
She doesn't have
much of a reach,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.410
so she can't reach up to
press the button if need be.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.710
And so in addition to that,
there's some other issues.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.170
Only one nurse is allowed to
answer the calls at any time.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:28.920
Her name's Angela.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.230
And so she sit at
the front desk,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.490
and this takes a
long time if there

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.060
are multiple
residents calling in

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.270
or if she has gone from
the desk and has to address

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.660
another resident's issues.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.660
So an aide also has to come in
to turn off the call system,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.750
otherwise it keeps
on beeping, and that

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.617
is quite annoying for both
the resident and the nurse.

00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:48.700
Many times, if there are
two rooms within a suite,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.950
as it is with Margaret,
so enter a door

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.520
and there are two rooms there,
sometimes the wrong room

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.390
is answered, so you'll have the
nurse call into the other room.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.850
And since this is
a speaker system,

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.600
if the resident is unable
to speak really loudly,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.640
or, in Margaret's case, she once
pulling out a chest of drawers

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.830
and it fell on her.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.620
So she was unable to both
reach the call light system.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.590
And if she had,
she wouldn't have

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.026
been able to speak loud enough
for the nurse to hear her.

00:26:17.026 --> 00:26:18.650
And actually, to add
to that, so that's

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.233
the reason why we're
planning on using

00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:21.790
an iPad for this solution.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.640
So we're planning on
creating application,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.970
because Margaret always
has her iPod with her,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.020
such that she can just
press a couple of buttons

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.895
and be able to talk with
the nurses directly.

00:26:32.012 --> 00:26:34.470
LAURA D'AQUILA: So to talk more
about assistive technology,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.810
both what Margaret
herself uses and what

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.171
other residents at
The Boston Home use,

00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:40.920
Margaret, along with
many other residents,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.860
uses a motorized
wheelchair to get around.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.610
And Margaret is very tech savvy.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.130
She owns both an
iPad and an iPhone,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:49.650
which she always has with her.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.520
And she owns a special
stylus so that she's actually

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.710
able to use her iPad and
reach all ends of the screen.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.530
And they've come in handy
in emergency situations.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.710
Tanya mentioned the time when
the drawer fell on Margaret

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.300
and she was unable to reach
the existing call light system

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:07.830
button.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.890
But fortunately, because
she had her iPhone,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.060
she was able to call
for help that way.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.040
And the Tanya had mentioned
that Margaret is an artist,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.630
and she's able to
use a mouthpiece

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.540
to hold her paintbrush,
and that's something

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.520
that Don had designed for her.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.700
And along with other
residents in the home,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.070
Margaret has the call light
system button in her bedroom

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.740
and also in the bathroom.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.020
So thanks to much of Don's work,
The Boston Home is very open

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.660
to assistive
technology, and it's

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.190
very prevalent
within the home now.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.740
For example, there exists a
cyber cafe, where resonance

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.710
are able to use computers, and
both the keyboards and mice

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.000
within the cyber cafe are
accessible to the needs

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
of the residents with
their limited arm mobility.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.150
And there are also speech
therapists and occupational

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.690
therapists on site, and these
individuals use technology,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.560
such as iPads, in
order to assess

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.510
the progress of the residents.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.597
And Don has added many
features to wheelchairs

00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:14.430
throughout his time
their too, accommodating

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.971
the different needs
of the residents.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.460
TANYA TALKAR: So to assess
how this application is going

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.086
to work for Margaret and for the
residents, because her vision

00:28:25.086 --> 00:28:26.460
is that at the
end of this, we'll

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.670
be able to have all 35
residents who are using iPads

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.390
also use the system.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.990
We have a couple
of success metrics.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.150
They're mostly qualitative.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.620
So, one, we just
want to make sure

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.703
that the correct iPad is
being called and answered

00:28:38.703 --> 00:28:41.940
and that the correct
resident is getting aid.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.490
We will also want to
time the amount of time

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.390
that it takes for a
task to be completed.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.660
So suppose Margaret
needs a refill of water,

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.030
so the nurse will come in
with the call light system,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.160
get the request, and then
go back to get the water.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.430
versus if we have this on the
iPad application, how much time

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.320
that'll take.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.370
And then just success overall--
does this application actually

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.670
integrate into the current
system with the nurses?

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.800
Will the nurses actually
end up using the system?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.310
Will the residents actually end
up using the system as well?

00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:16.950
LAURA D'AQUILA: So
a few weeks ago we

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.434
started discussing with
Margaret potential solutions

00:29:20.434 --> 00:29:21.100
to this problem.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.660
Tanya had mentioned that we're
going to be using an iPad.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.770
We work with Margaret to get
her input and her feedback

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.440
to actually develop some
early sketches of what

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.270
her end of this app looked like.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.390
And then within
the next week, we

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.320
developed this into a
low fidelity iOS app,

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.250
which I'll walk through now.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.630
So this is the home
screen of the app

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.970
that Margaret is going
to have access to.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.060
It has two large
by things that are

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.930
color-coded red and black, for
urgent and non-urgent requests.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.400
And should Margaret
press Non-Urgent Request,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.040
she's taken to the
next screen, which

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.930
has six potentially customizable
buttons for a common requests

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.760
that Margaret may
have for the nurse.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.960
For example, if she
needs a cup of water

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.330
or if she wants a nurse
to come to a room,

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.980
if she wants to be able to
video conference with a nurse,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.700
these are all buttons
that are easily

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.550
accessible for her to press.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:20.580
And similarly, if Margaret
presses the Urgent button,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.330
she's taken directly into
a video call with a nurse.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.990
And at the bottom, there is
a Cancel Call button for her

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.279
to cancel in the event
that she inadvertently

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:31.070
pressed the button.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.130
TANYA TALKAR: So
amazingly enough,

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.090
right after we transferred
this application to her iPad,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.810
she immediately
went off to go talk

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.268
to some of the other residents
about the application, which

00:30:43.268 --> 00:30:44.150
is great.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.680
And so some of the feedback
that she came up with

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.980
was that she wanted to make
sure that the buttons were

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.380
large enough, in case residents
end up having some fatigue

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.710
and their fingers start
dragging on the iPad.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.120
So she uses a stylus, but
not all of the residents do.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.770
So we just make sure that we
have larger buttons for this.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.940
She also wanted to make
sure that there was

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.660
an option to type in messages.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.940
So suppose any of the
requests that a resident

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.095
has isn't on the screen
with six buttons,

00:31:11.095 --> 00:31:13.345
that they will be able to
type in their own customized

00:31:13.345 --> 00:31:14.405
request.

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.280
She also wants to make
sure that she's always

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.870
talking with the nurse
through a video call

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.700
because sometimes her
message or what she wants

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.020
isn't conveyed through text.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.940
And something that all of the
residents said they wanted

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.400
was that the application
be voice-activated

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.180
because not all of
them are able to press

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.270
the buttons at every
time, and that they'll

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:40.380
be able to go forward
with this if they

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.980
can't speak super well either.

00:31:46.089 --> 00:31:47.880
LAURA D'AQUILA: So in
addition to Margaret,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.520
because of the nature of the
system that we're building,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.420
we actually have an
additional client,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.870
and that's the nurse on
the other end of the system

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.840
that Margaret's trying to reach.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.880
So we had mentioned all
of these nice features

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.720
that we want the app to have,
for example, video chat.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.000
And none of this stuff is
feasible with the existing

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.200
call light system that exists
already within the home.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.970
So because of that, we're
hoping to bypass the existing

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.630
system altogether and have
the nurse on the other end

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.290
have an iPad or
a computer screen

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.170
as well with an instance
of this app running

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.980
so that she can receive
the requests from Margaret

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.920
on this app.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.430
So because of this, we've
had to speak with and work

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.310
with Angela, who,
as Tanya mentioned,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.990
is the nurse on the first floor,
which is Margaret's floor, so

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.870
that we can make sure that
we can accommodate her needs.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.430
In addition to Margaret's
needs in terms of what

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.180
this application should have.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.970
And we've also worked
with Don to make sure

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.890
that this app is feasible to
be adopted within the nurse's

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.660
station.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.370
And within the next
few weeks, we're

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.390
also going to work on speaking
with other management level

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.270
people within The
Boston Home to make sure

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.080
that we're able to get
their go-to as well.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.940
And one potential thing
that we're still discussing

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:12.260
is how to acquire a potential
iPad that the nurse would

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.094
need at her station.

00:33:13.094 --> 00:33:15.510
So we're looking into whether
this is something The Boston

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.450
Home would purchase, or
whether it's something

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.840
that we may need to get
with our own team budget.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.710
So in terms of the timeline, we
spent the first month speaking

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.460
with Margaret, getting
to know her, her needs,

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.380
and what she's looking for
in a potential solution.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.225
And then in October,
we were able to assess

00:33:34.225 --> 00:33:35.980
in greater detail
the feasibility

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.270
of an iPad-based
solution on both ends.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.970
We worked with
Margaret and Angela.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.710
We developed a low fidelity
prototypes for Margaret

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.960
and tested this out
and received feedback.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.710
And then in November,
our plans include

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.590
developing a low fidelity
prototypes for Angela,

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.619
for the nurses' side of
the nurse call system.

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:57.160
We hope to receive
feedback from that

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.510
and iterate through
those prototypes as well.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.270
We also want to work on the
back end of actually sending

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:06.430
requests from Margaret's
iPad to the nurses' iPads.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.810
And we want to get video
conferencing set up

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.090
the week after that.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.205
And then finally, hopefully
by the end of November

00:34:13.205 --> 00:34:14.790
or beginning of
December, we'll have

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.310
an app that's able to
be used within the home

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.330
by not only Margaret, but
potentially other residents

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.489
in the home as well, and we can
continue to test it out and get

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.354
feedback from them.

00:34:27.855 --> 00:34:29.480
TANYA TALKAR: So a
little bit about how

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.360
the logistics for this
project go-- our meetings are

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.364
pretty conversational.

00:34:33.364 --> 00:34:35.030
They're less like an
interview, and more

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.760
just us talking with
Margaret, Angela, Don.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.699
So Laura is mostly in charge
of the videos and pictures,

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.250
and then Beth and I are the
ones who are taking notes,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.270
asking the questions.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:51.790
And we meet before the meetings
to go over speaking notes

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.810
and go over an agenda
of what exactly

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:57.130
we want to be accomplished
during the meeting.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.370
As for division of work for the
application itself, all of us

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.410
are new to iOS development.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.120
So we're learning
all of this together.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.244
We're planning on mostly
working on the application

00:35:06.244 --> 00:35:08.650
as a team, all three
of us together.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.840
And then for other things,
Beth and Laura mainly

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.069
worked on the video, and I was
mostly in charge of the report

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:16.110
and the presentation for
the mid-semester panels.

00:35:21.019 --> 00:35:22.560
LAURA D'AQUILA: So
to conclude, we're

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.287
very excited to be working
on this project with Margaret

00:35:25.287 --> 00:35:25.870
this semester.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.460
It's been a lot of fun so
far, and it's exciting to us

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.570
that this is something
that could potentially not

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.390
only benefit Margaret,
but could also

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.530
benefit many other residents
of The Boston Home,

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.640
should this be more
universally adopted.

00:35:48.386 --> 00:35:49.760
PROFESSOR 2: So
one of the things

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.400
that you guys mentioned
at the beginning,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.150
as you were talking
about the call system,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.940
was some of the regulations
that are in place at the home.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.270
Can you talk about how
your system actually

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.550
can map to some of
those regulations,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:06.110
and if they have to change in
any way to use your system?

00:36:08.294 --> 00:36:10.460
TANYA TALKAR: So that was
actually one of the things

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.043
that we are considering when we
were thinking about whether we

00:36:13.043 --> 00:36:15.830
wanted to interface with the
current call light system,

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.539
or whether we would create
this separate iPad application.

00:36:18.539 --> 00:36:20.080
And that's also one
of things we need

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.490
to talk with for administration.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:27.190
We believe that due to this
being a separate application,

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.450
we shouldn't need to
have the nurses go in

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.290
and turn off anything
on the iPad, which

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:38.140
is what they need to currently
do with the call light system.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.570
And that's something that
the company themselves

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.490
had come up with as
a regulation, that it

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.700
would have to be turned
off by a nurse aide.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.630
But for this, because it's the
resident who's in charge of it,

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.810
and they'll be video
calling with the nurse,

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.561
we believe that it
shouldn't be a problem.

00:36:52.561 --> 00:36:54.560
PROFESSOR 2: So I guess
my question is, how does

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.880
that regulation actually map?

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.710
So not the fact that
the system requires it,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.720
but what is the kind of
the purpose of having

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.244
that regulation
requirement, and is

00:37:02.244 --> 00:37:04.410
it something that you guys
should be matching or not

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.280
matching?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.210
It's an open question.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:10.260
Is there a benefit to having
the nurse specifically

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.750
go there and turn
off, and did they

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.122
design that into the
system not because it

00:37:15.122 --> 00:37:16.830
was needed for the
system, but because it

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.010
was important for the task?

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.774
TANYA TALKAR: So we've
asked everyone about that.

00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:24.440
They haven't really
been able to come up

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.550
with an answer for that.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.410
Margaret herself kind
of finds it intrusive

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.090
that you have to come in and
turn off the light manually,

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.650
instead of her just being
able to turn it off.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.310
So, yeah, we're not
really completely sure

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.194
why that is there.

00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:44.360
We just know that it's a
regulation on the company's

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.580
part.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.700
PROFESSOR 3: Well, it's clearly
a Department of Public Health

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.740
regulation, and it evolved out
of abuse and neglect issues,

00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.210
where you could
respond to a resident

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.670
or just repeatedly shut
their call request off,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.340
without really
addressing a need.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:12.180
But skirting DPH--
sometimes you sort of

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.170
have to play the
game a little bit.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:20.430
So if it's an experimental
or a redundant system,

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.880
it may not have to
match their regulations

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.900
as long as the primary one meets
those specific requirements

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:36.730
of having someone go
to attend to them.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:44.150
But I am curious how you honed
in on that specific approach

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:49.130
that you've taken of using the
iPad and using that simple GUI,

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.385
versus some of the ideas
I had pitched initially.

00:38:54.607 --> 00:38:56.690
TANYA TALKAR: So I think
I was mostly through just

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.020
talking to Margaret.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:03.200
And her approach to this was
that if she was in a situation

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.780
where she wasn't able to
reach the call light system,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.940
her immediate thought
would be to use her iPhone

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.740
and call The Boston
Home and try and reach

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.055
the nurses through that.

00:39:15.055 --> 00:39:18.960
And so we felt that that would
be a little easier to interface

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.630
in that way, in terms of
she always has her iPad

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.790
or her iPhone with her.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.890
And so suppose there were
connectivity issues in terms

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.667
of like we weren't unable
to reach the-- suppose

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:34.250
there was like a Bluetooth that
was attached to the call light

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.410
system, if that connectivity
wasn't established and wasn't

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.310
stable, then that
would be an issue,

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.730
as opposed to having
Wi-Fi, which I think

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.653
would be more reliable
within the home and slightly

00:39:45.653 --> 00:39:46.819
outside of the home as well.

00:39:47.145 --> 00:39:47.895
PROFESSOR 3: Good.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.400
PROFESSOR 1: What I would ask is
how much function does Margaret

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.090
herself actually have?

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.190
It's clear that you're
trying to broaden

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.700
this other members of The
Boston Home, which is great,

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.960
but what can Margaret
herself do with an iPad app,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.550
and have you measured
that, or have you observed

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.920
her use of the prototype?

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.230
LAURA D'AQUILA: So Margaret
has limited use of her arms,

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.160
and it varies depending
on how tired she is.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.050
So when she's
particularly fatigued,

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:30.530
it's even harder for her
to reach the full screen

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.160
coverage of the iPad.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.180
But because of the fact that
she has a stylus that definitely

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.150
helps, but that's also
part of the reason

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:41.650
why we had looked into
adding the large buttons

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.980
so that it's more feasible for
Margaret and other residents

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.940
to be able to use all of these
functionalities of the app.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.650
But, yeah, she can move her
arms a little bit, but not very

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.480
much.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.110
Tanya had mentioned that on
the first day we met with her,

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:04.900
we needed her to sign a
contract for our team contract,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.380
and it was clearly
a struggle for her

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.590
to be able to move her
arms to sign the document.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.920
When she paints, she
uses a mouthpiece

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.970
so that she can do it that way.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:25.080
So I'd say that her arm
movement is pretty limited,

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.040
but because of the stylus,
she's able to at least get

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.787
by with the iPad.

00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:34.757
PROFESSOR 2: We can probably
take another one or two

00:41:34.757 --> 00:41:37.242
questions if anyone
has comments.

00:41:43.206 --> 00:41:45.691
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:48.673
You talked about there was that
situation when someone fell

00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:50.164
over and was stuck in a ditch.

00:41:50.164 --> 00:41:55.850
How could they access this
application in the iPad?

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.215
Are you considering [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.630
LAURA D'AQUILA: Right,
so maybe depending

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:04.760
on the exact situation,
they personally may not

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.120
be able to use this app.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.130
But in the event
that maybe there's

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.935
another resident
who's also outside,

00:42:09.935 --> 00:42:13.240
it may be a little bit easier
for that second resident

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.090
to call for help while they're
still outside, as opposed

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.200
to having to go
into the building

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.305
to alert the nurses
of what had happened.

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:22.680
But, yeah, in the
event that it's

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.860
just one person outside and
depending on the situation,

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.470
if they're not able to use
the iPad, like if it fell

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.005
or something, then I guess
it wouldn't help them.

00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:35.380
But it's more so
in the situation

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.630
where there's multiple people.

00:42:39.386 --> 00:42:40.969
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was interesting

00:42:40.969 --> 00:42:43.915
that you had identified the
nurses as your second client.

00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:46.870
It's very smart
of you to do that.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:51.699
How many signals are they being
bombarded by on an average day,

00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:58.327
and how is that going to
affect how you would get

00:42:58.327 --> 00:43:01.630
their attention [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.780
TANYA TALKAR: So
Angela currently just

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.500
has the nurse call system plus
a computer set up at the desk.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.360
And then, of course,
if there any nurses

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.060
who are coming up
to her to talk,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.900
that will be a
distraction as well.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.910
So that was one of
the primary things

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:18.460
that we wanted to address with
her when we talked to her.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.960
So that's why we're wondering,
should it be on the computer,

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.540
or should it be on
a separate iPad?

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.380
And she did tell us that
with all the signals

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.410
that she's getting, if
it was on the computer,

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.470
she would not be looking at it
because you'll be most probably

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.340
browsing other applications,
if it's email or whatever.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.290
And then with the
call light system,

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.620
that is also something that
beeps whenever someone calls

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.840
in, so she will address that.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.600
But if there is an
iPad just mounted

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.480
like right in the
middle there, she'll

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.260
be able to see that as a
notification coming in.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.490
And she said that
because of where

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.310
she is sitting at the desk,
then she'll be able to see that.

00:43:59.706 --> 00:44:01.674
AUDIENCE: I just had a question.

00:44:01.674 --> 00:44:04.872
I noticed I didn't hear
anything about what

00:44:04.872 --> 00:44:08.070
was the client [INAUDIBLE]
nurse [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.514
in terms of the [? hybrid ?]
liability of this application.

00:44:11.514 --> 00:44:14.466
Have you guys considered
putting that into your metric

00:44:14.466 --> 00:44:16.450
as well for success?

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.240
Like what does
she expect to work

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.120
90% of the time,
80% of the time?

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.100
And also, what [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.974
You know, complicated
systems are complicated

00:44:27.974 --> 00:44:31.646
for a reason Maybe that's
something-- like have you

00:44:31.646 --> 00:44:33.770
guys had a conversation
with the client about this?

00:44:37.496 --> 00:44:39.370
LAURA D'AQUILA: We
haven't had a conversation

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.060
about a specific number,
but one of the benefits

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.820
to the fact that we have
this iPad system on top

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.680
of the existing system is that
in the event that Wi-Fi goes

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.390
out or something like
that in the home,

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.730
and the iPad app
that isn't working,

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.090
then Margaret does
have the ability

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.540
to simply use the system
that's in place, which I think

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.970
is known to at least go through
to the nurse pretty reliably,

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.740
if not receive a
response all the time.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.240
PROFESSOR 2: All right, let's
have Team [? Aaron ?] come up.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.840
PHILIP: So hello, everyone.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.400
We're Team Kate.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.979
My name is Philip [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:24.979 --> 00:45:26.104
And my teammates here are--

00:45:26.104 --> 00:45:28.096
JENNY: Jenny.

00:45:28.096 --> 00:45:30.090
RAQUEL: Hi, I'm Raquel.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.751
[? PHILIP: So ?] today we're
just going to talk about

00:45:32.751 --> 00:45:35.250
the progress that we've made
over the course of the last few

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.760
weeks in our project with Kate.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.090
Let me quickly introduce
who our client is.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.070
Over the last few weeks,
we've been talking about Kate.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.130
She's our client, and she works
at the Cambridge Disabilities

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.400
Commission.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.680
She has profound hearing loss,
and wears a cochlear implant.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.740
We also have this really short
video, about two minutes long,

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.250
in which talks about herself
and a little bit more

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.340
about the hearing
impairment that she has.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.322
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.790
-Without my cochlear implants,
I have no residual hearing

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.940
at all, so that would
be considered profound.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:21.106
With my cochlear implants, I
have a mild to moderate hearing

00:46:21.106 --> 00:46:21.605
loss.

00:46:21.605 --> 00:46:24.360
But obviously, I do really
well with my implants.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.940
You through in any
background noise,

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.870
and it's just you
can forget about it.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.360
In this kind of
setting I do really

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.651
well with my cochlear implants.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.875
So I was born with a
very mild hearing loss.

00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:41.360
I just had like preferential
seating in school.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.110
And it became profound
or rapidly progressive

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.080
when I was 13.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.230
It went from mild to moderate
to severe and then to profound.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:54.210
I got my first cochlear
implant my left side in 1999.

00:46:54.210 --> 00:47:03.230
I had my right side done in
2008, so nine years later.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.020
It is not a quick fix.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.314
So when it was first
turned on, everything,

00:47:08.314 --> 00:47:10.230
like my brother's would
like stomp their feet,

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.604
and it would sound like someone
was ringing little bells.

00:47:12.604 --> 00:47:13.370
It was weird.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.790
And I couldn't
understand any speech,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.780
but I had to force myself
to turn my hearing aid off

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.960
on the right side.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.200
And I was home from college
for six or seven weeks.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.970
and I did all these listening
exercises with my family.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:30.150
We made it a game.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.220
Like my mom would
take children's books.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.950
And at first, she
would read them aloud,

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.970
and I would follow along,
trying to place what

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.421
I was hearing with the words.

00:47:38.421 --> 00:47:39.920
And then I would
graduate from that,

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.009
and I wasn't allowed to
follow along-- to read along.

00:47:43.009 --> 00:47:44.550
and I was trying to
follow the story,

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.060
just basically
training my brain.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.560
So my brain was receiving the
signal in a slightly new way.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.580
And so I basically had
to retrain my brain

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.420
how to take that signal and
interpret it into usable sound.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.630
I mean, I can't
tell you how much

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.990
it has changed my life though.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.800
Like I used to
walk around college

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.130
with a little whiteboard, and
people would write notes to me.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.670
It has completely changed
my life-- completely.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:14.650
So for me.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:16.880
It was so worth it.

00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:24.427
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:24.427 --> 00:48:26.260
PHILIP: So we've already
seen from the video

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.990
that Katie uses
cochlear implants,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.490
and on this I would
just like to mention

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:34.420
that a lot of people who
have hearing impediments

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:39.650
still have functional nerve
ending, the auditory nerves.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.104
The main problem is
just that the part

00:48:42.104 --> 00:48:44.860
of the ear that is
responsible for transmitting

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.160
sound to an electric
signals that are translated

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.000
by the brain aren't functional.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.700
So it is that part of the
ear that the cochlear implant

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.905
tries to fix.

00:48:57.905 --> 00:48:59.280
So the cochlear
implant basically

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.390
provides a new channel
through which sound

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.400
signals can be transmitted
to electrical signals

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.840
for the brain to interpret.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.300
RAQUEL: So now we can get
into a little bit of what

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.200
our goals is a Team Kate.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.370
So our major goal here is
to create cochlear implant

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.990
attachments, so whether it's
covers or clip-on add-ons

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.740
to her cochlear implant
to kind of hit on three

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.950
particular sub-goals in this.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.580
So the first is to provide
some water resistance

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.210
to her implant.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.210
So currently, it
isn't water resistant,

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.940
and she doesn't have a cover
that she uses for that.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.260
So to give some
context for that desire

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.990
is that she, just
like any of us,

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.930
often finds ourselves
in the rain.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.970
It seems like it's a
great day to begin with,

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.290
and by the end of
day, it's pouring.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.890
So for Kate that means
walking around with her hands

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.650
like this, covering
her implants,

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:55.900
or taking off her
implants entirely,

00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:00.810
and that's not ideal because
she can no longer hear.

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.300
A second goal for
our implant covers

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.850
are to provide some
sort of sound blocking.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:11.820
So Kate has issues in
noisy environments.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.192
And what I mean by this is
like in a lobby or a restaurant

00:50:15.192 --> 00:50:17.400
where there's just lots of
background noise going on,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.260
she has problems
distinguishing sounds

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.804
that are coming from behind
her from sounds that are

00:50:21.804 --> 00:50:22.970
coming from in front of her.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.019
So she's having a
conversation with somebody.

00:50:25.019 --> 00:50:26.560
It's hard to actually
comprehend what

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.450
they're saying when there's
lots of noise from behind.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.460
And currently, her implant
just has a single microphone

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.840
so there's no kind of
sound directionality

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.380
capability to it.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.850
And so an idea for
this is just provide

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.360
some sort of physical barrier
to basically block sound

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.820
from behind her.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.440
The third thing here
is attachedness.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.770
So she has a problem with
her cochlear implants

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.280
just falling off all the
time for different reasons.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.766
But one goal for us is
to try to just provide

00:50:55.766 --> 00:50:57.890
something that gives it a
little bit more stability

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.650
so it just stays
on her head more.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.820
So the context of
that one in particular

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.520
is really just any
place, any time.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.390
The context for all
of these are kind

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.790
of just very portable
things that she

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.410
can use in her everyday life.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.730
So we've come up with
a few success metrics.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.680
We haven't formally
tested these yet.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.280
But for the water
resistance goal

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.600
here, we'll be doing something
like a water bead test

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.660
for the material to make sure
that it's water resistant.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.650
I guess I should say
that Kate has gotten

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:37.150
a demo of her cochlear
implant from the company that

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:40.290
makes her implants, so we can
do these water resistance tests

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:42.120
not on her actual implant.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.090
But something like putting a
material, like a paper towel

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.650
or something that would show
wetness, around the implant,

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.760
putting on her cover,
spraying it, and looking

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.990
for signs of wetness and where
that wetness is coming in.

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:54.710
Sound blocking,
what we plan to do

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:58.070
is kind of a human subject
experiment with her.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:01.910
So what we'll do is play noise,
a noisy environment behind her

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.440
from different audio clips.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.450
and then have audio
clips in front of her

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.000
of speech or just
a conversation,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.290
and try to kind of get
her subjective feedback,

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:15.280
and identify her threshold for
the volume of that conversation

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.370
in front of her, and
when she recognize that

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:20.609
with and without our different
sound-blocking devices.

00:52:20.609 --> 00:52:22.400
And then attachedness--
so currently, we've

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.510
talked to Kate, and her
cochlear implants can fall out

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:29.230
up to 10 or 12 times a day,
and this isn't even necessarily

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.220
when she's being
particularly active.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.930
So our goal is something
less than three time a day,

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:36.096
just something more reasonable
for her to deal with.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.310
JENNY: So during our design
process, we talked to Kate,

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.030
and he's really, really
excited about this project

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.380
because it has been a problem
for her for a very long time,

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.040
and she showed us a bunch of
her existing solutions she has.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.190
She had a head band that you
could hook the implants into,

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.890
and that would
keep them in place.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.840
But it's very sporty.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.057
It's a bright colored headband,
and it wasn't something

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:07.140
that she was pleased with.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:12.280
And then she also had some
other kind of neoprene sleeves

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.850
that she could put
over her implants,

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:20.920
but these technologies were
all like pretty primitive,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:27.500
and they only served to
solve one problem at once.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.970
So through talking to her, we
identified a bunch of feature

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:34.810
that we wanted to
address, the three

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.260
features-- the water
resistance, sound blocking,

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.400
and attachedness-- and
we began prototyping.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.270
So we each individually
sketched designs

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:47.126
so we could come up with many
ideas when we came together.

00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:52.200
And as a team we chose
the few to prototype out.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.410
And I'll show that
on the next slide.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:59.730
But we used [INAUDIBLE], which
were two materials that we

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:01.590
discovered during lecture.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:05.310
And then last week we presented
the prototypes to Kate

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.410
and did some informal testing.

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:10.380
And she was pretty
impressed them,

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:16.220
and that leads me to the next
slide of what we made so far.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.190
So at the beginning,
we wanted to create

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.310
some sort of
all-on-one attachment

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.340
that would address all
three of the problems.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:33.090
So on the left, you can see
it's like a unibody cover that

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:34.900
covers the entire
implant that also

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.250
provides a hood over the
microphone at the very top.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:41.950
And then there's
also a little ear bud

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.730
that would help with
the attachments.

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:48.670
We decide not to go with that
because Kate wanted something

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:51.530
a little more modular,
something that she could just

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:56.560
have separate accessories
for each problem.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:03.270
So when we prototyped
keeping this in mind,

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:05.700
we created separate covers.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.990
So the left of the
top right photo

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.040
are covers for the
coil and the implant

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.050
itself, the device
with processor.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:19.130
And then we also created
some sort of hood

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:22.510
that you can put right
over the microphone, which

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.402
it's a little hard to tell,
but the microphone right here.

00:55:25.402 --> 00:55:27.110
So this hood, it
provides a small barrier

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:34.240
from the sound traveling from
behind to hit the microphone.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:42.875
So we tried this out
and then also compared

00:55:42.875 --> 00:55:49.040
it to these previously
existing devices.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.470
They're called Ear Glasses,
and these help also

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.710
amplify sound that's
coming toward you.

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.940
And she was pretty
pleased with them.

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.630
And this was like
very informal, so we

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:08.890
plan to continue to prototype
and iterate our design

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:11.640
and then bring something
to show her on Thursday.

00:56:16.562 --> 00:56:18.020
For the rest of
the semester, we're

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:23.760
looking to continue measuring
and testing out our success

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.090
metrics with the prototypes
that we're planning to build.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:28.940
And then in November,
we hope to finalize

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.565
the design and the
materials that we're

00:56:30.565 --> 00:56:35.390
going to use and then create
our final deliverable.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.660
We're looking, like
materials wise,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.010
we're keeping 3D
printing in mind

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:43.180
to actually create
the attachments.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:47.583
But we haven't finalized it
yet, so that's just something

00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:48.764
that we're looking at ahead.

00:56:48.764 --> 00:56:51.425
And that concludes
our presentation.

00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:53.091
Thank you, and we'll
take any questions.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:07.090
PROFESSOR 1: First, that was
a really nice video explaining

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:10.590
her story with getting
the cochlear implants

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.320
and what kind of change
they've made in her life.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.070
I'm curious about a couple of
other aspects of your client

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.795
that you alluded
to a little bit,

00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:21.870
but I was wondering
how important they are.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:26.940
First, how active or athletic is
she, and is it important to her

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.820
that these things be
really, really secure?

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.636
And second, how sensitive
is she to her appearance?

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.232
RAQUEL: So she's not
particularly active.

00:57:40.232 --> 00:57:41.690
What she did tell
us is that she'll

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.610
starting pool therapy
soon for another condition

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:47.650
that she has that we
didn't talk about here,

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.420
but that she'll be using
the headband because it's

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.530
really important that they
don't fall off at all.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:55.060
And she'll be in shallow
end and there will basically

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.490
be no water touching them.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.050
But so for these it's really
just kind of daily life.

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.380
She works in an office.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.940
She attends a lot of meetings.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:03.960
So nothing too active.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.010
She does ride her bike
every once in awhile,

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:07.968
and she has issues when
she puts on her helmet.

00:58:07.968 --> 00:58:09.720
But again, she
uses that headband

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.330
that just really keeps it secure
on her head for those purposes.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:18.020
And about her caring about what
she looks like, we actually

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.442
did ask her straight
up, how do you feel

00:58:20.442 --> 00:58:21.650
about looking a little silly?

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.790
Is that OK?

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:26.820
And she said that's fine.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.020
I think there's a fine line.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.430
We don't want something
that's crazy sticking out.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:35.560
But I think she's willing to
have a little bit of something

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.330
extra on her head.

00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:38.640
She's even told us
that she prefers it

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.260
when people can see that she
has a cochlear implant, instead

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:45.860
of covering it up so that they
automatically know that she has

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.806
hearing loss so that they can
communicate better with her

00:58:48.806 --> 00:58:50.472
from the beginning
of talking with them.

00:58:53.294 --> 00:58:55.460
PROFESSOR 2: So I'm wondering
if you could talk more

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.710
about that design shape.

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:00.470
So you had the
kind of Ear Glasses

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.440
as something that was clearly
doing something similar that

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.810
provides that directionality.

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.920
And in your design, you showed
kind of two different methods

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.180
of a different shape that
was on that hood for how

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.767
you're doing that.

00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:15.850
I'm wondering-- I know you
said you guys are still

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.520
kind of the middle of testing
and testing out of it.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:24.940
How is that shape playing into
your kind of design decisions?

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.580
Are you are you specifically
designing shapes and testing

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.440
them, or is that more aesthetic?

00:59:32.967 --> 00:59:34.550
JENNY: To be honest,
we haven't tested

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:36.810
that many shapes out yet.

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.250
I think that when we
do create a lot shapes,

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:41.760
we're going to look
at effectiveness

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.092
before aesthetics.

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.880
And we tried out
different sizes so far,

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.314
or we tried out
three different sizes

00:59:52.314 --> 00:59:58.788
so far of the sound
blocking piece,

00:59:58.788 --> 01:00:01.776
and definitely the
largest one actually

01:00:01.776 --> 01:00:03.270
works the most effectively.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:07.752
So we're going to find a
balance between portability

01:00:07.752 --> 01:00:10.242
and effectiveness.

01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:15.750
PROFESSOR 3: Any questions
from the audience here?

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.291
If we can have the
last team as well.

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:21.314
Jeffrey, [INAUDIBLE]
and get set up as well.

01:00:21.314 --> 01:00:23.456
Any other questions or comments?

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:25.706
AUDIENCE: How are the ear
glasses supposed to stay on?

01:00:30.952 --> 01:00:32.618
JENNY: As advertised,
they were supposed

01:00:32.618 --> 01:00:34.076
to have some sort
of adhesive strip

01:00:34.076 --> 01:00:36.794
that you can just pull
off and then stick on.

01:00:36.794 --> 01:00:40.314
But they don't actually do that.

01:00:40.314 --> 01:00:41.730
It didn't actually
come with that,

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:43.650
so they just sit on your ear.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.570
But when we had her
try them on, we just

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.970
wanted her to try it on for
the shape of the ear glasses.

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:51.378
And she was really impressed
by how big of a difference

01:00:51.378 --> 01:00:52.866
it made with her microphone.

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.241
RAQUEL: But these,
in particular,

01:00:54.241 --> 01:00:56.834
won't stay on very well
for us, and they definitely

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.500
don't stay on with
her cochlear implant.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.760
PROFESSOR 3: I assume
that magnets would

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.860
be a problem with the implants.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.090
I don't know if you
address that specifically.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:13.960
I'm just thinking of how
well devices click in place.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.913
I'm just thinking quick
one in the extruder head

01:01:16.913 --> 01:01:20.070
on the 3D printer, how would
you just get sort of lined up,

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.630
and it jumps into place.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.680
And I like that
functionality, but I'm

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.480
wondering-- I'm
assuming-- that that would

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.688
be problem with the implants.

01:01:30.742 --> 01:01:33.200
PHILIP: It's actually one of
the things that we considered.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.410
But just like you
said, we weren't

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.460
sure about how adding
a magnet to the system

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.635
would affect the
way the outer part

01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:44.872
of the implanted part of it.

01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:46.580
So we haven't really
tried that yet here.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.270
But I think we're going
to explore that option

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:54.520
a little bit more and see how
it affects the communication.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.270
If it doesn't have
that much of an impact,

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:58.560
then we would use it.

01:02:00.189 --> 01:02:02.480
PROFESSOR 3: Any final
questions or anything like that?

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.340
AUDIENCE: One quick thing
is you may [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.126
think about the shape,
the engineering of it.

01:02:13.126 --> 01:02:15.292
There's some principles to
apply to kind of engineer

01:02:15.292 --> 01:02:21.002
a shape that is most
effective for sound filtering

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:21.792
or sound blocking.

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:22.740
That kind of thing.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.180
OK, Thank you.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.790
Hi, so we're Team Jeffery.

01:02:33.164 --> 01:02:34.080
JODIE CHEN: I'm Jodie.

01:02:34.303 --> 01:02:35.136
DAVID KE: I'm David.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.045
JODIE CHEN: And our
client is Jeffrey.

01:02:39.045 --> 01:02:42.910
Here's a picture of
him, and he's blind.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:45.290
So first, we're going to
talk about contextual inquiry

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.670
and how we worked
with the HAAT model.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.790
So we came up with
a few questions

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:51.770
that we planned on
asking him to kind of get

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:53.909
an idea of what
activities he enjoys doing

01:02:53.909 --> 01:02:55.700
and which activities
we can help streamline

01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.125
or make more efficient and allow
him to, I guess, enjoy it more.

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.500
So we kind of
asked him questions

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.874
like, what activities
do you want

01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:04.300
to be able to do independently?

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.290
And we asked him to
show as an activity

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.620
that he enjoyed in his
free time and also like

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.550
how he uses computers,
because it turns out

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.930
that he uses computers a lot.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.550
So I think one
thing that we found

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:20.360
about Jeffrey is that he's
actually extremely independent,

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.860
even though he's blind.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.070
He told us that like
75% of blind people

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:27.275
are like unemployed,
but he's been employed

01:03:27.275 --> 01:03:29.530
in multiple places before,
and he also continues

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:30.920
to do a lot of financial work.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.740
So we have a video to
kind of show, I guess,

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.735
how he's l challenged
our misconceptions.

01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:43.082
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.360
-Hi, so I'm David, and
I'm part of Team Jeffrey

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.350
with Jodie Chen and Yi Tong.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:50.726
And the client that we're
working with for PPAT, his name

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:53.050
is Jeffrey, and he's blind.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.379
I guess initially going
into this project,

01:03:55.379 --> 01:03:57.920
I didn't really know what I was
expecting in terms of working

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.340
with a person with blindness.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.560
I guess, part of it's
like I didn't expect them

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.300
to be super self-sufficient.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.000
And I thought they
would have to be

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.042
relying on a lot of technologies
to go through their day.

01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:11.500
[? And so I was like ?] struggle
with like a decent portion

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.255
of the daily activities.

01:04:14.255 --> 01:04:16.630
-I guess something that really
surprised me about Jeffrey

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:21.016
was how autonomous he is in
like his travel and other stuff.

01:04:21.016 --> 01:04:22.976
So what you might not
know about Jeffrey

01:04:22.976 --> 01:04:26.752
is that during our Monday and
Wednesday classes sessions as

01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:29.924
well as class labs,
he actually comes over

01:04:29.924 --> 01:04:33.828
and he listens and he also
participates in our team

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.065
discussions, gives all
of like helpful advice

01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:40.340
as to like how do we
really work on the project

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.300
and how to build it.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.172
-So I have plan
A, plan B, plan C,

01:04:44.172 --> 01:05:05.760
and plan D. That's how you
have to live OK, so here we're

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.810
on my email.

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:11.650
-Jeffrey is-- you can
barely tell Jeffrey's blind

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:14.954
when he's at his
place because he knows

01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.822
exactly where everything is.

01:05:17.822 --> 01:05:20.605
He's really passionate
about technology.

01:05:20.605 --> 01:05:21.646
-He is really passionate.

01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:23.396
He told me that he as
the coolest gadgets.

01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:24.270
-[INAUDIBLE]?

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:24.861
-What toys?

01:05:24.861 --> 01:05:27.360
-You looked at this other wall
while you were sitting there.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.721
I said, Jeff, what is it?

01:05:28.721 --> 01:05:29.304
-I don't know.

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.248
-Remember, I said
when I got here

01:05:31.248 --> 01:05:33.690
and he had this-- it's
a talking thermometer.

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:39.140
-Oh, it's a talking thermometer,
indoor/outdoor temperature.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.445
Neil plays with it more than
I do because, frankly, I

01:05:42.445 --> 01:05:44.127
don't give a damn.

01:05:44.127 --> 01:05:45.210
It's too much information.

01:05:49.422 --> 01:05:54.810
-The indoor temperature is
68.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.450
-I don't even know
how accurate it is.

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:58.920
It's a toy.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.840
-And then he [? bought ?]
this when he started cooking.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.110
It's a talking kitchen
thermometer-- a kitchen scale.

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:09.320
-Oh, yeah, I tell you, he
knows more the toys-- I forgot.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.546
-Because I found them.

01:06:11.546 --> 01:06:12.524
-(SINGING) Ah--

01:06:12.524 --> 01:06:13.491
-Ah.

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:13.991
-Ah.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.122
[END PLAYBACK]

01:06:20.122 --> 01:06:22.330
JODIE CHEN: So here's some
information about Jeffrey.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.540
So Jeffrey, he's
visually impaired,

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.800
and he has been kind
of for his whole life.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.432
He used to be able to
see like different things

01:06:30.432 --> 01:06:32.640
if you blew them up really
large on like a projector.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.260
But now, all he can see is like
just like light and darkness.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.790
So he's used computers
for practically his whole,

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.372
so he's actually very, very
good at using his JAWS screen

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:42.080
reading software.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.260
And he actually
teaches people how

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.650
to use it in the Carroll
Center for the Blind.

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:49.030
And he also knows
braille, and he told us

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:50.550
that actually a
lot of blind people

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.190
don't know how to read
braille, so he's actually

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:53.648
one of the few
people that actually

01:06:53.648 --> 01:06:55.870
does know how to read braille.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:57.900
And he also does a lot
of financial paperwork

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.560
for his homeowner's
association for his condo,

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.850
and he does a lot of
taxes for his friends.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:05.870
So he's constantly
on his computer,

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:09.105
checking his email, using
Excel to work on that.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.310
So we kind of wanted to
narrow down like an activity

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.160
that Jeffrey has to do that he
wants, I guess, like more help

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.660
in.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.252
So he's a pretty
opinionated person,

01:07:22.252 --> 01:07:24.460
so he already had an idea
of what problems he exactly

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.310
wanted us to solve
and also solutions

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.270
as to how to solve them.

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.740
So on the activities that
he kind of narrowed down

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.890
for us is finding a way to
sign a paper with a wet ink

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:35.530
signature.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:39.330
So he gets a lot of financial
sheets and documents from banks

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:42.010
and stuff that need him
to sign the document

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.220
and not have a
digital signature.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.725
So in order to
sign a document, he

01:07:45.725 --> 01:07:47.910
has to have his visual
aide Neil come over

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:51.290
and like help him find the
exact line where he has to sign.

01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:52.880
And if he doesn't
have a visual aide,

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.310
then there's no way for
him to get that done.

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:57.340
And she also uses
Excel a lot, and he

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.220
doesn't like the
new format of Excel,

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.320
so he wants us to
kind of like change

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.420
it to be more compatible
with like the versions

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.850
that he's used to.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:08.980
So we narrowed it down
to being able to help

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.880
him sign a document when he's
like independent and alone,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.050
without a visual
aide to help him.

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:21.069
So to kind of get a better idea
of what we have to work with,

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:23.319
we kind of asked him like,
what assistive technologies

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.100
that he currently
use so to find out

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.550
which assistive technologies
that he was comfortable with.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.390
So he told us that he's
really comfortable with JAWS,

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:37.000
and that like when he
does OCR on a document,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.810
he can determine where a
signature line is because JAWS

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:43.970
will just say like, underscore,
underscore, underscore.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.359
So all we had to do
is kind of find a way

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.850
to guide like his
mouse pointer to like

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:53.290
the position of the
underline and then

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:55.551
to find a way to convert
that into like something

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.509
that could be translated
onto a piece of paper.

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:05.160
So for our success
metrics we kind of wanted

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.470
to be able to evaluate
like how well he

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:11.029
can sign a document by seeing if
he can actually find the place

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.460
where to sign
independently on his own,

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.069
which he isn't able
to do right now.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.330
And we also wanted to measure
like how long it takes

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.090
for him to measure a document.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.210
And I guess that's
pretty easy to improve on

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:24.662
because currently it takes
infinite time for him to sign

01:09:24.662 --> 01:09:25.750
a document.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.220
And we also wanted
to measure kind

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.910
of how accurate he is
with finding the position

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:32.200
and also signing
because we don't

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.850
want him to sign
somewhere that's

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:36.160
really far away from the line.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.284
So that's kind of
like the scope.

01:09:38.284 --> 01:09:39.700
YI TONG: So I'm
just going to talk

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.866
about the project organization,
the progress so far.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.193
So the first is the ideation.

01:09:47.193 --> 01:09:49.359
So we're very lucky, so
Jeffrey's always in the lab,

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.830
as you all can see.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.790
So he's been meeting
with us every lab

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.000
and also contributes
a lot of good ideas.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.590
So we go to the lab with
ideas and then consult Jeffrey

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.870
and ask him for the feedback.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:01.520
And then we narrow
down the solutions

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.970
after every discussion.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:06.750
And then finally, we decided
on the mechi and software

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:09.820
combined solution.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.410
So for the software
part, so we all

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:14.730
know that JAWS can
detect a signature line

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.540
and read out underscore
and also like signatures

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.860
and different kinds of words.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.485
So we just need to find a way to
get coordinates from the mouse

01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:24.360
location, and then take in the
mouse location two inches so

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.970
that that can be the
input for the mechi part.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.350
So for mechanical
part, we need a frame

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.270
the holds standard sized
paper so it won't slide away.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.790
And then we need sliding
braille rulers, or rails,

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:40.310
to move horizontally and
vertically so that Jeffrey can

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.900
adjust to the exacty x-,
y-coordinates by sliding

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.150
the two rails.

01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:47.600
So here's the early sketches
and also the prototype

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.570
that we have.

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:51.520
So on the right is just
some white board drawings

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.850
about different ideas
that we had before.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.690
So the first one you can say
something more or less like

01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.680
the magnifier that we see
on [? Ability ?] [? Expo ?].

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.430
So basically the
advantage of that is he

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:07.390
doesn't have any restriction
while he's signing things.

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:10.080
But that is really hard to
implement because the camera's

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.420
on top of the paper.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:17.040
And also we also get inspired
by the idea of a project built

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.780
by an MIT Media Lab.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.175
So it's a finger reader, so
like whenever he scans a line,

01:11:22.175 --> 01:11:23.050
he hears "signature."

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:24.720
Then he will start signing.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.210
But then that would
require Jeffrey

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.410
to scan through the whole page.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.060
And then so we finalized
on this sketch.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.330
So there are two siting rulers.

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:37.230
Ideally, each ruler will
have like brailles on it

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:40.520
so that he can know how
far he's gone on the page.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.150
So both rulers kind of slide
left and right and also

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.220
the other's up and down.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.230
Yeah and then just the
idea-- you don't you read it.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:53.810
But it's just how much
Jeffrey's input is given to us,

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.290
and also he's really
passionate about this project.

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:02.360
DAVID KE: So this is the general
timeline for what we're doing.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.860
So in the next few
weeks, it's going

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.661
to be focused on mostly
making more prototypes

01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:08.160
for these projects,
and we're really

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.800
ramping up our
interactions with Jeffrey

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.604
to get feedback and
iterate on our designs.

01:12:13.604 --> 01:12:15.520
So like as you've seen
in the previous slides,

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.322
we already have a
really lo-fi prototype.

01:12:17.322 --> 01:12:19.280
So what we're going to
do in the next two weeks

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.890
is prepare multiple versions
with minor detail differences

01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:25.210
to Jeffrey to see
which ones he likes.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.460
Because a lot of it, the
general idea is pretty solid,

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.001
but a lot of it's
like in the details

01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:30.960
of how unexpected
things might come up

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.930
as he uses it day to day.

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:36.390
And in a few weeks, once we
kind of have that hammered out,

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.540
we'll try to work on
like a more high fidelity

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.351
prototype that this
more closer to what

01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:42.850
we'll be presenting at the end
in the beginning of November.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:50.346
And on the software side,
this is more like on our side

01:12:50.346 --> 01:12:51.970
because we need to
kind of get familiar

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:54.630
with hows JAWS is working,
as well as like what kind

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.810
of inputs to outputs we can give
to JAWS as well as from JAWS.

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:02.186
And then we're aiming to sort
of complete that little bit

01:13:02.186 --> 01:13:03.560
after hardware,
so we can kind of

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.143
combine it together and have a
few weeks to see how that would

01:13:06.143 --> 01:13:07.740
work as a complete package.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:17.191
And this is just what we've
done so far-- yay, teamwork.

01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.441
OK, and that's the last slide.

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:30.380
YI TONG: Well, he obviously
had a lot of ideas,

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.560
and I'm wondering how
you chose, or what

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.820
process you used to choose
this signature project?

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:41.710
Was it sort of an embodiment
of your skills and interests,

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:45.170
or was it like clear
front runner for him?

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:47.580
DAVID KE: So I think
two main categories

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.250
we were considering
in that was, one,

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.280
is it something that
aligned with our skills,

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.190
because we're all
studying computer science.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.940
He also had a bunch
of projects that

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.980
were pretty cool that
wasn't that involved,

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.960
like mostly mechanical
engineering.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.530
So that was like a little out
of the reach of our abilities.

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.696
At the same time, something
else we have to consider

01:14:06.696 --> 01:14:10.900
was we needed a project that was
the right scope for the class.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.140
So like, for example, the
Excel thing he mentioned,

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:16.240
it's mostly computers,
but it was very simple.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.231
So we wanted something that
had more substance to it that

01:14:19.231 --> 01:14:21.022
could be applied to
more people afterwards.

01:14:25.974 --> 01:14:28.390
PROFESSOR 1: I have a question
about your baseline success

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:32.980
metrics because you did say that
signing documents is something

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.860
does do with Neil's help.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.610
Have you watched him to
do that with Niel's help?

01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:41.100
Have you sort of collected
examples of his signature

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.080
that he's done with Neils help?

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.474
Seems like that you're not
just operating with something

01:14:46.474 --> 01:14:47.890
that he's completely
unable to do,

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:50.960
but something he just
can't do independently yet.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.460
JODIE CHEN: Well, he wants to
be able to do it independently

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.220
because Neil isn't always there.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.679
And we haven't really had a
chance to watch Neil show him

01:14:58.679 --> 01:15:03.850
where the signature line is and
how to sign it because, so far,

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:07.081
we've only gone to his
house once because he comes

01:15:07.081 --> 01:15:08.580
to Monday, Wednesday
class sections,

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.080
but also lab sections,
so we've been

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.090
meeting with him for
around four hours

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:14.972
every week during class time.

01:15:14.972 --> 01:15:16.930
DAVID KE: Yeah, but I
think that's a good idea,

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:18.688
and it's something we
should definitely do

01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:20.630
the next time we meet with him.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:24.500
I suspect we'll have
to consider that

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.770
as like two different
categories of like metrics,

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:30.730
but it's something
that should be included

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:33.811
PROFESSOR 2: So I'm curious
more about the mechanical aspect

01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:34.310
then.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:37.160
So you guys are really
comfortable with the software

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.634
side, and you presented
the first prototype

01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:41.050
of the mechanical
side, and you've

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.990
showed kind of your sketch of
how the camera might be there

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.280
and where the rulers might be.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.113
But you talked about
some of the limitations

01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:51.064
potentially for just
being able to kind of look

01:15:51.064 --> 01:15:53.230
at where you put your head,
where you put your hand.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:54.890
I want you to talk
a little bit more

01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:56.950
about some of those
limitations and things

01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:00.600
you're thinking about
from the mechanical side,

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.750
and what you think you
might do to balance that.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:09.150
YI TONG: I think I might have
misrepresented because I feel

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:12.091
like the camera thing is just
like the earlier prototypes

01:16:12.091 --> 01:16:14.590
that we explored, but we're not
going to do the camera side.

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:16.490
We're just going to
keep the software part,

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:17.840
the mechi part separate.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.036
So the mechi part
is independent.

01:16:20.036 --> 01:16:21.410
It only takes in
the coordinates.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.620
And then Jeffrey
will get feedback

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.390
when he's sliding the rulers,
so he knows how far he's gone,

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:29.240
but he doesn't have to
have a camera take down

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.320
where his hand is currently on.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.250
DAVID KE: Yeah, and one
good thing about this

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.090
is I think Jeffrey
and us are pretty

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:38.980
aligned in that we
want to keep the amount

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.540
of complicated components in
the final project like minimized

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.849
to reduce possibility
of failure.

01:16:44.849 --> 01:16:46.390
So a lot of the
things we've actually

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.950
talked about in
the past few weeks

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.392
are ways to simplify the
parts so that it still

01:16:50.392 --> 01:16:52.600
has the relevant information,
but it's like as simple

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.100
as possible.

01:16:56.015 --> 01:16:57.640
PROFESSOR 4: Any
questions or comments?

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.614
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
using a mouse [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:03.030
But wouldn't that require him
to click all over the screen

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:05.356
to find out where the
signature line is, or are you

01:17:05.356 --> 01:17:06.950
just going to have he
reads through it with JAWS

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:08.408
and then stops when
he finds lines.

01:17:10.622 --> 01:17:12.830
JODIE CHEN: So it's more
likely to be like the latter

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:15.400
because he's done that.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.997
For JAWS, when JAWS is reading
something on the screen,

01:17:17.997 --> 01:17:21.476
it has a [INAUDIBLE] somewhat
similar [? to mouse clicks, ?]

01:17:21.476 --> 01:17:23.970
but they're not actually
mouse [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.636
And then there's like
a function in JAWS

01:17:25.636 --> 01:17:29.981
where it moves the mouse
pointer to the location of where

01:17:29.981 --> 01:17:31.255
it's currently reading.

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:32.963
So that's how we're
planning on doing it.

01:17:36.939 --> 01:17:38.707
PROFESSOR 4: Any
questions, comments?

01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:40.915
So quick clarification, so
is there like a scanning--

01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:41.412
maybe I missed it.

01:17:41.412 --> 01:17:43.400
Is there some scanning
of the document first?

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.388
Are you buying a scanner?

01:17:45.388 --> 01:17:47.429
JODIE CHEN: Oh, he always
scans in his documents.

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.224
AUDIENCE: I was hoping to
[INAUDIBLE] Jeffrey briefly.

01:17:56.224 --> 01:17:58.807
Is it going to be an issue when
the line is like a drawn line,

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.292
as opposed to [INAUDIBLE] line?

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:03.280
Or will that resolve
with the scanner?

01:18:06.107 --> 01:18:08.690
DAVID KE: That just depends on
like the of quality of the line

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:13.179
as well as like the character
recognition software.

01:18:13.179 --> 01:18:14.678
So we'll probably
do tests with that

01:18:14.678 --> 01:18:16.678
to see like how much
tolerance the software has.

01:18:19.125 --> 01:18:20.666
PROFESSOR 4: Michelle,
last question.

01:18:20.666 --> 01:18:22.207
AUDIENCE: Is there
a general location

01:18:22.207 --> 01:18:24.159
where you know the
lines are going to be.

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:26.277
Just out of curiosity,
like if I sign a paper,

01:18:26.277 --> 01:18:28.151
it's usually at the
bottom right-hand corner.

01:18:28.151 --> 01:18:29.149
Do you guys have
an understanding

01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:31.190
of what kind of documents
he's currently signing,

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:32.749
like what they look like?

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:35.040
YI TONG: According to Jeffrey,
I think it varies a lot.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.860
And also sometimes like
there's a huge line,

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.580
but then the signature
word is under the line,

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.330
but sometimes it's
just next to it.

01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:46.060
And then sometimes,
the signature's

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.252
right here on the left
of page, but then you

01:18:48.252 --> 01:18:49.960
have to sign it to
the right of the page.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.670
So it really depends on
different kinds of paperwork.

01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:57.320
So we tried to collect all
different kinds of paperwork

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.080
that he normally
gets, and then we

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.080
tried to characterize like what
different kinds of signature

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.317
box that he normally gets
and then work on that.

01:19:06.317 --> 01:19:07.900
JODIE CHEN: And also
what Jeffrey does

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.100
is he scans a document,
and then he runs OCR on it,

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:15.400
and then he translates
it into a Word document,

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.620
and then he prints out
the Word document to sign.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:21.020
So what's going to happen is
that he alters the document

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.200
that he gets in mail
pretty significantly when

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.692
he runs OCR and changes
it to a Word document.

01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:29.150
DAVID KE: But overall he gets
a lot of different signatures

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:31.855
on that.

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:34.480
PROFESSOR 2: It would be really
interesting to actually try out

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.190
that and get those documents for
all these different signature

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:37.530
lines.

01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.113
And I think that's
a really good point

01:19:39.113 --> 01:19:42.100
about whether it's an
underscore line or a drawn line,

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.196
and some signatures are actually
boxes as opposed to lines

01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:46.404
and how that might affect it.

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:52.021
PROFESSOR 4: OK, thank you.

01:20:01.812 --> 01:20:03.770
VYNNIE KONG: Everyone,
we are Team Beverly Ann.

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.482
This is our mid-semester review.

01:20:05.482 --> 01:20:06.190
My name's Vynnie.

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:07.420
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: I'm Shruthi.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.420
ROBERT LUO : I'm Robert.

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:13.810
VYNNIE KONG: And
we're just going

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.160
to provide you a brief
introduction to our client.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.350
So some of the non technical
things-- Beverly-Ann

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.400
is a social worker
for DCF, so that's

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.740
the Division of
Children with Families,

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.290
so she basically works
at a sort of law firm.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:29.165
And she's actually
learning how to code using

01:20:29.165 --> 01:20:32.180
and Scratch Arduino, which
we thought were pretty cool.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.710
She loves playing Wi tennis.

01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:36.000
She has a backyard
garden, so she

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.820
grows tomatoes and marigolds.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.110
And most importantly, she wants
to maintain an active mind

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.790
in order to keep
busy and kind of like

01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:46.730
find something useful
for the rest of her life.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:49.630
And before we explain
more about stuff

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.390
related to the HAAT
model, we think

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:53.850
the video would be a
very good descriptor

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.598
of a lot of these things.

01:20:55.598 --> 01:20:59.990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:02.870
-Hello, my name is
Beverly Ann Rock,

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:06.144
and I have been
diagnosed with CMT, which

01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:07.435
stands for Charcot-Marie-Tooth.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:24.300
I was diagnosed
about 11 years ago.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.440
If there's any blessings
to this disease

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.550
or anything good
about this disease, is

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.200
it only affects the
hands and the legs,

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.770
which means I'll always
have my ability to talk.

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:39.800
Three of my 10 fingers have
taken on the deformity, which

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.360
means they're kind of locked.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.220
And eventually, they will
end up in gnarled positions.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:49.900
But fortunately, 7
is better than none.

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.660
So I use my seven
fingers very effectively.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:59.970
My right hand, it has
become numb in many places.

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:02.510
Thus it doesn't give
me the opportunity

01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:06.610
to use very simple devices.

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:10.290
So if I were to be trying
to drink something hot,

01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.590
I would make sure to try
to grip it as best I can

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:15.760
and support it.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.932
But over time, it's
not going to hold.

01:22:18.932 --> 01:22:20.890
It's going to slip, I'm
going to lose the grip.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.610
That's one of my concerns
is dropping stuff

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.990
and why I'm so
guarded about dropping

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:39.240
is if you drop a glass, a
shard, I had a couple times,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.490
a little thing has just
stuck into my foot,

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:45.230
and I didn't realize it
till I looked down and said,

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:46.810
why am I bleeding?

01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:54.450
I Constantly fall, and I
always have devices or walkers

01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:57.060
or scooters or things
that will enable

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:00.268
me to maintain balance
and continue to be mobile.

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:06.620
I choose, at this point
in my life, to work,

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.671
even though I'm
at retirement age,

01:23:08.671 --> 01:23:10.836
and that's because it
keeps my mind busy.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:18.220
And hopefully every day
they're working on a cure,

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:20.870
or I stumble on a
program like you

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:26.060
that is going to assist me to
make things a little easier.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.020
So if I had a device
that was telling me,

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.860
if I got too into
the conversation,

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:33.466
that it's loosening, then I
when know to go back and not

01:23:33.466 --> 01:23:40.394
use the assistance to go back
and try to tighten the grip.

01:23:40.394 --> 01:23:41.810
-We have to distract
you some how.

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:43.935
-You are distracting me
because why you're talking,

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:45.600
I'm saying, OK, hold on.

01:23:53.879 --> 01:23:57.790
[END PLAYBACK]

01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:02.220
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: So, as she
said in the video, she has CMT.

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.770
It's a neurodegenerative
disease that

01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:07.660
affects the extremities,
so the hands and the feet.

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.970
It results in a loss of touch
sensation and muscle control.

01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:13.170
So she has involuntary
muscle spasms.

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:15.685
For her, in particular, we're
interested in her hands.

01:24:15.685 --> 01:24:18.310
So it means that she has sensory
failures in part of your hands

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:21.030
and muscle failure in others.

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:23.890
And this is like
a general diagram

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.880
of her left and right hand.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.430
On her left hand, you can see
the green fingers are curled in

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:30.450
like this.

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:32.820
And that's because that's
their natural position.

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.903
So when she tries to open
them, they automatically

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:35.580
curl back in.

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.160
So this is like the
involuntary muscle movement.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.960
But her other two
fingers are very mobile.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.980
So even though she
can't grip anything just

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.840
with the left hand,
she uses her left hand

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.880
to support what
she's gripping a lot.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.364
On her right hand,
the red regions,

01:24:49.364 --> 01:24:50.780
which are most of
her fingers, are

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.760
the places where
her hands are numb,

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.020
so she can't feel anything.

01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.760
And so she has a
hard time gripping

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.250
with those parts of her fingers.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:01.740
But the tips of her fingertips,
which are marked in blue,

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.310
are actually fully sensitive.

01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:06.680
So she tends to claw whenever
she's picking things up.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.650
But over time, she still loses
grip with her right hand.

01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:14.820
VYNNIE KONG: Because
of the combination

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:19.560
of loss of pressure and also
involuntary muscle movements,

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.500
there are certain activities
that Beverly Ann has trouble

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.800
with on a day-to-day basis.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.630
And then I made a table
with modifications

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.650
that she's learned
to do to adapt.

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:31.306
So a lot of the things
she has trouble with

01:25:31.306 --> 01:25:34.167
is having to consciously
think about doing

01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:35.000
everything she does.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.250
So any time she has to pick up
something to drink of water,

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.730
any time she has
to type something,

01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:42.440
she needs to think about
every single letter she types,

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.650
rather than just typing
out of muscle memory.

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:48.321
And that's difficult,
especially when

01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:50.070
you're holding a
conversation with someone

01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:52.630
or if you're just thinking
about something else.

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:55.460
You can't always think about
what you're doing all the time.

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.080
This also helps with
walking down stairwells,

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.880
because she has to
grip onto the stairwell

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.050
and make sure she squeezes
every couple of seconds,

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:07.570
so if she's managed to stumble,
she'll still have the grip

01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:09.202
and be able to
stabilize herself.

01:26:09.202 --> 01:26:11.660
And the last thing is actually
cooking, which he brought up

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.410
in a meeting, where she realized
when she was cooking potatoes

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.140
and she was picking up
potatoes to put them in the pot

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.627
that she wasn't actually
grabbing on to them.

01:26:20.627 --> 01:26:22.710
So she had to use this
sort of like clawing motion

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:25.750
to get them from the
cutting board into the pot.

01:26:29.225 --> 01:26:31.600
ROBERT LUO : So the basic
problem we're dealing with here

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.360
is that she has to constantly
think about the things

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.590
she's grabbing whenever she's
grabbing some kind of object.

01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:42.800
And also, she is not
really confident in using

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.190
just her right hand
for grabbing objects.

01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:50.360
Instead she normally uses her
left hand to do the support.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.720
And we want to come up with
the device which would help her

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.420
by notifying her when she
first-- helping her to have

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.010
the confidence to grab objects
with just her right hand,

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:08.960
and then notifying her whenever
her gripping starts to become

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.110
loose.

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:14.390
So then we came up with
the success metrics

01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:15.300
for our project.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.930
There are few things
we can think about.

01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:25.230
So the first thing is we want
to see how much of a percentage

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:27.630
our device could
give her the warning.

01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:29.750
So right now, of
course, it's zero.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:32.930
But we think a
reasonable goal will 50%.

01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:35.600
Meaning that our device
will be able to alert

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.730
her 50% of the time whenever
her grip starts to become loose,

01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:42.490
and then with an
ambitious goal of 90%.

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.520
And then the second
success metric

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.890
is the dropping rate
with just her right hand.

01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:51.850
And so this part we still need
to measure how many times,

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.510
how many things she drops
on average in a day,

01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:56.270
and then we want
to decrease that

01:27:56.270 --> 01:28:03.400
by 50% as our reasonable
goal, and 20% off the original

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.340
as our ambitious goal.

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:08.850
And then we want to boost her
confidence in gripping objects

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.800
with just her right hand.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.510
And we can measure
how many times

01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:19.100
she grabs things in a weekly
basis or a daily basis.

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.280
And then we want to increase
the percentage of her just

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.530
using her the right hand to grab
to 60%, then eventually 90%.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.380
And so this is our design
process for this device.

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.410
So first, we define the goals.

01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:41.200
So we noticed that she
has two different problems

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.970
for her left hand
and her right hand.

01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:45.380
And after talking
with our mentor Jeff,

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:47.560
we decided to focus
on solving her problem

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.740
with the right hand, so
meaning the gripping part.

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.270
Then we brainstormed
of different ideas.

01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:55.690
We mainly focused on whether
we should use a sensor,

01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:58.440
and if yes, where
should we put the sensor

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.510
as well as how we can attach
the sensor to her hand?

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:07.580
Then we come with various
types of prototypes,

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.320
many based on the
location of the sensor

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.620
as well as the style of
attachment of the sensor.

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:17.390
So the fundamental
idea of our design

01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:21.870
is to have a way to quantify
the pressures she exercises when

01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:24.110
she grabs things
as well as trying

01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:27.860
to have a way to notify her
when her grip becomes loose.

01:29:30.394 --> 01:29:32.310
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: So
the first concept we had

01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:34.730
was to place the sensors near
the palm of her right hand,

01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:36.110
so that would be in this area.

01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.000
We figured that we
wanted as little material

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.580
on her hand as possible, so it
wouldn't weigh her down and so

01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.800
that it wouldn't look like
a very obvious device.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.180
And then on the
back of the hand,

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.388
you can see there's a square.

01:29:45.388 --> 01:29:47.280
That would be where the
sensors read out to.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.480
There would be
some sort of output

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.640
there that she could look
or that would notify her

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.950
when her grip is slipping.

01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:54.694
So this was good because it
was very small and condensed,

01:29:54.694 --> 01:29:56.360
and she'd still have
use of her fingers.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.760
But it was bad because she tends
to grip with her fingertips.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.210
So we wouldn't actually be
able to sense a lot of the grip

01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:02.480
that she was using.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.007
And so we would basically get
no reading most of the time

01:30:06.007 --> 01:30:07.840
So then we came up with
an exciting concept,

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.280
which was to place the sensors
on the tips of the fingers.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.530
If you can see, everything
except for the index finger

01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:13.646
has a sensor.

01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:16.020
That's because she actually
doesn't use your index finger

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.050
very much when gripping.

01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:19.429
So the other four
fingers have sensors.

01:30:19.429 --> 01:30:20.970
They wrap around
the back of the hand

01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:23.301
to go to the same output box.

01:30:23.301 --> 01:30:25.800
This is much better because she
grips with their fingertips,

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.758
so we can actually sense
what's she's gripping.

01:30:27.758 --> 01:30:30.790
But it does take up
more of her hand.

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:32.590
In the end, we went
with a second concept,

01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:35.455
and this is because we asked her
about how she felt about having

01:30:35.455 --> 01:30:36.330
a device on her hand.

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:38.462
And she was like, I don't
care what it looks like.

01:30:38.462 --> 01:30:40.920
It could be pretty big, and I
would be OK with that as long

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.460
as it helps me to grip.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.492
So we made some very basic
prototypes of just the shape

01:30:46.492 --> 01:30:47.700
of what they would look like.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:51.610
So the sensors are the
sort of strips of paper,

01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:53.380
and we just wanted
to see how they

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:58.775
would look so that we can
sort of experiment with how

01:30:58.775 --> 01:30:59.650
they fit on her hand.

01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:01.105
So if you want to--

01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.340
VYNNIE KONG: So a bit
of a future timeline,

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:10.530
we are planning by next week,
so October 29th, to start

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.280
and basically
finished figuring out

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:15.100
the circuitry for connecting
these sensors to some sort

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.020
of output voltage, and we
want to tune the circuit so

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.830
that whatever output
voltage the sensors produce

01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:24.385
will be in a format that's
interpretable to our needs.

01:31:26.645 --> 01:31:28.520
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: Then
we want to write code

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.978
to respond to the
sensor so that we

01:31:29.978 --> 01:31:33.110
can give her a sort of output
on when she's losing grip.

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:36.060
So we want to study what
the sensor voltage looks

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.870
like as her grip loosens
and try to figure out

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:40.950
where we can start
notifying her,

01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:43.770
when like this certain thing
happens that, oh, your grip is

01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:44.380
loosening.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.790
So we plan to try multiple
different algorithms for this,

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:48.790
and this will hopefully
be our second prototype,

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:52.390
and we'll have it done by
the first week of November.

01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:54.870
ROBERT LUO : And then the third
step is the actual glove we

01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:57.310
will use to attach
the sensor with.

01:31:57.310 --> 01:32:00.230
So some things we want to
think about in this stage

01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:03.320
is how we want to keep
the sensors safe, which

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.780
means we don't want
the sensors to be

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:08.030
exposed to the outside
environment as well

01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.850
as her hand.

01:32:08.850 --> 01:32:10.550
So maybe something
we're thinking about

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:13.240
is knitting two
layers of the gloves

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.310
together and having the
sensors to be in the middle.

01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:19.700
So that could protect the sensor
from the outside environment

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.550
as well as her hand.

01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:24.320
And then we also want to
think about questions like,

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.280
what happens to the sensors
when she curls her hand?

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.170
So the way we think
about it is that as long

01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:32.300
as we put the sensor
on the back of her hand

01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.220
or on the wristband,
it depends on which one

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.860
we choose eventually.

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:40.070
Both designs would able
to help stable, even

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.170
when she curls her hand.

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:49.780
And, of course, after we're
having the prototypes,

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.420
we want to keep improving on
the device based on our test

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.850
results with Beverly Ann.

01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:00.600
VYNNIE KONG: A little bit
about our division of work--

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.310
so during our client
meetings, Shruthi

01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:04.940
he has been primarily
doing the video.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:07.023
I've been primarily doing
the interviews, and then

01:33:07.023 --> 01:33:07.850
Robert, the notes.

01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:10.510
And looking onwards,
Shruthi and I

01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:11.970
will be planning
on working mostly

01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:14.530
on the circuits, and then
Robert on most of the gloves

01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:18.012
and figuring out what
materials to use.

01:33:18.012 --> 01:33:19.470
And thank you,
guys, for listening.

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:21.095
If you have any
questions, let us know.

01:33:27.496 --> 01:33:30.472
PROFESSOR 4: Questions
comments from [INAUDIBLE]?

01:33:30.472 --> 01:33:32.180
PROFESSOR 1: I'm
wondering if you thought

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.500
about what you
might do passively

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:38.200
with the material of
the glove to make it

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.390
less likely that it would slip?

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:41.265
You know what I mean?

01:33:41.265 --> 01:33:43.350
You have a very active
solution right now

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:47.382
that depends on sensors and
electronics and batteries.

01:33:47.382 --> 01:33:49.090
Are there anymore
passive things that you

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.650
might do, either with
material or with the design

01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:52.157
of the glove, or
have you thought

01:33:52.157 --> 01:33:53.365
about that part of the space?

01:33:57.739 --> 01:33:59.530
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: So
one of the big things

01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:02.540
we thought about was when we
get the material for designing

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.230
the glove, to have
like sort of grip.

01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:06.800
So certain gloves do
come with like rubber

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.036
on the outside of them
to have more grip,

01:34:09.036 --> 01:34:10.660
and we thought that
something like this

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.350
would also be able
to help her generally

01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:14.240
keep her grip on
slippery objects,

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.520
especially with the glove on.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.190
So that's one example
of a passive solution.

01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:21.540
We did think of entirely passive
solutions at the beginning,

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.249
like having some sort
of exoskeleton that

01:34:23.249 --> 01:34:25.290
would like hold her group
in place that she could

01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:26.750
lock into place or something.

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:30.890
But we figured that then
she'd be having to manipulate

01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:32.430
the device too much herself.

01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:34.780
And so we went with the more
active solution in general.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.240
But yes, smaller passive
things, like the rubber grips

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.390
and having some fingers open
so that she has better grip,

01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:42.967
will hopefully help her
with her grip anyways.

01:34:42.967 --> 01:34:44.550
VYNNIE KONG: And we
actually found out

01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:47.740
that a lot of her problems don't
come from muscular strength.

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.150
So it's not that she can't
physically lift the plate.

01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:53.850
It's just that she can't feel
how hard she's gripping it.

01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:56.450
So balancing it becomes a
bit of an issue, for example.

01:35:01.715 --> 01:35:03.840
PROFESSOR 5: Well, following
on what you just said,

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.506
did you think of any
sort of way of giving

01:35:06.506 --> 01:35:08.390
maybe auditory
feedback or some way

01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:13.450
to in terms of the gripping,
like is there a user interface

01:35:13.450 --> 01:35:14.660
aspect to this?

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.970
ROBERT LUO : Right, so some
things we think about is

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:20.710
so after having a sensors, we
want to be able to quantify her

01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:21.210
grip.

01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:24.020
And so some things
we are thinking about

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.350
is we can test how much of a
grip she exercises on an object

01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:30.550
initially, and then set
that as a threshold.

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:34.110
And whenever the grip comes down
to 50% of the original grip,

01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:36.740
then that's the threshold
we think of warning her.

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.990
And then and then the
ways of warning her

01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:42.080
include having a beeping
sound, or it vibrates

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.925
so she will be notified.

01:35:44.925 --> 01:35:47.571
PROFESSOR 5: Did you
think about cost?

01:35:47.571 --> 01:35:49.070
Did you say cost,
like what it would

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:52.240
cost to make one of these
in quantity or something?

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.950
ROBERT LUO : Oh, right, so we
already have the sensors ready.

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.660
So we already got the sensors,
so they were not too expensive.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.750
They were $60, $70.

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:03.250
And then we know are on
the stage of figuring out

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:05.910
how the circuits would work,
and we would approach it

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:08.840
by making it on a
breadboard first,

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.360
then thinking of whether
it's possible to make

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.310
this circuits into a
smaller circuit board

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:15.700
and attaching it to the glove.

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.450
And then the glove
itself shouldn't really

01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:20.115
be that expensive.

01:36:20.115 --> 01:36:22.240
PROFESSOR 5: Any quick
questions from the audience?

01:36:25.356 --> 01:36:27.037
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:36:27.037 --> 01:36:28.078
VYNNIE KONG: We have not.

01:36:28.078 --> 01:36:28.620
What is that?

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.661
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's like
thread that's in buckets,

01:36:30.661 --> 01:36:32.410
so it's like a wire,
but it's thread.

01:36:32.410 --> 01:36:33.243
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:36:35.866 --> 01:36:37.740
SHRUTHI NARAYANAN: Yeah,
I guess like once we

01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.600
have the sensors
attached inside the glove

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.885
to get it to the output,
we could use that.

01:36:41.885 --> 01:36:43.050
Thank you for the idea.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.130
STUDENT 1: Hi,
we're team Barbara.

01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:54.080
So this is Barbara.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.430
She has been a
teacher for 29 years,

01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:59.910
but she had to retire
early because she has PLS.

01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:02.350
So PLS is kind of like ALS.

01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:05.420
It's a disease where
your muscles get weaker.

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.700
And right now she is living in
the Leonard Florence Center,

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.940
and she really
values independence.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:15.110
And as of right now, she has
fine motor skills in her hands,

01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:18.230
but is slowly losing
her strength, especially

01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:20.240
in her left hand
because she does

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.840
a lot of crocheting during
her free time, which keeps

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:27.650
her right hand more flexible.

01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:30.510
And she's also constrained
to a wheelchair,

01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:33.500
and her speech is
sometimes unclear

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.808
because the muscles in her
face are also weakening.

01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:44.060
So some of the activities
that she has trouble with

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.670
is opening and closing
the door in her room.

01:37:46.670 --> 01:37:49.170
This is her door.

01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:53.860
And it's difficult for because
the door is very heavy,

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:57.850
and also it does not swing open.

01:37:57.850 --> 01:38:00.790
When she's trying to open
it, it stays where you

01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:03.370
leave it and locks in place.

01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:05.820
Also, because her
wheelchair gets in the way

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:08.050
because the door
opens towards her,

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.549
so she has to open
it a little bit.

01:38:09.549 --> 01:38:11.340
scoot her chair back,
and then open it some

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.280
more, which makes
it very difficult.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.460
Another problem that
she has is turning off

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.360
the lights before she goes
to sleep because once she's

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.680
in bed, it's very
difficult for her to get up

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.680
and turn off the lights.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:29.450
Currently, she has an
iPhone, and on her iPhone,

01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:31.150
these are some of
the apps that she

01:38:31.150 --> 01:38:34.100
uses for assistive technology.

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.100
The ones on the
bottom here, some

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.900
are for speaking because
her speech is unclear.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.930
So, for example, there's one
for her to say yes or no,

01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:45.440
and some of them where
she can type in phrases,

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.530
and it'll speak it for her.

01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:51.590
Or there's also apps for her
to indicate the amount of pain

01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:53.020
she has right now.

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:55.450
She also recently
got an iPad, but she

01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:57.870
hasn't been using it that
much because it's heavy.

01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:59.890
But she has no
assistive technology

01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:02.360
that she uses currently
for opening the door

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.480
or turning out the lights.

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:10.080
So some of the context is
that her room is right next

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.390
to the dining area,
so sometimes there's

01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:14.560
a lot of noise that bothers her.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.520
Also, she has
concern for privacy

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.580
because since the door
is so hard to open,

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.830
she leaves it open
most of the time.

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:23.770
And right now, the staff at
the Leonard Florence Center

01:39:23.770 --> 01:39:25.860
has to open and close
the door for every day

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.740
and turn on and off the lights.

01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:32.610
And although she didn't ask
for a solution for her voice

01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:34.830
problem, she did
tell us that this

01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.230
is a major concern for her.

01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:40.230
So based on my
contextual inquiry,

01:39:40.230 --> 01:39:42.440
we decided on our
project, which is

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.802
to automate the door
because she really

01:39:44.802 --> 01:39:47.260
wants to have the independence
to be able to open and close

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.310
the door by herself, and also
have privacy in her room,

01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:53.030
and she doesn't currently
have any assistive technology

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.830
for that.

01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:56.230
And that is like the most
difficult problem for her right

01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:56.730
now.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:03.140
So for success metrics we think
the best possible solution

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.270
would be for her to
have an app on her phone

01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:08.190
that she would just be able
to click or some sensors,

01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:11.920
so she doesn't have to
actually opened the door.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.896
And a less successful
solution would be for her

01:40:14.896 --> 01:40:18.440
to press a button and
something that would just

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.690
be able to reduce the
amount of effort she needs

01:40:20.690 --> 01:40:23.517
is to have her pull something
that would then open the door,

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.350
instead of actually
opening the door itself.

01:40:27.402 --> 01:40:29.110
STUDENT 2: So next
we're going to explain

01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:33.167
a little bit about our
ideation process for this door.

01:40:33.167 --> 01:40:34.750
So we're going to
start by showing you

01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:39.460
a video of our design process
and to give you a bit of sense.

independent the best you can.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.950
I like the attitude.

Hello, my name is
Barbara [INAUDIBLE].

01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:01.040
I was a teacher for 29
years before I got sick.

01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:05.525
I had to retire early.

01:41:05.525 --> 01:41:06.562
I miss the kids.

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:11.680
I miss the nonsense.

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.840
-What are your typical
daily activities?

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.520
-Some days Bingo.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.348
I never played Bingo
before I came here.

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:27.440
It's to socialize more.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.092
I struggle with the door
since my room is so small.

01:41:32.092 --> 01:41:36.570
I'm in my own way
with the chair,

01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:41.005
so to make it so it's easier
without crashing into the door.

-I can open and close
it without touching it.

have the technology.

Mine doesn't.

-So it's easy to open it.

01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:18.905
But then once it's not moving,
it's hard to do either.

01:42:18.905 --> 01:42:20.600
Also, like the door
will not swing open,

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.651
so you can't just
push it because it

01:42:21.651 --> 01:42:22.567
doesn't let it happen.

01:42:22.567 --> 01:42:24.910
It locks itself.

01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:28.320
-Then we began our
design process,

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.570
which consisted of
numerous measurements

01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:32.680
on everything related
to Barbara's door.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.900
We then considered whether
we wanted an app, button,

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.570
or mechanical solution and
started our ideation process.

01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:46.720
These ranged from an
automatic collapsible door

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:54.890
that opens with a pulley,
to a mechanical lever

01:42:54.890 --> 01:43:02.390
that closes the door
when you push on it,

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:06.082
as well as a pulley system that
opens and closes the door when

01:43:06.082 --> 01:43:07.275
you pull on the string.

01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:16.330
And lastly, we considered an
automatic soundproof curtain

01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:21.930
system which would open with a
touch of a button from pulleys.

01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:24.840
We decided to pursue
the curtain idea,

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.930
and are now beginning to
prototype over and over

01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:32.030
and over again until we create
the perfect automatic door.

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.255
STUDENT 2: So that's just an
overview of our design process.

01:43:42.255 --> 01:43:44.630
So I'm going to take you
through the specifics of it now.

01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:50.542
So these are the three idea that
we were pursuing for the door.

01:43:50.542 --> 01:43:52.000
And the first thing
that we did was

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.876
weigh the pros and cons
of each possibility.

01:43:55.876 --> 01:43:57.500
So with the automatic
collapsible door,

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.680
we thought that this would
serve as a good alternative

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.200
because it's rigid,
so it does still

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.550
have the appearance of a door.

01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:05.340
But some issues we
had with is that it

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.260
was hard to find the parts
to create a rigid collapsible

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:13.220
door that was cheap and
easy to put together.

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:16.430
Next, we considered automatic
curtains, which we thought

01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.430
would be very easy to
implement and test,

01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:21.580
and we get soundproof
curtains that could

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.180
implement that part of it.

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:26.510
But one issue is that it
might not be door-like enough

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.860
and fit in with like the norms
of what doors simply look like,

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.850
and the pulley system
could get stuck as well.

01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:36.370
Lastly, we considered a
mechanical lever and pulley

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:40.180
system, so this would
alter the door itself,

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.990
so we wouldn't have
any extra parts,

01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:45.920
and it should make the whole
thing flow a little bit more

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.420
smoothly.

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:47.878
But it's kind of
hard to implement,

01:44:47.878 --> 01:44:51.465
as we are not mechanical
engineering students.

01:44:51.465 --> 01:44:53.340
So we decided to go with
the middle approach,

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:57.822
as it is very easy to
test and prototype.

01:44:57.822 --> 01:44:59.780
But when we went to the
Leonard Florence Center

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.860
with our idea to see if
there were any issues,

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.760
we found that there were a lot.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.340
One of the first ones is
that they consider curtains

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:11.700
a major fire hazard because
she could get stuck,

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.650
or the curtains could get in the
way of her leaving or entering

01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.210
her room.

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:21.220
They also told is that this
idea must be fail proof.

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.600
So if there were a fire, the
door must be able to close,

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.529
and nothing should
inhibit its way.

01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:29.320
So we tried to brainstorm
another solution,

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.840
and decided to go with
our mechanical approach.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.440
But there we found
that if we connected it

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:41.210
with the fire alarm system,
we could get our pulley

01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:45.035
to dislodge from the door if
the fire alarm system goes off.

01:45:45.035 --> 01:45:46.410
And then this
would hopefully not

01:45:46.410 --> 01:45:48.610
in impede with the
door's mechanism

01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:50.860
when there is a fire alarm.

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:55.160
But still they raised the
problems of a fire hazard, that

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.270
must be fail proof, and
they also did not really

01:45:57.270 --> 01:46:00.910
understand how we would
connect our new door system

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:03.210
to the main system itself.

01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:06.030
And if we were to go through the
peak system that is currently

01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:09.640
at the Leonard Florence
Center, it's super expensive.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.680
And so we found it this idea
is not very feasible for us.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.790
So this led us to work into
her secondary problem, which

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:20.100
is light automation.

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:24.680
So the reason why this was her
secondary preferences it's she,

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.920
with third condition
of PLS, she actually

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:30.030
can't get up from her bed to
shut off the light before she

01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.920
goes to bed.

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.980
So she has to call
a nurse to do so.

01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.900
So this impedes on
her independence.

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.350
This happens every day.

01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:39.510
So this would be a problem
that if we could solve,

01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:42.570
it would help
frequently, so she'd

01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:45.100
be able to have
very good use of it.

01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:46.950
It's not like a
one-case scenario.

01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:49.810
And this will also help her
because in the future, when

01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:51.620
she is in a
wheelchair, she may not

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.890
be able to have the
strength to reach up

01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:55.735
to the light to switch.

01:46:55.735 --> 01:46:59.810
Whereas with an application,
she could, since PLS

01:46:59.810 --> 01:47:00.530
is progressive.

01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:04.100
So as a condition worsens
this would be one of the this

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.540
will be a possible solution
that can like at least

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.540
allow her to shut off the
light when she wants to,

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:13.040
and she's not in her bed
for a longer period of time.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:23.170
So different processes
we thought of doing this,

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:24.820
we thought of using X10.

01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:28.150
So while we were
searching, we found X10,

01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:33.380
so it's possible through Wi-Fi
to send a signal to the X10

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.580
transceiver.

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.970
That sends a message
to the outlet

01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:40.250
through electricity, some
sort of like Morse code

01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:43.780
for electricity kind of, to
give an idea of what it's doing.

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.670
And then that can be used
to turn on or off the light.

01:47:46.670 --> 01:47:50.020
So the process would be a
little straight forward,

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.230
since the products
are available.

01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:54.270
It would just be
us connecting them,

01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:57.880
and then the actual
application already exists.

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.960
And the price tag
was about $100.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.330
Another idea we thought
of was a more hands

01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:07.750
on approach of getting in
Arduino to send a radio

01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:09.600
frequency signal to the light.

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.440
We could buy the light that have
as a receiver for this radio

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.020
frequency signal.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.370
So then we would basically
send a Bluetooth signal

01:48:18.370 --> 01:48:23.130
from her phone to the
Arduino [? BLE ?] shield,

01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:25.750
and then that would
send the signal

01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:27.650
to the corresponding light.

01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:29.820
So this was an option
that we could also

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.820
have that basically
we just have to have

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:36.910
multiple receivers, radio
frequency receivers that

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:38.600
are on the bottom
right hand corner.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.330
So then she could
send different signals

01:48:40.330 --> 01:48:43.790
from her phone to control each
and every light independently.

01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:45.530
So it was an approach
we thought of.

01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:48.094
The price tag on
it was about $70

01:48:48.094 --> 01:48:50.510
because we would have to have
the [? BLE ?] shield as well

01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:51.640
as the Arduino.

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:54.150
And then the outlet,
the receiver,

01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:55.490
was also a little bit of cash.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.720
So then after that
we like started

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:08.040
trying to come up with how
we were going to do this.

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.210
And our next idea was WeMo.

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.520
We saw this online.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.280
Basically, they have
their own solution for it.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.377
Basically, you can connect
to it through an application

01:49:17.377 --> 01:49:18.710
that they already have provided.

01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:22.080
The application is free, and
the product actually costs $41.

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:26.740
So we thought of having this
implemented in her system

01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:30.200
and then possibly expanding
the SDK for the application

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.270
so that she could have
an easier time using it,

01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:36.117
and then have it
basically tailored to her

01:49:36.117 --> 01:49:38.075
so that she only had to
look at the application

01:49:38.075 --> 01:49:43.465
and touch larger buttons
since the buttons are

01:49:43.465 --> 01:49:46.560
a little smaller
than we would hope.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.450
Possible next steps
is what I just

01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:51.490
said, where we expand
an application based

01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:55.730
off the SDK for WeMo and make
that app available for her.

01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:59.850
Or if this ends up being a
solution right of the shell,

01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:02.730
then we could possibly
taken an avenue where

01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:05.730
after fixing this light
problem with WeMo,

01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:08.770
go into the voice
applications so try and see

01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:10.670
if we can tailor voice
application for her.

01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:17.150
So our timeline is by
the end of October,

01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:19.045
we hope to have WeMo installed.

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:21.230
The first half of
November we hope

01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:25.940
to prototype the like UI
for either the voice app,

01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:29.110
also, possibly, if
necessary, the light app.

01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:32.690
Second half, we would like
to have this app done in iOS.

01:50:32.690 --> 01:50:35.370
The reason for prototyping
[INAUDIBLE] it's faster,

01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:37.625
and we can get a lot of
the UI feel really quickly.

01:50:37.625 --> 01:50:39.000
And then after
that we would just

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.920
keep testing and iterating
until we have a product that

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.920
fits Barbara's needs.

01:50:47.597 --> 01:50:48.180
Any questions?

01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:55.080
PROFESSOR 1: Could you
say a bit about how

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.371
you're going to divide the
work among the three of you?

01:50:57.371 --> 01:51:02.190
STUDENT 3: OK, so in terms
of the work for the door,

01:51:02.190 --> 01:51:04.050
we've been all
going to the center

01:51:04.050 --> 01:51:05.850
to speak with as many
people as possible.

01:51:05.850 --> 01:51:07.760
So for the time
being, it's been a lot

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:11.360
of contextual inquiry and a lot
like designing all together.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.800
But in terms of the next
steps for installing the WeMo,

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.780
we were going to go
to the center together

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:21.840
and while two of
the members were

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.260
going to be working on
installing this in the room,

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:26.570
we were also going to continue
to ask about the door,

01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:28.589
we are pushing towards
like at least speaking

01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:30.630
to a lot of members in
the center about the door,

01:51:30.630 --> 01:51:32.338
since that is an issue
that we would hope

01:51:32.338 --> 01:51:34.330
would be solved in the future.

01:51:34.330 --> 01:51:37.110
After that is installed, the
dividing the actual application

01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:42.200
process, so since we,
as a team, don't all

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.840
have like skills in
App Inventor and iOS,

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.960
we were going to divide
up so that we would end up

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.610
having some of the base
code that would definitely

01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:51.870
be necessary for iOS built
right from the beginning

01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:54.460
while the UI is being
prototyping in App Inventor.

01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.740
So in terms of
like team specific,

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:00.080
it would be two members
working on the iOS application,

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.650
while one member just
continually prototypes

01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:05.170
the ideas that the team comes
up with in App Inventory

01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:07.210
to like give a feel for it.

01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:11.100
We would always go as a team
to show this to Barbara.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:14.840
And then once the App
Inventor UI decision is made,

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:16.730
we would all be
working on the iOS apps

01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:18.813
since that's going to be
the majority of the part.

01:52:21.850 --> 01:52:24.567
Any other questions?

01:52:24.567 --> 01:52:26.025
PROFESSOR 5: So
basically, the door

01:52:26.025 --> 01:52:27.592
is sort of too
hard is basically--

01:52:27.592 --> 01:52:28.550
it's just not workable?

01:52:29.714 --> 01:52:31.880
STUDENT 2: There a lot of
regulations with the door.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.546
We'd have to get it
approved by the fire

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.880
department, the public health
department, and the people

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.504
at the center, a lot
of them don't even

01:52:37.504 --> 01:52:39.680
know how it functions
and how it connects up

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.110
to like the central system
that closes all the doors when

01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:44.570
a fire alarm goes off.

01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:46.695
So it would require
a lot more research,

01:52:46.695 --> 01:52:48.570
and we're not sure if
it's feasible to finish

01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:51.560
this project in the next two
or three months that we have.

01:52:59.501 --> 01:53:01.000
JESSICA HERRING:
So we are Team Art.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:01.500
I'm Jessica.

01:53:02.055 --> 01:53:03.013
RACHEL ELLISON: Rachel.

01:53:04.009 --> 01:53:05.300
STEPHANIE CHEN : I'm Stephanie.

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.383
JESSICA HERRING: And what
we have decided to build

01:53:07.383 --> 01:53:09.340
is a power lift.

01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:11.260
So first, we're going
to introduce our client.

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:12.810
His name is Art.

01:53:12.810 --> 01:53:15.670
He is an adaptive rock
climber, a hacker, a tinkerer.

01:53:15.670 --> 01:53:19.400
He likes to build
stuff-- adapt stuff

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.150
to his specifications
and his desires,

01:53:22.150 --> 01:53:24.950
and he's a very active
member of his community.

01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:28.470
He has a girlfriend, and she
works in his hacker space

01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:30.440
at the Artisans
Asylum in Somerville,

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:33.660
which is pretty much
a hacker space, where

01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:35.850
people build stuff.

01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:39.430
However, he has T5 Asia
B Paraplegia, which

01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:41.990
is an incomplete paraplegic.

01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:45.730
So he has some sensory
function below his waist,

01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:47.910
but no motor function.

01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:51.480
In addition to this, he has
a grade 2 shoulder separation

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.209
that is not quite bad
enough to need surgery,

01:53:54.209 --> 01:53:56.500
but we do want to consider
this when making our design.

01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:01.450
We don't want to make our
mechanisms too manual.

01:54:01.450 --> 01:54:04.190
So Art wants to be able
to work on the floor.

01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:08.250
He wants to be able to get under
some of his bigger projects,

01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:11.379
like he'll lift up a wheelchair
on his lift that he's designed,

01:54:11.379 --> 01:54:12.670
and he'll want to get under it.

01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:13.910
But it's really
hard to do that when

01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:15.326
you're getting out
of a wheelchair

01:54:15.326 --> 01:54:16.880
and you can't move your legs.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.120
So, in addition to that, if you
were to fall out of his chair,

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.706
he would like to be able to
use something to get back up

01:54:22.706 --> 01:54:23.702
alone independently.

01:54:23.702 --> 01:54:27.686
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:54:47.606 --> 01:54:52.088
-Well, I'm a [INAUDIBLE] minded
person, a lot of independence.

01:54:52.088 --> 01:54:59.060
Before I got hurt
in March of 2010,

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.046
I was the person who took
care of all of our household

01:55:02.046 --> 01:55:02.546
maintenance.

01:55:02.546 --> 01:55:05.534
I did a lot of
motorcycle repair.

01:55:05.534 --> 01:55:08.024
[INAUDIBLE]

01:55:08.024 --> 01:55:12.506
Pretty much [INAUDIBLE],
I worked on it.

01:55:12.506 --> 01:55:15.010
Now, I still try to do
as much of that as I can.

01:55:15.010 --> 01:55:18.344
We're filming this at
Artisan's Asylum, which

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:21.180
is one of the world's
largest hacker spaces,

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.319
maker spaces and
collaborative workshops

01:55:23.319 --> 01:55:26.630
that anyone [INAUDIBLE].

01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:32.889
We have shops that cover an
incredibly wide range of skills

01:55:32.889 --> 01:55:33.847
and technology.

01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:42.090
What they call a T-5 Asia B,
which basically means that

01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:46.887
from about here down I
have no motor function.

01:55:46.887 --> 01:55:48.970
Because I can't get in and
out of my chair easily,

01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:51.742
I'm more or less
limited to doing things

01:55:51.742 --> 01:55:52.866
that I can sit in front of.

01:56:33.702 --> 01:56:44.658
[END PLAYBACK]

01:56:44.658 --> 01:56:47.148
JESSICA HERRING: He
is quite a character,

01:56:47.148 --> 01:56:51.230
and he's very specific
about he wants.

01:56:51.230 --> 01:56:54.170
But we figure that we can
help him out with that.

01:56:54.170 --> 01:56:56.536
So our goal is to design
something that's portable,

01:56:56.536 --> 01:56:58.240
something that's
lightweight, something

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.870
that is about the
height of his chair

01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:04.600
that he can get in and out
of and get up and down with.

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.860
So the height of the
wheelchair seat-- Art cat

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:12.230
only move about three or four
inches vertically by himself.

01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:14.690
And so we need our device
to be about the height

01:57:14.690 --> 01:57:17.400
of his wheelchair seat,
which is 22 inches tall,

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.420
but we'd also like it to be used
anywhere he wants to use it.

01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:23.520
So we originally wanted him to
be able to take it with him,

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.970
and that's still
one of our goals.

01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:28.300
We also need it to
weigh under 20 pounds.

01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:29.990
This is because he
wants his girlfriend

01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:32.365
to be able to take it to him
if he falls out of his chair

01:57:32.365 --> 01:57:34.430
and needs it or for
some other reason.

01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:36.150
His girlfriend can
only lift 20 pounds

01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:39.700
because she has a medical
condition that restricts that.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:43.170
So our major success
metric is time.

01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:44.600
A lot of these
design constraints

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.310
will make or break the project,
but the time is a variable.

01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:51.510
So we would like it to be
approximately one minute.

01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:53.780
Art wanted something a
little more like 30 seconds

01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.161
to 45 seconds, but we think
a minute would also be OK.

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.580
STEPHANIE CHEN : So after
taking these design limitations

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.510
into account, we decided to
look into products that were

01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.030
commercially available.

01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:18.340
So at first, we began looking
into commercially available

01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:19.360
medical technology.

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.350
For example, that up
there is something called

01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:23.020
an [? elk ?] emergency lift.

01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:27.510
It's probably the most
ideal out of these products

01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:30.770
for our client because it
weighs approximately five pounds

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:33.330
and it can support 1,000 pounds.

01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:37.820
The only problem with it is
that it costs $3,000 at least,

01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:42.190
and there's no guaranteed
stability if he's actually

01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:43.130
lifting in the chair.

01:58:43.130 --> 01:58:46.380
There's nothing preventing
them from falling to the side.

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.320
And just for fun,
we decided to look

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:50.886
into other types
of lifting cushions

01:58:50.886 --> 01:58:52.380
available in other industries.

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:54.980
We actually found something
called the Map Jack, which

01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:56.160
is something similar.

01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:01.680
It costs about $800, and it
can lift probably six tons--

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.330
fun fact.

01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:07.090
We then decided to look into the
idea of a scissor lift, which

01:59:07.090 --> 01:59:11.415
is a relatively prevalent
lifting mechanism.

01:59:11.415 --> 01:59:15.240
You can find it in construction
sites and warehouses and so on.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.450
The problem with that
idea is that there

01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:22.670
is a lot of friction losses
associated with scissor lifts,

01:59:22.670 --> 01:59:25.471
and considering the
fact that none of us

01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:27.729
are mechanical
engineers, we decided

01:59:27.729 --> 01:59:29.770
it would be best if we
started off with something

01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:30.580
a little simpler.

01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:34.170
And actually, if we consider
the weight of a scissor lift

01:59:34.170 --> 01:59:39.890
into account, it would certainly
weigh more than 20 pounds.

01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:44.470
We then decided to look into a
pool lift, which Art actually

01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:45.110
owns.

01:59:45.110 --> 01:59:49.160
The main issue with this idea
is that unfortunately it's

01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:55.060
stationary, and we require a
very powerful linear actuator,

01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:56.780
so we decided to
scrap those ideas.

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:02.070
One idea that we
actually came across

02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:06.020
is something similar to
one of those stair lifts.

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:07.720
It's essentially a sliding lift.

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:10.440
It'll bring someone who's not
capable of going to upstairs

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:14.390
from the bottom to the
top of their staircase.

02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:17.400
And Art was actually in
preference of this idea.

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:22.960
As you can see, based
on the lower sketch,

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.890
it appears to be
relatively light design.

02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:28.210
And it's incredibly portable
because it essentially

02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:30.450
looked like a tripod.

02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:34.480
And unfortunately, the
major disadvantages of this

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:40.200
is we, again, have to deal
with a lot of friction losses,

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.920
and we also have
to include a bunch

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.140
of fail safes such
as hand brakes,

02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:48.630
just to ensure that he doesn't
accidentally slide down when

02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:52.921
he's near the top of the ramp.

02:00:52.921 --> 02:00:54.420
And for this design
we actually need

02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:57.180
a very specialized motor,
something that's low speed

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:59.790
and high in torque.

02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:06.300
One idea that-- so
this is actually our

02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:08.280
currently most worked done idea.

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.550
It's a screw lift essentially.

02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:15.550
And that is a smaller
scale prototype.

02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:19.070
Based on this drawing, you
can see that we essentially

02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:23.390
take multiple 80-20
rods and arrange them

02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:26.310
in that sort of fashion, so
you have one rod on this side

02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:30.210
and one rod on the other, where
there's a seat in the middle.

02:01:30.210 --> 02:01:32.990
And in between those two
rods, and what's holding up

02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:34.770
the chair, is a threaded rod.

02:01:34.770 --> 02:01:37.650
So essentially we'd
be using either

02:01:37.650 --> 02:01:41.220
a drill motor or
any sort of motor

02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:45.880
to twist that threaded
rod to lift or to cause

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.290
the chair to ascend or descend.

02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.780
The major advantage
to this is it

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:52.977
can be designed to
be rather foldable,

02:01:52.977 --> 02:01:54.810
and we don't have to
build in any fail safes

02:01:54.810 --> 02:01:57.440
because we're dealing
with a threaded rod.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.500
And actually, the motors
required for this design

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.600
are also relatively cheaper.

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.490
But the major
disadvantages to this idea,

02:02:06.490 --> 02:02:10.360
in particular, is that we have
to work with multiple parts,

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:14.190
and this could be a
potentially heavy idea.

02:02:17.690 --> 02:02:21.350
So here is actually a
video of the prototype.

02:02:53.105 --> 02:02:54.980
RACHEL ELLISON: So this
showing it does move.

02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:56.105
This me turning it by hand.

02:02:56.105 --> 02:03:01.100
And so if you're turning
it at maybe 100, 150,

02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.520
it would be moving a lot faster.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.260
The [INAUDIBLE] we're looking
at are eight turns per inch.

02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:13.102
So at 22 inches, we are
looking at about 200 turns.

02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:21.480
So the next steps in
our process really

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.780
are to expand on these
two ideas and decide

02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:28.110
which design to pursue.

02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:30.090
Stephanie is handing
around now 80-20

02:03:30.090 --> 02:03:33.420
rod, which is the basis
of our sliding mechanism.

02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:35.350
And really what
we're trying to do

02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:36.970
is understand what
parts we'll be

02:03:36.970 --> 02:03:39.980
able to get within
our budget constraints

02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:43.180
and which one will
provide a lighter weight

02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.980
design that fits more of
our design specifications.

02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:48.610
We'd like it to be full
scale, our next prototype,

02:03:48.610 --> 02:03:52.780
and we're going to prioritize
durability and sturdiness.

02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:56.760
After that, we'd like to make
a more polished prototype

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.250
of our final idea.

02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:00.780
We'd like this one to fold
up to be transportable

02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.744
and to be within our
weight specifications.

02:04:02.744 --> 02:04:04.160
For our first
prototype, we're not

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.564
going to worry so
much about that.

02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:08.230
We'd like to try to
optimize the lifting

02:04:08.230 --> 02:04:10.430
time and the speed at
which the motor turns

02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:12.012
to lift Art up and down.

02:04:12.012 --> 02:04:14.220
And finally, we'd like to
think about the feasibility

02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.000
of mass production
of this device

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.440
and what is going into it
and whether those things will

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.460
be available for other users.

02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:24.851
And so our projected costs
with the slider design

02:04:24.851 --> 02:04:26.600
which is a little bit
more expensive we're

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.380
going to need a linear bearing
to slide up and down the broad

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:32.040
with hand brake built
in so that it will be

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.000
stable at the top of the ramp.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.060
And that's about $65.

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:38.030
For a high torque,
low speed motor,

02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:41.870
those are pretty pricey
and come at $60 to $80 new.

02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:44.320
We've been looking into
scavenging this part

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:46.590
to try to cut down costs.

02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:49.020
We'll also need other parts,
such as hinges and legs,

02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.190
so that'll fold up.

02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:53.840
For the screw lift
design, we're looking

02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:59.230
at using a threaded rod,
and this Acme thread design

02:04:59.230 --> 02:05:01.590
is a special kind of threading
designed to bear weight

02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:05.330
and not snag so that we can turn
it hopefully at higher speeds.

02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:07.520
We'll also need a low
torque, higher speed motor.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:09.019
Those will be
significantly cheaper,

02:05:09.019 --> 02:05:12.266
and actually we have several
of those on hand right now.

02:05:12.266 --> 02:05:13.640
And the rest of
the lift is going

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:16.060
to be aluminum or
wooden parts which can

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:18.480
come from the hardware store.

02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:21.260
So with that, I'd like to
thank teammates Jessica, who's

02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:23.850
been in charge of
videotaping our meetings

02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:27.340
and edited both the lovely
videos you saw earlier,

02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:29.580
Stephanie, who's been
heading up our prototyping

02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:33.120
and is going to be
doing a lot of stuff

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.696
with building in
the next few weeks,

02:05:34.696 --> 02:05:36.320
and then I'm not
going to thank myself,

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.920
but I've been doing a lot of
the interviewing and client

02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:40.760
communication.

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:43.147
We'd also like to give a
special thanks to Don Fredette

02:05:43.147 --> 02:05:44.730
at The Boston House,
who's provided us

02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:48.180
with a lot of guidance,
parts, moral support, Joseph

02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.360
Parse, in the Department
of Material Science

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:52.860
and Engineering, who helped
us figure out the screw lift

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:55.790
design and what parts
we'd need to make it work,

02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:58.200
and finally our client
himself has helped us

02:05:58.200 --> 02:06:01.610
a lot with the design
feasibility and sourcing parts,

02:06:01.610 --> 02:06:04.110
and since he works
at this hacker space,

02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:06.250
he's also volunteered to
help us put it together,

02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:08.625
and, of course, the PPAT staff
makes this class possible.

02:06:10.892 --> 02:06:11.475
Any questions?

02:06:15.343 --> 02:06:17.634
PROFESSOR 4: We have about
three minutes for questions.

02:06:20.198 --> 02:06:22.406
PROFESSOR 4: Have you looked
at Kiva Systems, a robot

02:06:22.406 --> 02:06:23.455
for warehouse automation?

02:06:23.455 --> 02:06:25.867
They were bought
for $600 million

02:06:25.867 --> 02:06:27.620
by Amazon a couple years ago.

02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:30.080
But they have a lift, a
clever lift mechanism.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:33.897
Their founder talked to
[? Mickey ?] last week.

02:06:33.897 --> 02:06:35.480
Maybe I can give you
a pointer or two.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:36.710
They have a clever design.

02:06:36.710 --> 02:06:37.543
Maybe it's the same.

02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:43.975
But I do worry about the overall
electromechanical robustness.

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:50.200
Have you thought about
how the whole-- the power,

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:54.587
the connectors, the control
everything puts together?

02:06:54.587 --> 02:06:56.920
RACHEL ELLISON: We should
have said something about this

02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:59.350
during the presentation,
but Art has

02:06:59.350 --> 02:07:03.870
hacked into 24 volt
battery system in his chair

02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.910
and has an Anderson
volt connector that we

02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:07.325
can use to power our devices.

02:07:07.325 --> 02:07:10.917
PROFESSOR 4: So you'll connect
in to the wheelchair battery.

02:07:10.917 --> 02:07:13.250
PROFESSOR 6: So that partly
answered one of my question.

02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.750
I had two.

02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:18.480
One, what equipment does Art
use at makers space, and two,

02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:22.330
has he adapted or hacked
any of his existing?

02:07:22.330 --> 02:07:24.213
So yes, he has hacked
his wheelchair.

02:07:24.213 --> 02:07:26.546
JESSICA HERRING: He does that
quite frequently actually.

02:07:26.546 --> 02:07:28.157
He replaces his joystick.

02:07:28.157 --> 02:07:35.552
He [INAUDIBLE] adjust the
sensitivity for [INAUDIBLE].

02:07:35.552 --> 02:07:39.706
RACHEL ELLISON: I think
he uses the [INAUDIBLE],

02:07:39.706 --> 02:07:42.289
and he's built this foot peddle
to help him use variable speed

02:07:42.289 --> 02:07:42.947
devices.

02:07:42.947 --> 02:07:45.732
He can't use his feet.

02:07:45.732 --> 02:07:47.190
I'm not sure
realistically how much

02:07:47.190 --> 02:07:49.410
he's going to be able to help
us with putting it together.

02:07:49.410 --> 02:07:51.493
But we thought it was
really kind that he offered,

02:07:51.493 --> 02:07:54.035
and maybe there will be things
that he's able to assist with.

02:07:54.035 --> 02:07:55.409
PROFESSOR 6:
[INAUDIBLE] it could

02:07:55.409 --> 02:07:57.860
be interesting to think about
then going forward, even

02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.890
beyond the class, how
do you design this

02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:02.590
so that he can
continue tinkering

02:08:02.590 --> 02:08:04.510
with it after the
semester is done,

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.129
if he's already in
a position and is

02:08:06.129 --> 02:08:07.170
interested in doing that.

02:08:07.170 --> 02:08:07.711
That's great.

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.280
PROFESSOR 1: So this is
interesting in the sense

02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:14.260
that he's intentionally
on the ground, right?

02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:17.670
You're not trying to
recover from fall,

02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:21.600
which I think is where many
of the other assistive devices

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.460
are thinking about.

02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.400
I want to actually probe
on this one minute time

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:30.600
because if he's intentionally
getting on the ground,

02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:36.240
he's maybe planning
to get back up,

02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:38.890
and he might do it, in fact,
frequently-- getting under,

02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:41.370
getting back in the chair to
go somewhere else for a tool,

02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:44.570
then going back and
getting under again.

02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:47.370
Does the one minute that you're
talking about, is that just

02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:50.520
measuring the time that
it takes like the motor

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.030
to propel him up to
wheelchair height,

02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:57.523
or are we talking about the time
to set it all up, get on it,

02:08:57.523 --> 02:09:00.036
as well as move up?

02:09:00.036 --> 02:09:04.244
STEPHANIE CHEN : That's the
time he wants to spend actually

02:09:04.244 --> 02:09:06.160
maneuvering himself on
the floor to his chair.

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.940
So we haven't actually taken
into consideration setup time,

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:14.160
though I guess that's
another thing we can add in.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:16.510
But, again, that's going
to depend on the design

02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:18.116
we choose, but some
may be, I guess,

02:09:18.116 --> 02:09:21.497
modular in the sense that
it may take some [INAUDIBLE]

02:09:21.497 --> 02:09:25.828
apart and actually have to
assemble the entire apparatus.

02:09:25.828 --> 02:09:28.574
But for now, we're just
focusing on the time length

02:09:28.574 --> 02:09:29.990
between him getting
from the floor

02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:32.320
to the chair or vice versa.

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.160
RACHEL ELLISON: So
another reason to favor

02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.320
this screw lift
over the slider lift

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.520
is that that's a lot more
flexibility in how fast

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:41.200
the thing goes up and down.

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.950
With a slider lift,
because so much torque

02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:46.890
is required to just
move a pulley that way,

02:09:46.890 --> 02:09:51.250
we'd be looking at-- we have a
minimum possible time of about

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.115
45 seconds.

02:09:52.115 --> 02:09:54.240
Whereas with the screw
lift, pretty much the faster

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:56.390
you turn the motor, the
faster the thing moves.

02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:58.180
And then the only
top consideration

02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.840
really is how fast we
can move it safely.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.256
We certainly don't
want to put him

02:10:02.256 --> 02:10:04.570
in risk of being
propelled off the chair

02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:07.990
or dumped onto the floor.

02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:09.705
PROFESSOR 1: I'd
encourage you to include

02:10:09.705 --> 02:10:13.165
setup time as one of
your metrics for at least

02:10:13.165 --> 02:10:13.665
[INAUDIBLE].

02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:20.110
PROFESSOR 4: OK, any final
questions or comments?

02:10:20.110 --> 02:10:23.190
All right, thank you, Team Art.

02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:24.677
And we'll jump right in.

02:10:24.677 --> 02:10:25.177
Thank you.

02:10:35.157 --> 02:10:36.150
Hi, everyone.

02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:38.690
We're team Chris.

02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:40.610
So I'll introduce ourselves.

02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:41.570
This is Arthie.

02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:43.460
She's a senior, and
she is our point

02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:45.940
of contact for the semester
with our client, who

02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.690
we'll introduce later.

02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:49.420
Next is Carolyn
right over there.

02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:52.640
She is also a senior,
and she is the person

02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:55.010
in charge of keeping us on
task during our meetings,

02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:58.240
make sure focused, and make sure
that we're following our goals

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:01.040
and aiming for
goals every meeting.

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.320
PHOEBE: Next, we have
Dirk, who's a junior,

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.180
and he is our main
scribe for the semester.

02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:07.680
And then there's me, Phoebe.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:11.750
I'm the main photographer and
videographer for this semester.

02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:14.460
And, of course, our most
important member of the team

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:15.610
is Chris.

02:11:15.610 --> 02:11:18.790
He is a first year MBA
student at Boston College.

02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:22.790
He loves to read, blog,
and he loves baseball.

02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:25.340
So he has this rare
condition called

02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:29.570
Miyoshi Myopathy, which is a
progressive muscular dystrophy

02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:30.360
condition.

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:32.917
So he can only walk
short distances

02:11:32.917 --> 02:11:34.667
and can only carry a
small load at a time.

02:11:41.274 --> 02:11:42.690
STUDENT 4: The
activity that Chris

02:11:42.690 --> 02:11:44.340
would like us to
help him with is just

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:46.750
as daily movements
throughout the world.

02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:49.540
Since he uses forearm
crutches and a scooter,

02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:53.040
he needs place that don't have
stairs and elevators to get

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.070
around.

02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:56.860
Currently, when he
wants to go anywhere,

02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.730
he has to research
that place online.

02:11:58.730 --> 02:12:01.550
He uses Google Maps,
and he uses Yelp.

02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:03.430
Yelp has a little
bit of information.

02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:08.870
But really what he uses is the
Google Maps Street View feature

02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:11.080
because he can actually
see where he can get up

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:13.530
onto a sidewalk
or the front door,

02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:16.960
if there's stairs up to the
door and things like that.

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.480
If he can't get
enough information

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:20.360
from online resources,
sometimes he

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.630
can call the building,
the restaurant, whatever

02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:24.390
he wants to do, and
they can give him

02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:26.130
some more information that way.

02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:29.280
On campus, he primarily uses
the disabilities office,

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.010
and oftentimes he
has to go in and talk

02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:33.200
to them because there's
not very much information

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.450
on their website.

02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:36.280
And can you go back?

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:39.000
One thing that's really hard
about some of these things,

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.630
except for the phone
call, of course,

02:12:40.630 --> 02:12:43.129
is that he doesn't know what's
going on inside the building.

02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:47.810
He can't see that on
a virtual application.

02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:51.550
So we've decided he needs this
in everywhere that he goes,

02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:53.490
but we've decided for
the scope of the class

02:12:53.490 --> 02:12:56.870
to focus on his school
and Boston College.

02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:58.860
Particularly, we're
starting with the building

02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:01.550
that he uses every day,
which is Fulton Hall.

02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:04.550
One thing about Boston College
is that it's very hilly.

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:07.400
So for Chris, that's really
difficult. Some of the paths

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:10.810
are sort of ramps up the
hills, but they're very steep,

02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:13.760
which can be difficult for
his chair and also scary.

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:16.816
If he's going down, he
might not be able to stop.

02:13:16.816 --> 02:13:18.940
And there's a lot of stairs
on some of these paths.

02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:21.480
So actually he needs to go
through buildings sometimes

02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.380
and use elevators
within the buildings

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:25.000
to get from a lower
level of campus

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.190
to a higher level or vice versa.

02:13:27.190 --> 02:13:28.930
And then he's a
very busy students.

02:13:28.930 --> 02:13:31.560
So if he needs a route
like that that's not easy

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.620
for him to see online,
he might take a long time

02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.940
to get to his meetings
or his classes,

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:37.530
and that's a problem for him.

02:13:37.530 --> 02:13:40.130
And the other thing is
students on campus don't really

02:13:40.130 --> 02:13:42.790
know these routes, and
they're also very busy,

02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:45.490
so it's hard for them to
help him out sometimes.

02:13:45.490 --> 02:13:47.550
So our goal is to
take the things

02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:52.440
that he uses right now-- Google,
Yelp, knowing about stairs,

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.270
and just going out
trial and error,

02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:57.470
and finding these warnings
by himself-- we're

02:13:57.470 --> 02:14:00.380
trying to take that uncertainty
and bring all of these elements

02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:02.420
together into a
central application

02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.140
that he can just go to
this one place, see a map,

02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.300
and also go inside
buildings and find out

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.710
what things might be difficult.
If an elevator isn't working.

02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.810
If an automatic
door isn't working,

02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:15.420
if there happens to be something
in the middle of the hallway

02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.950
that could be in his way, or
a classroom that has stairs up

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:21.480
to the seats, so he knows
about these things in advance

02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.919
and doesn't have to deal
with that uncertainty

02:14:22.919 --> 02:14:24.127
that he deals with every day.

02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:29.460
DIRK: So Chris came
into this project having

02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:31.542
a pretty good idea of what
he wanted us to create,

02:14:31.542 --> 02:14:33.370
and that is an
application that presents

02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:37.520
him all of this information
in an easily accessible form.

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.010
So our first goal was we needed
to narrow down the scope, which

02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:43.890
we decided was Boston College.

02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:45.900
And even more than
that, we decided

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:48.610
to look at three different
tiers of information.

02:14:48.610 --> 02:14:52.347
So the first one being
at the building level.

02:14:52.347 --> 02:14:53.930
So this would entail
essentially being

02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:55.860
able to see the
entrances and exits that

02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:57.920
are accessible to
buildings, being

02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:03.750
able to see information that is
things like potholes or places

02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:07.000
like hills that are hard to
access outside of the building.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.110
The second tier is that
of the floor level,

02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:12.360
actually being able to
look into the buildings

02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:16.190
and seeing where the
locations of elevators

02:15:16.190 --> 02:15:19.650
are, if there's
stairs to get places,

02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:22.660
where the accessible
bathrooms are located.

02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:26.725
And then the third tier is
that of rooms, in particular,

02:15:26.725 --> 02:15:28.350
if there are difficult
doors to get in,

02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:30.800
if it's like a lecture
hall where the accessible

02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:33.660
seating is, which
entrances he can use,

02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:37.700
and being able to present all
of that in a tiered format.

02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:40.030
So for our goals, we
want to definitely

02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:43.250
be able to do the first
and the second level.

02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:44.660
We think those
are both feasible.

02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:49.350
We're hoping to get to
the third tier as well.

02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:52.310
Beyond that, there are
two different aspects

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:55.570
the application, that being
the front end and the back end.

02:15:55.570 --> 02:15:57.690
The front end is the
visual display, what

02:15:57.690 --> 02:15:59.740
Chris will actually be using.

02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:04.050
And the back end is where
this data that is being

02:16:04.050 --> 02:16:06.350
displayed actually comes from.

02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:08.230
Now, the interesting
aspect of this project

02:16:08.230 --> 02:16:12.120
is that because it
is navigation-based,

02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:15.180
it's based on buildings and
wherever Chris wants to go,

02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:20.930
ultimately his vision is to have
this available for everywhere

02:16:20.930 --> 02:16:22.120
he wants to go.

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.836
Obviously, that's not all
feasible for the scope

02:16:24.836 --> 02:16:26.090
of this project.

02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:28.790
But we really want to have
some sort of method built

02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:33.510
in that allows us to
expand to future locations

02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:35.780
and be able to bring
in different locations

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:37.910
to this application.

02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:42.510
So we want to, alongside
the front end on display,

02:16:42.510 --> 02:16:44.770
have some sort of
method for bringing

02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:48.430
in new places and new
data into the application.

02:16:51.350 --> 02:16:53.650
As far as our actual
prototypes go,

02:16:53.650 --> 02:16:58.000
we initially started by all
four of us creating drawings

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.500
explaining how sort of we
saw this application coming

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:04.420
together, and we presented
all of these to Chris

02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:08.496
and discussed with him what
he liked about each of them,

02:17:08.496 --> 02:17:11.760
and took the best
aspects of each,

02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:16.840
and condensed them down into
a singular paper prototype.

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:22.290
So initially, he
liked the map view

02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:24.440
that showed each
of the buildings

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:27.950
with alerts for where
the entrances are

02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:31.219
and then being able
to have things pop up,

02:17:31.219 --> 02:17:34.040
such as potholes,
things outside actually

02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.730
getting to the building the
he might need to be aware of.

02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:39.860
Then, when he actually
clicked on the building,

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:45.340
it would show up a
actual floor plan,

02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.620
being able to look at different
floors within the building.

02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:53.000
He liked the floor plan because
it was very easy to navigate.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.360
And on top of that, having
different notifications,

02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.629
different alerts,
potentially color-coded

02:17:59.629 --> 02:18:02.629
that show different
pieces of information,

02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:07.930
being where there are doors,
stairs, elevators, bathrooms,

02:18:07.930 --> 02:18:09.740
all this information
that he wanted to be

02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:12.124
able to see very easily marked.

02:18:12.124 --> 02:18:14.540
One of the other big things
that he wanted to make sure of

02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:18.930
is that we were presenting
just facts about the building.

02:18:18.930 --> 02:18:23.219
He wants the information to be
presented in a fairly raw form

02:18:23.219 --> 02:18:26.341
so he can then determine for
himself this is somewhere

02:18:26.341 --> 02:18:28.090
I can go, or this is
somewhere I can't go.

02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:32.440
As far as actually
creating this,

02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:39.799
we decided on a web application
because it was easier for us,

02:18:39.799 --> 02:18:42.206
as far as our skills
coming in, and it

02:18:42.206 --> 02:18:43.664
was a lot more universal.

02:18:43.664 --> 02:18:46.549
He can access it from his
phone, from this computer.

02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:51.410
And then we want to use
JavaScript Node Express as far

02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:53.722
as our languages to be
able to code that and Mongo

02:18:53.722 --> 02:18:54.847
for our database structure.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:02.940
The success metrics
that we want to use

02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:05.799
to measure this apply
to the user experience

02:19:05.799 --> 02:19:08.379
side of this project, to make
sure that Chris is getting

02:19:08.379 --> 02:19:10.080
the most benefit out
of the application

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.309
that we're creating.

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:14.049
And so one of the
metrics that we are using

02:19:14.049 --> 02:19:15.680
is the number of
clicks it's going

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.809
to take Chris to get a
specific item of information

02:19:19.809 --> 02:19:20.530
that he needs.

02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:23.080
So, for instance, starting
from the full campus map,

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.490
we want him to only have
to click three times

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:28.230
to get a specific floor
plan of a building

02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:30.559
that he wants to
go into for class.

02:19:30.559 --> 02:19:33.270
And upon that, click
only one more time

02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:35.629
to look at a specific
room in that building

02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:38.480
or the specific elevator
and to get the information

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.440
that you need to know for
that specific facility.

02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:43.250
The second metric that
we are going to use

02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:47.299
is how much time it takes for
him to gather this information.

02:19:47.299 --> 02:19:49.900
So, as we mentioned
earlier, his current methods

02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.790
are to call the
restaurant he's going to,

02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:55.540
call the disabilities office,
look at their website,

02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:57.185
and just look
through Google Maps.

02:19:57.185 --> 02:19:58.560
And so we want to
be able to time

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.220
how long it takes him to
get to find information

02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:03.500
about a specific classroom
through those ways,

02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:06.110
and then make sure that
it's about 60% less

02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:10.400
time for him to use our website
to get that same information.

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:15.800
The third metric we're using is
to allow for uncertainty-- not

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:18.290
allow for uncertainty, but to
reduce as much uncertainty as

02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:19.210
possible.

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:22.570
And so that way
within our website,

02:20:22.570 --> 02:20:25.140
he's not confused when
using it, and so we

02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:27.690
want to count how
many questions he has,

02:20:27.690 --> 02:20:32.100
and have a little help menu that
he can use to clarify things.

02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:33.810
But also just to
reduce uncertainty

02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:36.190
within all of his
travel procedures

02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:39.220
and to allow him to answer
his questions before actually

02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:41.930
going out.

02:20:41.930 --> 02:20:43.860
Now for our future
plans of what we're

02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:46.110
doing for the rest of the
semester, as Dirk mentioned,

02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:48.850
we're going to split this into
the back end and the front end.

02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:51.030
So Dirk and Caroline
are going to work on

02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:53.480
in the data aggregation
and database set up,

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:56.680
so getting all the information
that we want to display

02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.380
and then creating a database
structure that we can scope

02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:03.300
later on to add more details--
different types of buildings,

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.580
different floors,
different facilities.

02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:08.150
And Phoebe and I are going to
be working on the front end

02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:12.550
to increase the user
usability of the whole design.

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:15.660
And since Chris
wants actual facts

02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:17.350
that he can interpret
for himself,

02:21:17.350 --> 02:21:20.920
we want to have a good
balance of images and text

02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:23.140
and just make sure
that he's able to use

02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:26.360
this in a clear way.

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:30.610
The timeline for this semester
is until the end of October,

02:21:30.610 --> 02:21:33.410
we want to start
our coding process

02:21:33.410 --> 02:21:35.880
and come up with a
software prototype,

02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:37.870
and in the first
week of November,

02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:39.640
work through our
software prototype,

02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.760
and by the end of that, have
something to present to Chris

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.750
and have him actually
test it and use it

02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:46.432
so that way we can
revise and reiterate

02:21:46.432 --> 02:21:47.390
and keep going with it.

02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:49.150
And by the end of
November, we want

02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:52.150
to have our final version
that we can continue

02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:53.633
to reiterate throughout.

02:21:53.633 --> 02:21:54.216
And that's it.

02:21:54.216 --> 02:21:54.799
Any questions?

02:22:01.252 --> 02:22:03.710
PROFESSOR 5: All right, we have
four minutes for questions.

02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:05.520
Have you tried to work
with Boston College

02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:07.982
to get the actual floor
plans, like PDFs and things?

02:22:07.982 --> 02:22:09.465
Do you have all that?

02:22:09.465 --> 02:22:10.840
STUDENT 6: Yes,
so we're actually

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:13.880
in contact with Boston College
Disabilities Office right now,

02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:16.900
and they are working
with the head architect

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:17.970
to get the information.

02:22:17.970 --> 02:22:21.250
Right now we're just working
through the legal procedures

02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:22.690
of which information
he's actually

02:22:22.690 --> 02:22:25.107
allowed to give us and so
what we're allowed to display.

02:22:25.107 --> 02:22:26.690
PROFESSOR 5: MIT has
a whole database.

02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:28.690
If you ever want MIT,
I'll show you where it is.

02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.981
AUDIENCE: How does he update
it, like if a pothole is fixed.

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:43.300
DIRK: Yeah, so that's
an area that we're still

02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:44.650
trying to figure out.

02:22:44.650 --> 02:22:46.490
We've had a couple
a different ideas,

02:22:46.490 --> 02:22:49.480
one being trying to
crowdsource that out somehow,

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:52.880
having the ability
in the app for users,

02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:56.020
if they notice something,
to put that in as an alert.

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:58.790
We've thought about
contacting Boston College,

02:22:58.790 --> 02:23:01.800
like the maintenance or
the facilities office,

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.230
and if their staff
notices things,

02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:06.070
having a way to put that in.

02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:08.140
So those are a couple
ideas, and we're still

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:09.986
trying to figure out
exactly how the best

02:23:09.986 --> 02:23:10.985
way to go about that is.

02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:17.890
AUDIENCE: Excuse me,
we have a colleague

02:23:17.890 --> 02:23:21.100
in New York City that's
done, in the past,

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:24.170
maybe two or three years
ago, like a Yelp for people

02:23:24.170 --> 02:23:28.991
with disabilities for
accessibility to buildings.

02:23:28.991 --> 02:23:33.410
I'm fairly sure the
site no longer as fresh

02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:36.830
as it was during his
NYU [? ITP ?] days,

02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:39.740
but we could put you
in touch with them

02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:42.911
and see how they've updated or
how they basically populated

02:23:42.911 --> 02:23:44.464
that information.

02:23:44.464 --> 02:23:45.797
DIRK: Yeah, that would be great.

02:23:51.712 --> 02:23:53.230
CIMMY: Hi, we're Team Felicity.

02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:54.060
I'm Cimmy.

02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:54.620
This Ari.

02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:59.530
This is Becca, and
we're Team Felicity.

02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:02.930
This is our mid-semester review.

02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:05.210
Today we're going to
show you our video, talk

02:24:05.210 --> 02:24:07.530
about the HAAT
model for Felicity,

02:24:07.530 --> 02:24:10.710
our project vision, and
our accomplishments so far.

02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:13.320
So we'll start off by
showing you our video.

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.440
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.940
-Let's like together
develop a prototype

02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:21.890
of assistive technology
that you will find useful.

02:24:21.890 --> 02:24:25.400
-I have a disease called
neurofibromatosis,

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:29.370
which causes tumors to build
up in the brain and spine.

02:24:29.370 --> 02:24:32.570
I had surgery last
February in 2014

02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:35.450
to remove the tumor on this
side, which also took out

02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:41.560
my hearing nerve completely,
so now absolutely profoundly

02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:43.790
deaf on each side.

02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:48.775
I also have a tumor on my
optic nerve behind this eye.

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:54.420
My vision, I have days where
my vision is perfectly fine,

02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:56.520
and I can see
everything clearly.

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.830
Then I have other days where
things are just like really

02:24:59.830 --> 02:25:05.220
cloudy and I lose
depth perception

02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:07.850
or have trouble seeing
like walk signals,

02:25:07.850 --> 02:25:12.590
like seeing whether it's
white or red or flashing.

02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:17.460
And I had a really close call
a few weeks ago over in Fenway,

02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:20.230
where, because I
know I'm impaired,

02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:23.370
so I'm looking for the light,
and I still kind of like

02:25:23.370 --> 02:25:26.220
look because I just
don't trust anyone.

02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:31.790
But I look for the light,
and then a big truck

02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:33.600
comes right towards me.

02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:34.770
It was terrifying.

02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:37.950
I pretty much rely on like
reading people's lips,

02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:39.570
and then I'll take
out pen and paper

02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:42.390
if it's like something that's
really, really important

02:25:42.390 --> 02:25:46.280
or if I'm just
particularly tired

02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.130
and don't have the energy.

02:25:51.335 --> 02:25:53.600
I'm moving to a new
apartment on October 1st,

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.290
and they're installing flashing
smoke detectors, CO detector,

02:25:58.290 --> 02:25:59.170
and a doorbell.

02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:01.949
I've never used a
flashing doorbell before,

02:26:01.949 --> 02:26:02.990
so that will be exciting.

02:26:06.265 --> 02:26:07.140
I can feel the vibes.

02:26:16.618 --> 02:26:19.000
And I have like a
computer that I watch

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.440
captioned DVDs on sometimes.

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.495
I don't have a TV or radio.

02:26:28.530 --> 02:26:34.640
I set my phone to vibrate all
the time for when I get emails

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:36.170
and so forth.

02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:41.626
If I call you, then they'll
be a relay operator.

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:42.328
-I'm doing fine.

02:26:42.328 --> 02:26:43.078
Thanks for asking.

02:26:43.078 --> 02:26:43.578
Go ahead.

02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:53.020
-Hi, I'm Ari.

02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:54.210
Hi, I'm Cimmy.

02:26:54.210 --> 02:26:56.565
Hey, I'm Becca, and
we're Team Felicity.

02:26:56.565 --> 02:26:59.330
We've gotten to know Felicity a
lot better through our meetings

02:26:59.330 --> 02:27:01.159
and have come up with
a lot of neat ideas.

02:27:01.159 --> 02:27:02.284
We're excited to get going.

02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:11.370
[END PLAYBACK]

02:27:11.370 --> 02:27:13.515
CIMMY: So, as you
can see, Felicity

02:27:13.515 --> 02:27:17.480
has neurofibromatosis, which
is a genetic disorder that

02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:20.530
can causes tumors to
grow on nerve tissue.

02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:24.340
She had a few surgeries
to take away some tumors,

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:29.220
and due to those surgeries,
she lost a lot of her vision.

02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.880
She can use her
peripherals, and she's

02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.465
profoundly deaf on both sides.

02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.510
The activities that
Felicity likes to do

02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:42.270
are she really enjoys
walking around Boston.

02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:46.400
She also actually has routine
doctor's appointments,

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:51.340
so she's usually between
our home and the hospital.

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:55.220
And in terms of
context, Felicity

02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:57.520
lives alone at her apartment.

02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:01.350
She is unemployed
and frequents doctors

02:28:01.350 --> 02:28:03.170
offices and the hospital.

02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:06.240
And she leaves the house
minimally during evening.

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:08.160
She doesn't like
to be out at night.

02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.520
And she happens to be
very open to letting

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:14.540
people know that she
is deaf and using

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:17.520
assistive technology
between that.

02:28:20.250 --> 02:28:22.770
In terms of assistive
technology that Felicity already

02:28:22.770 --> 02:28:26.100
uses, so to
communicate with her,

02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:31.380
we have been using a notepad
or a laptop with size 36 font

02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:33.510
so she can read it.

02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:37.890
And she also uses her iPhone,
as you saw on the video.

02:28:37.890 --> 02:28:39.590
She receives emails
from her doctor

02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:42.080
when she's out the doctor's
office to notify her

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:45.550
when they're ready for her.

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:49.620
And she uses a Sprint relay
app for phone calls and so on.

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:52.850
And, as you saw on the video,
a flashing smoke detector,

02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:55.300
and a CO alarm are
installed in her home,

02:28:55.300 --> 02:29:02.070
and she also has a flashing
doorbell, which the noise is

02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:05.430
loud enough that she actually
feel the vibrations when

02:29:05.430 --> 02:29:08.160
they're occurring.

02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:12.200
So now I'll switch
over to Becca.

02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:14.080
BECCA: So I guess along
the way of getting

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.420
to know Felicity
and her daily life,

02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:18.530
we like discussed
a lot of activities

02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:22.670
that we could potentially help
her design an AT solution for.

02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:25.340
We had to kind of whittle
it down to one motivation

02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:27.702
that we could center
a project around.

02:29:27.702 --> 02:29:29.660
And so the problem that
we're going to focus on

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:32.210
is that Felicity can't always
detect when events occur

02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:34.190
because she's mostly deaf.

02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:36.340
And so these include like
if people call her name,

02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:40.000
either at a cafe or at
the doctor's office,

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.890
or if a laundry
machine's done, or when

02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:44.920
she's going on her walks,
she can't hear cars

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.319
honking from incoming traffic.

02:29:47.319 --> 02:29:48.860
And so these are
all situations where

02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:50.624
somehow RET could help her.

02:29:50.624 --> 02:29:52.040
And so our goal
for the project is

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.930
to develop an AT that
will notify Felicity

02:29:54.930 --> 02:29:58.280
when particular events happen.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.130
So this is variation came
particularly from an email

02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:04.845
that Felicity sent to us with
this hearing dogs video in it.

02:30:04.845 --> 02:30:06.720
I guess we don't have
time to show the video,

02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:10.619
but the idea was just that she
saw this hearing dog video,

02:30:10.619 --> 02:30:12.160
and at the end of
her email she said,

02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:13.785
it would be really
cool if I could have

02:30:13.785 --> 02:30:15.740
my own handheld hearing dog.

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:19.460
And so that was a cool
step towards, for us,

02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:22.450
to find a solution for her.

02:30:22.450 --> 02:30:24.720
And so throughout so
far, we've currently

02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:27.140
been going through an
iterative design process

02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.210
to kind of whittle
go down a solution

02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:31.100
and find something
that works for her.

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:32.790
We've been using low
fidelity prototypes

02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:35.640
to get feedback from
Felicity, even to narrow down

02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:37.120
for our project solution.

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:40.410
And as we'll talk
about a little later,

02:30:40.410 --> 02:30:42.580
our initial design
process showed us

02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:46.214
that our project problem changed
after discussions with her.

02:30:46.214 --> 02:30:48.380
So this is just some example
of some of the sketches

02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:49.360
we've done.

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.210
In this example, we had
two parts of a solution.

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:56.135
One was a button that someone
could pass for her attention,

02:30:56.135 --> 02:30:58.260
and the other would be some
sort of wearable device

02:30:58.260 --> 02:31:01.580
that would vibrate, telling
her once like this button has

02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:02.159
been pushed.

02:31:02.159 --> 02:31:03.950
Now Ari is going to
share a little bit more

02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:06.325
about our initial problem
statement and problem overview.

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:15.140
ARI: Right, so the first
project we wanted to tackle

02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:19.270
was trying to let Felicity
know when someone called out

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:20.410
her name.

02:31:20.410 --> 02:31:23.880
And because she can't hear
and she has limited vision,

02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:28.100
it's pretty difficult if
she was in like a waiting

02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:32.150
room or the doctor's
office or in a classroom

02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:35.190
to like figure out if someone's
trying to contact her.

02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:39.550
So the idea we came up with
was rather than having someone

02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:43.390
try to call out their name, we
would have them have a button

02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:44.970
that they could press.

02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:46.950
And when they press
the button, it

02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:49.159
would contact Felicity
that they were

02:31:49.159 --> 02:31:50.325
trying to get her attention.

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:57.110
So this is the kind of
overview of that design.

02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:59.570
We have a button that
someone could press.

02:31:59.570 --> 02:32:02.410
It would send a
message to her iPhone,

02:32:02.410 --> 02:32:04.490
and then the iPhone
would display

02:32:04.490 --> 02:32:06.110
some sort of notification.

02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:08.290
And then we'd also
have a wearable device

02:32:08.290 --> 02:32:10.837
that she could use, and they
both display notifications.

02:32:10.837 --> 02:32:12.295
So kind of a two-step
notification.

02:32:18.310 --> 02:32:21.510
Luckily, we really worked
on doing iterative design

02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:23.720
and also user-centered
design because we

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:25.810
try talking with her
about how well does

02:32:25.810 --> 02:32:29.630
she think this will work, and
she really liked this idea.

02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:33.670
But she was concerned about
other people using it.

02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:36.340
And so one thing we
tried talking with her

02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:38.130
is what would you like more?

02:32:38.130 --> 02:32:40.580
And particularly, she
would want something

02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:44.720
that she could use possibly more
often and also independently

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:48.460
because this original project
involves two clients-- Felicity

02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:50.920
and whoever we
give the button to.

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:52.890
And so the new
focus of our project

02:32:52.890 --> 02:32:56.200
changed to try and
make some sort of way

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:59.030
to make sound emitting
appliances within her home

02:32:59.030 --> 02:33:01.643
accessible for Felicity.

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:07.510
So basically within
Felicity's apartment

02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:10.680
she has a few different
household appliances

02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.760
that she doesn't know
when they're done working.

02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:16.680
In particular, the laundry
machine, when it's done,

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:19.910
it just triggers a beep,
and it doesn't have a timer.

02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:23.450
So she would like a way to
know when it's finished.

02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:26.720
And basically the
idea we have is

02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:28.380
we could have some
sort of device

02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:31.530
that she could place next
to the household appliance.

02:33:31.530 --> 02:33:33.740
And then when the
appliance is finished

02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:37.240
doing whatever its task is,
it will emit some noise,

02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:39.910
and this device
would pick up on it

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:42.330
and send a signal
to Felicity to let

02:33:42.330 --> 02:33:44.900
her know that whatever
the household appliance

02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:48.470
task has completed.

02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:52.230
So again, we kind of kept
last half of the project

02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:56.200
that we started scoping
out and just talking about.

02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.170
And instead, now we
have a microphone

02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:00.920
that would be placed next
to the household appliance,

02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:06.310
and then the microphone would
be sending sound to the iPhone.

02:34:06.310 --> 02:34:08.510
And within the iPhone we
could have an application

02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:15.390
that would notify when the
sound of the appliance finishing

02:34:15.390 --> 02:34:17.030
has happened.

02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:23.000
So for the
implementation we decide

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.930
to use Bluetooth because
this is in her apartment.

02:34:26.930 --> 02:34:30.190
It's less than 30
feet, and also Felicity

02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:33.140
leaves her phone plugged in
while she's at her house.

02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:36.890
So we're not too
worried about that part.

02:34:36.890 --> 02:34:40.600
And then right now we're all
working on developing an iPhone

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.916
application for detecting
the sound and also

02:34:42.916 --> 02:34:43.999
the Bluetooth integration.

02:34:48.730 --> 02:34:50.450
So these are kind of
the hardware pieces

02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:52.140
we've been also testing out.

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:55.390
The first one was a Bluetooth
camera shutter button,

02:34:55.390 --> 02:34:57.790
and we also have a
headset that we're just

02:34:57.790 --> 02:35:00.641
using as a microphone
because we already have it,

02:35:00.641 --> 02:35:02.682
and we're just trying to
do low-cost prototyping.

02:35:08.067 --> 02:35:10.400
BECCA: So to talk a little
bit about the success metrics

02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.590
that we set up for our project,
for the technical side,

02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:15.736
we broke down our
project in two parts.

02:35:15.736 --> 02:35:18.110
There's going to be a noise
detection to the iPhone part,

02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:20.980
and then the iPhone to
the notification part.

02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:23.010
And so from there, we
have like two activities--

02:35:23.010 --> 02:35:25.590
the amount of noise
that this microphone

02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:29.300
could withstand before, and also
correctly detect the appliance.

02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:32.370
And those are kind of
our levels of how good

02:35:32.370 --> 02:35:34.530
it would be, where level
two would be ideal,

02:35:34.530 --> 02:35:37.599
and level zero is not actually
doing its job, and then

02:35:37.599 --> 02:35:39.140
the number of noises
it would detect.

02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.587
And then for the iPhone
to notification part,

02:35:43.587 --> 02:35:45.420
the success metric would
be like the percent

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:47.870
times the notification actually
succeeds and is correctly

02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:50.972
pinging Felicity.

02:35:50.972 --> 02:35:52.680
And then we have for
overall performance,

02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:54.596
I guess the best way to
measure our success is

02:35:54.596 --> 02:35:57.050
just how many appliances we
can actually adapt this to.

02:35:57.050 --> 02:35:59.830
And so the laundry machine,
dryer, toaster oven,

02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:02.360
and tea pot are just
five things that we

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:05.430
are kind of aiming towards
being able to make this for.

02:36:05.430 --> 02:36:07.705
And also we're considering
maintenance as well.

02:36:07.705 --> 02:36:09.080
Once we finish
with this project,

02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:11.150
we want to make sure that
all the parts of our project

02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:13.150
are replaceable so that
Felicity can continue

02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:15.580
to use it once we're not there.

02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:20.104
From the UI perspective side,
the best way quantitatively

02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:21.770
to measure this is
just the average time

02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:24.370
it would take to set up a
notification for a machine task

02:36:24.370 --> 02:36:27.710
that she has, and then
also her own perspective

02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:29.312
about whether or not
she things the UI

02:36:29.312 --> 02:36:30.520
is intuitive and easy to use.

02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:38.240
CIMMY: And in terms of our
project development so far,

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.280
we have purchased at Bluetooth
camera shutter remote button,

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:48.310
which was actually
for our previous idea,

02:36:48.310 --> 02:36:52.760
in order for Felicity to be
able to give a button to someone

02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:57.020
so that they could press
it to a signal her phone

02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:59.890
that she's getting a signal.

02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:03.160
And we started developing
an iPhone application

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:05.780
for the project that
we've moved towards,

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.090
and now we're investigating
wearable devices that Felicity

02:37:09.090 --> 02:37:12.000
could wear for notification.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.020
And we're leaning
more towards the side

02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:17.690
of some sort of wrist
wearable or something

02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:20.020
that she could hold.

02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:22.790
And in terms of our project's
plans and timelines,

02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:25.550
this is just a general
timeline that we have.

02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:30.810
We hope to get her iPhone
app working at a low scale

02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:33.200
so that we can just have
her iPhone connected

02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:36.000
with some microphone and see
how well that works, if we're

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.320
getting a vibration
notification,

02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:42.770
gather appliances and a sound
library by November 7th,

02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:44.270
and then test the
app functionality.

02:37:44.270 --> 02:37:49.500
We want to focus a lot on
having Felicity test out the app

02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:51.980
and see how well it works.

02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:57.250
And then probably by
the 28th of November,

02:37:57.250 --> 02:38:02.500
we want to clean up the final
project and work on the UI

02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:05.450
and fix bugs on the last week.

02:38:09.432 --> 02:38:09.932
Thank you.

02:38:12.416 --> 02:38:13.916
PROFESSOR 4: Questions
and comments?

02:38:21.087 --> 02:38:23.378
AUDIENCE: So for the appliances
you were talking about,

02:38:23.378 --> 02:38:29.305
like tea pot, laundry,
and [INAUDIBLE],

02:38:29.305 --> 02:38:31.346
would it make more sense
to use a timer for that?

02:38:31.346 --> 02:38:34.334
Because each of those
appliances are pretty set

02:38:34.334 --> 02:38:37.977
timings for the [INAUDIBLE].

02:38:37.977 --> 02:38:40.310
Would that be easier than
detecting a sound [INAUDIBLE]?

02:38:43.796 --> 02:38:46.226
BECCA: So that's something
that we asked Felicity about,

02:38:46.226 --> 02:38:47.350
and I think she-- oh sorry.

02:38:47.350 --> 02:38:48.950
That is something we
asked, we brought up

02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:50.991
when we were talking about
this is with Felicity.

02:38:50.991 --> 02:38:54.100
But, I think, one thing
is like you don't always

02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:56.610
remember to set up the
timer, or sometimes

02:38:56.610 --> 02:38:59.042
you just like run into
something else that you do.

02:38:59.042 --> 02:39:01.250
And so you told yourself,
oh, I was going to do that.

02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:03.159
But she just forgets.

02:39:03.159 --> 02:39:05.700
And also when she's home, she
doesn't keep her iPhone on her.

02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:07.940
So she usually
has it plugged in,

02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:12.260
so if she can't hear the alarm,
or even if it was vibrating,

02:39:12.260 --> 02:39:14.335
she just doesn't know
if she's in another room

02:39:14.335 --> 02:39:17.409
or she's taking a nap to
actually go and check on it.

02:39:17.409 --> 02:39:19.492
So I think when we did
introduce this idea to her,

02:39:19.492 --> 02:39:21.890
and we told her, well, there
are like other alternatives that

02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:23.390
seem more feasible,
she really liked

02:39:23.390 --> 02:39:25.621
the idea of having
something that's preferably

02:39:25.621 --> 02:39:26.870
a wearable that just vibrates.

02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:28.890
Then she doesn't have
to be thinking about it.

02:39:28.890 --> 02:39:30.580
But she'll know exactly
when it's ringing that she

02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:31.663
should go back and see it.

02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:35.400
AUDIENCE: Why do
you need the phone?

02:39:38.067 --> 02:39:40.400
BECCA: So I think first in
terms of like implementation,

02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:43.190
it's a bit easier
to have an iPhone

02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:47.800
app be the one that's sending
the Bluetooth signal back

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:48.830
to the wearable.

02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:51.940
And also in terms of
modularity, I think,

02:39:51.940 --> 02:39:54.610
it would be a more
complicated hardware solution

02:39:54.610 --> 02:39:57.190
if it was intelligently
picking up just

02:39:57.190 --> 02:40:00.045
to send to the specific
hardware device.

02:40:00.045 --> 02:40:07.160
I'm sorry, from like sound
detector to the wearable,

02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:09.530
it's two more complicated
hardware solutions.

02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:12.570
And so then it's the
question of maintenance,

02:40:12.570 --> 02:40:14.750
like how is she going
to replace these more

02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:15.960
complicated solutions?

02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.949
But instead, we're
using two kind

02:40:17.949 --> 02:40:20.490
of just all they have to do is
either send a Bluetooth signal

02:40:20.490 --> 02:40:22.350
and then receive a
Bluetooth signal,

02:40:22.350 --> 02:40:25.460
and that's like two much cheaper
hardware pieces for us to get.

02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:27.141
And she could always
replace those.

02:40:27.141 --> 02:40:28.640
And then the iPhone
app is something

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:29.940
that she'd already have.

02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:31.950
AUDIENCE: How much is
a Bluetooth switch?

02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:33.790
BECCA: Yeah, so what
we looked at so far,

02:40:33.790 --> 02:40:36.810
like out-of-the0box solutions
to be like $30 to $40.

02:40:41.076 --> 02:40:42.492
AUDIENCE: If you
skip the phone, I

02:40:42.492 --> 02:40:48.110
guess, you would be able
to use an RF link for $5?

02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:51.010
BECCA: OK, but would
that be able to know--

02:40:51.010 --> 02:40:53.030
like would the
notification collector,

02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:56.140
I mean the sound detector,
know to send it exactly

02:40:56.140 --> 02:41:01.535
to this Bluetooth wearable?

02:41:01.535 --> 02:41:04.191
Or is that a Bluetooth
[INAUDIBLE] RF?

02:41:04.191 --> 02:41:06.190
ARI: I guess one thing
we'd also like to include

02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:09.770
is one of the reasons we
kind of stuck with iPhone

02:41:09.770 --> 02:41:13.350
is we were interested in finding
commercial products that we

02:41:13.350 --> 02:41:16.968
don't have to customize
any of the hardware,

02:41:16.968 --> 02:41:18.384
especially with
the button design.

02:41:18.384 --> 02:41:21.510
If it broke, she could
easily purchase a new one.

02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:25.110
Like those buttons that we
first shows, they're under $10

02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:26.910
to get similar designs.

02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:28.705
So what we're
really hoping to get

02:41:28.705 --> 02:41:31.515
is something that
will work after we're

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:33.580
done with the class.

02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:35.260
So you can purchase
these designs

02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:38.390
and keep making designs that
work with the iPhone, then

02:41:38.390 --> 02:41:39.760
why don't we capitalize on that?

02:41:42.533 --> 02:41:44.574
PROFESSOR 4: So, Leonard,
do you have a question?

02:41:49.286 --> 02:41:51.160
PROFESSOR 5: Did you
make an actual prototype

02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:52.825
for-- what was your prototype?

02:41:56.702 --> 02:41:58.660
BECCA: It was mostly so
far just like sketches.

02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:00.296
It was mostly
sketches to show her

02:42:00.296 --> 02:42:02.265
like, OK, these are
three pieces, two pieces,

02:42:02.265 --> 02:42:04.275
or like, these are kinds of
pieces we're talking about,

02:42:04.275 --> 02:42:06.441
and then like whether or
not you even like the idea.

02:42:06.441 --> 02:42:08.350
PROFESSOR 5: Sort of
like a storyboard?

02:42:08.350 --> 02:42:09.766
BECCA: Yeah, and
user [? flows. ?]

02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:15.434
ARI: And we also brought
the physical hardware

02:42:15.434 --> 02:42:18.226
of that button to kind of
see how she liked it, would

02:42:18.226 --> 02:42:20.067
she feel like it's OK to use.

02:42:20.067 --> 02:42:22.150
PROFESSOR 5: So you're
going to run with that one?

02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:24.191
The you bought, is that
what you're going to use,

02:42:24.191 --> 02:42:26.020
or are you going to
use something else?

02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:27.520
ARI: No, we're
planning on switching

02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.650
to try to make something
that only works

02:42:29.650 --> 02:42:32.400
with her independently because
we're concerned about having

02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:34.830
the extra client that
couldn't really control,

02:42:34.830 --> 02:42:36.900
make sure they were on board.

02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:38.900
BECCA: So it's like
microphone, iPhone, and then

02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:41.375
wearable or something
to like [INAUDIBLE].

02:42:43.725 --> 02:42:45.350
PROFESSOR 5: OK, I
think we're at time.

02:42:45.350 --> 02:42:46.370
Thank you very much.

02:42:53.950 --> 02:42:56.370
EANN: Hi, we're Team
Don, and my name is Eann.

02:42:56.370 --> 02:42:58.814
This is Christina,
and over here is Jan.

02:42:58.814 --> 02:43:00.730
First, we'd like to tell
you a little bit more

02:43:00.730 --> 02:43:01.820
about our client.

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:05.180
Our client's name is Don, and
he is a male senior citizen

02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:06.320
who currently lives alone.

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:09.080
He's a strong advocate
for support groups,

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:12.610
and he constantly tells us
about how he goes to conferences

02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:15.870
and speaks to health
professionals.

02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:19.260
And he suffered from polio
during his childhood,

02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:21.340
and that is affected
his left leg.

02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:25.420
But in 2002, he also
suffer from a stroke

02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:27.800
that affected the right
hemisphere of his brain.

02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.300
So currently he has limited use
of his left side and especially

02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.510
his left arm, and
this has also resulted

02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:37.010
in cognitive
difficulties, especially

02:43:37.010 --> 02:43:39.336
in the late afternoon
or early afternoon,

02:43:39.336 --> 02:43:41.460
whenever sometimes it's a
little bit harder for him

02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:45.340
to process and to focus
and to just kind of stay

02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:47.390
on track with
whatever conversation

02:43:47.390 --> 02:43:48.700
he's currently engaged in.

02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.450
From our very first meeting,
we knew that Don loved food,

02:43:54.450 --> 02:43:55.650
and he loved to cook.

02:43:55.650 --> 02:43:57.100
So one of our very
first questions

02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:59.600
was, what's your favorite
flavor of ice cream?

02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.210
And this kind of transcended
into this conversation of food,

02:44:03.210 --> 02:44:05.400
and we discovered
that Don was actually

02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.790
a food catering manager
prior to his disability.

02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:13.050
And when you first
started at his job at KFC,

02:44:13.050 --> 02:44:16.690
he learned about his passion for
cooking and expressing himself

02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:17.710
through food.

02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:20.140
And so as a result,
he still cooks,

02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:22.737
and he constantly talks
about different recipes.

02:44:22.737 --> 02:44:24.570
And we got the opportunity
to make omelettes

02:44:24.570 --> 02:44:25.740
with him one day.

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:28.890
And so with his left hand,
it typically is stable,

02:44:28.890 --> 02:44:31.050
and he uses his
right hand to cook.

02:44:31.050 --> 02:44:33.150
And with his left hand
held typically either

02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:35.710
brace apart or hold
onto a cheese package,

02:44:35.710 --> 02:44:37.030
and rip open the top.

02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:39.340
But typically, it's
only just his right arm

02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:42.175
that he uses, and
it's essentially

02:44:42.175 --> 02:44:47.560
his only method of cooking--
or only manner of cooking.

02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:52.250
And so this you can see is
in his actual apartment.

02:44:52.250 --> 02:44:55.670
We got the opportunity to go
visit Don in his apartment

02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:59.580
and kind of see where he lives
and see where he actually

02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:00.970
takes the time to cook.

02:45:00.970 --> 02:45:02.630
And so we noticed
that is apartment

02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:05.420
is actually-- his kitchen
is actually fairly small.

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:10.030
It is about the size of a small
kitchen in Burton Conner, which

02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:11.630
is a dorm on campus.

02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:13.250
And you can see
in the next slide

02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:16.980
that the stove is fairly
close to the sink,

02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:24.020
and so it's a pretty
small quarter for cooking.

02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:26.540
And he's looking
for a way to improve

02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:27.945
the mobility in his kitchen.

02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:33.210
The assistive
technology that Don uses

02:45:33.210 --> 02:45:37.310
includes Velcro, which
is on the left hand side.

02:45:37.310 --> 02:45:39.710
He constantly tells us
that Velcro is his friend,

02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:41.850
and he uses Velcro
for his shoes.

02:45:41.850 --> 02:45:44.300
And on the far
right side, he also

02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:46.490
uses a leg brace
that prevents him

02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:48.380
from hyperextending his knee.

02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:51.330
But the most important assistive
technology that he uses

02:45:51.330 --> 02:45:53.120
is in the center, his iPhone.

02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.350
So you can see, he's clearly
really excited about it,

02:45:55.350 --> 02:45:59.170
and he's constantly using it to
schedule tasks, to send emails,

02:45:59.170 --> 02:46:03.478
and he depends on this iPhone to
remind him of his daily tasks.

02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:12.110
So in addition to
those three items,

02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:14.040
he also uses a cane
to help him walk.

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.480
And so this is a quick
video of him using his cane,

02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:20.430
and it's just simply
to help him walk

02:46:20.430 --> 02:46:22.270
and to assist him
in being mobile.

02:46:28.399 --> 02:46:29.940
JAN: So some challenges
we've already

02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:32.590
seemed to have
faced in this design

02:46:32.590 --> 02:46:34.820
project is our team scheduling.

02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:37.260
So it's really hard for
us three to get together

02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:41.910
with Don at the same time, same
place, and get something going.

02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:44.900
And with Don's
cognitive overload,

02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:47.849
he also has issues
focusing and telling us

02:46:47.849 --> 02:46:49.890
what he really wants for
us to do on our project.

02:46:49.890 --> 02:46:53.070
So we initially started
out with two projects

02:46:53.070 --> 02:46:56.140
that we were going to work for
helping him with his cooking.

02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:58.700
As you can see here, we
started off thinking of ways

02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:00.420
that we can help him
out in the kitchen.

02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:02.470
So something that
he did mention to us

02:47:02.470 --> 02:47:06.060
was the fact that he needs
some help carrying big pots.

02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:08.540
So since he has one
arm, it's really hard

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:12.120
to actually stabilize the
pot and move it from point A

02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:14.330
to point B without
having the contents spill

02:47:14.330 --> 02:47:16.070
and move around too much.

02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:18.770
And another thing that was
mentioned to us by-- oh, he's

02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:21.560
not here today-- another one
of the actual participants

02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:24.000
of this class,
Jeffrey, was something

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.770
used for stirring or
stabilizing the pot

02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:28.940
whenever he's either
stirring or doing something

02:47:28.940 --> 02:47:30.560
with the contents of the pot.

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.080
And we initially started off
with two different projects

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:36.370
that we were going
to test out with Don

02:47:36.370 --> 02:47:39.340
and figure out what he really
wanted out of us in this class.

02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:42.070
So the first one was the
stability of the mixing pot

02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:45.120
or doing something
with the pot or a bow.

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:47.790
And we decided that we wanted
to focus on these three

02:47:47.790 --> 02:47:50.970
little things, so minimizing
how much the bowl moves,

02:47:50.970 --> 02:47:55.560
how much it tips over, and
making sure that whatever

02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:58.830
we use is fast and easy to use.

02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:00.300
And as for moving
pots, we wanted

02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:03.550
to focus more on how he can
take these pots from point A

02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:07.420
to point B, so large pots with
a lot of things inside of them,

02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:09.266
and minimize how
much effort he has

02:48:09.266 --> 02:48:11.670
to put into moving these
things and stabilizing them,

02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:14.530
while making it very
easy to use as well

02:48:14.530 --> 02:48:18.720
and minimizing how
much liquid falls off

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:21.930
or how many things could
go wrong with this.

02:48:21.930 --> 02:48:24.390
So we initially started off
with some design prototypes

02:48:24.390 --> 02:48:29.575
for the stirring or for slipping
is something that we called it.

02:48:29.575 --> 02:48:32.500
So we started for
slipping, and we showed him

02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:35.450
some of these designs, and we
got some very good feedback

02:48:35.450 --> 02:48:35.950
from him.

02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:39.040
He was very, very opposed
to having something

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:42.910
big and clunky in his
desk or his workspace

02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:43.910
whenever he was cooking.

02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:47.464
And we used that to
further our designs

02:48:47.464 --> 02:48:49.880
and make sure that we go with
something smaller, something

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:54.190
that doesn't get in the way and
is very easy for him to use.

02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:56.300
And after that,
we showed him some

02:48:56.300 --> 02:48:59.680
of the things that he may
want to use for moving a pot.

02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:02.980
So over here, we
can see something

02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:06.870
that can adjust to a pot
and use some sort of strap

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:09.620
around his forearm or
shoulder to move the pot.

02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:13.040
Because he mentioned that
he has some what we thought

02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:15.540
were really big
pots to move around

02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:16.990
for a pretty long distance.

02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:19.073
This was before we actually
went over to his house

02:49:19.073 --> 02:49:21.150
and found out what
we were working with.

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:24.120
And another thing that
we thought was maybe-- he

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:26.560
says he slides the pots a
lot because it's a lot harder

02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.057
for him to carry them.

02:49:28.057 --> 02:49:29.640
Something that we
thought of was maybe

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:32.670
having a little mobile
station for him to use,

02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:36.910
where he can slide the pot onto
it, slide it across the floor,

02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:41.340
and then move it onto
the actual stove itself.

02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:44.540
And finally, this is just some
brainstorming/prototyping.

02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:48.780
We thought of like those
things that drummers use,

02:49:48.780 --> 02:49:50.330
where they attach
it to their chest,

02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:51.560
and you can pot in there.

02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:54.020
But this is just
for brainstorming.

02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:55.780
We just threw ideas out there.

02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:57.430
And we showed
these ideas to Don,

02:49:57.430 --> 02:50:00.130
and we decided
that we were going

02:50:00.130 --> 02:50:05.190
to go much further into the
actual movement of the pot,

02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:06.790
rather than the
stirring, since he

02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:09.280
says that that's one of the
big challenges that he has.

02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:11.917
And that's where we
are currently at.

02:50:11.917 --> 02:50:14.000
We have identified the
problem and know what we're

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.500
going to do from here on out.

02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:19.130
CHRISTINA: So this
past Friday we

02:50:19.130 --> 02:50:21.394
actually got to go
to Don's apartment

02:50:21.394 --> 02:50:23.060
to actually see what
his kitchen is like

02:50:23.060 --> 02:50:25.090
and what his cooking
environment is like.

02:50:25.090 --> 02:50:27.900
And so before we were
initially imagining

02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:30.229
that he was using pots
that were like this big

02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:32.520
and that you would need to
use like two hands to carry.

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:35.210
But we actually found
out that they're actually

02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:37.630
normal sized pots which you
can carry with one hand,

02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:40.940
and also the thing about his
kitchen space being very small

02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:46.141
made some of our initial
designs not feasible.

02:50:46.141 --> 02:50:48.015
So here you can see a
video of Don in action.

02:51:19.930 --> 02:51:21.740
So, as you can see,
Don has trouble

02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:24.140
moving filled pots from
his sink to his stove top

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:26.056
without having some of
the contents spill out.

02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:32.830
And so we kind of made a
sketch of his kitchen layout.

02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:36.930
And so the task requirement
that we decided on

02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:41.670
was that we wanted to
help him be able to lift

02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:45.475
and move the filled pot and also
not spill any of the contents.

02:51:48.130 --> 02:51:51.700
And so these are
success metrics.

02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:55.460
Them metrics include lifting
and moving the pot vertically

02:51:55.460 --> 02:51:58.616
as well as horizontally, and
then the amount of spill there

02:51:58.616 --> 02:52:01.630
is , and also how much time it
takes for him to move the pot

02:52:01.630 --> 02:52:03.640
from the sink to his stove top.

02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:10.400
And so we kind of evaluated
the current state of how

02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:16.080
he accomplishes the task, and
we used a scale from 1 to 10,

02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:18.730
one being we would
really like to help

02:52:18.730 --> 02:52:23.120
him improve in this aspect,
and 10 being this is OK,

02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:24.350
and this is great.

02:52:24.350 --> 02:52:30.877
So we have our current goals, or
we have the current situation,

02:52:30.877 --> 02:52:31.835
and we have the target.

02:52:31.835 --> 02:52:33.293
And we also have
our reached goals.

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:40.310
So our contributions
up to date--

02:52:40.310 --> 02:52:44.180
since we haven't really gotten
into the prototyping part yet,

02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:47.110
we have all been designing
and brainstorming together.

02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:49.910
And so Jan has been
facilitating the meetings.

02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:53.190
Eann has been documenting
and taking notes,

02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:57.210
and I have been taking
videos and also photos.

02:52:57.210 --> 02:52:59.790
And for our future
contributions,

02:52:59.790 --> 02:53:02.920
we are going to continue doing
what we're doing right now.

02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:07.660
Also, once we get a better idea
of what are design will be,

02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:10.400
maybe split up
the tasks for what

02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:12.224
different components
of our product

02:53:12.224 --> 02:53:13.682
that we are going
to be working on.

02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:22.660
So I guess like our
most crucial step

02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:25.320
is our next step, which is
like in the immediate future.

02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:27.820
So we really need to
be able to come up

02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:30.836
with a design for our first
prototype and get it to Don

02:53:30.836 --> 02:53:31.960
and get his feedback on it.

02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:35.950
So one of the main things
that we will be focusing on

02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:39.050
for this first prototype will
be mechanisms and concepts

02:53:39.050 --> 02:53:42.080
for how he can move a
pot from a certain height

02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:45.220
to a higher place.

02:53:45.220 --> 02:53:47.320
And also, we might be
considering the material

02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:50.120
that we will be using
the product because that

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:55.160
relates to, I guess, like
how much mass he can move.

02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:59.260
And we will also be doing a
more quantitative evaluation

02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:02.600
of Don's skills, so maybe like
how much mass he can life,

02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:04.418
or how long can he
hold up a pot for.

02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:14.520
And so I these are
our project plans.

02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:17.440
So, as I mentioned before,
our main thing right now

02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:20.200
is to get our first prototype
out and get his feedback on it.

02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.170
And then from then on,
we can add more details

02:54:23.170 --> 02:54:26.578
into our planning for how we are
going to finish this product.

02:54:35.061 --> 02:54:37.347
PROFESSOR 5: Any questions?

02:54:37.347 --> 02:54:38.055
Great, thank you.

02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:45.500
PROFESSOR 6: Did he
articulate any other scenarios

02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:49.340
of where her would move the
pot, aside from stove to sink?

02:54:52.134 --> 02:54:53.800
JAN: No, that's the
only one we actually

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:55.700
saw him doing physically.

02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:59.790
But I imagine that he would have
to potentially move something

02:54:59.790 --> 02:55:02.400
that has like maybe spaghetti
to cool it down somewhere else

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:06.970
and maybe actually serving
my the pot, so from his

02:55:06.970 --> 02:55:07.967
to the kitchen table.

02:55:07.967 --> 02:55:10.050
But that's the only one
we actually saw him doing,

02:55:10.050 --> 02:55:12.870
and that's why we are going to
get some further tests to see

02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:15.530
distance, weight, and other
things that could potentially

02:55:15.530 --> 02:55:16.750
play into our design.

02:55:16.750 --> 02:55:18.250
PROFESSOR 6: So I
was wondering that

02:55:18.250 --> 02:55:21.030
about how that may
impact your metrics

02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:24.430
or quantitative metrics of being
able to move it three feet.

02:55:24.430 --> 02:55:26.130
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
want to try to try

02:55:26.130 --> 02:55:29.945
to get him to fill
the pot and move it

02:55:29.945 --> 02:55:33.780
while there's hot liquid because
that may make a big difference.

02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.850
And he was very aloof
about splashing cold water,

02:55:36.850 --> 02:55:39.337
but he might not want to
do that with boiling water.

02:55:39.337 --> 02:55:41.420
JAN: No, we didn't want
anybody to get hurt there.

02:55:44.407 --> 02:55:46.365
AUDIENCE: Did you guys
try the pot-moving thing

02:55:46.365 --> 02:55:50.709
yourselves to see
how much-- you filled

02:55:50.709 --> 02:55:52.000
the pot all the way to the top.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.920
How feasible is it for
like one of you to do that?

02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:56.900
JAN: No, we did not.

02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:57.976
It's something that
we should have done.

02:55:57.976 --> 02:55:58.790
You're right.

02:56:03.549 --> 02:56:05.840
PROFESSOR 5: So imagine
everything goes amazingly well.

02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:07.212
What will you actually make?

02:56:07.212 --> 02:56:08.384
What will you actually do?

02:56:08.384 --> 02:56:09.550
Will it be a redesigned pot?

02:56:09.550 --> 02:56:12.530
Is it sort of like thinking
about the procedure

02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:15.010
of how to do these tasks?

02:56:15.010 --> 02:56:17.670
You can imagine building
a robot that could do it.

02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:20.564
It would be like really hard.

02:56:20.564 --> 02:56:21.980
What are you
actually going to do?

02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:24.130
JAN: So what really
thought was an attachment

02:56:24.130 --> 02:56:27.620
that you can adjust to
almost any type of pot.

02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:29.530
So one that I showed
over there was something

02:56:29.530 --> 02:56:32.050
that you can put around
the top side of the pot,

02:56:32.050 --> 02:56:36.960
so a belt or some
type of thing, where

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.480
it hooks on to the
top of the pot,

02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:42.630
and you have belt on top
of it, where he can--

02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:45.110
he says he would really like
to be able to really use

02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:47.650
his forearm because his fingers
also get really tired, to be

02:56:47.650 --> 02:56:52.320
able to put the belt over his
arm and then carry it over,

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:53.923
using that, rather
than the handle,

02:56:53.923 --> 02:56:55.589
where he doesn't have
as much stability.

02:56:58.971 --> 02:57:01.220
PROFESSOR 1: I do want to
echo what was said over here

02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:02.460
about heat.

02:57:02.460 --> 02:57:04.650
I think that the fact
that you didn't mentioned

02:57:04.650 --> 02:57:07.890
that at all in your success
metrics or in your constraints

02:57:07.890 --> 02:57:10.060
is actually a pretty
serious problem, right?

02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:14.070
He's moving a pot to his
sink-- I'm sorry to the stove

02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:16.302
in order to heat it up.

02:57:16.302 --> 02:57:18.510
And then if he's going to
continue to be independent,

02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:19.926
he's going to have
to do something

02:57:19.926 --> 02:57:23.270
with that hot, still heavy pot.

02:57:23.270 --> 02:57:26.372
So you need a
consideration here which is

02:57:26.372 --> 02:57:27.580
that he doesn't burn himself.

02:57:30.410 --> 02:57:32.810
And I think that
spillage may be something

02:57:32.810 --> 02:57:36.300
that you should give a little
less concern to because that

02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:40.182
can be solved by not filling it
up as much because that would

02:57:40.182 --> 02:57:42.682
boil over anyway, if you filled
it up as much as he actually

02:57:42.682 --> 02:57:46.370
did in that video or
by putting lids on it.

02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:48.690
But I really would encourage
you to worry much more

02:57:48.690 --> 02:57:52.549
and pay much more attention
to the problem of heat.

02:57:52.549 --> 02:57:54.340
JAN: That's something
that we'll definitely

02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:54.770
take into account then.

02:57:54.770 --> 02:57:56.270
AUDIENCE: Especially
if you're going

02:57:56.270 --> 02:57:58.450
in the direction of
putting something

02:57:58.450 --> 02:58:01.430
that's close to his body.

02:58:01.430 --> 02:58:05.730
And you can do tests
with him not burning him,

02:58:05.730 --> 02:58:07.251
like put food coloring.

02:58:07.251 --> 02:58:09.500
Have him wear something he
doesn't care about, and see

02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:12.650
if he an immediate reflex if
he's spilling food coloring

02:58:12.650 --> 02:58:13.440
on his clothes.

02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:16.650
It'll give you a better
sense of is he really

02:58:16.650 --> 02:58:19.600
that confident with this
forearm, for instance.

02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:21.740
PROFESSOR 5: So it's
a really hard problem.

02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:23.890
In some ways, I'll
just be honest,

02:58:23.890 --> 02:58:26.760
like when I first saw
this compelling client,

02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:30.210
and it's like, this
is a great person.

02:58:30.210 --> 02:58:32.290
It would be great
to help him, and I

02:58:32.290 --> 02:58:33.770
know that he loves to cook.

02:58:33.770 --> 02:58:38.770
But dealing with pots full
of water, possibly hot water,

02:58:38.770 --> 02:58:40.710
that just seems like
a really hard problem.

02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:42.890
And I wonder if
there's something else

02:58:42.890 --> 02:58:47.250
you can do for him that's not
so physically, like something

02:58:47.250 --> 02:58:49.791
that doesn't have
a safety dimension.

02:58:49.791 --> 02:58:51.290
You don't want to
give him something

02:58:51.290 --> 02:58:53.331
he's going to burn himself
with badly on his own.

02:58:53.331 --> 02:58:54.909
You know what I mean?

02:58:54.909 --> 02:58:57.200
JAN: Yeah, we could also take
the alternative approach,

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:00.794
the actual stirring or moving
the things within the pot.

02:59:00.794 --> 02:59:02.210
PROFESSOR 5: Or
maybe he just lets

02:59:02.210 --> 02:59:03.600
it cool for a really long time.

02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:05.010
But how do you get the food out?

02:59:05.010 --> 02:59:05.460
I don't know.

02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:07.584
Maybe there's a way to
rethink the entire-- I mean,

02:59:07.584 --> 02:59:09.540
the goal is to have cooked food.

02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:11.870
Is there a way to rethink
how you get cooked food

02:59:11.870 --> 02:59:13.747
at the end of the day
that avoids lifting

02:59:13.747 --> 02:59:14.830
a heavy pot from the sink.

02:59:14.830 --> 02:59:16.372
AUDIENCE: Have a longer hose.

02:59:16.372 --> 02:59:18.580
AUDIENCE: That's another
way to do the filling right?

02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:19.536
PROFESSOR 5: You can
imagine filling it

02:59:19.536 --> 02:59:21.240
with like small--
you know, a ferry

02:59:21.240 --> 02:59:22.706
system of smaller
things that get

02:59:22.706 --> 02:59:23.914
added a little bit at a time.

02:59:23.914 --> 02:59:25.000
AUDIENCE: Or an interesting
pump [INAUDIBLE].

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.542
PROFESSOR 5: If you can sort of
train him how to do the task.

02:59:27.542 --> 02:59:29.166
I wonder if there
are experts out there

02:59:29.166 --> 02:59:31.090
in the world that figure
out how to do this.

02:59:31.090 --> 02:59:33.700
Disabled cooking, is
there such a thing?

02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:35.196
But I admire you
for taking it on.

02:59:35.196 --> 02:59:38.351
It just seems really
hard and dangerous.

02:59:38.351 --> 02:59:40.017
PROFESSOR 4: Great,
thank you, Team Don.

02:59:40.017 --> 02:59:40.558
Thanks again.

02:59:44.490 --> 02:59:46.814
We managed to get
through them all.

02:59:46.814 --> 02:59:48.480
We have maybe two or
three minutes left.

02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:51.710
Maybe I'll ask if the
panelists or the support staff

02:59:51.710 --> 02:59:55.600
have general comments on
all the presentation today,

02:59:55.600 --> 02:59:56.910
for the panelists here today.

02:59:56.910 --> 02:59:59.800
And Professor Miller, if you
have general comments or advice

02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:03.490
on the presentations or the
project progress in general,

03:00:03.490 --> 03:00:04.990
give you the
opportunity to do that.

03:00:07.350 --> 03:00:10.580
But while you think about
that, just one reminder

03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:13.810
is to remember to upload your
slides from the presentation

03:00:13.810 --> 03:00:20.132
today, so that we can integrate
these things into the video,

03:00:20.132 --> 03:00:22.090
and so that we can look
at your slides as well.

03:00:22.090 --> 03:00:23.940
And then the reports
are due Friday,

03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:27.160
and then next week, we'll
have read all the reports,

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:30.470
and we'll give you some more
written feedback, a letter

03:00:30.470 --> 03:00:34.140
grade at this point in time.

03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:36.141
But I'll of the
panelists, Jose or Anna,

03:00:36.141 --> 03:00:37.640
Professor Leonard,
Professor Miller,

03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:41.670
if you have any general
comments or advice for teams

03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:43.444
at this point in time.

03:00:43.444 --> 03:00:45.860
PROFESSOR 1: Great to see the
progress that you're making.

03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:48.920
Keep meeting with your
clients, and focus

03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:51.630
on trying to finish that
prototype that you're

03:00:51.630 --> 03:00:53.824
going to deliver at the
end of the semester.

03:00:53.824 --> 03:00:55.490
PROFESSOR 5: I would
just say, like I've

03:00:55.490 --> 03:00:57.590
taught design classes
and mechanical and ocean

03:00:57.590 --> 03:01:00.480
engineering, and it's
really challenging

03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:03.720
when the schedule crunch
at the end of the semester,

03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:05.670
and so sometimes
you're going to have

03:01:05.670 --> 03:01:07.240
to down scope towards the end.

03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:10.279
But if you try to really think
about a measurable result,

03:01:10.279 --> 03:01:11.820
that you really
accomplish something,

03:01:11.820 --> 03:01:14.490
and what that would be, and make
sure you at least get that far.

03:01:14.490 --> 03:01:17.840
Like it would be a disaster
if you didn't at least do x.

03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:18.730
What is x?

03:01:18.730 --> 03:01:22.817
Have a prototype that
does something, that gives

03:01:22.817 --> 03:01:23.900
some value to your client.

03:01:23.900 --> 03:01:26.510
And so the time's going
to go really quickly,

03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:30.125
and you're going
to run out of time.

03:01:30.125 --> 03:01:32.250
PROFESSOR 6: I would say
it's great to that you all

03:01:32.250 --> 03:01:34.660
are meeting what seems
like a regular basis

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:37.700
with your collaborators
for these projects.

03:01:37.700 --> 03:01:39.200
And so take advantage
of every time

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:41.390
you're meeting with
them to bring something

03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:44.210
you can hold in your hand
that is going to impact

03:01:44.210 --> 03:01:46.570
the final design, whether
a potential material

03:01:46.570 --> 03:01:49.960
you could use, a prototype
of a looks-like design,

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:51.420
or this is a feature design.

03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:53.430
But that'll really
help you to continue

03:01:53.430 --> 03:01:54.920
to iterate on those features.

03:01:58.250 --> 03:02:01.520
AUDIENCE: I would echo
Professor Leonard's comments

03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:03.120
of take something.

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:06.820
If you're going towards
the end of the semester,

03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:08.736
pick that one item
that you know is going

03:02:08.736 --> 03:02:11.300
to make a critical difference.

03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:15.330
If you spend too much
time picking pots,

03:02:15.330 --> 03:02:18.250
we know what pots look
like, and how they behave.

03:02:18.250 --> 03:02:21.390
But if you don't know how
another mechanism that you're

03:02:21.390 --> 03:02:23.720
designing behaves,
then focus on that one.

03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:27.660
And just in case you
do run out of time,

03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:31.170
you know that that's an
addressable thing to leave out.

03:02:31.170 --> 03:02:33.780
Don't leave out the
[? core ?] [INAUDIBLE].

03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:35.530
PROFESSOR 4: Michelle,
[INAUDIBLE], Grace,

03:02:35.530 --> 03:02:37.140
you have general comments?

03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:40.640
OK, cool.

03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:42.930
I think one thing I'll
say is I think you all

03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:45.420
have gotten to know your
clients really well,

03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:47.550
from the presentations.

03:02:47.550 --> 03:02:51.330
On Monday and Wednesday and on
Friday night or on the weekend,

03:02:51.330 --> 03:02:54.870
Grace and I watched all the
videos that where submitted.

03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:57.040
We're all very impressed.

03:02:57.040 --> 03:02:58.750
You really have
spent a lot of time

03:02:58.750 --> 03:03:00.820
and really gotten
to know the people.

03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:02.587
One thing I would
suggest is you really,

03:03:02.587 --> 03:03:04.670
maybe in the next couple
weeks, really, really get

03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:06.900
to know the client's task.

03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:08.910
I mean really break
it down and come up

03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:12.130
with these measurable
metrics, try things out,

03:03:12.130 --> 03:03:15.630
food color the water, things
like that, so you can really

03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:17.300
get a sense of
whether your device

03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:20.925
or whether the system you're
building is going to work.

03:03:20.925 --> 03:03:23.230
PROFESSOR 5: Like really
put yourself in their shoes.

03:03:23.230 --> 03:03:25.370
PROFESSOR 4: OK, I think
that's pretty much it.

03:03:25.370 --> 03:03:27.880
Next week we're going to do
a bunch of electronic device

03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:29.850
labs, so bring your
laptop computer

03:03:29.850 --> 03:03:31.750
is what we're hoping
for people to bring.

03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:33.291
Grace, you have a
final announcement?

03:03:33.291 --> 03:03:35.660
GRACE: Yeah, we sent
out a poll today.

03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:39.170
We're going to set up twice
weekly hobby shop office hours.

03:03:39.170 --> 03:03:42.720
So if you think you're going
to be using a hobby shop

03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:45.520
or building anything mechanical,
please fill out the-- we'll

03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.395
decide by Friday what
those office hours are.

03:03:47.395 --> 03:03:47.670
Thanks.

03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:49.295
PROFESSOR 4: And
Monday's class lecture

03:03:49.295 --> 03:03:51.070
and lab will both
be in this room

03:03:51.070 --> 03:03:53.350
because we're doing these
electronic device access

03:03:53.350 --> 03:03:58.150
labs, so 32044 at both
1:00 PM and 3:00 PM.

03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:59.700
OK, thanks.
