00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.370
LAURA LING: You had a
pretty difficult childhood.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.460
Tell me about it.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.995
DAVID WANG: Yeah, I was a
pretty unhappy kid growing up.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.820
I would be afraid
of going to school

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.180
because I would get bullied
pretty often, physically

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.510
and verbally.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.940
They would call me like a
loser, stupid, skinny, small,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.130
retarded.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.810
So this was about when I was
five years old, right here.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870
I had just moved
to a new school,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.280
and I had a hard time
assimilating and fitting in.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.682
LAURA LING: Why were
kids bullying you?

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.140
DAVID WANG: Because
I was typically

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.050
one of the smallest kids and
the skinniest kid, the youngest

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.820
as well.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.700
My legs were so skinny that
I had to wear braces on them

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.320
because my quads were so weak.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.750
I was really insecure.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.570
I just was a really shy kid.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.970
I was not confident in myself.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.352
LAURA LING: How often
would you get bullied?

00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:58.880
DAVID WANG: Almost on
a daily occurrence.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.580
There were a couple
really vivid incidents

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.570
that still are in my mind.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.480
Once I was pulled back and
choked by a bully and strangled

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.210
and slammed to the ground.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.450
And no one really helped me.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.685
People around me were actually
laughing and ridiculing me.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.310
LAURA LING: How did
that make you feel?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.520
DAVID WANG: When you are
bullied, and you're put down,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.000
you really feel helpless.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.460
I decided to just
isolate myself.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.530
I would lie in bed
at night, and I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.580
would think about the knife
set downstairs in my kitchen.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.830
And I would think OK, if
I just took these knives

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.007
and I, you know, cut myself,
I bet no one would care.

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:40.590
I didn't know how
to control my anger.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.210
I didn't have an outlet at all.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.410
I mean, one time I punched
a wall, broke my hand,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.446
and that kind of was an
epiphany for me after that.

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:49.820
You know, I have
to start finding

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.403
a different kind of
outlet or else I'm

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.630
going to end up hurting myself.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.390
LAURA LING: So what did you do?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.060
DAVID WANG: So instead
of punching things,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.600
I started working
out in my room.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.750
I felt invigorated.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.160
I felt really happy and focused.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.990
I felt really just alive.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.080
LAURA LING: And how
has this ritual fitness

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.510
changed your life?

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.810
DAVID WANG: So it
started with that,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.060
working out in my
bedroom, but it was really

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.730
training in the gym that
I fell in love with it.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.470
And I was actually
around other people,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.590
so it wasn't like
me isolating myself.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.100
When I go to the gym, I always
take at least 15 minutes

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.730
to just put in my
headphones and visualize

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.250
what I'm going to do that day.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.880
If you're not focused, you're
just going through the motions,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.037
and that's not going to
give you the best results.

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:38.870
LAURA LING: When you
look in the mirror now,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.470
who is the person that you see?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.940
DAVID WANG: I see a lot
more confident person.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.960
I see someone who's
made a lot of progress,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.350
and most of all I see
someone who is on a journey.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.170
The gym is symbolic in my life.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.030
It's just a haven for me.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.965
It's given me my
closest friendships.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.730
I could even say it's kind
of like a sanctuary for me,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.910
because it's really
therapeutic for me to be there,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.515
and I decided to
become a trainer

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.200
and inspire and
motivate other people,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.444
and I just fell in love
with that, as well.

00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:08.735
LAURA LING: What would you
say to that young person who

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.864
is being bullied and beaten up?

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:12.780
DAVID WANG: I think life
takes you on a course

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.300
that sometimes you just don't
know what's going to happen.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.040
And I personally
never would have

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.730
thought I would be at USC,
having a passion for fitness

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.544
like I do right now.

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.850
It will make you
stronger, and that's

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.000
what I would say to
me 12-year-old self--

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.588
to just stay strong
and push through it.

00:03:29.588 --> 00:03:30.584
You will be OK.

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:47.720
LAURA LING: Bullying
is something

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.330
that sadly too many
people face in life,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.360
but I hope you were inspired
by David's story of strength

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.520
and determination.

And you can watch another
story about a young dancer

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.870
whose discipline and
passion have allowed

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.117
her to live out her dream.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.950
RIO ANDERSON: As a
student, each performance

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.415
matters so much, because
you just don't have as many.

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:10.360
And in the competitions, you
only have one chance on stage.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.600
It's a lot of pressure.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.150
