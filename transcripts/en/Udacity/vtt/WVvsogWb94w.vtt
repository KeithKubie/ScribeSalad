00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.550
Warfarin. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that acts by binding and

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.784
inhibiting a protein called VKORC1. Now

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:15.220
VKORC1 normally helps recycle vitamin

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.510
K. It takes it from its epoxidized form. To its reduced

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.620
form. Now it may not sound like much, it's still vitamin K. There is a chemical

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.190
change going on here, but that's a huge difference in allowing a certain kind

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.750
of vitamin K to promote blood clotting.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.260
VKORC1 recycles this vitamin K and promotes the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.310
production of a reduced vitamin K that

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.630
promotes blood clotting. Now, warfarin's an anti-coagulant,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.120
or something that inhibits blood clotting. Because

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.630
it actually blocks the activity of VKORC1. If

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.870
you block VKORC1, then you can't get the epoxidized form

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.740
of vitamin k back to the reduced form. So you don't

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.420
get as much blood clotting. You inhibited blood clotting. Now,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840
most of us realize that blood clotting in a good thing.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.200
Especially when you hurt yourself. When you get an injury

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.060
on your skin, and your, your blood starts spilling out, you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.550
want it to stop spilling out, so it clots, and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.000
that's a good thing. But sometimes blood clotting can happen inside

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
your blood vessels, inside your arteries. And anytime that happens

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.400
it could be really bad, because we're going to block the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.860
flow of blood in your body. So if you have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.180
an overactive blood clotting system, you might be at more

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.330
risk of blocking vessels. And if you have an under-active

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.130
blood clotting system, you may not have enough clotting when

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.370
you need it when you get injured. Now the efficacy

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.010
of Warfarin, or its effectiveness, is measured by how well

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.020
it inhibits this overall vitamin K recycling. A measure

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
of how effective it is at inhibiting VKORC1. So which

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.680
of the following would result in an increase or higher

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.390
efficacy of warfarin? Strong inhibition of VKORC1 or weak inhibition?
