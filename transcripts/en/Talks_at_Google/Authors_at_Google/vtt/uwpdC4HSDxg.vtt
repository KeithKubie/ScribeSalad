00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.530
Steve: Welcome everyone. I'd like to welcome
our speaker today, Ari Juels. Ari is the head

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.590
of RSA Laboratories which is part of EMC and
he's written a fiction book about a young

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.789
cryptographer who stumbles upon a plot involving
ancient cults and a lot of intrigue.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.650
And a little background of Ari. He's actually
a, has a background in Latin literature and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.270
mathematics and graduated as a Ph.D. from
Berkeley, and surprisingly his main character

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.680
is also a Ph.D. from Berkeley with a background
in classics.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.100
So I'd like to just turn it over to Ari and
welcome him to speak about his book.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.820
[applause]

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:54.109
Ari Juels: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to
all of you for coming today.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.170
Many first time novelists support themselves
with day jobs and I'm no exception. As Steve

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.930
mentioned I work as the Chief Scientist of
RSA Labs, the research arm of RSA, a company

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.940
that some of you are probably familiar with.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.940
My lab's research is on computer security
and cryptology, encryption and other techniques

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.720
for protecting computer systems.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.300
So my day job is like that of many of you
in the audience. But I want to stress that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.880
my novel isn't written for computer scientists.
It's written for readers; for ordinary readers.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.970
So there's a tiny bit of math in the book,
but not very much and there are only two lines

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.000
of pseudo code in the entire novel.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.830
I am going to talk to you a little bit about
computer security and cryptology because they

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.030
loom large into 'Tetraktys'. But of course
I'm not wearing my RSA labs hat and I'm not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.039
gonna talk about research.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:49.619
I'm gonna talk to you instead about a collision
of worlds between ideas in modern cryptology

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.509
and the vision of a philosopher in ancient
Greece.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.061
At first glance, computer security and the
ancient world don't seem to have much to do

00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:01.960
with one another. But by the end of this talk
I hope you'll see how these two worlds are

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.280
coming together and how in the light and heat
of that collision the adventure and mystery

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.640
story 'Tetraktys' was born.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.340
Probably the first question for most of you
in the audience is, "What in blazes does the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.951
word 'Tetraktys' mean?" And, and of course
I'll get to that.

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:23.800
I feel that book talks for fiction at least
are kind of a tricky proposition. When a bakery

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.920
wants you to buy a cake they give you a sample.
But a book isn't like a cake; one bite of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.980
a cake tastes like the rest of the cake. But
one chapter in a book doesn't taste, as it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.880
were, like all of the others.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.320
So what I would like to do instead, is to
try to entice you with something more atmospheric.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.830
Call it the aroma of the book.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.840
I am going to read some sample passages, but
I'm gonna give you a good deal of background

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.480
for the story and a little bit of visual support
in the form of just a few slides.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.730
I'm pretty sure I'm not the first novelist
to use Power Point and this may be a somewhat

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.390
dangerous thing, but I hope you'll bear with
me.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.370
Okay. So our story begins with some strange
computer infiltrations. We're not talking

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.420
about vanilla hackers stealing credit card
numbers or about foreign powers spying on

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.290
corporations like the Aurora attacks that
you've been dealing with here at Google. It's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.230
much stranger than that.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.590
The book opens with a passage about an Assistant
Secretary of State named Helen Abel and she's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.380
simply having a little problem with her calendar.
So let me read the first chapter to you. I've

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.200
truncated it a bit.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.280
[pause]

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.150
"Helen Abel, Assistant Secretary of State
for European Affairs, looked gradually into

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.940
the distance from a 17th century chateau.
She visually traced the sandy avenue that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.850
ran the access of the vast gardens. Beneath
her lay two garden beds embroidered with green

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.970
arabesques of faultless symmetry; low trimmed
hedges winding amid a soil of rich, reddish

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.650
brown. These great carpets led from the terrace
of the chateau to the center of the gardens

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.520
where circular fountains sent aloft a towering
plume of water. Beyond lawn stretched smooth

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.160
and green around basins in which rings of
jets gave forth aqueous crowns. Near the horizon,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.540
the Grand Canal spread its thin mirror of
water under a tiny portico.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.040
Still further in the distance, visible as
a notch in the trees, was yet another rectangular

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.000
lawn thrusting the strict ethic of geometry
into the surrounding forest up toward the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.320
sky.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.340
The only inhabitants of the garden were statues
disposed here and there in decorous solitude;

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.400
French ghosts of Roman copies of Greek originals;
gods and heroes, Diana, Venus, Jove and Apollo,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.340
stone animated with the memory of motion.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.690
She'd been leaning into the huge monitor on
her desk to immerse herself as thoroughly

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.820
as possible. She now tilted back into the
chair behind her smoky glass helm and looked

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.570
again at the screen. She really shouldn't
be spending so much time fussing with these

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.020
videos.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.350
On vacation in France the previous week after
a Summit she'd fantasized about a woman, what

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.850
a woman of her status might have been centuries
ago. Not a senior bureaucrat, but a great

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.050
and noble lady. She'd looked at costumes,
jewelry, palaces and gardens and spent many

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.320
thousands of dollars on antiques and reproductions
in Paris.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.630
She'd even bought an 18th Century tiara set
with diamonds and sapphires. While other tourists

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.400
were only able to look uncomprehendingly and
snap photos, she had beheld her own reflection

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.260
in the glass cases of the museum aptly superimposed
upon the jewels, dresses and other treasures

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260
within.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.691
But now it was back to work. She had a staff
meeting in an hour. She turned to the black

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:45.950
viper-like microphone rising from the pool
of glass that was her desk. 'Calendar' she

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.120
commanded.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.360
The garden dissolved from the monitor giving
way to the page of a calendar scattered with

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.520
flags and icons, somewhat like a military
map. A warning message highlighted by a gaudy

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.919
red bar blinked at the top of the screen and
a window popped up: "Reminder missed appointment."

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.360
What appointment could she have missed? Had
she simply neglected to click on reminders

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.060
early in the week or did her admin screw up
again?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.320
She spoke again in the direction of the viper.
"Go to missed appointment." The screen turned

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.460
a gray blur; a sound like pouring rain saturated
the speakers; the calendar software made page

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.680
turning noises with each traversed week; and
the weeks now whished stormily backwards.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.639
In the corner the year was still displayed,
but the last digit dropped quickly, three,

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.380
two one, zero, nine, eight; the second digit
also moved backward though more slowly.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.020
'Stop,' Secretary Abel shouted. The year stood
at 1965; the week was empty of meeting. 'Go

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.919
to missed appointment,' she repeated in annoyance.
Hand it to Microsoft that was one hell of

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.160
a bug or worse could it be a virus?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.199
The furious patter of flipped pages resumed.
She watched the slowly receding decade digit,

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:58.590
1950s, 1940s, 1930s; the century was rounded
and then 1890s, 1880s, 1870s. 'Stop,' she

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.820
cried again, freezing the year at 1872.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.050
'Christ,' she thought, 'maybe it was something
worse than a bug.' She spoke more loudly and

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.350
precisely, 'Go to missed appointment.' The
vertiginious backward sweep resumed.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.199
This time she watched in bewildered passivity.
It had never occurred to her to wonder, 'how

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:23.300
far back do these calendars actually go?'
1830s, 1820s, 1780s, 1770s, 1760s; the noise

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.790
ceased abruptly and a page appearing, appeared
displaying the week of 10th June 1754 and

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.340
fixed itself on the screen.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.210
A new message appeared, 'Missed appointment.
Should the Office Assistant schedule a new

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.970
one?' In fact several appointments over the
course of the week were marked as missed.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.509
The latest of these on a Friday evening flashed.
She had enough French to read, 'Ball at the

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:50.920
residence of Monsieur deCarzeneau Saint-Germain-des-Pres.'
Saint-Germain-des-Pres was a station in the

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.660
Paris Metro, that she knew. She had no idea
who Monsieur deCarzeneau was.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.440
She explored nearby entries on the calendar
looking for evidence of a bug in the software.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.710
There were so many appointments that it seemed
as though somebody else's life had been accidentally

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.960
grafted into an unlikely part of her calendar.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.570
'This was like finding a hidden passageway
in an old house,' she thought. 'Rather fun,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.320
actually.'

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.949
It soon became clear why the ball along with
many other social engagements had been missed.

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:21.680
It appeared that the owner of this portion
of the calendar had become bedridden with

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.210
a long illness. The ministrations of a Doctor
Dachmoi and a Doctor Parre had began in April

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.740
of 1754. They'd progressed from regular to
frequent over the course of May. By the beginning

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.269
of June, these doctors were in constant attendance.

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:40.379
Had Secretary Abel's historical medical French
been richer she would have deciphered descriptions

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:45.629
of a vigorous regimen of cupping, bleedings,
and the administration of poisonous metals.

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:50.050
These medical rigors culminated on the 15th
of June when the patient had her last appointment

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:56.399
in the book. This was annotated 'la mort',
death. The 15th of June she observed was her

00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:01.540
birthday. The fun took an unnerving turn.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.910
She went further back; there were dozens of
trivial engagements which seemed vaguely but

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:10.670
impalpably to trigger memories. Then on the
18th of December 1730 there was Aunt Jean's

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.290
funeral. Could she remember the day, the weather?
Was the low hanging gray sky a post-dated

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.329
symbolic trick of memory?

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:21.110
Her sister to whom she hadn't spoken in three
years called to tell her that Aunt Jean was

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.519
dead. Two weeks later a lawyer hired by her
sister called to tell her that there was a

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:29.100
crazed boyfriend of sorts in the picture,
and she remembered her disgust at how the

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.509
word 'boyfriend' was used to describe the
80 year old man.

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:36.339
The lawyer was trying to pry the old woman's
legacy away from this interloper. The boyfriend

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:38.639
wanted to funnel it to a church.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:42.139
Times had been difficult in these early days
when she was getting her Master's Degree.

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:45.379
The aunt had been a wealthy widow, a fragile
octogenarian.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.569
Even while her aunt was living, she had never
been entirely successful fending off daydreams

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:53.589
of an inheritance. She almost never saw the
old woman who refused to leave the Bronx where

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:55.610
Helen herself certainly wasn't gonna go.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.899
The aunt had sent fifty dollar checks in garish
greeting cards on Helen's birthday and on

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:04.269
holidays. Helen had always sent back dutiful
thank yous. She simply hadn't noticed that

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:07.149
nothing had come from Aunt Jean for a year
and a half.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.040
Her sister having gone to clean out the apartment
and called her again. The old woman it turned

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.970
out had been a miser and a packrat and had
lived in squalor. The apartment was a morass

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.149
of burned out light bulbs, moldy wallpaper,
broken radiators, crumbling plaster, heaps

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:25.189
of old newspaper waiting to catch fire, mice
and tattered doilies, amid a miasma of dust,

00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:27.019
furniture polish and urine.

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:32.089
Helen had felt unspeakably guilty and had
palliated her guilt by telling herself that

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.959
the old woman had never asked for her help.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:39.649
The calendar, however, made a firmer accusation.
In a matter of fact way, like a reminder for

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:45.040
a lunch appointment, which it was, the entry
read, 'Poisoning of Aunt Jean.' 'No,' she

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.600
protested out loud. 'No, I know what that
means. That's a lie.' She shook her head.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.660
'It wasn't my fault,' she said to herself.
'If she'd ever asked for help ever, I would

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.670
have helped her.'

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.560
She dug angrily deeper into the calendar.
What other accusations were there? She read

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.429
and reread the calendar entries trying to
ferret out all of the secret correspondences.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:07.629
If a history of the grand dame matched her
own, then she had only two more years to live.

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:10.749
Her antecedent had died at the age of 49.

00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:14.179
Her meeting was beginning in a matter of minutes.
Bewildered and exhausted and paying little

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.429
attention to what she was doing, she made
her way back to her own era.

00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:21.279
Instead of keying the current date into the
computer, she held down the forward arrow

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:27.860
key with her index finger. The weeks advanced;
the years hastened by, 1750s, 1760s, 1770s,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.389
1780s. She traversed the blank corridors devoid
of appointments of the late 18th, the 19th,

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:38.300
the early and mid-20th century. From Aunt
Jean's funeral and the balls, fetes and deaths,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.170
back to her own epic.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:45.929
Rounding her birthday in the year 1970 she
came upon the following entry: 'an. 1970 - an.

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:51.269
1754 = 215 = 63 hic incipit saeclum vitae
novum. [Here begins a new cycle of life.]

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:52.269
Reincarnate.'"

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:53.269
[sound of pages turning]

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:58.382
Attacks like this against Secretary Abel multiply
as the story gathers pace. There are strange

00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:04.910
references to reincarnation, numerology, like
the game here with dates that Helen Abel came

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:10.029
across, and vegetarianism. The attacks become
so serious and widespread that the National

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:13.439
Security Agency gets involved. And what do
they find?

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:18.100
They trace the attacks to what seems to be
a cult of followers of the ancient philosopher

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.699
Pythagoras who was active in the sixth century
B.C. So you see a, a bust of him here.

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:29.059
Now we tend to think of Pythagoras as the
fellow who discovered the Pythagorean theorem

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:34.249
which, which in fact he probably didn't, but
you'll remember we learn about this theorem

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:40.170
in school; it's a theorem about right triangles.
You see it here; a2 + b2 = c2.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.579
But Pythagoras was actually much, much more
than just a small torment to junior high school

00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:49.860
students. He really was a philosopher in the
broadest sense of the word. And in fact he's

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.519
even credited with coining the very word "philosophy."

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:58.410
He and his followers created one of the earliest
notions of a political utopia and actually

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.560
seized control of a city in southern Italy
to try to realize this, this vision.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.869
But getting back to mathematics. It was a
very strange affair in Pythagoras' day. It

00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:14.970
was in many ways more like sorcery than science.
We don't have a terribly accurate picture

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.429
of what Pythagoras and his followers were
like, but in some ways they weren't all that

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:23.799
different from the people you might come across
say across the Bay in Berkeley.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:29.100
For instance, they were probably vegetarian;
they believed in reincarnation. In fact they

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.049
believed in transmigration of souls; this
idea that you might die and wake up a cow

00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:40.139
or a house cat. And they wore unusual clothing.
Pythagoras, for instance, wore a white robe

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:45.779
and a gold diadem. And Pythagoras himself
may actually have claimed to be an incarnation

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:48.949
of the god Apollo.

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:53.230
They had other habits we can't begin to understand
and probably never will. Some of their maxims

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.089
have come down to us. Some are sensible, like
for instance, one of their maxims was "Eat

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:03.119
not in the chariot." In other words, don't
eat while you're driving. Others are just

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:07.329
weird and foreign, particularly if you're
vegetarian, like keep away from the vinegar

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:09.389
bottle; an inscrutable one that.

00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:14.209
They considered it a crime to throw stones
into fountains and they said, "No matter you

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:20.379
do, don't ever, ever catch a cuttlefish."
Really strange stuff.

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:25.720
But one thing they believed in makes them
a lot like us, given how our world is pervaded

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.939
by computing. In particular, they believed
above all in the primacy of number. They believed

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:37.299
that numbers were the fabric of the universe
and they believed this in a way that resonates

00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:39.260
particularly well in our digital world.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.549
[pause]

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:46.319
So this idea about the supremacy of number
was encapsulated in a sacred symbol for the

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:50.139
Pythagoreans called the Tetraktys; you see
it up here.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:55.470
The tetra part as you may have guessed means
four. There's really no good translation for

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.720
the full word 'Tetraktys', perhaps the best
translation is something like the essence

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.869
of fourness.

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:09.160
Anyway you see it's a pyramid of ten dots
aligned in four rows. This one symbol for

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.129
the Pythagoreans embodied the foundations
of the universe.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:19.220
So let's start with music, for instance. We
number the rows as here. And now look at the

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.980
ratios that those numberings define; the three
different ratios defined by the Tetraktys.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.450
Well, let's start with a ratio 1:2. If you
take a string and pluck it; let's suppose

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:37.859
it produces the note C; and then you take
that string and you exactly double its length,

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:45.290
you'll again get the note C, only it will
be one octave lower. So the ratio 1:2 in the

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.119
Tetraktys defines the octave.

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:53.540
Similarly the ratio 2:3 defines the interval
of a fifth; roughly speaking that's a span

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.350
of five keys on the piano. And 3:4 defines
an interval of a fourth; roughly a span of

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:04.309
four keys on the piano. That's in a, a differently
tempered world but I won't get into that.

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:11.660
So with this reasoning the Tetraktys encapsulated
the basics of, of music and consequently the

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:18.629
idea of the harmony of the spheres; the resonant
substance of the cosmos, the universe.

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:22.660
The Tetraktys also encapsulates the basics
of geometry and I'll just go through this

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.220
very quickly.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:31.160
The first row is, is a point; zero dimensions.
The second row contains two dots; you connect

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.669
them you get a line; that's one dimension.
The third row contains three, they form a

00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:41.149
triangle; two dimensions. And the fourth contains
four dots; if you connect them up like this

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:43.769
you get a pyramid; three dimensions.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:49.470
So all of the known dimensions of our universe,
the ones that we experience at any rate, are

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.410
encapsulated in the Tetraktys. So you can
think of the Tetraktys as being a little like

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.829
our periodic chart in chemistry or perhaps
even a little like string theory, only much

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:01.540
cruder and, and much more powerful.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.650
[pause]

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.910
So the Pythagoreans are the villains in our
story, if they really are villains, which

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.550
isn't at all clear. Now of course the National
Security Agency isn't accustomed to dealing

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.810
with incarnations of the god Apollo, so they
bring in an un, unusual young man named Ambrose

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.680
Jerusalem.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.180
Ambrose is finishing up his doctorate in computer
science just across the Bay in, in Berkeley,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:31.990
but he's unusual in that he was home schooled
by his father, a classical archeologist. A

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.030
really intense guy who would even taste the
dirt and artifacts to make sure that they

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.270
were authentic.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.380
Ambrose is exactly what the NSA needs because
he straddles these two worlds; the worlds

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.760
of computer science and antiquity.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.370
To give you a sense of what Ambrose is like,
I'm gonna read another passage. This is a

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.400
passage in which Ambrose has been approached
by the NSA, and he's remembering the things

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.290
that his father told him when he was a child;
the things about Pythagoras in particular.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.940
And again I've truncated the, the chapter
somewhat here.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.480
[pause]

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:18.650
[sound of pages turning]

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.880
"Outside of the two crowded tourist seasons—midsummer,
and a space of two weeks around the peak of

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.880
the fall foliage—Dorington was a picture-book
specimen of rural New England. Even as natives

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.290
of the region, if not the town, Dr. Jerusalem
and his nine-year-old son felt a sense, a

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.930
heightened sense of charm as they walked a
dirt road away from the town center. The town

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.480
consisted of a clutch of white, wooden buildings:
a clapboard post office, a general store,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.130
and a patterned New England church with a
single steeple atop a square base.&nbsp; (Savoring

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.110
the irony, Dr. Jerusalem pointed out that
such churches were modeled on the architectural

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:55.950
template of an English Catholic.)
The ground was still sodden in late afternoon.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.730
The trees turned forth cold, luxuriant greenery
touched here and there with hints of autumn.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.670
Ambrose’s photojournalist’s vest—his
favorite piece of clothing, with the pockets

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.280
of the many treasures—was just warm enough.
The bleak weather seemed to embalm the isolated

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.440
houses in a way that brought a cozy pleasure
to him. There could be no vain scrambling

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.720
to find one’s destiny, here. It lay not
more than five feet from the fireplace, as

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.990
in ancient years. His father frequently set
Ambrose ruminating on civilizations tens of

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.800
centuries old, on the frenetically unfolding,
spreading, and splintering empires of the

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.850
Mediterranean. Several times together they
had visited archaeological sites. Now, as

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.610
then Ambrose ran his mind over the traces
of antiquity. The jewelweed and blank yellow

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.820
and copper leaves scattered on the forest
floor, the broken stone walls and raw timber

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.400
of old buildings evoked, if they did not resemble,
the altars and groves of ancient Greece or

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.290
Italy.
They approached the edge of a pasture enclosed

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.060
in wire, in which horses grazed. Dr. Jerusalem
bounced the back of his hand on the top wire,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.950
the ends of which stretched between white
plastic cylinders on wooden posts. 'Not electrified,'

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.760
he said. A dappled gray horse came over to
them, and Dr. Jerusalem stroked it under the

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.320
forelock. The animal awkwardly tilted its
head up and down, as if unsure how to nod

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.220
approval and enjoy the scratching at the same
time. Dr. Jerusalem encouraged Ambrose to

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.120
pat the horse’s head.
Ambrose said, 'It's an intelligent horse.'

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.000
'Yes she is. A beautiful mare,' his father
replied stroking her head. 'There's soul in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.330
those eyes.'

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.600
'Maybe there's a person trapped in the horse
like in the story I read by Apuleius. He was

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.940
turned into an ass though. That's like a donkey.'

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.401
Dr. Jerusalem laughed, 'Yes, so maybe this
is some Russian empress who according to the

00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:41.920
great wheels of cosmic justice was reincarnated
as a mare.' He chuckled at his private joke.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.310
'Reminds me of Xenophanes' story about Pythagoras
and the dog. Have I ever told it to you?'

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.520
'I don't think so,' Ambrose said seriously.
'Pythagoras was the ancient philosopher who

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.040
coined the word "philosophy." He also invented—or
at least popularized—the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.150
Yes, I know you know that already. Well, the
Pythagoreans thought of numbers a little like

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.680
we might think of gods. Pythagoras himself
was a bit of a loon.'

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.820
'How?' Ambrose asked in surprise.
'Well, one story goes like this: He was walking

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.000
down the street in Kroton—in southern Italy—one
day, when he saw a man kicking a dog. Normally,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.630
this wouldn’t have bothered anyone in the
ancient Greek world. But Pythagoras was different.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.510
"Stop," he shouted at the rogue. "Stop that
at once! This dog is a friend!" Pythagoras

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.030
explained that the dog was a reincarnated
friend from a previous life. He recognized

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.660
him by his bark.'
'Did he take the dog home?'

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.921
'A very good question. But that’s the whole
story. My guess is that Pythagoras had probably

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:42.350
collected too many friends at home as it was,
and I doubt his wife appreciated it—although

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:47.110
Theano herself was also a formidable philosopher.
I’m sure the dog kicker was stunned, and

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.021
left his dog alone for at least a few days.'
'How cruel!' said Ambrose. 'Pythagoras should

00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:55.710
have taken the dog home with him. Is that
why he didn't eat animals?'

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.590
'You mean why he was vegetarian?'

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.590
'Yes.'
'That may be a myth. But almost everything

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:05.050
about Pythagoras is a myth, Ambrose. All we
know with anything approaching certainty is

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.110
that he was some kind of genius—and that
he abstained from eating beans and ox hearts.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:13.310
It’s not impossible that he was a vegetarian,
though.'

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.270
Father and son fell silent. An old pickup
truck with a wood-railed cargo space drove

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.500
by, forcing Ambrose and his father to the
edge of the road. Damp, colored leaves glistened

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.390
on the forest floor like the shiny coat of
an exotic, broad-backed creature. Ambrose

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.420
mused, 'I wonder whether I’d remember if
I’d been a horse in another life.'

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.150
'Do you?' Dr. Jerusalem asked. 'What would
you remember?'

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:41.180
'I don't know. Maybe my pasture. And people
petting me. And how hay tastes.'

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.190
'I've raised a confirmed Pythagorean then.
Do you know the Pythagoreans tried more or

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.190
less just that?'

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.570
'What do you mean?'

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.730
'They used to perform exercises to improve
their memories. Every evening, Ambrose, they

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.860
would try to recall all of the events that
had occurred over the course of the day. Imagine

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.790
it. They’d try to recollect finer and finer
details: faces, clothing, what they ate, whom

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.610
they saw. A word that a friend deftly pulled
out of a hat in a conversation on philosophic

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.160
doctrine in the morning. An odor that wafted
with the midday breeze near the western entrance

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.080
to the agora. Variations in the shapes of
the clouds during the afternoon before a storm

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.590
broke. How the texture of their tunics felt
from hour to hour. Then they’d try to extend

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:27.360
their recollections to more and more distant
times: previous days, weeks, and years. They

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.490
hoped, eventually—they claimed in certain
cases, as Pythagoras did—to recall events

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.370
from former lives.'
Again they walked for a long time in silence.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:42.180
The sun set and the sky began to glow. Ambrose
tried forcing on himself a consciousness of

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.240
the texture of his clothing. He attuned himself
to the places where it touched, brushed, or

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.380
lay lightly on his skin. He felt his stomach
rumble. As he turned his attention upward

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.360
to the orange evening sky, he felt a ghostly
attraction to the place—or rather, its tutelary

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.740
spirit—a desire to embrace it, to sleep
by its side. He didn’t know what this meant,

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.520
and he could not articulate it. He could only
experience the bagful of sensations and submit

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.860
to a feeling that was too grand and tenuous,
predicated too glimmeringly on a slant of

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.480
light, for him to possess.
He felt as if his father would glibly discouraging

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.340
something important. But he had no way to
protest.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.360
'So do you think the feelings are lies? Are
they bad?'

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.990
'No, not bad, Ambrose. Quite the opposite.
They're too important to be badly handled.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.080
The successors to the Pythagoreans went wrong.
They tried to reduce them to a superstitious

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.350
system, to explain these poetic and highly
individual experiences in terms of a simplistic

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:40.850
universal, like reincarnation or numbers.
I can’t prove it, but the original Pythagoreans

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:46.390
to my mind clearly believed in living in the
world. Memory—historical, personal—of

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.730
course it's the substance of life. Without
that depth of perception, we’re Cyclopes,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.570
one-eyed monsters. But today we replace our
human memories with computer memories, with

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:00.540
exomemories and exominds. That spells the
death of nostalgia, the loosening of the deep

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.330
cord with which an ancient ruin or this spot
of countryside resonates in you, Ambrose.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.580
Recall that "memory" in Greek was the mother
of the muses.'

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.630
'I know.'
'The world is placing less and less value

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.600
on such things. Fewer and fewer people with
memory these days. Memory has been shunted

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.300
off to a nursing home. The muses will follow
soon. I have you learn poetry by heart to

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.260
nourish your spirit and your mind—to glue
it to your soul, Ambrose. That’s just one

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.750
reason I’m educating you yourself. Do you
understand?'

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.750
'I think so.'

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.750
'Do you know the famous poem by Frost about
the two paths that "diverged in a yellow wood"?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.790
The Pythagoreans called it the Furca Pythagorica,
the Pythagorean Fork. They represented it

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:44.470
by the letter upsilon. Upsilon resembles our
capital letter Y, right? It’s forked. You

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.470
will face the Furca Pythagorica many times
in your life, Ambrose. I’ve led you down

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.070
a different branch of the fork than nearly
anyone else will follow.'

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.610
Ambrose looked at the road behind them which
lay straight as far as the eye could see.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.770
He held up two fingers as though in a sign
of victory.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:05.330
'What happened to them?' he asked. 'To the
Pythagoreans? They chose the wrong branch?'

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.310
'The Pythagoreans were the original utopians,
Ambrose. Bringers of the gods’ fire to Earth,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.260
if you will. The first aristocrats in the
true sense of the word. I don’t mean lazy

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:18.500
snobs from privileged families with a ‘de’
or ‘von’ in their names. Just the opposite.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.980
I mean that they tried to create a community
of aristoi, the ‘best’—noble, wise,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:28.000
elect guardians of civilization. It was too
much. Most of Pythagoras’s followers couldn’t

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.050
understand. Pythagoras had unearthly mental
gifts and vision. He was strange; he was godlike.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.790
Some of his early followers forgot what they
learned. Plato, Augustine, More, Jefferson—they

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:43.690
all owed a debt to Pythagoras. They remembered
some of the important teachings. But too many

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.450
have forgotten.'
Dr. Jerusalem stopped and put his hand on

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:52.200
Ambrose’s shoulder. 'I sometimes lose sight
of how young you are. But this is one of the

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.520
burdens I'll have to place on your shoulders.
We’ll make sure that you don’t forget

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.230
entirely. You’ll be rooted in other times
and places. It 's the only way to understand

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.440
your own. You’ll be one of the last with
the gift of a classically educated mind, Ambrose.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.860
The barbarians are again sweeping over the
land, and it’s time to retreat to Hibernia—to

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:16.320
bide our time across the sea. Perhaps the
aristoi will come again. But perhaps you’ll

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320
be alone.'
[pause]

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:26.770
[sound of pages turning]

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.300
Now where does the mathematical view of the
Pythagoreans come together with modern cryptology?

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.880
In other words, why is Ambrose at the right
intersection of ideas?

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.580
The NSA believes that the cult of Pythagoreans
has used its mathematical prowess to break

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:46.070
a cryptographic algorithm known as RSA; many
of you are probably familiar with it. Named

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:54.500
after its inventors at MIT in 1977, Rivest,
Shamir and Adleman. Here's a picture dating

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:00.950
from that decade obviously. Some of you will
see a nice little joke on the blackboard there.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:06.080
Most of you in this audience probably know
that RSA is a real algorithm used in nearly

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.759
every computing system in the world today.
It operates, for instance, when you send your

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:13.830
credit card information over the Internet
and a little lock appears in the corner of

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.190
your browser, as, as here.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:21.380
So breaking RSA would compromise computing
systems in a devastating way. It would basically

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.940
undermine the whole trust infrastructure of
the Internet. In fact at this very moment

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.530
about a mile away at the Moscone Center, the
RSA Conference is taking place. This is a

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:37.809
huge industry conference staged every year
by the company RSA, and Rivest, Shamir and

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:40.250
Adleman are probably there at this, this very
moment.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:49.920
Now you see here the basic formula; one of
them for RSA m = cd mod pq. It looks a little

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.740
like
e=mc2, right? It's got the same sort of simplicity

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.760
and, and elegance.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.270
Now the Pythagoreans believed in the power
of a very particular type of mathematics,

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:08.530
based on integers. And closest in spirit to
what we would call number theory today. Mathematicians

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.890
who specialized in this area used to pride
themselves on studying the most useless form

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:19.840
of math. They believed that their discipline
enjoyed a kind of peerless intellectual purity.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.500
We know that calculus is useful, but they
asked themselves, "What possible use could

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.170
there be for things like prime numbers?"

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:33.510
Well Pythagorean ideas about numbers and their
supremacy; all this numerological gobblygook

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.830
seems little silly at first blush, but Pythagoreans
were even writing prayers to numbers like

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:44.240
their Tetraktys. But the earth shook under
the feet of those number theorists a few decades

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.760
ago. Prime numbers suddenly found a use; protecting
secrets, cryptology.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.900
So these number theorists found themselves
whisked away from their ivory towers into

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.250
the fortress of the NSA.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.840
Now Ambrose realizes that as computing gravitates
toward the center of our universe and cryptography

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.940
spreads, the whole Pythagorean idea of prowess
in number theory, of secrecy and so forth,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:15.450
doesn't seem so far off base any longer. Pythagoras
said famously that the universe is number

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:23.050
and he meant it in a mystical way. Well cryptology
directly links the knowledge of numbers with

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:29.590
the unraveling of secrets and control of what
we might even think of as divine forces, in

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.510
a loose sense. So it gives body to the mysticism.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.200
[pause]

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.900
As many of you know, to break the RSA algorithm
all you have to do is solve the following

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.210
very simple problem. I randomly picked two
numbers, call them P and Q. I generate them

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:50.300
behind my back and I multiply them behind
my back. Now these are prime numbers; they're

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.830
divisible only by themselves and one, as,
as many of you know.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:59.891
So we'll call the product of these two integers
N. So now what I do is I give you N and your

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:06.550
task is to figure out the original P and Q,
as it were to split this number N.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:12.210
When P and Q are very big, and so therefore
when N is very big, this problem is believed

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:18.790
to be very hard; and by big I mean really
big. Here's, here's an example of what N might

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.590
look like in the real world.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:28.210
So this is the cornerstone of the RSA algorithm;
this problem of factoring as it's called.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.970
And this is the problem that the NSA thinks
that the Pythagoreans have solved in order

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.860
to crack the RSA algorithm.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.290
As the story gathers pace, messages like the
one that Secretary Abel came across multiplied.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:45.750
Other powerful people start to be menaced.
So how do Ambrose and the NSA sleuth out the

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:51.570
identities of the Pythagoreans? They use a
number of techniques: there's classical scholarship;

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:57.580
there's gumshoe sleuthing; and computer forensics
also come into play.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.790
So let me read a last bit from the book. This,
this bit needs a little bit of explanation.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:08.610
The messages left by the Pythagoreans like
the one left for Secretary Abel have been

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:14.230
essentially flawless, but Ambrose and the
NSA noticed a typo in one of them. In one

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.751
message the word "Syracuse," like the name
of the town in upstate New York, which is

00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:25.650
also the name of an, a city in the ancient
world, Greek city, is misspelled. Somehow

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:30.700
the letter "e" dropped off the end and they
ended up with Syracus instead of Syracuse.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.110
It's a tiny, tiny clue, but it turns out to
be critical.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.700
So in this passage there's a conversation
taking place between Ambrose and Rochelle

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.520
his supervisor at the NSA.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.700
[pause]

00:32:47.700 --> 00:33:00.440
[sound of pages turning]

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.130
"Ambrose prepared another list of books and
they again sent out to the library. In the

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.270
meantime he read about the history of Huron
and the City of Syracuse extracting what he

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:13.760
could from the reference books on hand. Rochelle
searched the Web to learn some rudiments.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.250
'Look here. I found a portrait,' she announced,
swiveling her monitor to show Ambrose photographs

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:23.140
of the two sides of a silver coin on auction.
The reverse depicted a galloping cavalryman

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.620
carrying a sphere. The obverse showed a beardless
man in profile with a prominent round chin

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:34.130
and a small ear; his curly mass of hair bound
in a slender band tied from behind.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.130
'He looks young for a king.'

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:41.870
'That's thanks to Alexander the Great. He
started the vogue in boyish looks for conquerors.'

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.620
'Apart from that,' Rochelle said, 'every Website
has the same historical snippet on Huron.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.520
Nothing more than you told me. Any luck on
your end?'

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.820
'No. Not yet.'

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.940
'Really, Ambrose. Are we chasing our tails?
Can one letter really mean all that much anyway?

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.691
Syracuse, Syracus. Is it really such a big
deal? Couldn't it just be a spelling error

00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:00.691
or a typo?'

00:34:00.691 --> 00:34:06.260
'It could be a typo. In that case it may not
mean much, but every other piece of writing

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:11.399
we've seen from the neo-Pythagoreans or that
I have at least, has been more or less flawless.'

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:13.460
'True. But a typo?'

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.819
'That doesn't answer your question, does it?'

00:34:15.819 --> 00:34:17.480
'Can a single letter be important?'

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.510
'Yes, absolutely.'

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:23.419
'There's a town in northern Italy called Cortona.
Ancient tradition asserts that the tomb of

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:28.669
Pythagoras lies there. But Pythagoras probably
never visited northern Italy. It was a mistake.

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:33.480
Somebody confused Cortona with Cratona, the
Latin name for the City of Crotone in southern

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.539
Italy.'

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:39.020
'In classical literature these little errors
are everything. For example, the original

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.869
name of the author The Aeneid was Vergil,
that's spelled v-e, but then in the Middle

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:49.470
Ages when he was believed to be a magician
of some kind, it became Virgil, v-i. You can

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:54.980
tell a Brit from an American by his spelling.
For instance, the Brit spells it v-e, while

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.169
the American spells it v-i.

00:34:56.169 --> 00:35:01.019
Where it gets especially interesting is in
Medieval manuscripts. Everyone has spelling

00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:05.559
errors and they're like differences in DNA;
they mark time and pedigree and they allow

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:10.299
philologists to date manuscripts and place
them at a kind of family tree.'

00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:15.109
'So you're hoping that this missing "e" may
be our key DNA marker? Was Syracuse every

00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:17.670
spelled Syracus by the Greeks?'

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.520
'No. I've looked it up in Little and Scott.
There were several variance on the name in

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:28.329
Greek, the Ionian Syracusi,' Ambrose said.
He continued, 'And also the Doric and others.

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:32.430
I'm pretty sure that Syracus is the modern
German spelling, but I just can't see any

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.109
reason for writing Syracus in English.'

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:41.579
'I see. So to put it in your terms, the word
Syracus is a mutation of some kind.'

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:45.160
'Well, yes,' Ambrose replied. 'I suppose you
could say that.'

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.599
'But that makes it distinctive, you see?'"

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:48.910
[pause]

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:56.810
The NSA ends up plunging into various types
of computer forensics to figure all of this

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:01.589
out and actually a remarkable thing happened
while I was writing this story. I was making

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:07.220
up certain forensic techniques in Tetraktys
to track down the Pythagoreans as it were,

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.580
when this patent suddenly surfaced describing
exactly the techniques I was developing in

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:19.890
this fictional context. Only I hadn't filed
that patent; it was the NSA. So it's just

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:24.289
one of these wonderful coincidences I guess
I, I happened to, to divine what the, what

00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:28.039
the NSA was up to as I was writing this story.

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:32.710
As the story evolves, the Pythagoreans gradually
infiltrate many parts of the world online

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:38.210
and off. Lottery numbers get changed; airline
schedules are modified; and some great event

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.579
seems to be coming to a head.

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:46.480
But it's not clear whether the Pythagoreans
are a malevolent or benign force. After all

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.089
these are the people who tried to establish
Utopia many years ago; the bringing a certain

00:36:51.089 --> 00:36:55.630
beauty to the world and reviving classical
ideals.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:37:00.799
Ambrose as you can imagine with his background,
has a yearning for these things. So he has

00:37:00.799 --> 00:37:06.400
to grapple with what's real and what's not.
And whether he may be working for the NSA

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.819
to try to hunt down and destroy a group that
may be older and wiser than we are and could

00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:18.700
bring a certain order and moral force to the
world.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.900
So who are these Pythagoreans and how do they
break the RSA algorithm? And what does ancient

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.640
Greece tell us about our own evolving digital
world and authenticity?

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.519
These, these are the questions at the heart
of 'Tetraktys'.

00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:38.450
So I hope that after hearing me speak today,
you'll accept my invitation to join Ambrose

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:43.190
on his, on his journey and explore the mystery.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.190
Thank you very much.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.190
[applause]

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:56.559
Steve: If you have questions, please use the
mic in the middle of the room.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:57.559
[pause]

00:37:57.559 --> 00:38:03.790
male voice in audience: This is a somewhat
standard question for people who have very,

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:09.999
very busy schedules and pretty big day jobs.
How were you able to carve out time to, to

00:38:09.999 --> 00:38:11.480
welcome your muse?

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.720
Ari Juels: That's a, that's a great question.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:19.150
So the first answer is that it took me over
10 years to write the book.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:24.319
The second answer is that to some extent I
don't remember and I often wonder in fact

00:38:24.319 --> 00:38:29.230
if I just happened to encounter some genie;
picked up a bottle on the beach or something

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:34.799
and made a deal. I said "Okay, you can erase
10 years of my life if a book will just pop

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:40.319
out." And, and that happened. Because I really
don't have a strong recollection of how on

00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:41.910
earth I squeezed my writing time in.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.859
[pause]

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:51.529
male voice in audience: In your book you reference
the NSA and the interactions there and in

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:55.920
the panel you'd chaired earlier this week
at the RSA conference. There's a really interesting

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.170
cultural contrast between the representative
from the NSA and the other members of the

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.170
panel.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.760
How does that, what is your characterization
of the NSA culture and how does that play

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.339
out in terms of the book? Is that, is that
a part of the book or is that really secondary?

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:13.890
Ari Juels: Well, I don't have intimate knowledge
of the culture of the NSA, of course very

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:20.009
few people outside the NSA do. So to some
extent I, I had to try to make guesses. As

00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:25.970
I mentioned, I made at least one happy technical
guess. I don't know whether the cultural guesses

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.809
that I made were accurate.

00:39:27.809 --> 00:39:34.299
Some of the elements of the book are, are
certainly farfetched, but there, there certainly

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:39.970
is a sharp difference between the academic
perspective and the, and the NSA perspective.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:45.319
And I think the little that I know has probably
percolated into the book, but I'm not sure

00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:46.820
I can give you a crisp characterization.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.820
[pause]

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.840
female voice in audience: Thank you, Ari.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.620
Ari Juels: Okay. Thank you very much.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.599
