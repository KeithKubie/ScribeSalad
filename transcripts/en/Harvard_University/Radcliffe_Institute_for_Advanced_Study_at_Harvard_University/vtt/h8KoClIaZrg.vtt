00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.990
- Good afternoon, and
welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.440
My name is Janet Rich-Edwards,
and I am the life sciences

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920
director for the Radcliffe
Institute's programs here,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.500
and I also happen to
be an epidemiologist.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.510
It has been my great
pleasure this year

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.880
that our science theme
has been on epidemics.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.580
We launched this
back in the fall

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.030
with the daylong symposium,
and we've had several lectures

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.300
over the course of the year on
epidemiology and epidemics--

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.630
everything from small fiber
neuropathy, which is a pain

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.390
condition, to the
epidemic of obesity,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.870
and we've also had the Detroit
public health commissioner

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.660
and current candidate
for governor of Michigan

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
talk about the
epidemic of poverty

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.810
and how that affects our health.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.320
Today-- I want to tell
you that if you're

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.540
interested in any of
those, they're all online

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.210
at radcliffe.harvard.edu.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
So if you're an epidemics
fan, you know where to go.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
I know many of
you are here today

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.379
for this particular topic,
which affects so many of us--

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.489
affects us personally.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.600
It affects our families.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990
I think it's very big
in our public concern

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.170
and public imagination.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.910
So it's a particular pleasure
to welcome Dr. Albert Hofman

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.250
to give a speech to us today.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
An MD PhD, he's the chair of
the Department of Epidemiology

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.660
and the Stephen B. Kay family
professor of public health

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
and clinical epidemiology at
the Harvard T.H. Chan School

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.030
of Public Health, so
right across the river.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.460
Dr. Hofman was the chairman of
the department of epidemiology

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.900
of Erasmus University
in Rotterdam

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.340
before we snagged him.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.940
He has been the science
director of the Graduate School

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.090
in Netherlands-- sorry, for
the Netherlands Institute

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.310
for Health Sciences since it
started in 1990 until 2015.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.530
He's also well-known
to us epidemiologists

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.230
as the initiator of two
population-based cohorts

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.640
of very large studies
in Rotterdam--

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.090
the Rotterdam study,
which started in 1990,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
and the Generation
R study in 2002.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.340
These studies, these
large cohort studies,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.639
target multiple common
diseases, have extensive state

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.460
of the art assessment of
the putative determinants

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.160
of those diseases, and
employ new technologies

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.150
in the setting of epidemiologic
population studies.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.310
Important for today,
Dr. Hofman is also

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.700
the initiator of the recently
established Alzheimer Cohorts

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.900
Consortium.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.510
His current research
focuses on the intersection

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.320
of public health and
clinical medicine.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.315
We will listen to Dr. Hofman
for a good 45 minutes,

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:36.690
much of this time,
and then we'll

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.510
open it for questions, which
I'm sure many of you will have.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.040
And we will, I think,
put a mike in the center.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.950
When you go to
answer a question,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.200
do us the favor of
telling us who you are

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.110
and keep questions
brief, because I think

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.370
there will be a lot of them.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.350
So with no further
ado, please join me

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.914
in welcoming Dr. Hofman.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:59.238
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:00.206
- Yes, indeed.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.710
Dr. Rich-Edwards--
Janet, I can say,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.780
it's a great pleasure
to be here-- an honor

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.150
to be at Radcliffe, also talking
about my favorite research

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.550
topic, Alzheimer's disease,
indeed, as an epidemic.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.220
And before I will show
you some evidence of that,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.150
I would like to show
you two slides that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.330
are my favorite ones and
explain, to a certain degree,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.760
what we are talking about.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.230
These slides gives
you life expectancy

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.600
at birth in record countries,
since we have good records.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.150
You see here in about
1600, the records

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.820
come from France and England.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.140
Average life expectancy
at birth was about 35.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.420
We lived up till 35.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.460
Most of us would have
been dead by now.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.090
At 1800, something very
spectacular starts.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.510
You see this increase
in life expectancy.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.010
I took this from a
paper from Jim Vaupel,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.740
an American demographer
working in Germany,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.390
and it's a beautiful paper.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.500
I decided to take
the original one.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.670
But it went on until now 2015.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.390
You see an increase in life
expectancy from about 35

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.500
till now in the record
country, 90 years of age

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.600
in women, just last
year, first time, 98,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.000
in the record country Japan.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.970
Similarly in Spain.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.310
This is just, I
think, unbelievable.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.930
From 35 to 90 in two
centuries in our species.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.360
This has never, of
course, happened before.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.310
It means, by the
way, that this line--

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.260
every four years, we add
one year in life expectancy.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.170
Every four years,
there's one year added.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.750
I summarized this for myself.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.277
You live a week, and
you gain a weekend.

00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:19.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.180
This is what it is.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.920
This is men and
women separately.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.540
Here you are.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.960
Women, and here you
are, men-- men, blue.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.740
Women live, on average
in record countries,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.570
about five years longer
on average than men.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.930
This explains a thing that
we will talk about later.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.780
And you see also that the
slopes are about the same.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.580
Their four years and one
year is about the same.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.010
There are two
moments of exception.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.680
Here, this is the Spanish flu--

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.090
1918, 1919, '17, '18, '19.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.750
And this is the epidemic
of heart disease--

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.300
myocardial infarction,
acute coronary syndrome,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.220
as we would say now.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.600
But that's particularly in men.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.710
But then on track again.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.770
Living one week and
gaining a weekend.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.290
In fact, the only exception
added to the two exceptions

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.210
that we have is
currently going on

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.390
because of the opioid
epidemic-- one of the epidemics

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.670
also to be discussed.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.900
That is a decline
in life expectancy.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.880
Overall, the trend is
very, very much upwards

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.200
in life expectancy.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.620
Now, you immediately
see this is a triumph.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.310
This is a societal
triumph at large,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.500
but there is a counter
side, and that's this one.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.980
This is a slide
taken from a study.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.960
Janet referred to it.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.880
The Rotterdam study-- it's
a town in the Netherlands,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.000
my home country at that time.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.360
And we did a study
in which we basically

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.310
examined all 15,000 people
in one district that

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.710
were 50 years or over.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.110
We knocked on all doors,
and nearly everybody

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.420
participated in that
study, and we looked then

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.140
whether they could make
the diagnosis of dementia.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.020
This was not just
on questionnaires.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.870
No, there was a
neurologist involved,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.970
there were imaging
studies, and so on.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.960
And then you see from a low
prevalence absolute number

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.320
of people that have the disease,
the proportion of people having

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.470
the disease, it goes up till,
at the age of 95, to one in two.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.710
That means that if we
live long enough, that

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.090
is to say up till
90, 95, perhaps 100,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.610
our [? foreland ?] is
perhaps a one in two chance

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.500
to have dementia or
Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.830
I use the terms more or
less interchangeably here.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.890
This is why we sit and talk
about an epidemic here.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.870
We made a calculation
for the world.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.020
Epidemiologists like to do that.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.250
And here-- this is some
number of years ago--

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.580
this is what we saw in 2001.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.370
This is what we, in fact,
see now approximately.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.720
And this is what we will
see 20 years from now.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.160
You see that in--

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.430
of course, all continents
there is an increase,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.630
but the particular increases
are in China and also

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.409
in North and Latin America.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.679
This has to do with
changes in population,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.458
particularly an increase of
the proportion of elderly

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.124
in a population.

00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:45.640
Now when you see a thing
like this, or in particular

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.790
when you see a pattern like
this-- this strong increase

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.900
with age.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.320
The very natural
question of someone--

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.630
you don't have to be a scientist
for that-- is to ask yourself,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.580
why is this?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.600
Why is there such an
increase with age?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.660
And so that is the question.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.090
Why is there this Alzheimer
or this dementia epidemic?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.260
I'm afraid I cannot give
you the answer, and you may,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.540
if you wish, still leave.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.630
Perhaps I oversold the title.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.740
But I can tell you that
I know why it is not.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.270
It is not because of this.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.940
It is not because of aging.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.000
It is not because of aging.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.040
Before that, I tell you why
I think that's the case.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.250
I perhaps have to
explain a little bit more

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.260
about what we mean by aging.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.300
There are two ways that
you can look at aging--

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:49.470
population aging and
individual aging.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.880
Population aging
effectively, essentially

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.830
is a demographic phenomenon.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.910
It is the phenomenon in
which what you see here--

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.350
people grow older.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.460
A population grows older.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.000
The proportion of elderly
in a population goes up--

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.530
the so-called--

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.300
freeze-- rectangularization
of mortality.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.590
The compression of mortality.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.120
This is the most quoted paper
in our local journal, the New

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.430
England Journal of
Medicine, the highest

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.040
journal that you want to
publish in in medicine at large.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.820
It's the most quoted
paper, and reasonably so,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.820
because this idea of
rectangularization

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.070
here in 1900--

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.700
50% dead at about the age of 50.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.890
In 1980, what was it?

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.710
About 70 or so.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.020
And now we are up to 80 overall,
perhaps, and it goes on.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.540
This is demography.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.590
This is population aging--

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.270
a very reasonable and
important concept,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.790
particularly in demography.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.220
Then we have individual aging.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:06.790
Now individual aging-- you
can think of in two ways.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.820
And I propose for your
consideration that one is false

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.960
and the other is a
reasonable way to look at it.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.260
One is the so-called
gerontologic view.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.720
It is the view that there is
an innate process of aging that

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.550
produces this-- this type
of hair color or wrinkles

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.680
or brain failure or heart
failure or liver failure

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.430
or what have you.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.510
There's an innate process.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.370
We have protocols, so to speak.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:46.560
We are designed to age, and then
at the end, it fails and falls.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.270
And then there's the other view.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.970
There is the geriatric view--

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.740
namely, the idea that
there is accumulated risk.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.810
It is not that we are programmed
to have these diseases.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.130
No, there is accumulation
of various risk factors

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.290
that may lead then to brain
failure, heart failure, liver

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.980
failure.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.860
This is a very
important distinction

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.330
because for a researcher,
the first few view

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.440
would mean that we want to look
at what is the aging process--

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.670
causes of the aging process.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.440
The second view means that
we look at specific causes

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.000
for the disease--

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.220
specific causes that may occur
over a lifetime and, in fact,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.310
generally occur over
a lifetime and that

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.830
lead then to a
particular disease.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:43.010
Now, I think that this is
the most reasonable view.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.830
In fact, I think
this view that there

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.430
is an aging process is
actually completely untenable.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.995
You find it often.

00:12:50.995 --> 00:12:52.840
These are two recent papers--

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.690
wrote very recent, I must say.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.920
I did not give you the authors
to protect their privacy,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.440
but it says, "We investigated
the aging process."

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.290
You see, in Science,
given the language.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.600
"To elucidate disease causes."

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.840
And then the authors go on
to discuss longevity, life

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.460
expectancy.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.950
And here in Nature.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:21.440
"C. elegans--" Elegans is a
little worm, a little nematode,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.260
that is used very often
to study longevity, life

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.190
expectancy-- to study aging and
its pathologic consequences.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.290
And then the authors go on to
study life expectancy again.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.620
In fact, it is indeed possible
to change the life expectancy

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.630
of this C. elegans [? with ?]
[? effect of ?] three, four,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.140
five, given particular
environmental circumstances.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.070
But not aging.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.286
He does not study aging.

00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:47.660
Now, I'm not the
first one to say

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.260
that this overall idea that
there is no such thing as aging

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.220
is untenable.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.560
So Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize
winner in immunology-- in fact,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.740
he worked on
transplant immunology

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.950
in Britain, in Cambridge.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.990
He gave his inaugural lecture
at University College in London

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.110
under the title "An Unsolved
Problem in Biology,"

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.680
and he explains there
that when we have problems

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.670
later on in life, it is
because of this accumulated

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.540
risk and various combined
risk factors over a lifetime.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.880
And then his two
colleagues, but also

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.670
particularly our
colleagues, epidemiologist

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.980
Richard Peter and
Richard Doll, the ones

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.490
that basically nailed smoking
to be the cause of lung cancer--

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.180
one of those, they did--

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.630
wrote a paper, "There is
No Such Thing as Aging"

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.130
in the British Medical Journal
quite a number of years ago.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.350
So this overall idea that
there is no such thing as aging

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.160
and that when we want to study
the consequences of living

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.190
longer that we have to
study specific causes

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.274
is not a new idea at all.

00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:01.940
And I follow it.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.250
So that brings me then, of
course, to the question.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.560
What then, if you
say it's not aging--

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.526
what can then be the causes?

00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:13.920
A category, of course,
is that we immediately

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.780
think of nowadays, and I
think rightly so, is this.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.000
Genes.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.510
Is it that genetic
factors, genes,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.310
cause Alzheimer's disease?

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.280
Is it, in fact, a
genetic disease?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.482
If you want to study
a question like that,

00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:35.940
you can do it in
a variety of ways.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.470
We, in epidemiology, we did this
in the medicine first looking

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.980
at family history of patients
with Alzheimer's disease

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.210
or dementia.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.160
You would expect people who
have suffered from dementia

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.870
that in their families,
if it's genetic,

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.890
there is more of the disease.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.520
It can also, of
course, be nurture,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.962
but it has to be more in a
family when it is genetic.

00:16:00.962 --> 00:16:02.670
Then there was a
second, very important--

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.800
and that, by the way,
this is three, four times.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.116
If you have a first-degree
family member with dementia,

00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:09.990
you have three, or times
the risk of dementia

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.020
or Alzheimer's disease yourself.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.670
Then there was a very
important observation

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.270
in patients' children
with Down syndrome

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.030
that had died at an early age.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.500
And in examining the brains
compared to children who had

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.920
died for another reason
at approximately same age,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.560
changes in the brain-- the
so-called plaques and tangles

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.330
that had been described
by Alzheimer--

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:39.210
Alzheimer's disease-- were very,
very, very much more prevalent,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.390
occurring more in the
brains of Down's children

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.330
than in reference children.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:52.180
Now that lead colleagues, when
they wanted to study genes,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.810
to chromosome 21, because
Down syndrome, of course--

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:01.620
you have a triple chromosome
21, and this was then

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.960
the first paper
that looked at that

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.980
and found a gene related
to Alzheimer's disease--

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.150
the amyloid.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.740
Amyloid precursor protein
gene chromosome 21.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.500
John Hardy, still working
at that time in Britain,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.730
then entered the US,
and now back in Britain.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.920
Beautiful paper.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.569
Nature.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:29.440
Two other genes at
the same time found--

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.450
PS1, PS2.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.750
So indeed, we had three
genes around the beginning

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.270
of the '90s of the
last century that

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.640
were related to Alzheimer's
disease and dementia.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.590
The only consideration
that was of importance

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.180
that was that this
represented less

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.640
than a tenth of a percent--

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.230
one in thousand of all patients.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:02.440
This is really, really very much
of a minority consideration--

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.910
the three of them together.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.700
Well, we wanted then
to make the next step,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:14.140
and that is a step we could make
because we got new technology.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.460
And this is a theme I would
also elaborate a little bit

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.550
on-- the importance of
technology for medicine

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.600
at large.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.170
Medical research epidemiology
as well-- population studies.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.600
It's enormous, and this
is an example of this.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.520
Genome-wide association
studies could only

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.120
be done because the whole
genomic technology had

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.350
been developed.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.480
And basically, what you do-- you
have a large group of patients

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.290
with a disease.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.230
You compare it to patients
who do not have the disease,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.530
and you look at all
genetic variants

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.260
that are different
between the two groups.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.100
This is not very much--
how shall I say--

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.800
on the basis of a very
specific hypothesis.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.050
On the contrary, it is what
we call hypothesis-free.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.650
And when you look at
those different groups

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.940
when using this
technology, you find

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.260
this is the first
paper that published.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.680
It was published on this-- one
the genome-wide association

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.900
study, you find, in
this case, 10 genes.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.810
And then all the
studies were combined.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.180
There are now about 30--

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.690
a bit more than 30 genes
known that are involved

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.680
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.662
By the way, you
see the three genes

00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:34.120
that I mentioned to you before
are not on here because they

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.630
are too rare.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.331
These are a bit more frequent.

00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:43.150
A bit more frequent, although
I will argue that also these

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.420
will not, in themselves,
explain the majority

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.090
of Alzheimer's
disease or dementia.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.640
In fact, it is considerably less
than a quarter, I would think.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.640
Now, we do not, of course study
genes for the sake of genes.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.240
We want to find something
and understand something

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.050
about the disease.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.530
And here is a kind of scheme.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.030
I don't want to go
into much detail,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.740
but that may lead to thinking
about how this disease occurs

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.490
and how genes can be involved.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.920
There are two pathways.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.710
One pathway has to do with how
the synapses in your neurons--

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.510
in your brain-- how the
neurons are connected.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.410
This is a very clear
thing that goes

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.709
wrong in Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:33.250
And there are quite
a number of genes

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.580
that we know now that have to
do with this so-called synaptic

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.360
dysfunction.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.160
Then there is an
other set of genes

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.080
that have to do with
the immune response

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.880
and inflammatory factors--

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:50.280
our immune responses too
strong or not strong enough--

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.310
are involved.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.350
We know that in
Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.010
And here are some of the genes
that are related to that.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.420
So these genes have
led to pathways

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.850
that are now further
investigated in the lab

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.020
and in population studies,
by the way, as well.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.180
I showed you, by the
way, this technology--

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.080
the technology that we use now--

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.940
15 years ago one snip, one
little variant, took about--

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.690
in, say, 10,000 people.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.110
That's what you want to
do in population studies--

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:30.370
took about six months, perhaps
a bit longer, to investigate.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.660
Now we do this in a
matter of microseconds

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.060
because it is so fast now.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.580
There has been an
enormous scaling up.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:45.160
So genes, indeed, are involved
but to a modest degree--

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.990
limited.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.680
That brings is of course
to our next question,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.240
the non-genetic factors.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.910
What are the other
possible factors

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.210
that are causing Alzheimer's
disease or dementia?

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.010
This slide is a bit of a
testimonium paupertatis,

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.510
perhaps.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:11.080
This slide I made over 25
years ago, and it still works.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.850
And we are a bit
better, but, well.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.100
Traumatic factors.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.990
You have heard, perhaps, about
the trauma-- head trauma,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.360
the dementia pugilistica.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.850
You've heard about that as a
possible model for dementia

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.260
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:36.530
You've heard about
the NFL and a model

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.410
for Alzheimer's
disease or dementia.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.060
Perhaps not.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.340
It's very interesting.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.600
One of the biomarkers
that we study now,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.155
and is quite strongly
associated and possibly linked,

00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:51.050
in that sense, with Alzheimer's
disease, is called NFL--

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.395
the Neurofilament Light.

00:22:52.395 --> 00:22:54.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.860
I don't show a slide,
but it's very interesting

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.070
because it combines the
evidence that the trauma that

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:06.350
is on your neurons, and it
combines in a kind of summary.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.830
And it's quite strongly
related to dementia

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:09.830
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.600
So yes, possibly
traumatic factors.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.620
Endocrine factors.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.460
Hormones.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.900
Yes.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.480
Although you will
see in some time

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.760
now whether there are
differences between men

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.760
and women in that, perhaps.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.150
Inflammatory factors,
already mentioned those.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:32.990
Indeed, immunologic
differences-- factors

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.060
play a role in
Alzheimer's disease.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.560
It's been discussed and
studied really extensively

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.710
now in the past, what
is it, five years or so,

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.790
and I'm quite sure we'll
get further in that.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.930
And I would like to focus
on these-- vascular factors,

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.700
your overall circulation.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.827
And I do this perhaps under--

00:23:56.827 --> 00:23:58.410
here are vascular
factors, by the way,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.770
before I give you the question.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.620
Stroke, cerebrovascular
stroke, atrial fibrillation.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.205
Diabetes mellitus is a
strong vascular factor.

00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:09.530
It has a strong effect
on the circulation.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.140
And atherosclerosis--
hardening of the arteries.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.110
Atherosclerosis-- important one.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.980
I could summarize this
section under this question.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.630
Namely, was Kraepelin right?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.270
Who was Kraepelin
to begin with--

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.450
before we say
whether he was right.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.190
This was Kraepelin.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.250
Kraepelin was a
German psychiatrist--

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.530
neurologist,
psychiatrist, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.950
arts, as they would call it
at that time, combination

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.800
of neurosciences or psychiatry.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.990
He was at the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.400
He was at the same
time proximate

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.000
contemporary of Sigmund Freud,
and they were not friends,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.350
I can tell you.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.340
He is-- if you have heard
of the DSM, the Diagnostic

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.610
and Statistical
Manual in psychiatry--

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.180
this is the classification
in psychiatry.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.210
He started this.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.170
He was the one to
work with that first

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.160
and build up the
whole classification.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.500
Kraepelin said around--

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.470
I cannot exactly tell you that
because it's undated in his

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.070
memoirs--

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.280
but it must have
been around 1910.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:34.060
He said, "I have a wonderful
coworker, Alois Alzheimer.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.800
He worked with me in Heidelberg,
and when I went to Munich

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.870
he came with me and
formed the lab there.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.960
And Alzheimer, as
a neuropathologist,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.750
has found these very
specific changes

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.400
in the brain of his patients."

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.640
It's plaques and tangles.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.480
And this is wonderful.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.130
It's wonderful.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.920
We get insight in
there, but we all know--

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.610
this is the German
professor speaking--

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.700
we all know that
dementia, largely,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.250
is a matter of
arteriosclerosis--

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.010
hardening of the arteries,
of the small arteries.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.400
We all know that in 1910.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.130
So let me try to see
whether Kraepelin was right.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.650
Before that, I show you also
here is Kraepelin again--

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.890
Emil Kraepelin, Alois Alzheimer.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.810
Here is Nissl and [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.690
For you who are a
bit in neuroscience,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.760
this is a who is
who in neuroscience

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.130
at the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.480
They sit here, by the
way-- sorry that I

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.330
slide this digression.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:42.700
They sit here south of Munich
in front of the Starnberger--

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.950
this is a bad picture, though.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.430
You cannot see it, but the
Starnberger See, the lake,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.080
is behind that.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.740
And this was an important
lake because the reason

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.640
that Kraepelin and
also Alzheimer went

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.560
to Munich from Heidelberg was
that they needed the successor

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.170
in psychiatry, the
professor of psychiatry,

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:07.490
because the previous one had
died because he walked together

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:12.410
with King Ludwig the second
into the Starnberger See,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.330
and they both drowned.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.620
King Ludwig the second is
very often referred to as mad.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.680
King Ludwig-- you have
seen movies, probably.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.960
You've seen perhaps
the castles in--

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.380
or pictures of it--

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.590
in the south of Germany.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.280
It's a bit Disneyland
avant la lettre, actually.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.460
And so the reason that Kraepelin
and also Alzheimer were there

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.790
to begin with was that
the King had died.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:45.370
Now, when we looked at this
in this Rotterdam study

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.130
that Janet referred
to, we found this.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.320
Here is what you look at.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.920
This is an artery.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.530
This is the internal
carotid artery.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:02.750
This is a bit not so good,
although a clinical neurologist

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.980
would see this in you or me,
would say, nah, not so much

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.060
to worry about.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:12.410
The moment the lumen here
gets closed for more than 80%

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.690
or 90%, then we
get into trouble,

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.150
but this is not something
very much to worry about.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:22.070
Still this here is a plaque.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.300
Here also.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.970
This predicts dementia
and Alzheimer's disease

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.380
really quite well.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.690
It is if you are in the upper
third of this with this plaque

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.960
you have three times or so the
risk of Alzheimer's disease.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.230
Given that the overall risk
is already relatively high,

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.180
that means that quite
a number of people

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.600
have this because
of atherosclerosis.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.700
Their link was atherosclerosis.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.220
A typical-- this is
three, what I say.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.950
A typical strength of
the link with a gene

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.040
would be something
like 1.1 here or so.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.022
So that is really
quite a difference.

00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:08.770
Now, other studies we could
do looking at these vascular

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.970
factors are, in fact, again
a new technology-- not so new

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.200
anymore, of course.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.480
This is an MRI machine.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.230
This was the first
MRI machine that

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.780
was installed in a population.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.280
And here you have images
like this, all types.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.050
You can see it's a
beautiful device, actually,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:34.990
and we can learn even more than
we have learned until now, I'm

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.730
quite sure.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.720
This-- what you see here
is a little infarct--

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.710
the brain infarct.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.910
Something here is our
so-called white matter lesions.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.660
These lesions, a brain infarct,
and this don't particularly

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.820
give symptoms.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.420
So it is not that you have to--
you see it in patients, so no,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.030
but still they are quite
predictive of both dementia,

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.620
depression, and stroke.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.440
Two or three times the
risk when you have those.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.800
Now given that if you look at
people, say, between 50 and 70,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.540
at least 40% has these
small brain infarcts.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.870
This, again, is a
very good reason

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.320
as a marker for the occurrence
of Alzheimer's disease

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.005
and dementia.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.480
Now, final part.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.640
I would like to
tell you something

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:38.250
about a possible more
optimistic viewpoint on dementia

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.830
and Alzheimer's disease, namely
whether that perhaps there's

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.230
a decline in dementia.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:49.450
And we could study this in the
so-called Alzheimer Cohorts

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.680
Consortium, which brings the
various population cohorts,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.000
groups of people that have
been studied, worldwide-- well,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.030
worldwide, in this case,
particularly means North

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.120
America and Western Europe--

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.460
brings it together and tells
us what overall evidence

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.260
we have for that.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.000
Now here is, first of all,
the incidence rate with age.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.060
I showed you on my first slide
the so-called prevalence.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.090
Prevalence is the number
of existing patients,

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.865
but this is the
force of morbidity.

00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:28.540
Now, how many new cases
will be there every year?

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.760
Say new patients.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.410
This tells you much more about
what the possible causes are,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.380
and here they are.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.870
This is the overall in the
various studies that are here.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.700
Overall, you see
it in the same way.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.960
Strong increase with
age, as to be expected,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.590
because if the underlying
number of new cases

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.320
goes up then, of course,
also the prevalence--

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.600
existing cases-- go up.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.670
And you see here very
strong increase with age.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:05.910
But no difference
between men and women.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.580
Here is women.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.200
What is it, red or brown?

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.380
And here are men,
exactly the same.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.370
So if you have read
this weekend an op

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:28.720
ed piece in the newspaper
that generally specializes now

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.810
in fake news-- no, no,
joke, the New York Times.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.810
But if you read a piece
of one of our colleagues

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.340
who says we should study
the differences in dementia

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.880
between men and women, perhaps
you have a question by that.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.506
Not that there is not--

00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:45.880
there are differences,
of course,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.610
between men and women in
the frequency of Alzheimer's

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:49.900
disease and dementia.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.730
In fact there are
many more women

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:53.470
who have Alzheimer's
disease than men,

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.870
but that's because
women live longer,

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.560
not because the underlying
force for the disease

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.760
is different between
men and women.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.930
So if you say we want
to particularly study

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:09.500
what we need to do to have care
of patients, and in that sense,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.070
there's a difference between
men and women, most certainly,

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.460
but in causes, it's unlikely,
at least on this basis,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.460
that these causes are
very different between men

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.510
and women.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:25.840
Now if you now look at possible
changes in this incidence--

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.790
which is the true measure
that we want to use,

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:31.090
incidence, the
force of morbidity,

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:36.190
we could study this in
this Rotterdam study

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:42.580
comparing two cohorts 1992
2001 and 2002 to 2010.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:47.530
And we could not only look at
changes in vascular factors

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.920
but also in imaging markers,
which is a very objective way

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.190
to look at the brain.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.460
And of course, that's
the incidence, the number

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.660
of new cases, of dementia.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.040
And what we observed
over that period

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:09.360
was a 20% decline in the disease
over a period of 10 years.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.210
Some time later, our
colleagues here in Framingham--

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.870
a wonderful study going
on already from 1948

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.139
in the town of Framingham,
not so far from here--

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.400
same observation.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:28.469
About a 20% decline per decade
in dementia and Alzheimer's

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:28.969
disease.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:33.440
When we combined this
for the various cohorts,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.630
and you see them here.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.469
This is relatively recent.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.659
You see here indeed an overall--

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.540
perhaps about 20%,
perhaps a bit less--

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.040
decline, if you
look at the various.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.130
This is a study in France.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.969
This is in Sweden.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.429
This is Framingham.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:55.139
This is a study in Britain.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.550
3C, France.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:03.980
Overall, very similar studies
but also a overall effect

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.250
of about 20% decline.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.710
[INAUDIBLE] this was for what
I showed you before, men, now.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:20.140
And this is for women--
very similar results there.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.300
Optimistic in that sense,
leading us, of course,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.360
to our next question.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.260
Why is this?

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.790
And I would like to link this.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.380
I will not further develop that.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.550
I'd like to link this to
what I said before-- namely,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.030
it is very likely that if you
have changes in these vascular

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.410
factors over time--

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.470
genes haven't changed
over this period,

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.530
but these vascular
factors have changed.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:47.290
The amount of
atherosclerosis, possibly,

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:51.600
has declined on the
basis of better treatment

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.800
of high cholesterol statins,
high blood pressure, less

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.310
smoking.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.260
So it's very likely.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.080
I think, that the
overall reason--

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.140
one of the major overall
reasons why we have dementia

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.650
is chronic hypoperfusion.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.770
Just for 20, 30, 40 years--

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.900
not enough blood in your brain.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.490
Not that it's 50% less.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.084
No, perhaps 10% less,
but chronic, chronic,

00:36:17.084 --> 00:36:21.180
chronic, then gradually,
on that basis,

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.531
neuronal death, leading
then to dementia

00:36:24.531 --> 00:36:25.530
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.160
And to beat that, this
chronic hypoperfusion,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.770
is basically to beat
atherosclerosis.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:37.260
It's to treat high blood
pressure, hypercholesterolemia,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.840
diabetes mellitus,
not to forget.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.910
Treat it well, and it's likely
that without us focusing very

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.510
much on that-- we did that for
reasons of preventing heart

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.070
disease and stroke--

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.070
but in the process
we possibly also have

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.740
prevented quite a number
of dementia cases.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.460
This does not mean, by
the way, this trend--

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.540
down 10%-- does not
mean that we will have,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.680
in absolute numbers, much
less dementia patients.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.510
This has to do with the fact
that we still live longer.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.100
Remember, live a
week, gain a weekend.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.060
And the price we--

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.480
so we, in some senses, pay for
that, given the current state,

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.270
is that we will have
more dementia cases.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.240
But the trends-- the
overall underlying trends

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.140
in the incidence is in
the right direction.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.110
Let me summarize what I said.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:39.650
First of all, I hope I showed
to you, as an epidemiologist,

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.270
that these population
cohort studies are really

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.190
a very, very important
resource for our knowledge.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.630
In fact, many things we
know in medicine at large

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.541
and in specific areas we know
because of these population

00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:55.040
studies.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.720
And I always like to thank
particularly our colleagues

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.646
in Framingham for going on
for 60, 70 years with this.

00:38:04.646 --> 00:38:06.520
This is quite amazing
that you keep a study--

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.160
I know this.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.760
I did-- how to keep that going.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.270
That is really quite remarkable.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.970
And this is one example
that I'm-- other examples,

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.810
obviously, now as well.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.780
Secondly, the new technologies.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.090
We cannot do without
these new technologies,

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.030
and these are really very,
very, very important.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.390
They help us very
much, and I'm therefore

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.210
optimistic overall
on there that we

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.790
will find more
causes of dementia

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.150
and know also the combination of
these causes, the interaction,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.940
because of these
new technologies.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.500
I would like you to consider,
at least, that there

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.090
is no such thing as aging--

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.000
that the fact that
we get wrinkles

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.310
and so on and also
diseases in old age

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.620
is because of
accumulation of factors

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.630
that cause these specific
diseases or these wrinkles

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.686
or what have you.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.690
I would also suggest that
the role of genes in dementia

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.050
is limited.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.300
In fact, I would even
say it's quite small.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.770
I don't think that the
main story of dementia when

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.630
it's-- the book is written.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.200
We'll have a short
chapter on genes,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.990
but there will be
many other chapters

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.880
with other causes, of which
I think vascular factors are

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.630
important ones.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.737
But overall, these are
preventable causes,

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:33.320
I would think.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.720
So the overall potential
that we have, as a society

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.880
and in medicine, is that we can
use these factors to prevent

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.810
dementia.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.450
That is the step forward.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.880
That is the way
forward, I should say.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:55.580
And finally, my apologies
for speaking a bit prodomal,

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.470
but I cannot resist this.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.310
Epidemiologists.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.660
It's a wonderful field.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.760
It is such a spectacularly
wonderful field.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.850
And when you see the
results of epidemiology,

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.680
they occur very slowly.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.670
It is for our PhD students and,
well, from [? us. ?] Janet,

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.340
I'm quite sure, feels the same.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.610
It takes so long.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.100
But the effect, overall,
on clinical medicine,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.090
on treatment, on prevention
in community medicine is vast.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.330
I thank the two organizations
that help me to do the things,

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.550
and, of course, the
many, many colleagues

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:39.300
that I work with, particularly
our PhD students and post-docs

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.490
that I worked with
over all these years.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.860
And I thank you, of course,
not only for inviting me--

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.179
for listening to me.

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:45.679
Thank you.

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:58.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.400
- Hi.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.160
My name is Helen [? Abrams, ?]
and I have two questions.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.660
One is I noticed that on
the picture of the genes,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.565
that the APOE gene was
going through the roof,

00:41:10.565 --> 00:41:12.690
and I wondered if you
thought that was significant.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.190
- Yep.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.300
- And then I had
a question about--

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.680
everybody feels that the
creation of the plaques

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:26.760
and tangles and everything else
starts early, and so what's

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:32.670
the correlation between
preventing Alzheimer's and just

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.210
the reality that it may
already be starting it

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.130
or it may already exist?

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.890
- Yep.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.320
APOE, the APOE gene is
a very important one.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:47.220
I showed you three very
small ones, APP, PS1, PS2--

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:47.850
very small.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:53.100
APOE is bigger, and among us,
as we sit here, about 15% of us

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.160
have at least one allele of
this APOE, and perhaps 1%

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.500
have double dose of APOE.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.030
And that-- the double dose--

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.950
increases the risk about
four to five times.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.730
It's associated with that.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.250
It's not absolutely
clear why that is.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.700
It is most likely
largely related, again,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.950
to lipid metabolism and
thereby, indirectly,

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:18.870
to vascular factors.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.870
And that brings me to
your second question.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.230
Namely, if you say
this all, does it not

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.400
start very early in life?

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.320
And the answer is I'm
afraid, yes, it does.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.780
It's very likely, I
think, if this idea

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.790
of chronic hypoperfusion--

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:38.120
too little perfusion-- if
that's a reasonable idea,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.330
that that starts very early on.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:44.760
So that's why the life
course approach in is--

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.870
trying to prevent this
from an early age onward,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.360
is a very fruitful one.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.580
And so I propose that
for your consideration.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.400
There's another
little thing there--

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.200
why the life course is good.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.930
If you look at the genes in this
case involved in brain volume

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.430
early in life--

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.460
brain volume at
births in particular--

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.600
and you look at brain
volume, atrophy of the brain,

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:19.440
at aged 80 or 90, they
have one gene in common--

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.850
the so-called MAPT gene,
which is also the tau gene.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.570
So that means that
one of these tangles--

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.980
the plaques and the tangles--

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.169
that [? amyloid ?]
described indeed

00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.460
is related to one of the genes.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.310
So I'm not pushing
away all genes,

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.660
but there is, also in genes, a
kind of life course, it seems.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:41.380
In any event, it
mean, most likely,

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.200
if you want to protect
your brain later on,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.500
start very early in life.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.060
- Two related questions.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.440
I wonder if you think
United States society

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.110
today needs to do
more than it is doing

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:04.170
in the area of prevention.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:07.620
And secondly, I
wonder what you think

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:12.560
of the movement that is
called the Bredesen Protocols?

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.530
- As a guest here--

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.570
I feel myself very
much as a guest

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.860
in this beautiful country--

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.670
I've worked so long with
many colleagues in the US,

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.220
I am not going to say anything
very specific on the US.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.250
I think my US colleagues
should do this.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.940
But yes, I think
prevention is, in nearly

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.730
every respect in medicine, in
disease, is the way forward.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.255
And do we do enough?

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.626
You won't, you know.

00:44:49.626 --> 00:44:51.690
I have to apologize, but indeed.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.130
We do not, overall.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.330
We do not do enough.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.770
We could, by and
large, I think, if we

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.410
would have sufficient
preventive measures,

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:05.940
eradicate, with really strong
efforts worldwide, nearly

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.070
all catastrophic
infectious diseases.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:11.070
I think there is no
reason to believe

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.520
that we could not do that.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.280
I'm not talking
about Alzheimer now.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:20.010
If we would have even stronger
emphasis on prevention

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.980
in heart disease,
cardiovascular disease,

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.110
we could at least
reduce it with half.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.360
I am quoting now again
Richard Peto from Oxford--

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.410
just retired--

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.590
but he always goes around
that we can basically prevent

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.530
about 50% of early mortalities.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:42.850
So in that sense, prevention,
yes, we could do much more.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.170
I missed your second
question but--

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:55.190
- Your opinion about what is
known as the Bredesen Protocols

00:45:55.190 --> 00:46:01.456
that Dr. Bredesen publicized
in his book called The End

00:46:01.456 --> 00:46:03.850
of Alzheimer's.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:08.020
- I must say, I am familiar
with the name, the author,

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.220
but not with the book,
and so the overall idea

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.960
I would have to
discuss with you then

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.900
after we have done the
plenary session here.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.830
I'm happy to do so.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.790
- I find you so
intelligent, and thank you,

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.080
thank you for all you've stated.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:25.580
However--

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.480
- Tell my wife.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.120
- I have had my
first knee surgery,

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.320
and in my physical therapy
five and three times a week,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.750
they always bring up
blood up to my knee.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:46.080
And you stated about
the blood in our head.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.920
So again, if we bring
up blood, is that

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.510
going to make a difference?

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.770
- Well, you see, yes.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.410
The answer is yes.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:47:01.040
Your brain is the
organ that needs,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.890
proportionately
speaking, most oxygen.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:08.600
You can do with a lot of
less oxygen in your heart,

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.550
your liver, but your brain, no.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.590
It needs to really
a lot of oxygen.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:16.130
So the moment you're
awake, you need it,

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.630
and if you don't
have it, something

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:19.375
goes wrong with
these neuron cells.

00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:20.860
It's as simple as that.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.910
Your knee is probably better
without a bit more blood.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.290
- I'm in my 70s.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:28.951
I'm old, and I don't
want to grow up.

00:47:28.951 --> 00:47:29.450
Thank you.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:32.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.280
- I have-- pleasure to
listen to you today.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.760
I have two fairly
pointed questions.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:42.750
One, what are your
thoughts on EDTA chelation,

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:47.190
if there are atherosclerotic
conditions that are affecting

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.690
brain perfusion, and
then number two, what

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.850
are your thoughts on
things like [? HydroGene ?]

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:59.520
or the racetams for increasing
blood flow to the brain?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.190
Ginkgo biloba-- and of course,
there's a million supplements,

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.050
but I'm particularly
curious about what

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.050
you thought about
[? HydroGene ?] and EDTA,

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:11.380
given that they're both
fairly inexpensive and safe.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.370
- Well, I appreciate
the general question.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:19.050
Namely, are there
relatively simple ways

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:25.980
to increase blood flow here or
to reduce the negative effects

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.620
that we have on
our blood vessels?

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.950
And you think of a kind of
omnibus type of effect--

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.880
a big effect on the overall
circulation and then

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.800
on the brain.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.990
My favorite one there
is, indeed, antioxidants,

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:44.040
because the free radicals--

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.250
the ozone, O3, going around--

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.510
not only are really quite
harmful to your overall--

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:55.851
to your blood vessels but
also to your brain and neurons

00:48:55.851 --> 00:48:56.350
and so on.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:49:00.570
And therefore,
sufficient antioxidants,

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.570
in one form or another-- we know
that selenium works quite well

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.210
in this case--

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.910
really has most likely
a very good effect

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.710
on preserving
cognitive function.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:18.810
This has been quite strongly
studied in these nematodes,

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:24.330
in C. elegans, and also
in specific mice that

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.970
had oxidative stress
and then were compared

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.290
to those who did not have that.

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.880
So the overall idea--

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.650
I'm not going to go
into the specifics,

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:35.050
but the overall
idea I like, yeah.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.600
- I've seen some
good work done on

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.180
the antioxidant astaxanthin--

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.580
- Yeah.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.080
- --and how it protects the
form of DHA that crosses

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.950
the blood-brain barrier,
therefore having a benefit

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.220
on the brain.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:51.630
But then I was curious if that
would have a vascular effect

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:52.961
versus more of a neurological.

00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:54.960
- Yeah, that's always the
question in this case.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.130
I agree with that.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:56.639
It doesn't.

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:58.680
By the way, if it works,
doesn't matter very much

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.760
what the pathway is, but yeah.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.610
- Hello, my name
is Caterina Gates,

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:06.930
and I want to thank you
for being here for us.

00:50:10.002 --> 00:50:12.450
I want to thank you for
being here for all of us,

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.190
and my name is Caterina Gates.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.750
I have three short questions.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.140
Is it true what
we've heard before,

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:24.270
going to lectures and so on,
that the Alzheimer's is apt

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.050
to be passed down from mother
to daughter than from mother

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:29.310
to sons?

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.760
And is it also true
that the only way

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.260
to diagnose Alzheimer's
is after death when

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.310
they look at your brain--

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.960
that they take it apart?

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:49.680
And the third one is what is the
commonest in the women in Japan

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.750
and the women in Spain?

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:56.130
As you said, they had, at
least, chances of having

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.142
Alzheimer's or incidence
of having Alzheimer's.

00:51:00.142 --> 00:51:01.600
- Shall we start
with the last one,

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.970
and then you lead me
again to the other ones?

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.240
The last one-- they live
longer, women, but men

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.710
as well, although there
is in both countries,

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.720
the difference
between men and women.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.500
But they do not get less
Alzheimer's or dementia.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.560
In fact, when you
look at the pattern,

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.360
you saw the pattern with age.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.870
That's very similar whether
you see it in Japan, in Spain--

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:24.160
there is a study in Spain--

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.800
and in the US or
in Western Europe.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.400
So there's basically--

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.540
I don't think in this
particular instance,

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:38.360
we cannot learn very much from
possible heterogeneity between

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.960
populations, which is generally
a very good way to study

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.340
particular questions.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.620
Of your two other questions,
what is your most pressing one?

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:52.700
- If it's passed down more
from mothers to daughters

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.370
than mothers to sons?

00:51:54.370 --> 00:52:00.110
- OK, there is some
evidence that for longevity,

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.550
in this case, for life
expectancy-- in fact,

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.720
there's quite a recent
published publication on this--

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.500
that this, indeed, is
in the maternal line.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:15.260
For dementia, I do not know of
any evidence in that respect.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.560
- That's good news because
my husband's mother had

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.720
Alzheimer's, and the only way to
diagnose at the time she died--

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.980
that was back in 2006--

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.670
it was-- I don't know if
everyone can hear me--

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:29.960
that it was through
just after death,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.190
if you have the brain in.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.610
I want everybody here, if
you are dealing with someone

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:38.260
with Alzheimer's or are afraid
of maybe someone having it

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.000
eventually in your
family at some point--

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.560
nobody will take her
brain because you

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.010
had to do all that paperwork
ahead of the death here

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.370
in this country.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.360
And so here she always
was an organ donor,

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.520
and she wanted her brain
to go, and we wanted that,

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.600
and it went to waste because
they wouldn't take it.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.770
We looked at all--

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.770
called every hospital where
we are here in Boston.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:08.481
Nobody would take it
because of the paperwork.

00:53:08.481 --> 00:53:08.980
- If--

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.480
- Anyway.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:15.770
- --in the more general question
of paperwork and science,

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:18.530
I'm on your side, I must say.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.130
In terms of diagnosis, making
a diagnosis, we are very close,

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.350
and we are actually
quite good in making

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.300
the diagnosis, also alive.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.280
And I'm not sure--
yet that is important,

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.220
because that means
that being alive,

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.370
we could study differences, and
we could try to find out why it

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.010
is that--

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.300
- Well, thank you--

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:35.966
- --being alive.

00:53:35.966 --> 00:53:37.370
- --anyway for
everything you do.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.870
- Thank you.

00:53:40.049 --> 00:53:41.090
- My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.760
I'm a student in
nutritional epi.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.265
So my question is would
you please address

00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:48.870
the role of nutrition
and dietary pattern

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.450
on the risk factors
you mentioned?

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:51.950
Thank you.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.260
- I think one of the best
summaries would be to say,

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.790
all dietary patterns that
are related, particularly

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.390
to cardiovascular disease
or vascular factors,

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.270
are most likely
involved in that sense,

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:10.940
directly or
indirectly, in dementia

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.710
and Alzheimer's disease as well.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:14.960
This afternoon,
before I came here,

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.080
we had a working
group discussion

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.830
on carotenoids in Alzheimer's
disease and dementia--

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.950
very strong evidence from
a variety of studies there.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:28.250
And so that would lead
then to particular trials

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:31.010
that you could do in
which you looked then

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.540
at people having those or people
not having intake of that.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.460
So yes, there are quite
a number of, I think,

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:42.080
factors that are nutritional
factors that are possibly

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:42.920
involved.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:48.950
The evidence, though, is, in
overall, not very strong yet.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.610
I emphasize yet because
I think it will be better

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:57.650
and in the bigger
studies we have on this.

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:59.660
I say this a bit
hesitantly, you hear,

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.080
but I think one
of these chapters

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.450
in the book of
dementia will certainly

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.690
be nutrition or nutritional
factors in relation

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.380
to the disease.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.097
It will be, I think, a bigger
chapter than the genes.

00:55:15.555 --> 00:55:16.180
- Good evening.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.680
My name is
[? Gabriela. ?] Thank you

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.590
very much for your
wonderful lecture.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:23.020
I have a probably
very similar question.

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.640
What do you think is the
role of physical inactivity

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:35.180
as related to probably brain
volume and vascularization

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.430
and probably the prevention
of Alzheimer's disease?

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.100
Thank you.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.590
- I think it's big--

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.980
possibly big.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.670
Physical activity is
quite strongly related

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.310
to generally all
these risk factors

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:54.810
that I mentioned
for heart disease,

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:59.760
and thereby, indirectly at
least, also for dementia.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.560
But it's also quite
well possible,

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.310
and there's increasing
evidence for that,

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:06.700
that there's a direct neuronal
effect of physical activity.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.470
And so direct brain effect,
if I may say so, and so

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.430
therefore yes.

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:16.140
I think it's a
very good strategy

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:22.800
to focus on physical
activity or decline

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.060
and fight physical inactivity if
you want to prevent Alzheimer's

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.360
disease and dementia.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.100
This is something also that
can start early in life.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.690
One of the, I
think, the tragedies

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.660
of physical activity-- most
people like it very much when

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.040
they are students.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.600
They go and you know and so on.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.280
And then what happens?

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.240
Why does that happen?

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:47.910
You get a family and things, and
you cannot do anything anymore

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:48.460
and so on.

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.390
But if we would continue
physical activity,

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.990
being reasonably physically
active over a lifetime,

00:56:54.990 --> 00:57:00.690
I cannot give a quick estimate
of the number of patients with

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.940
Alzheimer's that would save,
but I think it would be

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.018
considerable.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:11.340
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.920
- That brings us to the
end of our questions,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.250
so please join me in
thanking Dr. Hofman.

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.750
Yeah.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.600
[APPLAUSE]
