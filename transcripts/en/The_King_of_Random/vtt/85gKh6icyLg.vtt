00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
[Captions by Mary V. at Y Translator]
We've got a really fun experiment today

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.060
brought to us by
YouTube user Daniel Burton

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.800
who wants to know if we can
use kinetic sand to cast molten metal.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.640
[Music]

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.449
We've done a few different
experiments in the past

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.410
using sand to try and cast metal.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500
And so I think this is
an interesting progression.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.480
Kinetic sand is this
weird polymer covered sand

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.720
that does a pretty good job
of sticking to itself

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.810
just a little bit.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.839
So, the sand really bonds
and it doesn't pour

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.500
like individual grains of sand.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.700
It almost pours more
like a sort of a liquid,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.120
like a clumpy liquid.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.100
It's weird.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.840
There's a good chance that
one of the reasons Daniel

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.510
wanted to see us try
casting molten metal in this

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.420
is that it does a good job
of taking mold shapes.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.300
In fact this sand comes
with a few different molds.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.760
Let's look at what happens
when we pack the sand into those.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.700
[Music]

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.680
Boom!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.710
The grains of sand that make
this stuff up are really small

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.161
so you can pick up some
pretty good details here.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.720
You can see the
inlaid brick texture.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.200
That's a part of this cast.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.340
[Music]

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.440
Similarly, let's try taking this piece,
and pressing it down into the sand.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.540
[Music]

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560
Once again you can see it
picked up quite a bit of detail.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.500
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100
We've got about 4 pounds
of this kinetic play sand.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.409
We're gonna try a
couple different methods

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.200
for making molds in the sand,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
and then see if we can
cast melted metal into it.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.520
First up.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.200
I think we're gonna
try some aluminum,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.020
and because this sand
comes in a plastic container,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.840
we're gonna try transferring
some of it into this frying pan.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.480
And as a first experiment,
I want to try casting a handprint.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.120
So I'm going to take this sand,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.200
throw it down into the pan,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.480
and try and press my hand in, maybe
press all of the sand down around it.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.560
So it really does a good job
of keeping its shape

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.320
then we'll melt some aluminum
see if we can pour it in.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.380
Okay, I think I've probably got
a pretty good hand print going on here.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.980
That's a handprint.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.320
Pretty good detail.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.700
Not like fingerprint level of detail,
but it's pretty good detail still.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100
I have another test I wanna do.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.170
I also want to just do
a test for how well

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.200
the sand takes molds
that we make ourselves.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.530
So I've got here this
little King of Random logo

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.349
that I just made
out of some MDF board.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.980
We're going to see if we can
get this pick up all the details,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.220
and really give a good impression down
into that sand for the metal to grab onto.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.380
That's packed, but not 
super strong packed.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.260
I'm most concerned about
the dot inside the R

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.100
and little lines inside the O,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.340
so I think I'm just gonna
take a little bit of the sand,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.120
and try and just drop it
down into those spots.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600
So we know that there's
already sand in them,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.140
and hopefully, it comes
out in the way we want.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.240
Little bit of uncompressed sand on top.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.560
Right here it goes.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.900
[Music]

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.780
Hmm...

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.880
Didn't really stick very well
to the parts in the little gaps and spaces,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.440
so we have an okay outline,
but we lost a lot of the detail.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.280
This time I'm trying
to not compress it quite as much

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480
because it might be that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.010
when it gets pushed
too far into the mold,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.120
it can't really release.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.680
So this is pressed but
a little more gently.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.560
That one there turned out pretty well,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.099
and it does have some
tiny little cracks in the sands

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.250
just from not being compressed too much.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.580
I think we've got a
little bit of a trade-off.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.140
But we would rather have the sand
with some little cracks in it?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.110
Or would we rather lose
a lot of the detail

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.160
from all the nooks
and crannies of our mold.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.100
We've got some aluminum,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.340
and hey, we've got our updated
foundry with the fire bricks

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.340
as the insulation,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.520
and at the bottom with our nicer top.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.430
It's time to give this thing a real test.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.709
See what we can do with it,

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.680
and we're gonna start
by melting some aluminum down.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:04:01.320
[Music]

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.820
We've got a nice crucible full of
molten aluminum inside our foundry.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.680
We're gonna pull that out, set it down.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.440
I'll grab the pouring tongs,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.520
grab it and then I'm first,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.620
gonna pour it into the
King Of Random symbol

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.580
and then everything else that's left over,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.360
I'm just gonna pour into the handprint.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.840
We're gonna see how they go.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:28.900
[Music]

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.840
Flow.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.320
[Music]

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.440
The middle fingerless hand.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.140
It may be kind of hard to see
'cause it is really bright out here

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.680
but that might be on fire.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.460
Yeah there's definitely
flames coming off of that.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.200
Smells interesting.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.760
Probably not too good to be
breathing in much of those fumes.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.800
So I'm just gonna stop
trying to smell that for now.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.500
Now this is aluminum,
which means it needs to cool off

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.440
for quite a while
before it stops being liquid.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.680
Can see this is still very runny.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.700
Just pass the tongs right through it.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.440
This one's thinner.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.660
So it was able to cool down
more and it's not solid yet.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.060
It's sort of almost a
a wet sand consistency.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.120
I can stab into it if I try...

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.500
Poke it, dent it very easily.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.840
We need to give those
some time to cool off.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.600
The comment request was to see
if we could cast molten metal

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.740
in this kinetic sand.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.440
And we're trying that with aluminum.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.880
We've got our aluminum that we poured,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.260
and those are cooling off outside
because aluminum takes a while to cool down.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.840
But in the meantime,
there's something else I wanted to try.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.820
The comment did not
specify what type of metal.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.220
So we've got a different
type that we're gonna try.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.180
First, let's make the mold
then let's grab the metal.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.760
Running a little low on
these two sand colors.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.600
So I'm just gonna mix them together.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.000
Now for the mold on this version,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.220
I have a tiny plastic replica
of Grant's Head and Shoulders.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.440
This was made by 3D scanning Grant
while he sat in a rotating chair

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.540
and then printing it out on a 3D printer.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.800
Pretty cool little thing.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.020
So we can just have mini-Grant
sitting in the studio all the time,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.180
and we're gonna see
if we can't make a mold of this,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.560
and then cast it in metal.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.780
What do you say mini Grant,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.260
you ready to get face-planted
into some kinetic sand?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.540
Oh no, I don't want to.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.740
Ha ha! Too bad.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.800
Suish squish squish squish
squish squish squish.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.140
All right.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.700
Moment of truth.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.120
Do we have a mini Grant
imprint in the sand?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.520
Oh his hair sticking up.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.520
Think we do.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.240
We got Grant's face smooshed
down into the sand here.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.539
Lovely.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.280
Obviously, this 3D print isn't
the highest resolution in the world.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.060
So we'll see how much of it gets
transferred from the 3D print

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.960
into the sand into the metal.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.300
You may have noticed that
our mini Grant mold in the sand

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.790
is still in the plastic
container that I was using before.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.100
And I didn't use that

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.160
because I didn't want
to melt it with molten aluminum.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.760
So this time I'm using gallium.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.480
I have here a couple
of pounds of gallium.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.360
Now if you're unfamiliar with gallium,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.220
gallium is a metal with a melting point
of about 85.6 degrees fahrenheit,

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.740
which means that this metal right here
is about as warm as a bathtub.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.460
At any rate,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.220
it's easily cool enough
to put your hands in.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.169
It's really kind of neat to play
with because it's pretty dense.

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:20.810
It is metal after all,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.770
and it doesn't have nearly the danger
or destructive power of mercury

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.800
even though it looks pretty much
just the same when it's melted.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.960
So here we go.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.680
Let's see if we can pour some
of our gallium down into our mold,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.600
and cast a little mini Grant.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.140
[Music]

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.400
Not too bad.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.360
There we go.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.580
I had a barrier kind
of low on this one spot,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.080
and as you can see, of course,
it has spilled over the edge.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.300
But that's all right.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.040
We're just gonna let this cool down,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.440
and then take it out
and see what kind of result we've got.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.000
[Music]

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.940
Our aluminum has partially cool down,

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.180
at least enough that I feel
safe bringing it inside,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.000
and setting these pans on a table,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.580
at least with a cloth underneath it.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.540
So now to cool these down the rest
of the way let's try taking them out,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.099
dropping them into this bowl of water,

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:09.500
which should both cool them off,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.660
and help rinse off any sand stuck to them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.080
Missing a middle finger and
the other fingers are puddles.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.200
[inaudible] that.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.060
I mean obviously, other than the
missing finger and the puddle fingers

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.040
going around,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.240
but the detail that that picked up
is actually not too bad,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.460
can see like the creases
in my fingers a little bit.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.660
Definitely got the finger shape.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.900
Interestingly, the heat seems to
burn out the color from the sand.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.200
There is still some sand stuck
to this but it's not purple.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.980
It's just kind of sand colored.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.280
As I said it definitely
discolors the sand,

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.289
and then I would say it
just straight up burns it

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.499
and it absolutely does
something to the polymer.

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:46.540
You can see, if I just poked
a little bit of this,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.120
and scoop it with the
screwdriver here,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.360
it sort of sticks together
very much clumped up.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.200
Doesn't like to separate,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.600
and then I can squish it
back down to pack.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.120
If I do the same thing to
the sand here in the middle,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.000
this just very powdery,
falls to pieces, does not clump,

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.680
does not seem to pack back
together well at all.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.239
So it's completely
dried up and burned up.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.580
Let's see how deep I could
dig before I get back

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.140
to some purple and sticking the sand.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.100
So the color is still under there.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.379
It didn't burn all the way through.

00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:21.379
We've just got maybe, I don't know,
an eighth of an inch sort of thing

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.920
of this just absolute powder.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.720
No binding at all.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.899
Kind of wonder if we can
get rid of all that,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.960
and still use the sand underneath it.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.460
This is actually pretty interesting too.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.040
You can kind of see the change

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.329
at it radiates out.

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:36.829
Here's the burned portion
where all the color is gone,

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:39.139
and then fairly abruptly
the color returns

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.230
and that's acting
like the normal sand.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.400
It's got the springiness, the stickiness.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.520
See how our King of Random symbol did.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.520
Not too shabby.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.960
It's not perfect.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.699
But it's decent.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.220
You can see what it looks like.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.800
Obviously, it ruined some of the sand,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.850
but the sand does do a pretty
good job of holding its shape

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.140
and containing the aluminum
even if some of it does get burned up.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.420
The aluminum looks all right.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.220
Let's see how the gallium did.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.280
Oooh, boy that is sticking quite a bit.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.660
Might be because I had to put it
in the freezer for 40 minutes.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.980
[Music]

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.920
Over all, that is not
too shabby of a casting

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.170
like it picked up
some pretty crazy detail.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.220
You can see the print
lines in the gallium.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.600
It did seem to get a little bit
of the sand stuck in embedded

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.459
into the metal in a couple of spots.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.309
That's in there a little bit.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.699
So I'm not sure what exactly
about that particular spot

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.720
and these other tiny little spots
that was different from the rest of it.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.680
But overall, I'd say we did
get a pretty good casting,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.180
and while it's not exactly
a photo realistic sculpture of Grant,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.440
it looks about as much
like him as this 3D print did

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.980
so I'm pretty impressed.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.240
Well Daniel Burton, you wanted us
to try using kinetic sand to cast metal,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.179
and I would say we got
some decent results

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.020
with both the aluminum and the gallium.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.699
