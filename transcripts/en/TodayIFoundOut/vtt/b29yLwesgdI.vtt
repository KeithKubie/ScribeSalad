00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.430
When Did We First Use Rubber Ducks?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:16.630
In 1970, everyone’s favorite orange roommate
sang a song to his bathtime buddy.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.670
“Oh, rubber duckie, you’re the one.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.320
You make bathtime lots of fun,” cooed Ernie
to his squeaky yellow friend.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.060
While the rubber duckie had been around for
at least a century prior to Ernie and his

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.500
mellow melody, this Sesame Street tune shoved
the bathtime toy into the popular culture

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.609
lexicon where it has remained ever since.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.929
From a chew toy to a piece of art to Ernie’s
best friend (sorry, Bert), here’s the story

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.359
of how the world got into the bath with the
rubber duckie.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.800
In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered vulcanized
rubber.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600
Legend has it that while in an argument with
his lab partner, he angrily threw a piece

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.149
of sulfur-covered rubber into a potbelly stove.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.940
The rubber charred and, then, hardened.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.089
Heat had combined the sulfur molecules to
the rubber molecules, creating a rubbery substance

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.420
that was stronger and more elastic.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.570
Whether that’s really how it happened or
not, Goodyear never reaped the financial rewards

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.180
that often come with an invention of this
magnitude.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
In fact, he died $200,000 in debt, or about
$5 million today.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.680
(See: The Luckless Rubber Maven: Charles Goodyear)
Nevertheless, the vulcanization process and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.070
his subsequent patents changed the world.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.360
By the mid-1800s, products using vulcanized
rubber started flooding the market, including

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.060
footwear, sheet rubber, car springs, bicycle
tires and toys.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.240
The first vulcanized rubber toys were available
to consumers around 1850, which included balls,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.800
rattles and doll heads.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.080
It isn’t definitively known who was the
first to make a duck-shaped rubber toy, but

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.100
the first rubber squeaky toy of any type was
invented around the 1860s and the first rubber

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.990
duck decoy (which was used for hunting) came
in the 1880s.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.010
Rubber toys at this time were nothing like
we think of today.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.650
Hard, unattractive and not malleable, they
were often used as chew toys for teething

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.270
babies and dogs.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.189
Like these toys, the early rubber duckie play
item was not meant as a water toy.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:16.150
As noted by toy scholar, Charles Steiner,
it “was cast, solid and did not float well.”

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.489
It also was most certainly not bright yellow.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.329
As the Industrial Revolution engulfed the
country, an increased percentage of Americans

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.659
held factory jobs.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.909
Moving from rural America to urban cities
in search of these jobs, the American urban

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.760
population grew rapidly.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.359
In 1880, 8.4% of Americans were living in
cities, but by 1890, that percentage increased

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.650
to 12.7%.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
Living space was limited, so several generations
of family often lived together.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.170
This had a direct effect on many normal family
activities, including bathtime.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.530
Noting this, former curator at a Pittsburgh’s
Toonseum, Joe Wos, claims that the rubber

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.480
duck became affiliated with the bath because
it was the only way to get kids in the tub.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.029
According to his theory on the origin of the
rubber duckie as a bathtime companion, on

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.709
Saturday nights, everyone in the family would
bath for Sunday church, attempting to rid

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.499
themselves of the dirt and grime of the previous
week’s work.

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.640
Of course, there was only one tub with limited
water.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.150
Dad would go first, then mom, then the oldest
siblings and so forth until, as Wos explains,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.279
”then you get down to the littlest ones,
they’ve got to go into that dirty, filthy

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.969
water that the whole family has used, so you
need a way to get them into the tub – and

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.219
suddenly the tub becomes playtime.”

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.769
Whether you hold to Wos’ speculative theory
or not, it isn’t difficult to see how a

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.109
toy duck, whether it floated or not, would
inspire kids to start playing with it in the

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.290
bathtub, regardless of how dirty the water
purportedly was.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.400
Nevertheless, it would be several decades
after this era before rubber duckies would

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.919
hit the mainstream.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.920
One of the first relatively popular rubber
duck toys came about in 1938 when the Seiberling

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.870
Latex Products Company partnered with the
newly popular movie studio Disney (who had

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.969
just released to great fanfare Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs a year earlier), debuting

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.760
a line of rubber figurines, including their
character Donald Duck.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.249
Made from solid rubber, like incarnations
before it, this rubber duck was not meant

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.249
for water play.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.449
rubber-duckie1A few years prior to Disney’s
Donald Duck toy, a patent was filed by Eleanor

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.840
Shannahan of Easton, Maryland for what is
generally considered the first true rubber

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.699
duck-shaped bath toy.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.889
While this rubber duckie wasn’t like today’s
version, it provided amusement nonetheless

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.340
to “both little children and older persons”
by shooting jets of water at unsuspecting

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.340
bathers.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.670
As the patent reads, the duck toy was supposed
to “to produce an attractive fountain-like

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.250
effect, and also to enable the playing of
pranks by one person upon another.”

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.990
Little is known about the actual production
and sale of this item, but, in 1941, a Los

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.120
Angeles artist and sculptor took this basic
design and turned it into a fortune.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.010
rubber-duckie2Even before his creation of
the iconic yellow rubber duckie, Hollywood

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.930
artist Peter Ganine was rather famous.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.460
Immigrating from Russia to the United States
on an art scholarship, he moved to Los Angeles

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.960
in the 1930s where his work attracted the
attention of longtime Los Angeles Times art

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.970
critic Arthur Millier, who helped expose him
to the greater art community.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.020
Ganine hit his apex in the late 1940s when
he began designing toy sculptures, like a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.030
giant grinning whale and a bright yellow rubber
duckie.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.100
Patenting it in 1949, the patent document
for the “toy duck” was remarkably short

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.379
and to the point with the drawings of his
design doing most of the talking – showing

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.860
that it floated, squeaked, possessed a goofy
smile and it was yellow.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.259
The design was a hit and Ganine sold millions
of his yellow rubber duckies.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.759
While Ganine later also became famous for
adding Gothic faces to chess pieces, the duck

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.940
became his most defining work.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.449
Over the next decades, the rubber duckie became
synonymous with kids’ bath time, with a

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.830
major assist from Ernie’s song.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.659
Debuting in 1970, “Rubber Duckie” was
so beloved that it actually landed on the

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.039
Billboard charts, reaching as high as number
11 in 1971.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.759
Written by Sesame Street head writer Jeff
Moss and voiced by legend Jim Henson, the

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.400
song became one of the show’s defining moments,
even reenacted by Little Richard in the 1990s.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.939
rubber-duckSince then, the rubber duckie has
had several other pop culture moments, like

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:26.379
when 28,000 of them were accidentally dumped
into the ocean during a storm (to this day,

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.680
there are still reports of people finding
them around the world).

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.889
There’s also been several occurrences of
a giant yellow inflatable duck making appearances

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.919
in major cities, including stops in Hong Kong,
New York and Syracuse.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.569
And so it is that for over a century now rubber
ducks, in one form or another, have joined

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:45.669
us for bathtime.

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.009
Presumably the now iconic yellow duckie will
continue to be a mainstay for centuries more.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:07:30.659
After all, they are kind of fun to play 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:55.110
with while taking a soak.
