&gt;&gt; MY ONLY ISSUE IS IF THAT WAS
TRUE AND THE POLICE WERE SCARED.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.240 line:85%
THEY HAVE THE GUNS AND WEAPONS.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.043 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TON BE
SCARED, RIGHT.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:15.181 line:91%
EVEN IF THEY WERE SCARED OF US
WHY IS THAT OKAY TO SAY I'M NOT

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:16.315 align:start position:0% line:85%
DOING THAT.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.219 line:91%
THEY TRASHED A BIRD DOG --
&gt;&gt; LARRY: TALKING  ABOUT THE 

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.888 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUY IN AFGHANISTAN

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:27.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY SAID HE DIDN'T DO HIS
JOB BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OR HAD

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.062 line:91%
A -- THEY SAY HE WAS A COWARD.
WHY IS IT OKAY FOR POLICE TO SAY

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:33.766 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE SCARED, SO WE'RE NOT DOING
OUR JOB.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.334 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S OKAY?

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.439 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THERE JOB IS TO DO THIS.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.940 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; LARRY: I AGREE.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:46.245 line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S DEFENDED
SO VIGOROUSLY WHY FOX NEWS HAS

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.647 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THE GLEE ON THEIR FACES ?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.783 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES YOU DO.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:54.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
LARRY: BLACK PEOPLE --
I DO, I HATE THAT I DO.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE
WIRE 2.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.295 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; LARRY: A NEW TV SHOW.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.363 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; A NEW WIRE.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
LARRY: THAT WILL SOLVE THE
PROBLEM.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:10.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
BALTIMORE IS YEARNING FOR IT
ANOTHER BLEAK DEPICTION.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK WHITE LIBERALS
HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.644 align:start position:0% line:91%
ROMANTICIZE BLACK STRUGGLE IN
BALTIMORE.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.813 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET TO THE WIRE.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:21.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROVE IT.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY: THE REASON I BROUGHT
UP THE BLACK/BLUE THING.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:30.123 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE
IN CHARGE IN BALTIMORE.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.524 align:start position:0% line:85%
BLACK MAYOR -- COPS.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:32.792 size:75% position:38% line:85%
WHY IS IT GETTING WORST?

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT RACE AT THAT
LEVEL.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE NEED A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
TOO. WE DIDN'T MARCH TO

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTEGRATE POLICE FORCES FOR
BLACK COPS TO BEAT US.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DIDN'T INTEGRATE SCHOOLS FOR
BLACK TEACHERS TO FAIL US.

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.077 line:85%
WE NEED A DIFFERENT MENTALITY.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE POLICE HAVE A
PARTICULAR IDEOGOLGY ABOUT WHAT

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.114 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT MEANS TO POLICE.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.049 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.284 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE MAYOR AND THE GOVERNOR AND
THE PRESIDENT.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:02.855 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;  IF THEY HAVE THE SAME
IDEOLOGY OF THE PREDECESSOR IT

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.123 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DOESN'T CHANGE THE GAME.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:10.062 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY: YOU THINK THE
PRESIDENT HAS THIS IDEOLOGY.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST SPEAKING IN GENERAL
TERMS. I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.335 line:91%
I THINK HE HAS A PARTICULAR
STANCE ON POLICING THAN I 

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:17.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T AGREE WITH
&gt;&gt; LARRY: WHAT IS THAT?

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT, WHEN SOMETHING
HAPPENS HE SAID "I UNDERSTAND

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.142 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY EVERYONE IS MAD."

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.978 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS LIKE YOU, MAN.

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:31.184 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY GENERIC WHITE GUY
IMPERSONATION

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY: OBAMA IS HALF WHITE--
&gt;&gt; A HALFRICAN.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:39.825 line:91%
HE SAID I UNDERSTAND WHY BLACK
PEOPLE ARE MAD AND WHITE PEOPLE

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:40.826 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE MAD.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.529 align:start position:0% line:91%
I UNDERSTAND WHY --
&gt;&gt; LARRY: HE'S HAS TO BE THE

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:43.996 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRESIDENT TO EVERYONE.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.097 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S STUPID.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; HEAR ME OUT.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.672 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEAR ME OUT.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:03:01.647 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF OBAMA CAME OUT AND SAID 
-[BEEP] YOU, I'M JUST THE

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.816 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PRESIDENT OF BLACK AMERICA.
THAT'S IT AND DROP THE MIKE.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE'D HAVE MY VOTE.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:13.793 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M NOT ASKING HIM TO IDENTIFY
ONE GROUP OR THE OTHER.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.194 line:91%
CHOOSE THE OPPRESSED OVER THE
OPPRESSOR. THAT'D BE LIKE IN

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.028 size:78% position:39% line:91%
1865 SAYING " -- SLAVES 
ARE MAD, MASTERS ARE MAD.

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.762 align:start position:0% line:85%
I UNDERSTAND."

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.464 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY DID SAY THAT.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.230 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I THINK THEY DID SAY THAT.
