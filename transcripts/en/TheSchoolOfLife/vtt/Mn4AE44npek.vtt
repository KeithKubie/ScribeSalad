00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.230
In our waking hours, for much of our lives,
we are granted an unwarranted luxury: a sense

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.140
that we are immortal. Our organs function
normally, our joints give us no pains, we

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.289
are focused on the next few financial quarters
in the business. Dropping dead is the last

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.300
thing on our minds.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.990
But this is not the case in the early hours.
Suddenly, there’s an odd gnawing twinge

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.239
in the stomach. It isn’t anything major,
and it might pass by tomorrow. But this might

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.390
also be the start of a tumour that will fell
us by the new year. Also, our chest feels

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.789
a bit tight. When we breathe, there can sometimes
be a sense of strain. There was an incident

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.480
a little while back at the airport, running
for the distant gate. Could it have been a

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.300
heart attack, a quiet one that passes largely
undetected but tears fatefully at a valve?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
What about the slightly odd mole on one’s
back? Has it always been there or is it new,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.300
spreading aggressively and malignantly? Why
can’t we remember the name of that really

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.421
nice colleague we worked with a few years
back? Is reason beginning to crumble? This

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:11.610
would be just the moment for a stroke which
will leave us half-paralysed; paramedics will

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.861
urgently wheel us along the A&amp;E corridors
on a trolley bed. We’ll need to have our

00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:20.520
bottom wiped by a nurse and be fed with a
tube coming out of our nose.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.560
The sheer implausibility of being, and remaining
alive, grows overwhelming. How is it possible

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.979
that one can keep living, given everything
that might go wrong? It isn’t hypochondria

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.511
any more, that macabre almost fun state of
mind you can adopt as an adolescent, this

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:45.180
is a realistic assessment of the risks. It’s
the imagination correctly deployed.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.439
This present ache or twinge might not announce
the end - but something will happen. The abstract

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.990
possibility of death turns, at night, into
a concrete, decisive fact. Perhaps we’ll

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.390
fall off a ladder trying to get a suitcase
out of a high-up cupboard and lie on the floor

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.780
for eight hours with a broken neck, blood
filling our lungs, before anyone finds our

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.000
discoloured limp body. Or maybe we’ll be
lucky and it will be a quick aneurysm on the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.210
way back from a party celebrating a friend’s
birthday. Whatever it will be, it’s getting

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.640
closer. Others will be deeply distressed for
a while; a few people will be sad even years

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.840
later when they happen to think of us. But
they’ll cope. It won’t matter to anyone

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800
the way it matters to us right now.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.390
We’re appalled and awed by the deep strangeness
of being alive; it’s so fundamentally improbable

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.660
that the delicate web of our thoughts and
feelings is being sustained by a bunch of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.150
pulpy, fragile organs. All our complicated
ideas and lovely movements of the soul depend

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.400
upon tiny mindless white blood corpuscles,
oxygen molecules and the rhythmic spasms of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.230
the sinoatrial node. Why does the machine
keep going? Why aren’t we dead already?

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.660
The thoughts are horrific - and the full panic
may go on for half an hour or more. But as

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.550
we gradually grow used to the idea of being
obliterated and forgotten, the thought of

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.710
death sharpens our resolve: we have to do
the important things while we can. We need

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.750
to finish our work and dare to take up new
initiatives. We need to forgive more. We can

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.390
let a stupid comment pass; we can give up
on a feud, even though the other wronged us.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.330
The visceral knowledge of our approaching
death renews our appreciation of existence.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.870
It’s incredible to be able to hear a car
accelerating in the distance; it’s fascinating

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.680
to have feet; the pillow feels so nice on
our cheek; it will be lovely to look tomorrow

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.990
at a tree or to hear a song or bite into a
fig. We’re brought back to a proper sense

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.410
of the charm of things that ordinarily seem
too slight to notice but which are close to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.280
why life is worth cherishing. The veil of
jaded familiarity is pulled back - at least

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.070
for a little while. A year starts to look
like a huge privilege to have. A day when

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.650
nothing much happens won’t be boring, it
will be magnificent opportunity to continue

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:24.181
to exist. Our perspective cards features tools
for a wiser, calmer perspective on life. They

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:28.500
help to restore calm and clarity even during
difficult times.
