00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.183
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:03.016
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:03.952
I'm in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:05.973
There's this one dish called tempoyak,

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.662
which his fermented durian,
which can be used to eat

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:12.732
as a condiment with rice, or
you can make it into a curry.

00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:14.716
And ever since I heard
about this years ago,

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:18.236
it has been a mission, it's
been a dream of mine to go,

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:21.260
to come back to Malaysia,
and to eat it at the source.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.037
And so today, we're driving to Temerloh

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:25.324
which is famous for a catfish.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.551
It's along the river.

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.842
And they make a very, very famous,

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.340
it's known throughout Malaysia
for their catfish tempoyak,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.216
durian, fermented durian curry.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:36.431
So we're on our way.

00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.671
We're gonna meet up with Sufian,

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.246
who also makes videos, food videos.

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:40.380
I cannot be,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.587
my mouth is already watering.

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:43.588
I can't wait to share the
food with you right now.

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:46.171
(upbeat music)

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.326
Alright.

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:02.828
That was about an hour and a half drive.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.534
Welcome to Temerloh.

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:08.018
But the ride and this entire
town is known for their durian,

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:11.577
or this entire area, known
especially for tempoyak

00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:13.776
and also the freshwater catfish.

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:14.859
What's up, man?

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:15.692
- Great.

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:16.525
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:17.399
- Nice to meet you too.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.812
I'm super excited--

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.645
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:20.478
- To meet Mark Wiens.

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:21.311
- [Mark] Cool, man.

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:23.307
Awesome to meet you,
and awesome to meet you

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:25.699
to eat this special delicacy.
- Yeah.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:29.086
This is the special, what
we call patin tempoyak.

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.245
- [Mark] Patin tempoyak.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:31.078
- Yeah.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:32.622
- They have some little to-go tubs

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:34.787
of fermented durian as well.

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:37.133
Oh, that sounds delicious.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.301
They have salads.

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.684
They have fried meats,
fried chicken, fried fish.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.584
Ah, so you can walk down
the line and check on it,

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:44.701
just grab what you want

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.534
and then put it on your
tray and self seating.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.430
At the end of the line is
where they serve the main dish,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.838
the curry, the tempoyak
curry with the catfish.

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:10.364
And as soon as he stirred that, you can,

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:14.725
just the poof of steamy humidity of durian

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.259
just filled this entire
little back room back here.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.275
We asked it,

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:20.872
Sufian asked them for extra spicy.

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:23.700
So he took a spoon of extra
chili before he added it.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.911
First they have, it looks
like they have the fish

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.086
cooked on its own, and then the main sauce

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:34.178
which is in a separate pan
which they then combine.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:35.051
And then you take that on your tray

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:37.169
and bring it to your table, ready to eat.

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.752
(upbeat music)

00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.386
I think facing this way should
be really good if we all sit.

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:54.695
It has an incredible aroma.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.280
You can smell it's like sour and fruity.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.294
- Yup, and--

00:02:58.294 --> 00:02:59.389
- And you can smell the fermented--

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.331
- Fermented--

00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:01.164
- [Mark] For sure.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:03.104
- [Sufian] Fermented durian for sure.

00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:03.937
- This is one of those dishes,

00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:06.633
one of those foods where I'm
like shaking in anticipation.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:07.695
I just can't wait.

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.614
- [Joel] Oh, yeah.

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:11.447
- This is the essence.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.548
- Ah, this is sambal tempoyak.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:15.381
- [Sufian] Can you smell it?

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:16.214
- Wow.

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:19.905
(Sufian chuckles)

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:21.191
Oh, that smells incredible.

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.053
That's like durian plus like oniony.

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:25.293
- [Sufian] Onion, yes.

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:26.126
- [Mark] Plus--

00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:26.959
- [Sufian] Chili.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.823
- Chili, jungley.

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:30.007
- Ooh.
(Mark laughs)

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:30.840
Powerful.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.673
- It's powerful.

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:33.509
The head is the super spicy.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.280
He added in an entire
extra spoon of chili.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.359
And then this one is the normal.

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.447
The tail is the normal spiciness.

00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:41.372
- [Mark] It's like thick.

00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:42.205
- [Sufian] Very think.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:43.618
- [Mark] Almost like,
yeah, like liquid fruit.

00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:44.451
- Cheers.

00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:54.779
(Mark chuckles)

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.196
- Oh, wow.

00:03:57.334 --> 00:03:58.167
Oh.

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:03.320
- You can taste the
chili inside your mouth.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.153
It's burning.

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:07.670
- Damn, it's spicy, but it's so rich.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.062
- It's spicy because
we got the extra spicy,

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:13.518
but then the actual tempoyak,
it does have a fruity,

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.571
almost like pineappley taste to it.

00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.116
Actually, maybe even the durian,

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:22.291
the aroma is stronger than the
taste for the actual durian.

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.650
That is unbelievably good,
like the perfect balance

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.996
of sour, fermented and spicy all together.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.175
I've only had one bit, and
that's a life-changing dish.

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:31.918
(Sufian laughs)

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:32.883
- That's true, man.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:33.716
(Mark laughs)

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:36.004
- Okay, we're gonna move
into the actual fish now.

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.199
I'll start with the head

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.010
because I gotta go for that spiciness.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.677
And dip in, get as much gravy
as possible, onto my rice,

00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:50.391
load that up with some
more tempoyak gravy.

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:52.938
Alright, mix in, get that fish.

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:54.547
You can see the skin as well,

00:04:54.547 --> 00:04:57.297
the meat mixed in with your rice.

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.962
Oh, wow.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.080
It's such a,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.381
it's like the fruitiest
curry you will ever have.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.214
How is it, man?

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.047
- Mmm.

00:05:19.097 --> 00:05:19.930
Superb.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.191
You can taste the tempoyak
more in the sambal.

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.024
- In the sambal, okay.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:24.972
- In the sambal, yeah.

00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:26.460
- 'Cause that's like the
condensed version of it.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.121
- Yup, it's very thick.

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:30.381
- This looks like a perfect
leaf to scoop it up.

00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:33.198
It's just like the custard of durian

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:36.781
just with extra fermented
layers of flavor.

00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:40.931
Oh. (laughs)

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:43.192
Oh, that's--

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:44.025
- Very good, right?

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:46.118
- Oh, that's incredible.

00:05:46.118 --> 00:05:46.951
Oh, wow.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:51.150
Yeah, that is the more condensed version.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.769
You definitely feel the durian.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.711
The durian like goes up
your nose a little bit.

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:57.807
I've had variations of veggies
and dip around the world,

00:05:57.807 --> 00:06:01.228
but that takes the crown
for being the ultimate

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:03.926
vegetables and dip that
you could possibly have.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.343
That is just flavor overload.

00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:11.732
(Joel laughs)

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.033
- Ooh.

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:19.347
- This looks like a watercress kind of.

00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.729
You're gonna lick your fingers
after that, guaranteed.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.539
That is finger-licking,

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.815
that is the definition
of finger-licking good.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:43.197
- [Joel] Immediately, it smells amazing.

00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:44.853
(Sufian laughs)

00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:45.825
- [Mark] We've got one more dish.

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:46.816
Pais patin.

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:47.649
- Pais patin.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:48.482
- Bakar.

00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:49.315
- Bakar.

00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:50.148
- [Mark] So it's the same fish.

00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:50.981
- [Sufian] Yup, same fish.

00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:51.897
- And so what they do for this dish

00:06:51.897 --> 00:06:54.166
is they put it in the tempoyak.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.227
- Tempoyak, yes.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:56.460
- Then they wrap it in a banana leaf.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.639
- In the banana leaf.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.121
And then they, what we call, grill it.

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.327
- And then grill it.

00:07:02.327 --> 00:07:06.239
So all the like tempoyak,
durian, fermented flavors

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:09.374
just soak into the fish as it grills.

00:07:09.374 --> 00:07:14.374
Yeah, you can just see just
the puddingness of that gravy,

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:17.291
of that sauce, that tempoyak.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.503
Mix it up with the rice, mix the fish.

00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:24.649
Unwrapping a gift will never
be the same again. (laughs)

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:28.281
This is the best gift you
could ever receive (laughs),

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.031
a packet of tempoyak.

00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:33.089
Okay, guys.

00:07:35.632 --> 00:07:37.531
This one is even more fruity.

00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:41.698
It's like a condensed
tempoyak fruitiness version.

00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:49.104
Wow.

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.538
We've also got some pickled petai,

00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:53.464
which are stink beans, stinky beans.

00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:57.214
They smell beautiful
and a totally different,

00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:01.103
unique aroma than the tempoyak.

00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:02.829
Awesome, and these guys are fermented too.

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:03.982
It's called petai jeruk.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:04.815
- [Sufian] Petai jeruk.

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:06.107
- Petai jeruk.

00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:06.940
Oh, yeah. (laughs)

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.023
- The smell is so dope. (laughs)

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.712
- Oh.

00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:15.091
It's like a vitamin.

00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:18.174
- Ooh.
(Mark laughs)

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:24.349
- It's an unexplainable flavor.

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:26.173
It's a sensation.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.675
It's an experience in
your mouth is what it is.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.815
- The taste is so strong.

00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:31.648
Wow.

00:08:33.595 --> 00:08:34.428
- That's one of those things

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:36.686
where the aftertaste keeps on giving.

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:37.519
- Wow.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.696
- It's pungent and so good.

00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:42.279
(upbeat music)

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:47.819
- [Joel] That smells beautiful.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.028
- That is an explosive bite.

00:08:58.028 --> 00:09:02.501
Oh, wow, the flavor is,
it's almost so unique

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.033
that there's nothing to compare it to.

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:05.866
It's its own.

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:06.949
It's its own.

00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:10.669
From the assembly line,
we got the masak lemak,

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:11.602
which is beef.

00:09:11.602 --> 00:09:15.519
This is beef with curry
in coconut milk, curry.

00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:22.156
Oh, that's stunning too.

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:26.800
That is like beef jerky in
like a spicy coconut milk,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.474
like rich curry sauce.

00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:30.083
Ah, (mumbles) okay.

00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:32.251
So there's onions,
there's shallots in here.

00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.084
There's some herbs.

00:09:33.084 --> 00:09:34.492
There's coconut, right?

00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:36.575
- [Sufian] Coconut, yeah.

00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.773
- Oh, oh, that's wonderful.

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:44.426
All the crisp vegetables and herbs,

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:47.593
all just coated in like dried coconut.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.684
That is a gravy of wonders.

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:55.565
I don't know if gravy will ever be

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.732
the same again in my life.

00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:05.196
Oh, we have dessert now. (laughs)

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:06.167
- Cendol durian.

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:07.000
- [Mark] What's all in there?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.833
The green noodles.

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:08.666
Is there ice cream?

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:09.499
- [Sufian] Cendol.

00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:10.845
- Those are like the pandan noodles.

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:12.780
- Pandan noodles, yeah.
- Okay.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.456
- And then we have, this one is red beans.

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:17.289
- [Mark] Red beans.

00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:18.122
- [Sufian] Red beans.

00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:18.955
- [Mark] Okay.

00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:21.552
- [Sufian] And then we have a gula Melaka.

00:10:21.552 --> 00:10:22.397
It's actually already melted.

00:10:22.397 --> 00:10:23.230
- [Mark] Ah, the sugar.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.063
It's like a brown sugar.

00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:24.896
- [Sufian] Brown sugar.

00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:25.729
- [Mark] From Melaka?

00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:26.562
- [Sufian] Gula Melaka, yeah.

00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:27.441
- [Mark] Which is very
famous in Melaka, right?

00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.274
- Yeah.

00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:32.309
- And then there's an entire
chunk, ice cream in there.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:33.142
- [Sufian] Ice cream.

00:10:33.142 --> 00:10:34.236
- [Mark] Ice cream and ice.

00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:35.069
- [Sufian] Ice cream and ice.

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.902
- [Mark] And that's what makes--

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:36.735
- [Sufian] Shredded ice.

00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:37.568
- Shredded ice.

00:10:37.568 --> 00:10:38.401
No other dessert would do.

00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:41.767
The only thing that could top
this is a stinky bean cendol.

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:45.267
(Sufian and Mark laugh)

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:47.850
(upbeat music)

00:10:49.151 --> 00:10:50.364
- [Sufian] Wow.

00:10:50.364 --> 00:10:52.237
- [Mark] How was that, dude?

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:54.237
- This durian is superb.

00:10:55.373 --> 00:10:56.206
Wow.

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:02.305
I'm speechless right now. (chuckles)

00:11:02.305 --> 00:11:04.942
- It almost has the effect
of a root beer float.

00:11:04.942 --> 00:11:06.210
You know, when the foam,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.919
because of the carbonation and
then the ice cream, the foam.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:13.586
The durian and the ice cream
is having that same effect.

00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:19.622
Oh, wow.

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.491
Yeah, that durian is--

00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:23.324
- [Sufian] So big.

00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:25.160
- [Mark] Unbelievably good.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.618
It's so creamy.

00:11:26.618 --> 00:11:27.520
It's so sweet.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.109
It's like half frozen
because of the ice, right?

00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:30.942
- [Sufian] Yeah.

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:34.859
- [Mark] So it's like
very cold and refreshing.

00:11:36.627 --> 00:11:37.460
- Thank you.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.293
- [Mark] What was your name?

00:11:38.293 --> 00:11:39.126
- Rizar, Rizar.

00:11:39.126 --> 00:11:39.959
- [Mark] Rizar.

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:40.792
- Thank you.

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:41.915
- [Mark] (speaks in foreign
language) It's amazing food,

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:43.666
amazing food.
- Yeah, thank you.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.499
- What is it called?

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:45.494
Like when you're playing a video game

00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:46.547
and you go to the next level,

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:49.245
that's like going to the
next level of cuisine.

00:11:49.245 --> 00:11:50.921
Since we're in Temerloh, we've decided

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:53.558
to go try one more
restaurant that also serves

00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:56.881
the same dish, the fish with tempoyak.

00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:58.409
This is a tempoyak town.

00:11:58.409 --> 00:12:01.038
But since we just happened to be here.

00:12:01.038 --> 00:12:01.965
Okay, so we're on our way

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:06.965
to go try one more tempoyak
restaurant. (laughs)

00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:10.045
- That was life changing.

00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:10.878
- Yes.

00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:14.695
- Using durian as a cooked
ingredient was life changing.

00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:15.978
- Fermented cooked ingredient.

00:12:15.978 --> 00:12:18.478
(Joel laughs)

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.380
Just about a 10-minute
drive just down the river.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.341
And this is another very local restaurant

00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:35.383
to eat tempoyak plus the same catfish.

00:12:35.383 --> 00:12:36.216
We've just arrived.

00:12:36.216 --> 00:12:37.212
It's really in the neighborhood.

00:12:37.212 --> 00:12:38.479
You're actually backed into the jungle.

00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:40.255
You almost come back into the plantations,

00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:41.528
the fruit plantations,

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:43.967
and it looks like it's
in somebody's front yard.

00:12:43.967 --> 00:12:46.534
This really is like in somebody's home.

00:12:46.534 --> 00:12:48.673
So they have their home,
the whole compound,

00:12:48.673 --> 00:12:50.843
and then they open up the line of food.

00:12:50.843 --> 00:12:52.699
Again, you smell the tempoyak,

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:55.366
that durian, fruity, sour aroma.

00:12:58.093 --> 00:12:59.927
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:12:59.927 --> 00:13:01.896
Round number two.

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:04.254
- [Joel] Oh, the precious cargo.

00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:05.587
Just as excited.

00:13:08.307 --> 00:13:10.645
- And then over here is
where you scoop out your,

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:14.562
it's all self service,
scoop out your own rice.

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:21.894
Okay, we got the tempoyak curry.

00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:25.548
We got our own plates
of rice and vegetables.

00:13:25.548 --> 00:13:27.131
We've got some tea.

00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:30.895
We're all set for round two.

00:13:32.026 --> 00:13:34.429
And I'm really loving the
environment, the atmosphere here.

00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:36.277
It's very laid back.

00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:38.659
Same setup. (laughs)
- Same setup.

00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:40.705
- [Mark] We've got the tempoyak.

00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:41.538
We've got--

00:13:41.538 --> 00:13:42.371
- [Sufian] Patin tempoyak, the same fish.

00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:44.746
- The same fish, the bakar.

00:13:44.746 --> 00:13:46.397
- [Sufian] The pais patin.

00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:48.241
- I think in English, it's
called a silver catfish.

00:13:48.241 --> 00:13:49.889
So it is a type of catfish.

00:13:49.889 --> 00:13:51.678
Taste the curry, taste the broth.

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:54.542
Oh, an the owner, he hooked us up

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.559
with a whole bowl full
of just the extra gravy.

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:58.951
- [Sufian] Extra gravy.

00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:00.991
- I think the first step
is just to taste the gravy

00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:04.658
just to get the full
effect and taste of it.

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:11.507
Oh. (laughs)

00:14:11.507 --> 00:14:12.340
Oh, wow.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.650
I had a little drop go down onto my lap.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.507
Yeah, this one is almost really mangoey.

00:14:19.507 --> 00:14:20.340
- [Sufian] Mangoey.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.173
- [Mark] Like it's mangoey.

00:14:21.173 --> 00:14:22.387
- [Sufian] Yeah.

00:14:22.387 --> 00:14:25.363
This one is less thicker than the--

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:26.318
- [Mark] The previous one that we tried.

00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:28.243
But this one is nice
and spicy, and this one,

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:29.856
you can actuallY feel like the chili

00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:32.173
burning your lips a little
bit, like that first bite.

00:14:32.173 --> 00:14:33.006
- The first bite.

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:33.839
- That's amazing.

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:37.345
That is unbelievably good. (laughs)

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:38.568
And just the yellowness of it.

00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:42.011
Look how orange-yellow
it is with the turmeric.

00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:43.095
- -[Sufian] Spicier than before.

00:14:43.095 --> 00:14:44.101
- [Joel] More spicy.

00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:45.741
- Yeah, it is more spicy.

00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:48.339
And that is, it really,

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:52.240
truly is one of the
world's greatest flavors.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.351
I don't say that lightly.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.210
It reveals, it opens up your taste buds

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.651
that you didn't even think you had.

00:14:56.651 --> 00:14:58.161
The skin is part of the
highlight of eating this fish

00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:00.313
because it has a totally
different texture to it.

00:15:00.313 --> 00:15:03.142
Stick some of this on to the,

00:15:03.142 --> 00:15:03.975
oh, yes.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:08.392
He knew we wanted extra
gravy before we even started.

00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:18.738
That gravy goes so well with the rice.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:22.903
Like liquid fermented durian.

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:28.194
Life doesn't get better,
under a mango tree.

00:15:29.377 --> 00:15:32.697
I don't know if life can
get better than this.

00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:35.113
This is as good as eating gets.

00:15:35.113 --> 00:15:36.780
The sambal tempoyak.

00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:38.947
- Ooh.

00:15:38.947 --> 00:15:40.877
- Oh, it sticks to the lid.

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:42.544
That's a beautiful sight.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:45.461
Oh, look at the stickiness of that.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.825
Lumpy. (laughs)

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.335
oh, that smells so good.

00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:54.168
Oh, yeah.

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:58.308
That is not, that's not an
aroma for the faint of heart.

00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:00.337
(Sufian laughs)

00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.218
Just as I was leaving the
buffet line, I found the jenkol,

00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:07.616
but I'm gonna dip it
into the durian sambal.

00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:09.615
I don't know if you can dream
of a better combination.

00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:10.448
Cheers.

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:11.281
- Ready, guys?

00:16:11.281 --> 00:16:13.306
- (laughs) Jenkol.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.403
- Jenkol cheers.

00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:15.736
- Jenkol cheers.

00:16:18.315 --> 00:16:20.815
(Mark laughs)

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:24.175
Oh, that one almost tastes like cheese.

00:16:24.175 --> 00:16:26.331
And the jenkol is very, very young,

00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:28.748
so it's very soft and chalky.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.651
Yeah, you feel the chalkiness
coating your mouth.

00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:33.864
And for the bakar, I'm gonna unwrap this.

00:16:33.864 --> 00:16:35.864
This is the grilled fish.

00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:36.738
Oh, we got the head.

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:39.198
You can actually see the like,

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.322
the tempoyak starting to
ooze, ooze out of the packet.

00:16:42.322 --> 00:16:43.155
Oh, wow.

00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:46.944
That sauce is so thick.

00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:49.082
It's like a jam.

00:16:49.082 --> 00:16:52.082
I'm gonna take a little bit of this.

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:54.855
- Wow.

00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:00.068
- Wow.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.526
That is,

00:17:02.526 --> 00:17:05.368
oh, yes, I saw the finger lick.

00:17:05.368 --> 00:17:07.201
- Finger-licking good.

00:17:08.554 --> 00:17:11.276
- It's not, it's totally
okay to lick your fingers?

00:17:11.276 --> 00:17:12.109
- Yup.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:16.052
- Oh, good, 'cause you, like
the natural human thing to do

00:17:16.052 --> 00:17:18.660
would be lick your fingers immediately.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.388
It's that tasty.

00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:21.498
It really almost has

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.732
like an apricot mango flavor, mango puree.

00:17:24.732 --> 00:17:26.001
- [Sufian] This is the best part.

00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:29.870
- [Mark] The belly part,
fish belly tempoyak.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.110
- [Sufian] Full of collagen.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.943
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:33.176
- [Sufian] Full of collagen here.

00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:35.819
- [Mark] Collagen and durian.

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:38.240
Wow, look at that oiliness.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.266
Give that a dip.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:42.900
Dip it into... (chuckles)

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.690
- [Mark And Sufian] Oh!

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.857
- [Mark] That is the bite.

00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:49.928
- Oh, my goodness.

00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:53.105
(Mark laughs)

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:53.938
Oh.

00:17:58.729 --> 00:18:01.705
- [Mark] Your reaction
was just too tempting.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:04.819
And I like that they filled
tempoyak into the whole fish.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.135
Look at that.

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:09.391
It's like a stuffed, it's
stuffed with tempoyak.

00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:11.892
Look at that goo.

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:14.225
- [Joel] Wow, dipping jelly.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.644
- Oh. (laughs)

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:20.477
Oh, wow.

00:18:22.698 --> 00:18:24.300
That just oils in your mouth.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.911
The belly just starts to melt

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:29.923
and then like the fruity
pulpiness of that tempoyak.

00:18:29.923 --> 00:18:31.976
That's unexplainable delicious.

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:34.250
It's polite to lick your
fingers here, it's okay?

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.083
- [Sufian] Yeah.

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.082
- Okay.

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:38.421
There's a reason they
don't have napkins here.

00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:39.538
It's because you're gonna wanna lick,

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:41.201
you have to lick your fingers.

00:18:41.201 --> 00:18:45.368
No napkins on the table,
and no napkins necessary.

00:18:48.764 --> 00:18:51.347
Let's go with the jenkol scoop.

00:18:57.128 --> 00:18:59.746
Yeah, I mean, the deliciousness
of this meal is just,

00:18:59.746 --> 00:19:01.200
it's no exaggeration.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.117
No facial expression, no
descriptive vocabulary

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:08.450
can possibly do the food justice.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.409
- [Sufian] Sambal tempoyak.

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:10.909
- Sambal tempoyak.

00:19:15.088 --> 00:19:17.588
Then I also got some eggplant.

00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:22.051
Almost actually the
same texture as durian.

00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:24.378
It's just like custardy, like pudding.

00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:26.332
It just kinda melts in your mouth.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.832
You can taste a lot of garlic in that too.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:42.244
It just (laughs),

00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:46.519
this is one of the
hardest meals to explain,

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.618
not because of the, I mean,
not only because the flavor

00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:55.035
is so complex, but because
it's so unbelievably good,

00:19:56.942 --> 00:20:00.209
your brain cannot process
how good it is and cannot,

00:20:00.209 --> 00:20:01.459
your taste buds can't,

00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:03.547
here, okay, I got it down.

00:20:03.547 --> 00:20:04.721
When it hits your taste buds,

00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:07.494
your brain doesn't have
the capacity to explain

00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:10.653
how good it tastes, and
I will leave it at that.

00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:14.137
And I expected it to be
good because I love durian.

00:20:14.137 --> 00:20:16.456
I love spicy.
- Spicy, yeah.

00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:19.456
- But that like blew my expectations

00:20:20.502 --> 00:20:23.000
way over, multiple times.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.489
That really is one of the greatest dishes,

00:20:26.489 --> 00:20:29.396
like flavor, powerful
dishes that I've ever had.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.130
But I wanna say a huge
thank you to Sufian for--

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.963

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:49.331

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.401
