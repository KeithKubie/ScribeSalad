00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
Charles Darwin was a big fan of billiards.
He loved his billiard table.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.880
It was one of his prized possessions and one
of the most valuable things he owned.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.549
Well - not the actual table itself. In fact,
it was the balls that were so valuable.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.240
Pure ivory carved from the tusks of elephants;
only the wealthiest could afford a full set.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.500
Luckily he was married to an heiress.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.840
A full set of 16 billiard balls would require at least one, possibly two, full elephants worth of ivory.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.540
The idea that any bar in the world might contain
a billiard table available for anyone to play,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.260
and not like run out of the bar with your pockets full of valuable ivory would have sounded insane in 1850.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.680
And the billiard industry was well aware of
this problem.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.370
Billiard balls were getting more expensive,
elephants were getting more rare.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.830
It was thus not with an environmental motive, that in 1867 the Phelan and Collender Pool Supply Company

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.380
offered $10,000 to anyone who could come up with a substitute material that worked as well as ivory,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.940
but could be produced more quickly and sustainably
then dead elephants.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.970
An inventor named John Wesley Hyatt took on
that challenge.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.700
He used nitrocellulose, a flammable solid,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.800
created by mixing cotton with nitric acid
to create a hard, shiny, white sphere.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.850
The properties were extremely similar to ivory
billiard balls.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.750
The company never gave him the prize.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.500
But he did patent the technique, using it
to create billiard balls,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.910
piano keys and even teeth, becoming pretty
dang wealthy in the process.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.790
Also he pretty much created the industry that made all of the polymer materials that surround you right now,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.490
and that we'll be discussing today in Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.930
Also elephants didn't go extinct, so that's
a plus.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.650
[Theme Music]

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.720
The polymer that John Hyatt worked on was,
somewhat unsurprisingly, kinda crummy.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.760
It worked well once it was created, but the
manufacturing process was dangerous

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.550
because nitrated cellulose can explode in
a warm breeze.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.979
So luckily, some replacements started creeping
in.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.059
Replacements with some names you probably
recognize, like polyvinyl chloride or PVC,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.960
bakelite, polystyrene, polyester, and nylon.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.560
These are all polymers; huge chains or sometimes 3D networks of repeating organic units called monomers.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.820
Each polymer has a monomer, but they're all
relatively simple at that basic one unit level.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.760
The trick is that they bond to each other
on each side potentially forever,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.300
though in reality the chains are sometimes
hundreds, sometimes thousands,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720
sometimes hundreds of thousands of units long.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.160
In order to make a polymer all you need is a molecule that can easily bond to another identical molecule at 2 points.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.440
And the simplest of those is ethene, also
known as ethylene.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.120
It's polymer, you'll be unsurprised to hear is polyethylene, which you've probably heard about.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.999
We'll talk more about the specifics in a second,

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.769
but basically because pi bounds in the double
bond are weaker than sigma bonds

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.560
they can be broken and new monomers can be
added.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
Just to note to avoid confusion: polyethylene
has that "-ene" sound in it, right,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.180
but it's not an alkene because all those double
bonds get broken to form new sigma bonds.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.540
It's a polymerized alkene, but the molecule
itself is an alkane.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.800
It's confusing so I thought it's worth pointing
out.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.859
Now chemists might want a bunch of different
things out of their polymers;

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.959
maybe they want it to be stretchy, maybe strong,
maybe transparent, maybe recyclable.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.140
Polyethylene is transparent and thermoplastic, meaning it can be melted and reformed. Making it recyclable.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.799
Some other polymers like polyurethane or Bakelite
are thermoset.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.049
Which means that they change chemically during
some kind of curing process

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.329
and cannot be melted down and reformed.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.669
Polyethylene can actually be converted into
a thermoset polymer by introducing cross-links,

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.500
basically molecular bridges between those
polymer chains.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.720
Any plumbers out there probably have heard of cross-linked ethylene or PEX pipe. Which is what this is.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.070
It's extra, super strong because of those
cross-links.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.989
Polyethylene is also nice because it's strength can be varied by changing the size of the molecules.

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.949
If they are allowed to polymerize until they
are tens of thousands of monomers long,

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.629
the plastic they will form will be all knotted up in these ultra long chains and it will be extremely strong.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.049
That's why this HDPE, high density polyethylene,
is a strong bottle.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.650
Whereas this is much squishier, this is low
density polyethylene.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.660
However those ultra long chains also make it much more viscous when heated and thus more difficult to process.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.100
It also loses some of its opacity, and becomes
more of that milky white color.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.520
Now polyethylene is great.
It's really great.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.140
So great that it's the most common plastic in the world.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.330
We produce over 80 million tons of it per
year.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.570
But we want a lot out of our plastics - strength,
color, elasticity, resilience, recyclability -

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.920
we need everything from saran wrap to car
tires.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.880
All of these are traits that chemists work tirelessly to create in the early to middle 20th century

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.800
and continue to work on even today.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.819
One of the earliest techniques they used to
try and bring out new properties

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.339
was to change the substituents on the ethylene
monomer.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.759
Just, see what would happen.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.229
Like, what if we swapped out one of the hydrogens
for chlorine?

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.729
Well you get polychloroethene, kinda, that's
not what we call it.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.940
OK, so remember how benzene when attached
to a chain is a phenyl group,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.860
and how those two words have nothing to do
with each other?

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.940
Well the same thing goes for the ethene functional
group, which is called a vinyl group.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.620
It's an old word, super old, it comes from
the Greek word for wine.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.409
And that is why chloroethene is more commonly
called vinyl chloride.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.180
And polychloroethene is more commonly called
polyvinyl chloride, or PVC.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.159
Which is what this little ducky is made out
of and also what records are made out of,

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.620
which is why we call them vinyl.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.710
Now what happens when we change out a hydrogen
for a methyl group?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.610
Well then suddenly this molecule is a propene
or, if you are using ye old ways, a propylene.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.720
And, yes, if you polymerize it, it becomes
polypropylene.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.900
If one of the hydrogens is replaced with a
phenyl group,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.200
well that chemical was first derived from trees in the Styrax family, so it's called styrene.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.420
Polymerize it, polystyrene.
Make a foam out of it, Styrofoam.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.000
Now if you change all four of the hydrogens on the base ethylene with fluorine it becomes tetrafluoroethylene.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.220
Polymerize that and instead of hydrogens that
polymer is bound entirely to fluorines.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.000
Fluorine as we could guess from its spot on the periodic table, love electrons. It is extremely electronegative.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.100
But because it holds onto it's electrons so tightly, and is so satisfied in this polymerized chain,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.240
the electrons are unavailable for even minimal
interactions with any other molecules.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.599
I'm not just saying this stuff is super difficult to difficult to react with, or it's really stable.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.199
It's more than that the electrons aren't even
available for the sort of interactions that

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.539
make things stick to each other, or cause
friction.

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.770
Which is why you have heard of polymerized
tetrafluoroethylene,

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.140
because it's super useful, either by its abbreviation,
PTFE, or by its brand name Teflon.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.880
So how do we actually make these things?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.280
Well, ethene based polymers form through a
process called addition polymerization.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.050
The monomers are simply added together and
no by products are formed.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.099
In order to get the process kicked off you
have to introduce a free radical.

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.580
To me, that always sounded like some crazy
freedom-fighter diving into battle

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.620
without much thought for what would come after
he was consumed in the firefight.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.720
And, that's kinda what they are. Free radicals are atoms or ions that have a single unpaired electron.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.460
This is crazy unstable. It's basically like having half of covalent bond dangling off the atom.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.820
Anywhere this can form a bond, it's going
to form a bond.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.540
And, in the case of addition polymerization it attacks the double bond and joins one of the carbons,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.110
while the other carbon is itself left with
an unpaired electron.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.219
The molecule itself is now a newly formed
free radical,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.600
and it attack another nearby pi bond, joining with another molecule of ethene, forming another radical.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.960
This process continues until two radicals
meet each other

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.460
consuming both free radicals without producing
any more, thus, ending polymerization.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.340
There are, of course, other sorts of polymerization,
as well.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.600
Sometimes a hydroxyl group from one molecule is happy to join up with a hydrogen from another, forming water.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.419
The water will break away as a byproduct,
leaving the two molecules bound together.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.499
This often occurs when an amine group, with
its loosely held hydrogen,

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:51.120
meets a carboxylic acid, with its loosely
held -OH group.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.080
This is just what happens when hexamethylenediamine meets adipic acid forming another branded polymer, nylon.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.060
By dissolving hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid into two different immiscible, or un-mixable, solvents,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.260
we actually create nylon right here.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.979
The nylon forms at the interface between the
two immiscible liquids.

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:16.519
And, we can literally grab it and pull it
out of the vial, twisting and spooling it

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.480
until we get a nice glob of nylon.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.680
This works because hexamethylenediamine has
an amine group on each end

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.520
and adipic acid has a carboxylic acid on both
ends.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.479
Thus when the two monomer unit, called a dimer,
is formed,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.200
there is still a carboxylic acid on one end and an amine group on the other, allowing for further polymerization.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.540
These amine acid condensation polymerizations
also allow for the creation of

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.440
possibly the most important polymers on the
planet;

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.680
natural polymers being created inside of youvright now out of monomers that we call amino acids.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.180
Did you see that one coming?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.620
Amino acids polymerize through condensation
reactions guide by the code in your DNA and

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.280
some very complicated enzymes to form basically
you.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.550
Other important polymers in your body include:
polysaccharides, which we use to store energy;

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.160
and yeah DNA and RNA, which we use to encode
information for the formation of proteins.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.580
But that would be back to biology, which is
a whole other Crash Course.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.850
Which to be clear is available if you'd like
to watch it.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.280
And thank you for watching this episode of
Crash Course Chemistry, in it you learned:

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.480
That the first commercial polymer ever saved
the lives of a lot of elephants.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.780
That ethene is sometimes called ethylene.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:30.220
And, that a huge variety of polymers is based on the addition reaction of ethene based monomers, including Teflon.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.320
Which so friction-less because of fluorine's
extreme electronegativity.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.070
You also learned how addition polymerization
reactions work.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.690
And, that other polymers are formed by condensation
reactions.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.340
Including the polymerization of amino acids monomers, which along with other polymers like DNA and RNA,

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.860
and glycogen, make up a lot of the stuff that
is you.
