00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.300
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: How you doing?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.940
Thanks so much for joining us here.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.240
We really appreciate it.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.720
As was said, my name's Eric
Deggans, and I'm TV critic

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.360
for National Public Radio.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.100
So of course I should
be talking to an author.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.510
Actually, I've written a lot about
race in media and have also --

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.720
I interviewed Taraji P.
Henson for [inaudible]

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.420
so we got a little
bit in common here.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.760
So our esteemed guest, the daughter

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.460
of a NASA scientist
and English professor?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.760
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.060
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Virginia native.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.360
You worked in investment banking?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.060
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: That
was my first job out of school.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.360
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Wow.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.460
And also had a magazine
for expats in Mexico.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.760
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Mexico.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.060
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Inside Mexico?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.360
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.550
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Started working
on Hidden Figures in 2010.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.480
Wow. And became a New York
Times number one bestseller,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.870
spawned a movie that
was Oscar nominated.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.670
Margo Lee Shetterly, everyone.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.240
[ Applause ]

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.250
So I heard that you gave an
amazing speech last night

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.930
where you talked a little bit
about Charlottesville and race.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.900 position:56%
Could you give us just a little
taste of what you talked about there

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.240
and how it compares to what
you talk about in the book.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.540
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.890
The thing that we talked a little
bit about what I started out doing,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.320
which was working in
investment banking out of school.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.640
And really when I was growing
up, that seemed like progress

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.070
in the future and very
protagonist way --

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.700
life or career to have,
like very powerful.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.390
And history for me, it was
something that always felt --

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
I think as an African American,
always so heavy and connected

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.230
to this past, which is usually
taught in schools as slavery,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.940
Martin Luther King, and of course
now there's Obama, this very long

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.860 position:56%
but extremely narrow arc of history.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.400
And so during the course of writing
Hidden Figures, what I really came

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.070
to understand was how powerful
it is to be able to tell a story

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.560
and to write a story and
to tell your own story

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.780
and to be the protagonist
in your own story as opposed

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.700
to telling a story
where you are kind

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.210 position:56%
of the passive recipient of history.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.900
And so I live in Charlottesville,
Virginia.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.520
I went to the University of
Virginia, but recently moved there.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.930 position:56%
And this entire issue of the statues

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.060
and then the white
supremacist marches,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.790
all of that stuff has been
happening since I've moved there,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.860
and I think for me we're
very focused on the presence

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.840
of the statues and the
meaning of the statues,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840
what they have come to symbolize.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.240
But I think part of the issue
also is that the statues,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.770
they also represent an
absence of a counter narrative,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.100 position:56%
that there is the slavery narrative.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.400 position:56%
There are these confederate
statues, but in terms of a diversity

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.220
and a richness of African American
stories, there are very few

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.080
and there are very few in which
African Americans are protagonists.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.680
And these stories in which you are
allowed to be a protagonist matter.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
I mean, each of us is the
protagonist in our own life.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.310
We see ourselves as
people with agency,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.350 position:56%
and I think that's why we love
stories about super heroes and kings

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.260
and -- these stories
make us feel powerful.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.460
And so I think that it is really --

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.740
it is about the presence of
the apartheid and the presence

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.950
of the racial terror and slavery,
but it's also about the absence

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.300
of the counter narrative.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.900
I really see that one of
the jobs of bringing --

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.060
bridging some of these divides
is bringing forward these stories

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.260
that have always been there.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.560
The people have been there.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.860
The history is there.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.920
The stories are what
we need to tell now.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.220
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Right.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.410
Well, for people who may have been
under a rock for the last year

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.430 position:56%
or so, Hidden Figures, this
amazing book about these black women

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.480
who served as human computers
working for both the agency before

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.160
that preceded NASA and for NASA,
crunching all of this complex math,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.130 position:56%
these complex numbers that were used
first to develop the aerodynamics

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.060
for planes and then later to --
for space flight and the moon shot.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.700
Now I saw in the book you said
this isn't hidden history,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.000
it's unseen history.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I know you say everybody
asks you why don't we know this?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.360
But I'm going to ask you,
why don't we know this?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.320
And why is it unseen?

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.440
Are we afraid to look at it?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.400
Are we -- were we too
busy lionizing NASA

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.480 position:56%
and John Glenn and people like that?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.070
Why was it unseen?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: I think the
primary reason why this history has

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.940
been unseen is because
this work was women's work,

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.560
and that not just at NASA.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.050
So there was this [inaudible]

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.730
of African American women
working at NASA Langley.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.320
They were part of a much
larger cohort of women

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.320
from all backgrounds
doing the work at all

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.570
of the different NASA centers.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.920
There were women computers
working in the Army and the Navy.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.330
They were working at Bell Labs,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.360
which many of you may know
is the precursor to AT&amp;T

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.680
and basically founded the
communications revolution,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.750
cell phones and things like that.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.860
Virtually everywhere you
found technological progress

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.430 position:56%
that required number crunching and
reduction of data, there were women.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.870
There were rooms full of women kind

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.160
of like a living Excel
spreadsheet doing math, and I --

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.750
this work it was considered
sub professional work.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.140 position:56%
It was very necessary, but literally
the women at NASA were classified

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.120
as sub professionals which meant
they were above clerical employees.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.370
They were not as high in
the hierarchy as the men

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.340
who were engineers who were
considered professional employees.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.320
And so I think that that's a large
reason why this work was invisible.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.010
They were kind of the equivalent
of our computers sitting

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.060
on our desks doing the work
today and yet without them,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.080
all of these advances would
not have been possible.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.260
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Now I'm interested
in how you decided to focus on this

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.550
because I know, of course, you
were surrounded by these people

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.750
when you were growing up, and I've
done panels where I talk to people

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.140
and they go, "Well, I had this
idea and then I made it a reality

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.110
by doing X, Y and Z," and I
think to myself, wait a minute.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.880 position:56%
I want to hear about how you had the
idea because that to me is the key,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.710
deciding -- I mean there
were plenty of other people

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.020
who grew up around these people.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.980
In your neighborhood
when you were growing up,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.600
I'm sure everybody
knew these stories.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.380
What made you decide
this was worth a book?

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.500
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Well,
I've told this story before.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.800
It's interesting.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.160 position:56%
The moment -- there's a very
specific moment when Hidden Figures,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.110
what would become Hidden
Figures came into existence.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.660
And interestingly, it
came out of a moment

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.210
between the two most
important men in my life,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.370
my father and my husband.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.820
And so my husband and I
had gone back to Hampton,

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.460
and we were visiting my parents
for Christmas seven years ago now.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.830
And we had run into a woman who
had worked at NASA many years

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.360
as a computer, and that sort
of sparked this conversation

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.640
of my Dad sort of going into this
speech about what she had done

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.200
and the other women and
Katherine Johnson who --

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.530
she calculated the launch
window for the astronauts.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.760
It was a very casual way.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.660
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: You're
like wait a minute,

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.020
that moment where the
needle slips off the record.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.700
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: But
I didn't have that moment.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.170 position:56%
I didn't hear the needle slip off
the record because I had heard a lot

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.960
of those stories before,
and I had grown up there,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.380
and I had known these
women but had known them

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.030
as my parents' colleagues
and friends.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.690
But the needle definitely slipped
off the record for my husband

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.850
who is not from Hampton
and was like wait a minute.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.950
Can you please replay that for me?

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.210
And why haven't I heard
that story before?

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.540
And so for me it was a moment
of looking at the community,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:16.520
the people, NASA, this very
extraordinary kind of place

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.020
that I had grown up and that was
also extremely normal and ordinary

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.750
but looking -- being able to see
past what was so normal to me

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.900
and say wow, that is
pretty remarkable.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.730
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah,
and what's amazing to me

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.790
about the book is the level
of detail that you're able

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.500
to bring forth about
these people's lives.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.590
I mean, I feel like when Dorothy
Vaughn is walking to teach

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.000
at a high school, I'm walking right
along with her because you're able

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.630
to describe what that
journey was like.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.690
How did you get that
level of detail?

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.930
How did find the research to
say what the place smelled like

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.580 position:56%
or what landmarks she passed when
she was walking to that high school?

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.220
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Doing
the research, I loved it.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.170
I mean, I loved it.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.750
And I really -- the kind of book
that I wanted to write was the kind

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.350
of book that I loved reading,

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.510 position:56%
which is really detailed narrative
nonfiction where you are so immersed

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.260
in this dream and this life
that you lose yourself.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.390
You go into this time machine.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.830
And so I -- I mean, the sources --

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.150
there were so many
different kinds of sources.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.760
First of all, interviews
with people.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:35.290
Katherine Johnson who just turned
99 years old really amazing.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.780
I was very fortunate --

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.420
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Taraji P. Henson.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.720
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yes.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.020
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: You all
that didn't read the book.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.890
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: So I got
to spend a lot of time with her

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.540
and talk to her not just about
her life but also Dorothy Vaughn,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.220
for example, and the
relationship between the --

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.250
Dorothy Vaughn and the
women who worked for her.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.040
There were employee
newsletters starting in 1942

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.560
for the Langley Research Center,

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.370
which was called the Langley
Aeronautical Laboratory back then.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.910
Black newspapers, amazing source
of information, the description

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:15.800
of Mary Jackson's wedding dress
in the book came from an article

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.320
in the Norfolk Journal and Guide.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.620
I mean, the level of detail
in the black newspapers.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.350
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Talk about
telling our own story.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.650
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.900
It is amazing, absolutely
extraordinary.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.360
The NASA history office

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.970
and the Langley Research Center
has done a spectacular job

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.160
in preserving wind tunnel records,
research reports, phone books,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.000
seating charts, photos of offices
and work groups, teams of people.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.940
It was -- so I really -- I
loved that part of it, and I --

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.090
if I didn't have to
eventually turn in a book,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.540
I probably would still
be doing that research.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.840
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Now I
heard that you already --

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.600
you sold the rights
to this to be made

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.870
into a movie while
you were writing it?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.090
Man, I'm scared of you.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.560
I am scared of you.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.610
How'd you convince somebody
to buy the movie rights

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.430
to a book you hadn't even
finished writing yet?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Or that I
hadn't actually even started writing

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.850
is the --

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.230
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: I want her agent.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.530
Who's your agent?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.620
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.040
I will tell you I have a
very good literary agent.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.730
Her name is McKenzie Brady
Watson, young, very smart.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.030
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Excuse me.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.880
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
And she was the one

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.090
who represented my book proposal
and sold it to Harper Collins,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:47.030 position:56%
and then she was the one who
basically facilitated the getting it

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.220
into the hands of Donna
Gigliotto, who is the Producer

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.740
for Hidden Figures,
and Donna read it,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:59.460
and she immediately felt a
sense of mission, I think.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.950
She really made her job
championing this story as a movie.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:12.960
She made it her mission, and
it -- it is not a usual or --

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.980
it was sort of a lightning strike
set of circumstances that happened

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.380
with the book and the movie.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.680
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Wow.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.590 position:56%
Well, now what I love about the book
in addition to all the great detail

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.640
that we get about these wonderful
women is that you're able to talk

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.060
about so many different
things within that narrative.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.010
One example is the way in which
we've always had these periods

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.470
where there's been progress on
Civil Rights in America often

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.840
because America is threatened.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.720
World War I, World War II the
Cold War, and then these periods

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.140
of backlash where black
soldiers are coming back

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.650
from the war and they get beat up.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.710
This attempt to put
people back in their place.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.550
Talk a little bit about how those
themes work in Hidden Figures

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.570
and why it was so important to
make sure that we had a sense

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.100
of this sweep of history
in that way.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.300
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah,
I think again a lot of it came

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.370
from my interest and my preference
for these epic narratives,

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.080
and I wanted that these women
had that epic narrative.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.330
So it wasn't enough to
either to show their lives

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.020
or simply to show the history.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.060
I wanted their lives directly
connected to the sweep of history.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.300
And the thing about these women
is that they in so many ways,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.900
their lives were connected to
the big history and not just

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.310
for them working at NASA starting
in World War II, but for example,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.080
Katherine Johnson was one
of three black students

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.980
to integrate the graduate
schools in West Virginia.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.870
Dorothy Vaughn worked at --

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.100
as a math teacher before
she went to NASA.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.240 position:56%
She worked at a school in Farmville,
Virginia that filed a lawsuit

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.940
that was eventually incorporated
into the Brown versus Board

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.100
of Education suit, and that school
system was shut down by the state

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.790
of Virginia rather than comply with
the board decision and integrate.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:19.830
So it was -- it really was
fascinating to me to look

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.510
at these sweeps of history and
to see how this opening for all

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.690 position:56%
of these women happened during
World War II and because of the need

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.550
for labor and because
of the external threat.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.860
And that we would see these
periods of backlash, for example,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.210
when after Brown -- when
Virginia closed its schools.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:49.210
So I wanted to understand how the
big picture circumstances affected

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.440 position:56%
the individual lives of these people

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.130
and how they responded
to those circumstances.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.650
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:05.350 position:56%
I also love this idea of looking
at, for example, during the cold war

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.350
when all of these countries
were fighting off their colonial

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:14.120 position:56%
oppressors and the pressure that it
brought in America to show that hey,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.530
we're not really that bad.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.050
Hey, we'll strike down segregation.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.290
Please join us instead of
going with the communists,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.400
India or Liberia or Cuba.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.780
And you were able to also show how
that fit into their stories, too,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.080
which I thought was amazing.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.720
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah,
I mean this time of Sputnik --

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.500
1957 when the Soviets put
Sputnik, their satellite into space

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.790
that really kind of kicked off the
space race version of the cold war,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.500
that was a fascinating time.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.850
I mean, this was a
time of McCarthyism.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.610
It's the time of the Sputnik
obviously, the excitement of going

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.740 position:56%
into space, the fear of -- that
maybe the Russians are spying on us.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.260
It's the time that Little
Rock happened in 1957.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:04.180
So one of the most -- I mean, just
unbelievable documents that I found

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.530
that I put in the book that sort
of connected those two things is

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.550
that the Russians would
always publish a time table

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.940
of where the Sputnik satellite
was overflying during its sort

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.430
of orbit around the earth.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:24.070
And so I found this Washington
Post article that showed

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.670
that the Russians published
when it was flying

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.880
over Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.610
So very direct connections
between the domestic turmoil

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.820
and the United States and this
international global battle

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.220
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.760
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: And this idea
that because of segregation

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.670
and because people were oppressed

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.630
that America was holding
itself back.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.700
Like maybe one reason the
Russians got Sputnik up earlier is

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.800
because they gave women more agency
as engineers in the Soviet Union.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.100
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.090
There were many, many
more female engineers

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.740 position:56%
in engineering school there than
there were here in the United States

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.560
where women were still having
problems even getting admitted

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.990
to engineering programs.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.570
So yeah, no, I mean, I
think one of the things

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:22.100
that was very clear during the
research into Hidden Figures is

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.200
that the story is so important.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.790
The stories that we tell ourselves,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.730
the stories that we disseminate
inside the country outside

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.000
of the country, all of these
things affected the decisions

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000 position:56%
that people made in a very real
way, and the government was involved

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.440
in shaping those stories both
internally and externally.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.470
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Now your book
covers a wide swath of history.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.510 position:56%
It starts in 1943, comes all the way

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.740
through to the end
of the space program.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.060
Hidden Figures, the
movie, doesn't do that.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.480
Now, I went through the whole
book looking for Kevin Costner.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.500
I didn't see no Kevin Costner.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.290
So -- and I know that you said
that you enjoyed the movie,

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.790
and you didn't have a problem
with it, but were you surprised

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.030
at how they chose to tell the story
because it seems like they kind

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.770
of conflated a lot of things
and kind of crunched a lot

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.880
of circumstances together to make
the narrative more compelling.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.180
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
Yeah, I mean,

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.040
it was a really interesting
experience

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.600
of this whole Hidden Figures theme.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.510
While I was writing my first
book, learning how to do that --

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.810
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Your first book.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.230
Her first book.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.530
Oh my God.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.800
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: I was
also getting a crash course

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.220
in what it takes to adapt a book
for film and how you tell a story

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.010
through film and how
you tell a story --

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.230
sort of the difference between
fact and truth so there are a lot

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.540 position:56%
of facts that are conflated in the
movie, but what I really appreciated

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.910
about the final product of the
movie is that it's very true.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.110
It's very true to the
nature of the women.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.000
It is very true to
the circumstances.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.320
It's very true to NASA and
that sense of what it was

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.320
like during those early days of the
space race, but it was really hard

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.410
for me because first of all, I
wrote this book from 1943 to 1969.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:33.690
I was like why can't you make a
movie that goes from 1943 to 1969.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.690
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Or TV
show says the TV critic.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:36.990
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
Yeah, I mean, that was hard.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.820
I think it was very
much the right decision

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:45.420
to make a compact narrative focused
around this very dramatic moment

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.720
in Katherine Johnson's life

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.030
where she calculates the
trajectory for John Glenn's flight.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:58.050
And it was difficult to see certain
elements of the story shifted

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:03.380
from one character to the other
or see things that were created

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.350
like I'm sure anyone who has seen
the movie you probably did figure

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.360
this out, but yes, there was
no Kevin Costner character

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:17.810 position:56%
who sledge hammered the colored
sign in Langley, but it's sort of --

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.610
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: I was
looking -- I was in the index.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.910
Where's the --

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.050
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
But so it was --

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:30.470 position:56%
there were moments when I
struggled with some of the decisions

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.770
and there were moments --

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.160
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: One of the things
that struck me, for example,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.060
was that in you book you say

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:42.910
that they basically ended
segregation in [inaudible] in 1958?

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.410
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah, so
basically, yeah when [crosstalk] --

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.550
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So the time that
they're portraying in the movie

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.810
where there still seems
to be segregation,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.220
they had already stopped that?

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.520
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yes.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.820
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So does the --

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.120
yeah, the department wasn't
segregated during the time

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.420
that the movie shoes.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.720
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Exactly,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.500
but in order to bring together
these two very dramatic things

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.520 position:56%
which is John Glenn's orbital flight

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.040
and Katherine Johnson doing
the calculations and the end

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.360
of segregation, they were
conflated in terms of timeline.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.660
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Was
there ever a moment

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.020
when they had to break that to you?

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.320
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
Well you know what?

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.720
I have to say I know a lot of
people who have written books

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.580
and have them made into movies
have different opinions,

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.180 position:56%
but I had a very positive experience
with this, and the producer,

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.820
in particular Donna Gigliotti
who was the producer,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.510
really kept me in the loop.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.500
Every once in a while it's like 3
o'clock in the morning and I'd be

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.360
up working to try and finish
this draft so I can turn it in

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.730
and then the script would pop up
like latest version of the script.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:52.020
And so they really did
an amazing job, I think,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:57.030
of keeping me in the loop,
of honoring my suggestions,

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:03.500
really listening to me and doing
all they could to understand

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.570 position:56%
and preserve the authenticity of the
story, which I was very happy with.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.870
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Right.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.560
So the movie comes out,
and it's very successful.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.930
I think it was the highest grossing
movie amongst all the movies

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.970
that were nominated for best
picture the year that it came out.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.010
Your book was a New
York Times bestseller,

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.920
and then a year later we have
white supremacists marching

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.050
through Virginia who feel
like they've been supported

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.270
by the President of
the United States.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.840
What do you think?

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.170
I mean, on the one hand, there's
a sense that this story comes out

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.910
and people are so hungry for this
history and they are so worried

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.920 position:56%
about how people have been oppressed

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.890
and how this history has been
oppressed and then a year later,

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.480
we have people who
would be right at home

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.570
with the birds upholding white
supremacy marching down the middle

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.660
of a street in the
town that you live in.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.090
What do you think of that?

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.640
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: I mean,
this is I think -- this is America.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.850
I think a lot of -- there's
been a lot of commentary

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:18.530
after Charlottesville that the
town and the state and the country

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.720
that this is not who we are.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.020
It is who we are.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.110
I mean, America is
a complicated place.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.410
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: You
can clap for that.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.710
Go ahead.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.380
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: But what
I mean is it's a complicated place.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.230
Its been a complicated
place from the beginning.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:40.730 position:56%
And we have some of the most admired
and beautiful and worthy ideals.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.990
I mean, we hold these truths
to be self evident that all men

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.050
and people are created equal.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.430
I mean, this is something that we
navigate by and that we believe

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:58.350 position:56%
in here fundamentally, and we are
always at war with the ideal that --

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:04.420
and the reality of the
implementation and that is --

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.380
when I say this is
America, that struggle is --

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.620
that is the struggle
that we're always facing.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:19.030
And so it is -- I think
that we are --

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:24.130
this is a part of that struggle
for living up to those ideals

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.980
and saying what does it take to
really support and allow everyone

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.720
into those ideals and believing
in those ideals, doing what we can

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.920
to enforce them and to spread them.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:45.000
And I -- for me, I live 12
minutes driving from Monticello,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.080
and I think Monticello,
it's a fascinating place.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:54.320
Thomas Jefferson was an absolutely
riveting person who owned people,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.990 position:56%
humans, something that today we find
objectionable and who wrote some

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.830
of the most amazing and
insightful and beautiful words

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.200
about the nature of human freedom.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.310
And so that dichotomy is -- that
is sort of the core, I think,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.420
in a lot of ways that struggle of
America, and I think particularly

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.350
for me anyway as an
African American,

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.950
really trying to unite
those two things

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:33.940 position:56%
to say I both acknowledge the
circumstances of slavery in the past

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:39.280
and all of the heaviness that
comes with that, and I also embrace

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.980
and love the beautiful parts
of those ideals of our country

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.940
and the best of our country.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.830
So it's complicated.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:54.700
Every -- humans are complicated,
and this is a complicated place,

00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:02.110 position:56%
but I -- I think the fact that we
are living in a moment that it feels

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.220
like we're living in
the history right now.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.520
It's terrifying.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.820
It's fascinating.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.140
It's all these things at the same
time, and I think it's a moment

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.260
where the American
ideals are calling to us,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.100
and it's sort of like saying
can we take these from ideals

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.410
to putting them into practice
in our every day lives?

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.210
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Now we are
going to take a few questions.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.500
So I'm going to ask if you have
a question to line up at one

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.720
of these two mics, and I will
point to you, and I will ask you

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.720
to say your question and
please make it a question.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.270
Okay? Please.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.800
I always feel like the
stories of black folks

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.280
and especially black
women in the south get

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.060
at that what you just
talked about so effectively.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.870
The wonderful things about our
country and also the things

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.900
that we struggle with, the duality
of all these popular figures.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.490
We live that as black folks
in the south, do you think?

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.790
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
You know what?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.760
I am a native Virginian.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.580
I am a native of the south.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.880
I love the south.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.210
The south is a complicated place.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:23.060
I think people from -- a lot of
these issues that exist everywhere

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.900
in America are maybe closer
to the surface in the south.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.110 position:56%
So I do -- and southerners have a --

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.310
I guess the reputation of
being great lovers of history.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:42.080
And I think this embracing even
the hard things like really trying

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.020
to face those hard things and
make them also part of who we are

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.840
as a country and who
we are as individuals

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.070
and maybe it's the individual --
I think for me like trying to do

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.450
that work as an individual
and embrace all

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.850
of those things even the
painful things is part

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:06.710
of my heritage as an American.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.850
I think within me that's
sort of like the fusing

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.600
of all these -- the conflict.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.250
I want those things to
be able to coexist even

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.270
as they are difficult things.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.570
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Yeah.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.870
All right.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.880
Let's start over here if you
could just tell us your name

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.220
and your question.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.370
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is
Debbie Greenberg.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.730
I loved your movie.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.030
It gave me insight into my uncle
and cousins who grew up in Hampton.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.330
He worked at Langley as well.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.630
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Oh wow.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.270
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] back in that era.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.080
Now I understand.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.380
Thank you.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.680
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: You
should read the book.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.980
There's more about it there.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.330
&gt;&gt; My question to you as somebody
who grew up there just a few years

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:55.320
after what you portray, what
was the cultural environment,

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:01.410
the racial environment, the
interfaith environment and how has

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.280
that influenced you
and your outlook?

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.600
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: I
consider myself as having grown

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.840
up in a very -- in a
very interesting place

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.390
and a very wonderful time.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.400
So until I started doing
the research for this book,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:24.520
I didn't realize just how close
I was to kind of the tail end

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.050
of this period of desegregation
of the schools in Virginia

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.240
because Virginia really dragged
its feet for a long time.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.500
But when I went to school, I
went to integrated schools.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.040
Black kids and white kids.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.380
There were actually a lot of
Vietnamese people who lived

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.790
in the community so
we were heavily --

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.440
as you know, maybe Hampton runs
the very heavily military area,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.740
defense industry.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.300
So in addition to NASA,
there are any number of Army,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.750
Navy bases, Air Force base.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.070
So it really does get
a lot of people

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.770
from a lot of different places.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.900
And I think there was
a period that was --

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.730
the space thing had just happened.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:14.380 position:56%
People were still very optimistic
about that and so I feel like I grew

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.430
up in what to me was like sort of
still riding a lot of the optimism

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.580
for progress and change from
the Civil Rights Movement

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:32.950
from the space race there in
Hampton, and I went to a very kind

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.270
of normal -- I don't know,
American normal whatever that is

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.890
in the popular imagination public
school with kids from a lot

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.870
of different backgrounds,
socioeconomic backgrounds.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.800
I mean, I think this is something
that has changed since I was

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.200
in school, that I went to
school with kids who were

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.260
on public assistance,
and I went to school

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.460
with kids whose parents
were quite affluent.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.650 position:56%
And I think growing up with this
very diverse and not just ethnicity,

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.790
but I means in terms of economics,

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.830
nationality even was
a real privilege.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:16.130
And so I feel very, very
fortunate to have gone

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:21.310
to the Hampton Public
Schools, got a great education

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.990
and very much love my hometown.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.140
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Over here.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.580
Your name and your question.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.500
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Katie Dansler,
and I was wondering

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.680 position:56%
if you considered writing sort of a
follow up, maybe following the story

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.000
up at Dwight or the Mercury 13?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.300
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yes.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:47.960
So the Mercury 13 was a group of
women who were being recruited

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.390
with the idea that they could also
be part of the astronaut core,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.530 position:56%
and Ed Dwight is an African American

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.360
who was also recruited
into the astronaut core.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.760
Those are amazing stories.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.040
I mean, the thing about
Hidden Figures is that I --

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.810
there were so many
different fascinating stories

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.870
and people involved.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.730
Those are, I think, somebody
-- those are very worthy.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:21.570
I'm actually working on a next book
that doesn't have to do with NASA,

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:28.420
but those -- I spend so much time
even now reading about people

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.910
who were in some way
involved with this spine

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.330
of the Hidden Figures story.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.830 position:56%
So I don't have those plans, but I
mean, I think that those are stories

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.770
that we definitely
could [crosstalk].

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.330
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Perhaps
you could write that book,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.720
and you do mention Ed in the book.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.420
Your name and your story
-- and your question.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.720
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Steven.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.020
Excuse me, I'm a little
nervous, Thomas.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.630
I saw the movie, and it was
in an audience like this,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.790
diverse like this,
predominantly white.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:09.750
But when it was over, people
applauded and people were crying.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.620
My wife was crying.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.330
The white man next
to her was crying.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.210
The Asian woman next
to him was crying,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:23.390
and I was wondering what
you felt about what evoked

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.090
that deep emotion, tears of joy?

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.440
Tears of hope?

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.150
Tears of sadness?

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:36.510
What's your thinking on the
emotional impact of that story?

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.880
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
That is a great question.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.630
I've seen the movie like ten
times in different settings,

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.770
very different settings,
and it has been the same.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.430
I've seen in Hampton where
everybody knows the people.

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:56.140
I've seen it in -- I mean, just
with the people who made the movie.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.210
I mean, just so many different
settings, and it has been that.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.450
I think that it is --
there are these ideals.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:08.040
There are these things that we
want to believe about who we are,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:13.990
about who we can be and
I think that maybe what

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:21.220
that movie does is it shows us
an instance of closing the gap

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:27.670
between who we are when we fall
short and who we are when we stand

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.960
up and go up to our highest
level, and it's optimistic.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.900
It doesn't shy away from
the difficult things,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.190
but it doesn't take away the hope.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.250
And you need to look the difficult
things squarely in the eye,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.810
but you can never take
away the hope,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.390
and you can't deny the progress.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.200
Even in a moment like
now when people --

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.130
we're saying where there are many
challenges facing this country.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.000
Well, there have always been
challenges facing this country.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.420
We have made a lot of progress,
and I feel like we need to --

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.190
we need to acknowledge that
and even as we look squarely

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.690
at very difficult things,
we're humans.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.990
We need hope.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.880
We need happy stories to get up in
the morning and give us meaning,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.700
and I think that is maybe it.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.630
It shows the hard things.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.050
We have to see those things.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.440
We have to acknowledge them,
but we need the hope as well,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.030
and it's a very hopeful movie,
and it's a movie about people

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:33.790
who love what they're doing and who
-- for whom that becomes a bond.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.740
They come from all these
different backgrounds,

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.500
but these people are passionate
about the space program and numbers

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.270
and math, and that is very
true to who these people are.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.500
And it enabled them to
transcend and become very close,

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.620
and I think that's
also very positive.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.920
&gt;&gt; Keep hope alive.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.220
Thank you very much.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.970
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Your
name and your question.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.630
&gt;&gt; My name's Indola
Latte [assumed spelling].

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:12.110
I wrote down my question
because I'm nervous too, Thomas.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.630
At the beginning of this talk,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.360
you talked about how history
was not hidden but unseen

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.150
and the book you wrote and the
movie that was produced was one way

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.280
of making this story seen and
visible to much of the American

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.330
and international public.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.880
What are other ways you see unseen

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.240
or counter narratives
being brought to light?

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:45.180 position:56%
And how do you think the awareness
of these stories will have an effect

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:54.700
on the actions that we as America
take and on the global community?

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.000
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: When I --

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.950
growing up, I always thought of
history as the history of politics

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:05.230
and presidents and -- I mean, this
sort of very big picture history,

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.020
but history is really what
all of us, each of us,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.820
does and history is
about communities.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.780
It's about people and how our
lives fit into the great course

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.460
of human events, and
I think that the --

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:26.690
maybe sort of in the same way that
I think science is always seen

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:31.020
as the great individual
scientist, Einstein and all

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.370
of these great people who have
been mostly men in the past,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.850
but we don't see that how much
of that scientific progress

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.200
and work is based on the teamwork
and people coming together

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.210
to create something,
a great, a giant leap.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:53.980 position:56%
I think in the same way we see these
great individuals and we don't look

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.250
at the people around us,
and I think that's --

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.380 position:56%
I mean, that sounds really
simplistic, but I think just looking

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.010
at the people around us,
grandparents, people who live

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:11.580
down the street, why is this moment
here and its been there for so long

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.000
and how did it get there?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.210
I mean, asking these questions
about things in our surroundings

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.290
and saying that we're going to
start looking at the history

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.720
from the ground up as opposed to
the history from the top down.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.560
I mean, I love those stories
because I think those are sort

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.740
of very human level stories,
and I think that those --

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.640
that very human level
view of why things --

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.670
why things happen is something
people are really hungry for.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:48.900
I was dying to go and see the
presentation of J.D. Vance

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:57.770
who I think is also writing about
people in our country from a point

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:04.100
of view that we don't always get
and that people are hungry for.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.480
And I think there's a
lot of similar energy

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.020
between why people are very
interested in hidden figures

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.940
and very interested in [inaudible],
and I think maybe people see

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.970 position:56%
that as a contradiction, but I think
there's quite a lot of similarity

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.960 position:56%
between what people are looking for.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.300
So I think maybe looking from the
bottom up as opposed to the top

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.370
down in terms of history
is a great start.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.670
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Okay.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.650
This will be our last
question from the field.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.340
So better be good.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.640
Just saying.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] be the last question.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.730
My name is Allen Weinstein.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.750
Not quite Einstein, but --

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.470
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Well now
you're really raising the bar.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:52.170
&gt;&gt; But in my own way, I like
to think I made a contribution

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.650
to the emergence of
computer technology

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:56.810
in science in my field particular.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.930
So I'd like to thank you for your
contribution from the vantage point

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.680
of a white male, not an
African American female.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.590
But what I actually [inaudible] my
question is how did the book differ

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.870
from the movie in any
significant way?

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.130
And what was your role in
that if it was a difference

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.800
between the book and the movie?

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.990
What was your role
in that difference?

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.290
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: So --

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.860
well the biggest difference
between the book and the movie

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.510
as the book starts in
1943 and ends in 1969,

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:37.080
and the movie is just a sliver,
basically takes place from 1957

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.500
to 1962 and because of that as we
talked about a lot of the timelines

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.920
and things were conflated.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.670
So I was a consultant on the movie.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.270
They would ask me questions.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.350 position:56%
I would give them a lot of research.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:57.910
And -- but one -- just sort of
to speak a little bit to the math

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:02.400
and the computer part
of it, so the book --

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.440 position:56%
NASA is an engineering organization.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.620
A lot of this was about building
planes and building spaceships,

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.890
and the book Hidden Figures
is very much about that.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.610
But because Katherine
Johnson as a mathematician

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:18.440
in that whole hierarchy
was the central character,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:25.500
they really created a plot in
the movie that hinged on math

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.560
and her viewpoint, it was really --

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.950
it was just something that
I didn't even really learn

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:35.160
until after the movie was produced
and had all these questions

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.040
about how this particular part
of the script had come together,

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.880
but they made this very interesting
decision to really make it a movie

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.340
about math as opposed to
about the engineering,

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:52.170
which the book is a lot
more about engineering

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.150
than the minutia of the math.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.510
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Of the math,
yeah, yeah, and about their lives.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.810
I mean, you --

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.110
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly:
And about their lives.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.410
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: You detail
their lives a lot more

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.710
than the specific projects
that they worked on.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:05.050
I wanted to ask you
real quickly to talk

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.950
about the human computer
project that you're working on.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:12.350 position:56%
This is something you have
continued past the life of the book.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.920
Can you talk a little bit
about what you're doing there

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.570
and how its succeeded since the
book and the movie have come out?

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:20.980
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: So yeah,
the human computer project --

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.740
essentially what I was so surprised
to discover during the research

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:31.340
for Hidden Figures is how many
women were involved in computing

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.970
as I talked about before
not just at NASA,

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.030
but in all of these
other organizations,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:41.250
and so this is really a way to
try and catalog all of the women

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:46.110
who are involved in doing this
work in the early days of computing

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.980
and really understand what kind
of work they were doing and also

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.420
to get a snapshot of women in these
fields and see if there's something

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.170
that we might learn from those
early pioneers that we can apply

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.320
to women working in
these fields today.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.620
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: So if people want

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.990
to participate, they
can find it online?

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:06.690
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Yeah,
thehumancomputerproject.com

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:10.690
or you can reach out to me
at margotleeshetterly.com.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.990
&gt;&gt; Eric Deggans: Great.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.290
Well, thanks a lot guys.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.060
Really appreciate your
attention, your great questions.
