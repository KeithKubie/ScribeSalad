00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.490
The Siberian Family Who Didn’t See Another
Human for Over 40 years

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.500
To this day, the Siberian wilderness is still
one of the most isolated places in the world.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.330
Known as the Siberian taiga (meaning “forest”
in Russian), its harsh, cold climate greatly

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.800
discourages human habitation.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.050
Its steep hills and difficult terrain makes
it nearly impossible to travel through it,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.119
much less live there.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.050
It’s filled with pine and birch trees, nearly
undisturbed by humans for centuries.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.180
Bears and red foxes wander through the forest
during the day, while wolves hunt at night.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.760
It’s freezing cold with the average mean
yearly temperature at negative five degrees

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.179
Celsius.

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:46.210
Stretching east to west, from the Atlantic
Ocean across the continent to the Mediterranean,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.699
and extending up north to the Mongolian Arctic
border, the Siberian taiga is the largest

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.019
of Earth’s nearly uninhabited wilderness.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:01.170
Nearly five million square miles of barren
land sparsely populated by a few towns containing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.530
only a few thousand people.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.650
In 1978, a team of Russian geologists were
sent to explore the deepest, most isolated

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.590
part of this region.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.900
Forest and wilderness that, at the time, have
been barely touched by human hands.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.220
Traveling there via helicopter, from high
above the taiga, they spotted something that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.300
seemed quite unusual- a clearing with a garden,
clear evidence of human life.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.200
This seemed nearly impossible to the geologists.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.530
They were nearly 150 miles from the nearest
human settlement.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.950
Upon landing, the geologists knew they had
to investigate, despite their trepidation.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.740
One of the geologists, Galina Pismenskaya,
said later that they had “put gifts in our

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.460
packs for our prospective friends,” but
also checked “the pistol that hung at my

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.560
side.”

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.660
They continued on and found more signs of
human inhabitants- a wooden staff, a log bridge

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.860
across a stream, more gardens, until they
saw a hut.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.880
They approached the hut with caution.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.320
Finally, the makeshift door creaked open and
out stepped an old man with tattered clothing

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.780
and an unkempt long beard.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.880
Despite having “fear in his eyes”, the
old man said very softly to his visitors,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.720
“Well, since you have traveled this far,
you might as well come in.”

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.420
As the geologists entered, what they saw astonished
them.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.700
The dwelling was something out of history
books- tree stumps holding up the foundation,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.920
floor made out of potato peels and pine-nut
shells, everything covered in filth.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.340
As they looked closer in the dim-lit, one
room shack, they saw this was a home for a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.170
family of five, a father and four children,
two of which began crying uncontrollably at

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.420
the sight of humans unknown to them.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.130
As the geologists said,
The silence was suddenly broken by sobs and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.130
lamentations.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.380
Only then did we see the silhouettes of two
women.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.810
One was in hysterics, praying: ‘This is
for our sins, our sins.’

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.530
The other, keeping behind a post… sank slowly
to the floor.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.600
The light from the little window fell on her
wide, terrified eyes, and we realized we had

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.360
to get out of there as quickly as possible.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.060
Karp Lykov, the old man, once lived in a populated
part of Russia.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.750
He was a member of a fundamentalist Russian
Orthodox sect known as the Old Believers,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.280
called this because their worship style hasn’t
changed since the 17th century.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.600
Old Believers had been persecuted in Russia
for centuries, even before the Soviets took

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600
over.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.971
Dating back to Peter the Great’s reign in
the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Old

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:34.930
Believers, who customarily wore beards, were
forced to pay a tax on their facial hair.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.860
When the Soviets took over, Karp thought it
was time to retreat to sparsely populated

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.920
towns that dotted Siberia.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.810
One day, in 1936, while working the fields
with his brother near their village, a Communist

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.440
guard came by and shot his brother right in
front of him.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.650
Karp immediately grabbed his family (which,
at the time, only consisted of his wife, his

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.260
son Savin, and his 2-year old daughter Natalia)
and disappeared into the dark Siberian wilderness.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.050
Karp and his wife, Akulina, had two more children
in the wild, Dmitry and Agafia, who before

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.130
they met the Russian geologists, had never
seen another human besides their own family.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.500
Everything they knew of civilization came
from their parents.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.139
They were taught how to read and write with
the help of an old family Bible.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.590
They knew nothing of the world past 1936,
including even the existence of World War

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.699
II or the Cold War.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.870
Every member of the family had to learn how
to provide for themselves using only the resources

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.990
found within the wilderness.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.090
As the children grew, they became the hunters
and gatherers.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.279
Dmitry, for example, learned how to kill animals
without guns or bows.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.520
He did this by digging traps and chasing the
animals until they collapsed from exhaustion.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.090
Times became even tougher for the family when
Akulina passed away in 1961 (approximately)

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.090
from starvation.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.069
Now, it was just a father and four children
struggling to survive.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.710
Realizing how traumatic this must be for the
kids, having never met another human before,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.139
the geologists retreated out of the hut and
set up camp a little ways away.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.220
Soon, the family came out and approached the
scientists, still scared but curious.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.539
At first, they refused everything given to
them by the geologists, including clothes,

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.710
food, and bread (Karp explained that his youngest
children had never even seen bread, much less

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.909
tasted it).

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.819
Soon, the family and the geologists formed
a bond.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.680
The geologists told them about what they’d
missed in the world since 1936 and showed

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.190
them modern innovations like cellophane (“Lord,
what have they thought up—it is glass, but

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.449
it crumples!”, exclaimed Karp) and television
(which scared and enthralled them at the same

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.449
time).

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.789
In turn, the family showed the geologists
how to survive in the Siberian taiga, including

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.680
how to grow crops in such harsh conditions.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.120
The geologists continued to survey the wilderness,
co-existing with the family, for several years.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.639
On several occasions, the scientists tried
to convince the family to move back to civilization,

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.949
but they refused.

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.220
Eventually, though, the years of survival
in harsh terrain caught up with them.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.430
In the fall of 1981, three of the four children
(Dmitry, Natalia, and Savin) passed away within

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.949
several days of another, two from kidney failure
and one from pneumonia.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.181
The geologists offered to transport the sick
members of the family to a hospital, but their

00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.740
offer was staunchly refused.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.129
After the death of the three, the geologists
once again tried to convince Karp, now a man

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.479
in his late 80s, and his youngest daughter,
Agafia, to move in with relatives in a village

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.080
150 miles away.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.869
They still refused.

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:42.610
On February 16th, 1988, exactly 27 years to
the day after his wife, Karp passed away in

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.729
his sleep, leaving only Agafia as the surviving
member of the family.

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.139
Insisting on staying, Agafia, as far as I
could dig up, to this day now in her 70s,

00:06:52.139 --> 00:07:01.830
still lives high in the mountains of the Siberian
taiga.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.830
Alone.
