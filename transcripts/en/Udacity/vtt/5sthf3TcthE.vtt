00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:02.540
Philip did really really well
throughout the interview.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.830
He was able to make sure that he was
communicating what he was thinking

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.810
all the time.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.220
So I never worry that he had
no idea what was going on.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.720
He went into great depth when I asked
him a question and he was usually on

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.270
point with run times and thinking
about how much space things take up.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.430
So the three things he did well were,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.000
he was great at making sure was
communicating his thoughts,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.930
being very specific about run times,
and memory space.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.850
And I'd say the third thing that he
did really well was when needed he

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.200
put out a diagram and made sure it
was very clear what he was saying.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.440
Things that I think he
could've done better,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.480
where I think he needed his
testing on the first question.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.510
The fact that he wasn't using
the syntax of a testing library would

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.860
show to an interviewer that he hasn't
written that many tests, potentially.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.500
So using the actual syntax of Python
testing library would be one thing

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
that would be important.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.129
Number two would be

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.690
making sure he has the runtimes of basic
things like using data structures.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.670
He ended up being fine in the end and
he ended up driving the right runtime.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.880
But making sure that's down pat
is something interviewers usually

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.280
are looking for.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.950
And I'd say the last thing is as
a full stat candidate, companies

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.113
are usually looking for people who can
not only work in the back end which

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:32.710
Philip clearly shows he can do, but
also work on the front end well also.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.810
I think at the end of the Google
question where Phillip said,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.700
not too sure about how
the rendering works.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.500
That would indicate that he's more
backend leaning, and a real really

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.060
really strong full stat candidate would
have been able to do that part as well.
