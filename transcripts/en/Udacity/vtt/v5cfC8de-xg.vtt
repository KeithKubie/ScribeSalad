00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.542
It's clear that evolution, genetics, and epigenetics come together to make us

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:07.979
who we are, and this is truly an amazing process. We could devote an entire

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.040
course to this, but we just don't have the time in Introduction to Psychology.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.550
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you've enjoyed the topics we've covered so far in genetics for this course,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.580
you should check out our other course, Tales from the Genome. Where we'll delve

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.982
deeper into the topics of genetics and learn a lot more about DNA, identity,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.500
and health.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.194
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much for your help on this, Matt. But now, it's time for us to

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:32.360
move on to something that's equally as astonishing and that's our brain. It's

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.850
truly amazing how our brain works and how complex of a system it is. So, we're

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.490
going to devote some time looking at the different functions and structures of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.530
the brain because they're going to come up in future lessons.
