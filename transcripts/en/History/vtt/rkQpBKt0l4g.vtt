00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.380
- Bladesmiths, welcome to our
strength test

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.290
the bicycle frame chop.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.540
Now, what I'm
going to do is take

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.830
each of your canister
Damascus knives,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.880
and I'm gonna deliver
several very brutal strikes

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.710
to these bicycle frames.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.500
Tony, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.880
- Let's get it on.
- We're going to.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.380
TONY: Chopping a bicycle frame
is an extremely violent test.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.210
My biggest concerns
are the grain

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.670
may be too big and
susceptible to breaking.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.710
[grunting]

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.670
[exhales]

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.880
Well, Tony, the
blade stayed aligned.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.750
But you've got several rolls.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.540
Some little pieces are missing.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.080
But other than
that, that held up.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.920
Good job.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.380
Thank you.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.420
How are you feeling, Rebel?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.750
As ready as I'll be for this.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.920
[laughs]

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.710
I'm feeling a little
worried because my pins

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.210
are not all the way
through my handle

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.460
because I had rushed on it.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.380
And so one of the
slabs could pop off.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.790
OK, Rebel, your knife held up.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.790
What I really liked
though was your handle.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.540
Though it's on the
little rough side--

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.210
I mean, you've got the
pins coming through here--

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.880
but it was very comfortable.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.250
Chuck.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.000
Let's do this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.460
I'm a little concerned
about his swinging technique

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.500
and breaking my blade.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830
But I've done
everything I can do.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.670
My only real
concern is I may not

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.080
have addressed all the handle
issues that the judges wanted.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.460
[grunting]

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790
Nice.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.750
Well, Chuck, your
blade held up very well.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.460
You do have some minor chipping
up at the front end here

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.290
and a little bit of rolling
on the main belly part.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.880
But the problem I
have is the handle.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.210
As I was chopping,
it's constantly

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.210
wanting to turn in my hand.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.120
Bladesmiths, now
it's time to find out

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.540
if there's any sharpness
left to your edge.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.960
Now, unlike the
strength test, this

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.960
is all about what the
edge of your blade

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.380
will do to these inner tubes.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.710
Tony, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.290
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.710
When Doug takes the
blade, I'm apprehensive

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.880
'cause my blade took a little
more damage than the others.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.790
Nice.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.620
Thank you.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.920
OK, Tony, let's talk
about your blade right here.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.420
The blade configuration slices
through these inner tubes.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170
You don't have a flare over here
that might want to go through.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.710
But overall, your
blade will cut.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.420
- Thank you.
- Good job.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.250
Hey, Rebel, how are you feeling?
- Good.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.250
Let's do this.
[music playing]

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.830
Nice job.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.170
All right, Rebel, let's
talk about your blade here.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.500
First up, it's got the
cleanest cut so far.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.750
Your handle
construction is smooth.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.120
But most importantly,
your blade will cut.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Thank you.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.960
All right, Chuck, your turn.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.750
You ready for this?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.580
I'm ready.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.080
Let's do this.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.120
I see the other two
smiths' blades cleanly

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.710
sliced through the inner tubes.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.620
My edge was left
intentionally fat to take

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.080
the abuse of the frame chop.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.580
Hopefully, this
doesn't send me home.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.920
[music playing]

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.620
All right, Chuck, let's
talk about your blade.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.380
You've got an edge
over here that lends

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.540
itself to slicing and chopping.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.580
But overall, it will cut.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.290
Good job.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.460
Thank you.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.120
Bladesmiths, the
judges have deliberated

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.620
and made their final decision.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.750
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Tony.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.170
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.500
David Baker's
gonna tell you why.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.080
Tony, you made a great
comeback in round 1

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.920
and managed to finish
a blade and get

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.960
it to pass one of the
toughest strength tests

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.830
I've ever seen on this show.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.330
But in the end,
your blade took more

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.580
damage than the other smiths'.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.420
And that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.420
I understand.
