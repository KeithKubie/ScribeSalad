his plays you think ok we buy this
 

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.080
his plays you think ok we buy this
because we just see it enacted before us

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.090
because we just see it enacted before us
 

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.200

but if it had to go through six layers

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.210
but if it had to go through six layers
 

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.850
but if it had to go through six layers
of editors they probably would have

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:23.860
of editors they probably would have
 

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.790
of editors they probably would have
pushed him on it you think so there's

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:26.800
pushed him on it you think so there's
 

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.490
pushed him on it you think so there's
not some hidden wisdom we don't know

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:29.500
not some hidden wisdom we don't know
 

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.670
not some hidden wisdom we don't know
yeah actually do not know and one of the

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:32.680

able to ask him those questions and that
 

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.230
able to ask him those questions and that
means that he's infinitely interpretable

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240
means that he's infinitely interpretable
 

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.690

do not want it done that way and I
 

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.060
do not want it done that way and I
forbid you to do it do that as an author

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.070
forbid you to do it do that as an author
 

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.640
forbid you to do it do that as an author
would you prefer to be in that situation

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:02.650
would you prefer to be in that situation

looks like right you have to start from

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:28.810
looks like right you have to start from
 

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.480
looks like right you have to start from
the beginning that's right because

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.490
the beginning that's right because
 

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.460

otherwise then especially in this day

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:32.470
otherwise then especially in this day
 

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.860
otherwise then especially in this day
and age of ferreting out people's secret

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:34.870
and age of ferreting out people's secret
 

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.260
and age of ferreting out people's secret
identities you will have left enough

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:37.270
identities you will have left enough
 

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.970
identities you will have left enough
clues so that they wouldn't find you

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:38.980
clues so that they wouldn't find you
 

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.270
clues so that they wouldn't find you
quite quickly or you turn into sand

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280
quite quickly or you turn into sand
 

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.370
quite quickly or you turn into sand
everyone has an opinion about what a

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380
everyone has an opinion about what a
 

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.920
everyone has an opinion about what a
kooky must be for having disappeared at

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:45.930
kooky must be for having disappeared at
 

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.080
kooky must be for having disappeared at
the height of his powers or something

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.090
the height of his powers or something
 

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.330
the height of his powers or something
yeah and then we get people to him at

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340
yeah and then we get people to him at
 

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.860
yeah and then we get people to him at
the time writing a book about what a

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:51.870
the time writing a book about what a
 

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.930
the time writing a book about what a
kook kooky was because they actually got

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940
kook kooky was because they actually got
 

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.090
kook kooky was because they actually got
into the inner sanctum right you know he

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100
into the inner sanctum right you know he
 

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.230
into the inner sanctum right you know he
was a coup what can I say we all we all

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240
was a coup what can I say we all we all
 

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.690
was a coup what can I say we all we all
grow up on Salinger we loved Salinger

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700
grow up on Salinger we loved Salinger
 

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.290
grow up on Salinger we loved Salinger
yeah and and in a way it kind of doesn't

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:06.300
yeah and and in a way it kind of doesn't
 

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.910
yeah and and in a way it kind of doesn't
matter what a kook a person is right

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:09.920
matter what a kook a person is right
 

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.740

unless they're kookiness has been fully

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:12.750
unless they're kookiness has been fully
 

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.410
unless they're kookiness has been fully
embodied in their in their work and if

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:15.420
embodied in their in their work and if
 

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.360
embodied in their in their work and if
it's malevolent kookiness then we don't

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.370
it's malevolent kookiness then we don't
 

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.090
it's malevolent kookiness then we don't
like it right right yeah in the case of

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100
like it right right yeah in the case of
 

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.950
like it right right yeah in the case of
Salinger I don't think that's no no it

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960
Salinger I don't think that's no no it
 

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.450

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.190
not careful about how that data is
 

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.090
not careful about how that data is
protected it could leak out

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:55.100
protected it could leak out
 

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.830
protected it could leak out
it could accidentally be exposed to

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840
it could accidentally be exposed to
 

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.020
it could accidentally be exposed to
other people and then also if big

00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.030
other people and then also if big
 

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.180

archives are made that has collected

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:01.190
archives are made that has collected
 

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.130
archives are made that has collected
many thousands of people this could

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.140
many thousands of people this could
 

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.470
many thousands of people this could
suddenly become an attractive target so

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480
suddenly become an attractive target so
 

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.690
suddenly become an attractive target so
today we're a little bit guarded in the

today we're a little bit guarded in the
 

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.279
today we're a little bit guarded in the
sense of this genetic information is

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:09.289
sense of this genetic information is
 

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:12.070
sense of this genetic information is
decentralized in many different labs so

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080
decentralized in many different labs so
 

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.810
decentralized in many different labs so
that if there's a breach at one lab it's

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:13.820
that if there's a breach at one lab it's
 

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.150
that if there's a breach at one lab it's
relatively localized if everything gets

relatively localized if everything gets
 

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.220
relatively localized if everything gets
aggregated together it becomes a little

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:18.230
aggregated together it becomes a little
 

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.990
aggregated together it becomes a little
bit more risky because it becomes a

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000
bit more risky because it becomes a
 

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.760
bit more risky because it becomes a
little bit more attractive as a target

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:21.770
little bit more attractive as a target
 

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.500
little bit more attractive as a target
I think these challenges can be overcome

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:23.510
I think these challenges can be overcome
 

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.960
I think these challenges can be overcome

although actually come to think of it I
 

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.419
although actually come to think of it I
I wonder whether there might be some

making your choices partly or not yeah
yeah no I guess what I'm saying is very

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.210
yeah no I guess what I'm saying is very
 

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.289
yeah no I guess what I'm saying is very
unfair if you go far enough if you look

00:25:58.289 --> 00:25:58.299
unfair if you go far enough if you look
 

00:25:58.299 --> 00:26:01.440
unfair if you go far enough if you look
closely enough at any genome I wonder

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:01.450
closely enough at any genome I wonder
 

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.960
closely enough at any genome I wonder
whether you find some horrors you know

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:03.970
whether you find some horrors you know

attendance maybe in the family but maybe

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.230
attendance maybe in the family but maybe

not in that particular person right

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:10.210
not in that particular person right
 

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.710
not in that particular person right
right right

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720
right right
 

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.169
right right
so that is that would be one of the

00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:13.179
so that is that would be one of the
 

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:16.019
so that is that would be one of the

00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:16.029
hazards one of the pluses is and they
 

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:18.360

they did a show like this in in England

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:18.370
they did a show like this in in England
 

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:19.799
they did a show like this in in England
in which they got a bunch of people in

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:19.809
in which they got a bunch of people in
 

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:20.999
in which they got a bunch of people in
the room and asked them where they were

00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:21.009
the room and asked them where they were
 

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:22.590
the room and asked them where they were
from and they all said they were from

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600
from and they all said they were from
 

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.539
from and they all said they were from
England right or someone who said they

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:24.549
England right or someone who said they
 

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.919
England right or someone who said they
were from France and that they had

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:25.929
were from France and that they had
 

00:26:25.929 --> 00:26:27.389
were from France and that they had
always been from France and that their

00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399
always been from France and that their
 

00:26:27.399 --> 00:26:29.610
always been from France and that their
families and so forth and always been

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:29.620
families and so forth and always been
 

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.350
families and so forth and always been
from England or France and then they ran

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360
from England or France and then they ran
 

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.570
from England or France and then they ran
their genomes and found that they were

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:33.580
their genomes and found that they were
 

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.450
their genomes and found that they were
related to you know people that they had

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:36.460
related to you know people that they had
 

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.240
related to you know people that they had
claimed to dislike such as Muslims or

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.250
claimed to dislike such as Muslims or
 

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.399
claimed to dislike such as Muslims or
maybe they were related to an African

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:41.409
maybe they were related to an African
 

00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:43.560
maybe they were related to an African
and there were some huggy kissing scenes

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:43.570
and there were some huggy kissing scenes
 

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.259
and there were some huggy kissing scenes
in which people in in this study group

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:46.269
in which people in in this study group
 

00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:48.330
in which people in in this study group
found out that they were cousins which

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:48.340
found out that they were cousins which
 

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.740
found out that they were cousins which
they had never known Wow

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:49.750
they had never known Wow
 

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.669
they had never known Wow
so it can be a very me part of human

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679
so it can be a very me part of human
 

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:56.639
so it can be a very me part of human
race type of experience rather than me

always have been a white member of the
 

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.460
always have been a white member of the
clan so so it could have that kind of

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:03.470
clan so so it could have that kind of
 

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.120
clan so so it could have that kind of
benefit that kind of benefit but I think

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.130
benefit that kind of benefit but I think
 

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.769
benefit that kind of benefit but I think
like all of these like any human

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:08.779
like all of these like any human
 

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:11.529
like all of these like any human

want to talk about it I mean we did that
yeah yeah so let's let's see this this

00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:35.849
yeah yeah so let's let's see this this
 

00:31:35.849 --> 00:31:40.909
yeah yeah so let's let's see this this
is Victoria Coates who is kicked a lot

00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919
is Victoria Coates who is kicked a lot
 

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:46.039
is Victoria Coates who is kicked a lot
out of them um yeah some form of time

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:46.049
out of them um yeah some form of time
 

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:48.310
out of them um yeah some form of time
that's not a good answer

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320
that's not a good answer
 

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.109
that's not a good answer
art is the best unifying for us we have

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:51.119
art is the best unifying for us we have
 

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:53.869
art is the best unifying for us we have
that so it's too contentious well let's

00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:53.879
that so it's too contentious well let's
 

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:55.849
that so it's too contentious well let's
see what it says so yeah we want to see

00:31:55.849 --> 00:31:55.859
see what it says so yeah we want to see
 

00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:57.200
see what it says so yeah we want to see
the next one what else have we got

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.210
the next one what else have we got
 

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.359
the next one what else have we got
we've got Trump is that it we just got

00:31:59.359 --> 00:31:59.369
we've got Trump is that it we just got
 

00:31:59.369 --> 00:32:01.129
we've got Trump is that it we just got
two more yeah these are the other two

00:32:01.129 --> 00:32:01.139
two more yeah these are the other two
 

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:04.310
two more yeah these are the other two
options narcissism and children oh but

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320
options narcissism and children oh but
 

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.289
options narcissism and children oh but
it's Alison Gopnik who is a very

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299
it's Alison Gopnik who is a very
 

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:08.570
it's Alison Gopnik who is a very
interesting person so we can find an

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580
interesting person so we can find an
 

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.190
interesting person so we can find an
angle here yeah yeah yeah let's do this

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200
angle here yeah yeah yeah let's do this
 

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.619
angle here yeah yeah yeah let's do this
Alison Gopnik was on this show she's a

00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:12.629
Alison Gopnik was on this show she's a
 

00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:13.999
Alison Gopnik was on this show she's a
developmental psychologist from

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:14.009
developmental psychologist from
 

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:17.330
developmental psychologist from
certainly and let's see what she has to

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340
certainly and let's see what she has to
 

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.580
certainly and let's see what she has to
say about Donald Trump narcissism and

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:19.590
say about Donald Trump narcissism and
 

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:27.539
say about Donald Trump narcissism and
children it's all about him right

00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:27.549
 

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:29.830
one of the things that we've discovered

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840
one of the things that we've discovered
 

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.859
one of the things that we've discovered
in the science is that children who

00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:32.869
in the science is that children who
 

00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:35.529
in the science is that children who
already have moral intuitions from the

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:35.539
already have moral intuitions from the
 

00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:37.029
already have moral intuitions from the
time they're extremely young

00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039
time they're extremely young
 

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.669
time they're extremely young
so even 14 month olds will go out of

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679
so even 14 month olds will go out of
 

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:41.680
so even 14 month olds will go out of
their way to try to help someone else

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:41.690
their way to try to help someone else
 

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.840
their way to try to help someone else
who's in trouble and there's even some

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:43.850
who's in trouble and there's even some
 

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.580
who's in trouble and there's even some
evidence that this is true for babies

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:45.590
evidence that this is true for babies
 

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.460
evidence that this is true for babies
for infants so the old picture that we

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:48.470
for infants so the old picture that we
 

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.409
for infants so the old picture that we
had about moral development was that

00:32:50.409 --> 00:32:50.419
had about moral development was that
 

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:52.629
had about moral development was that
children started out being these amoral

00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639
children started out being these amoral
 

00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:55.269
children started out being these amoral
egocentric creatures and then they had

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279
egocentric creatures and then they had
 

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:58.480
egocentric creatures and then they had
to be socialized into being moral or

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:58.490
to be socialized into being moral or
 

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.759
to be socialized into being moral or
caring about other people and that view

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:00.769
caring about other people and that view
 

00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:03.789
caring about other people and that view
is sort of exactly the opposite of the

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799
is sort of exactly the opposite of the
 

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:06.279
is sort of exactly the opposite of the
view that we have now there was a column

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:06.289
view that we have now there was a column
 

00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:08.680
view that we have now there was a column
in the New York Times that said oh you

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:08.690
in the New York Times that said oh you
 

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.810
in the New York Times that said oh you
know someone like like Donald Trump is

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:10.820
know someone like like Donald Trump is
 

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.419
know someone like like Donald Trump is
like a two-year-old and I was extremely

00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:13.429
like a two-year-old and I was extremely
 

00:33:13.429 --> 00:33:14.830
like a two-year-old and I was extremely
irritated thought about writing a letter

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840
irritated thought about writing a letter
 

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.690
irritated thought about writing a letter
to say that's a terrible insult to

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:16.700
to say that's a terrible insult to
 

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.580
to say that's a terrible insult to
two-year-olds two-year-olds are not

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.590
two-year-olds two-year-olds are not
 

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.039
two-year-olds two-year-olds are not
narcissistic and egocentric and only

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:21.049
narcissistic and egocentric and only
 

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:22.989
narcissistic and egocentric and only
concerned with their their own happiness

00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:22.999
concerned with their their own happiness
 

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:25.720
concerned with their their own happiness
they have the potential for caring about

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:25.730
they have the potential for caring about
 

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.999
they have the potential for caring about
other people taking care of them it's

00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:28.009
other people taking care of them it's
 

00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:30.279
other people taking care of them it's
something that happens between being -

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:30.289
something that happens between being -
 

00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:32.440
something that happens between being -
and being grown-up that makes the

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:32.450
and being grown-up that makes the
 

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.869
and being grown-up that makes the
narcissists and the egotist of the world

00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:34.879
narcissists and the egotist of the world
 

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:37.210
narcissists and the egotist of the world
develop that's a grown-up condition not

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:37.220
develop that's a grown-up condition not
 

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.369
develop that's a grown-up condition not
a condition of a two-year-old and as a

00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:39.379
a condition of a two-year-old and as a
 

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:41.950
a condition of a two-year-old and as a
parent the challenge is to try to give

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960
parent the challenge is to try to give
 

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.739
parent the challenge is to try to give
children information and encouragement

00:33:44.739 --> 00:33:44.749
children information and encouragement
 

00:33:44.749 --> 00:33:47.680
children information and encouragement
for those natural tendencies towards

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:47.690
for those natural tendencies towards
 

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.749
for those natural tendencies towards
altruism no it has to be said that we

00:33:49.749 --> 00:33:49.759
altruism no it has to be said that we
 

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:51.399
altruism no it has to be said that we
have a lot of evidence that that natural

00:33:51.399 --> 00:33:51.409
have a lot of evidence that that natural
 

00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:53.350
have a lot of evidence that that natural
tendency towards altruism towards

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360
tendency towards altruism towards
 

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.940
tendency towards altruism towards
helping for others being empathic to

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:54.950
helping for others being empathic to
 

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.859
helping for others being empathic to
others caring for others seems to go

00:33:56.859 --> 00:33:56.869
others caring for others seems to go
 

00:33:56.869 --> 00:33:59.769
others caring for others seems to go
hand-in-hand with a tendency to split

00:33:59.769 --> 00:33:59.779
hand-in-hand with a tendency to split
 

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:02.379
hand-in-hand with a tendency to split
people up into an in-group the people

00:34:02.379 --> 00:34:02.389
people up into an in-group the people
 

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:04.359
people up into an in-group the people
that we're empathic for and take care of

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:04.369
that we're empathic for and take care of
 

00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:06.549
that we're empathic for and take care of
and then an out-group the others and the

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559
and then an out-group the others and the
 

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.989
and then an out-group the others and the
others are the ones that we don't have

00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:07.999
others are the ones that we don't have
 

00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:10.240
others are the ones that we don't have
to take care of and those two things

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:10.250
to take care of and those two things
 

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.980
to take care of and those two things
from an evolutionary perspective even

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:11.990
from an evolutionary perspective even
 

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.780
from an evolutionary perspective even
for a month physiological neuroscience

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:13.790
for a month physiological neuroscience
 

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.000
for a month physiological neuroscience
perspective seem to go hand-in-hand so

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.010
perspective seem to go hand-in-hand so
 

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.730
perspective seem to go hand-in-hand so
the challenge for a parent is to say

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:18.740
the challenge for a parent is to say
 

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.909
the challenge for a parent is to say
give children a sense of encouraging

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919
give children a sense of encouraging
 

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:24.129
give children a sense of encouraging
that sense of belonging and caring about

00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:24.139
that sense of belonging and caring about
 

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.159
that sense of belonging and caring about
other people without also having a sense

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:27.169
other people without also having a sense
 

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:29.470
other people without also having a sense
that you only do that for your group and

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480
that you only do that for your group and
 

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.560
that you only do that for your group and
you cannot care about the other group

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.570
 

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.870
okay so most people who go through being

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:38.880
okay so most people who go through being
 

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.770
okay so most people who go through being
children are do that in the context of a

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780
children are do that in the context of a
 

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.250
children are do that in the context of a
large group of people a large well in my

encounter pushback bullying exclusion

all those things that we know happen at

all those things that we know happen at
 

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.950
all those things that we know happen at
school all right I'm kind of a weird

school all right I'm kind of a weird
test case because I did grow up in the

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:12.990
test case because I did grow up in the
 

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.340
test case because I did grow up in the
woods so I didn't I didn't really have

woods so I didn't I didn't really have
 

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.150
woods so I didn't I didn't really have
that much contact of hurt from family

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160
that much contact of hurt from family
 

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.220
