00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.120
When you think about all the things humans
have put their mind to, it’s impressive:

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.920
we built and landed robots on Mars to learn
more about space.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.220
We conjured up theories about how the universe
works — and then proved them right.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.840
We sequenced the human genome to paint a complete
picture of our dna. but as for the minds that

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.140
made this all possible, we still don’t know
much about how those actually work.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.890
Scientists have been trying to navigate the
mechanics of our large, complicated brains

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.610
for hundreds of years.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.989
What would be really helpful is if we had
a map.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.590
And in order to get one of those, we’re
going to need some brave scientists and very

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.270
advanced technology.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.480
So how close are we to mapping the human brain?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.510
If we could build a complete map of our brain
and translate it, imagine what we could do:

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.690
We think maybe that will give us clues as
to the causes of various forms of mental illness,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.390
learning difficulties, diseases of aging.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.000
And that might better allow us to figure out,
are there treatments?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.840
Or prevent the onset of some of those illnesses.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.520
A map of the brain could even help us understand
other scientific mysteries, like the origins

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.860
of consciousness.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.450
Our brain is so powerful that if we better
understood how it worked, we might be able

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.120
to create smarter robots and computers.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.680
There is this technology in our brain for
... actually, in the brain of every mammal,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.440
that allow us to behave autonomously.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.100
It is very power-efficient.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.440
A map of the human brain is seen as so valuable
that multiple efforts across the world are

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.060
underway to get us there.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.710
Aside from some big projects in the U.S. — we’ll
get to those later — the European commission

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.900
is funding 100 universities to create a detailed
computer model of the human brain.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.390
China also announced a project to map the
brain, and so has Japan.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.770
There’s even several private projects focused
on this goal.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.150
So what do we mean when we say a map of the
human brain?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.090
Specifically, we’re talking about creating
something called a “connectome” — a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.069
complete catalog of all the structures in
the brain and how they connect.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.380
We typically think of there being both a structural
and a functional connectome.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.959
So the structural connectome is the white
matter fibers that connect different parts

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.749
of the brain or the synapses that connect
neurons.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.430
And we call that structural because there's
a physical synapse there that we can measure

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.430
and look at.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.790
We're kind of making more of a roadmap of
connections among brain regions.But there's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.319
also what we call functional connections in
the human brain, which have to do with kind

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.599
of coordination and function across brain
regions.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.409
That means identifying parts of the brain
that work together but don’t necessarily

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.430
touch.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.879
We don’t have any fully mapped functional
connectomes yet and the only structural connectome

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.480
we’ve fully mapped is of “C elegans,”
a transparent nematode about 1 millimeter

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.819
in length.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.640
Even though they've been able to do that,
it's still a complex organism.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.719
And there's still a lot of work to be done
to understand how the interactions give rise

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.939
to even the relatively simple behaviors that
the C elegans can accomplish.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.629
The connectome of the c. elegans brain identifies
302 neurons.

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.639
And if researching and building that connectome
was complicated, now imagine how exponentially

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.769
more difficult it is to do the same with humans,
who have somewhere in the region of 100 billion

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.269
neurons.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.010
This is probably the first obstacle scientists
have to overcome in mapping our brains — the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.739
sheer size and daunting complexity.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.180
So, they have to start small, and I mean really
small — the samples they are studying are

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.999
the size of a grain of sand.

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:53.809
Inside that small grain of sand, there's about
100,000 neurons and form about one billion

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:54.809
connections.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:04:00.090
So now, you see our brain is more than a million
times bigger than this grain of sand, so you

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.799
can see how much units are compressed in such
a small space.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.329
And the brain is always changing, which makes
it even more difficult to study.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.079
When we're born, the brain grows over the
course of development.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.760
It builds new neurons, we're learning and
interacting with the environment and that's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.790
also shaping brain connections and how different
parts of the brain work together.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.680
but then it also starts to change as we get
older and we move into later in life.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
To tackle these challenges, the Obama administration
started the Brain Initiative in 2014, bringing

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.170
several scientific institutions together to
understand and treat the human mind.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.230
As part of that coalition, the Allen Institute
is analyzing mouse brain samples to count,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.070
catalog, and connect the many different cell
types — as a foundation for eventually doing

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.410
the same for the human brain.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.781
Using electron microscopy, the team imaged
billions of tiny synaptic connections in a

00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:00.540
cubic millimeter of mouse neocortex.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.450
Mapping the, the brain, at least at the resolution
that we do it is difficult because many things

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.980
have to go right in the series.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.040
Preparing the sample has to be perfect.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.320
Scientists had to section the grain-sized
brain sample into 25,000 pristine slices 40

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.450
nanometers wide.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.310
For reference, a strand of hair is five times
as thick as that.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.750
Then those slices were distributed over six
electron microscopes to be photographed.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.860
It took us about five months to take all the
pictures of that millimeter cube.I don't have

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.850
the final tally, but there's certainly hundreds
of millions of those.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.380
This type of data gathering took exhaustive,
dedicated work around the clock.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.780
When all the images were collected, researchers
could then segment each single neuron and

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.800
create a 3D wiring diagram...step one towards
that complete structural connectome, which

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.490
the team estimates will take five years to
finish.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.080
In terms of data storage was about two petabytes
of data.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.310
That’s about 2 million gigabytes from just
a millimeter.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.810
To eventually work with bigger human brain
samples, something about this process will

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.310
have to change, as it will eventually be the
largest data set ever collected about anything

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.310
in the world.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.370
I think substantial, substantial advances
on sample preparations, sample sectioning.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.040
And above all, the storage of such will be
immense.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.210
Either technology will have to evolve in a
way that such storage is available or our

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.140
sampling will have to evolve in ways that
we can compress that, that information that

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.020
we want to extract from it.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.641
We’ll also need forms of technology that
aren’t as invasive as this, so we can study

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:42.680
live human brains, too.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.180
And to develop a really robust map, we’re
going to need to work with more than just

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.440
1 single brain.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.420
We’ll need to study young brains, old brains,
male brains, female brains.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.680
We collected a pretty interesting and unique
sample of 1200 individuals.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.770
The human connectome project, led by the NIH,
is using non-invasive tools to study human

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.050
brains now.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.070
So the main tool we use to start out is an
MRI machine.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.480
If we're looking at the structural connectome,
we typically use something called diffusion

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.620
imaging.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.310
It's looking at the diffusion of water along
these white matter connections in the brain.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.550
And if you have a nice strong connection going
in a certain direction between two parts of

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.930
the brain, we can measure that.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.980
We do something pretty different though when
we look at the functional connectome in the

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.980
human brains.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.820
So we still use an MRI scanner, but we use
a different kind of sequence.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.820
It's looking actually at blood flow in the
brain that we think happens after there has

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.820
been neural activity.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.240
So if you're looking at brain activity in
a brain region going up and down over time,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.480
you can say, "Are there other brain regions
that show that same pattern?"

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.900
And if the patterns are very similar over
time, we call those functionally connected

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.990
brain regions.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.090
So far, the human connectome project has made
a lot of advances in this area of mapping

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.090
the brain.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.200
In 2016, they released the most detailed map
of the cerebral cortex to date, discovering

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.810
97 new brain regions in addition to confirming
the existence of 83 others.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.780
We understand much more now about how different
brain regions kind of wire up together to

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.180
form networks.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.480
We're starting to get a good sense of how
those networks relate to which types of behaviors.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.510
Where I think we still have work to do is
understanding exactly how those contribute

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:37.169
or are changed by the experience of illnesses,
how different kinds of environmental factors

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.699
might have an impact.

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:43.490
So this challenge is immense.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.370
It will push our technology and creativity
to their furthest limits; but so did sending

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.529
robots to mars, and sequencing the human genome...
and we did all that.

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:56.620
So how close are we to mapping the human brain?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.720
The biggest barriers keeping us from building
a highly detailed human connectome is really

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.779
technology.

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:06.040
In my scientific lifetime, the progress
has been exponential.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.810
So I wouldn't be surprised in 10 or 20 years
if we had a sort of dramatic leap in our understanding.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:19.540
I think we may never have a map of every connection
in the human brain in the sense of understanding

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:25.860
exactly how they interact together to give
rise to exactly all the human behavioral and

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.069
cognitive and emotional abilities.

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:33.610
That's a tall order and I'm not entirely convinced
that we will ever be there.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.860
Looking at the shapes of those neurons they
are beautiful.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.300
They make me happy.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.240
We and our collaborators are the first ones
to see such, such, such detail at such scale

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.220
on the brain and that's like the, the old
explorers when they arrived at the new continent.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.481
We are, you know, we are mapping this, we
are going into, into a territory where, where

00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:54.830
things are new.
