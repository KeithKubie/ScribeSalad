00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.070
So we have a
look at encryption,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.889
but remember that TLS is
made up of two parts--

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.629
encryption and hashing.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.849
Hashing is the process
of transforming data

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.240
into a short representation
of the original data.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.130
The smallest change
in the original data

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.100
will have enormous
changes in the hash.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.040
If two documents yield
the same hash value,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.549
they are very very likely
to be the same document.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.380
There are a couple of
things we care about

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.820
with hashing functions.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.780
One, it should be impossible to
revert the conversion process.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.079
Meaning once data has been
converted into a hash,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.039
it can be unconverted back
into the original data.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.219
And two, it should be
just as impossible to find

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.920
a different document yielding
an identical hash value.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.899
One of the most common
hashing functions

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.699
is SHA, which exists in
multiple flavors like SHA-256,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.429
or SHA-512, where
the number says

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.670
how big the output of
the hash is, in bits.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.969
No matter how big the
document is, if you pass in,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.479
you will always get
256 bits as output

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.129
when you are using SHA-256.
