00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.060
In this module, we will cover three

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.640
topics. The first is systems issues in providing

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.040
giant scale services on the internet. And the second topic is what exactly is a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.390
programming model that is used for the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.770
applications that are delivering the service that you're

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.570
expecting on an every day basis? So-called Big

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.700
Data applications. And the third topic is content

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.580
distribution networks that are used for the dissemination of the content

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.680
when you access giant scale services on the internet. So in

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.680
this lesson, of course, we are focusing on what are the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.240
issues in giant scale services, from the perspective of the system.
