I followed the bone fragments of the
 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.950

up his crew and began excavating the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
up his crew and began excavating the
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.450
up his crew and began excavating the
site removing more and more rocks and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
site removing more and more rocks and
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210

more to these fossils than just bones I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240
more to these fossils than just bones I
 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.750
more to these fossils than just bones I
knocked off a little piece of what I

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760
knocked off a little piece of what I
 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600
knocked off a little piece of what I
thought was just sandstone and I looked

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
thought was just sandstone and I looked
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660
thought was just sandstone and I looked
at it and it had a weird pattern to it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
at it and it had a weird pattern to it
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.719
at it and it had a weird pattern to it
and so I brought the piece of sandstone

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
and so I brought the piece of sandstone
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.310
and so I brought the piece of sandstone
back to the lab and after hours and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
back to the lab and after hours and
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.850
back to the lab and after hours and
hours of slowly brushing it the scale

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860

sin around the bone at that point I knew
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.430
sin around the bone at that point I knew
that we had a 3d dinosaur mummy I was

that we had a 3d dinosaur mummy I was
 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.240

reconstructed museum skeletons what's
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.250
reconstructed museum skeletons what's
extraordinary is that Dakota seems to

extraordinary is that Dakota seems to
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320
extraordinary is that Dakota seems to
have fossilized with most of its skin

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
have fossilized with most of its skin
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.430
