00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.170
My name is Tae Smith and I’m the dresser
for the Museum of Modern Art exhibition

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.860
“Items: Is Fashion Modern?”

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.330
Most often you see garments in exhibitions
on mannequins.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.640
But mannequins are difficult because you have
to think of so many aspects.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.980
You have to think of, what color do you want
the mannequin?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.420
What kind of gesture?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.400
The history of mannequins themselves is the
history of what people look like or what the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.960
ideal is.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.030
So, you have to be very careful about what
you're portraying.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.149
You know, what your garment looks like and
what the mannequin looks like may be saying

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.079
two different things.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.260
So you need to make sure that they're both
talking about the same thing.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.609
The most important aspect of an exhibition
is the storyline.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.030
And so, the first thing I do is I really talk
to the curator of the show.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.850
They have to have their object list.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.699
If they don't have their object list, I can't
point them in the right direction because

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.700
it's all about the object and how they want
to portray these objects.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.370
So this is the little black dress section
and, as you can see, they represent dresses

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.150
from the 1920s, which is the Chanel, to the
90s.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.810
This is the Versace Safety Pin Dress.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.910
This is the early 60s, and this is from Givenchy.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.370
This is the Kinematic dress.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.020
This is a 3D printed dress.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.860
So what we’re going to do for this exhibition
is put all of these on invisible mannequins.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.060
It’s going to look like it’s floating,
and you can really look at the outline and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.130
just how they interact with the other garments
on that platform.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.950
Where we could we really tried to stay away
from the body as much as we could because

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.110
this is not a traditional fashion exhibition.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.490
And so we didn't want it to look like a traditional
fashion exhibition.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.290
These are one of the four types of mannequins
that are going to be in the exhibition.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.179
This is the buckram mannequin.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.860
They start out as this.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.880
This is millinery fabric that hat makers use
and once you wet it down, you can mold it.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.409
You need...I used a dress form to create this
mold.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.969
This is what it looks like when it comes off
the dress form.

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.030
As you can see these are the pencil marks.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.650
This is a halter top black dress for the Little
Black Dress section.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.430
And I'm going to come back and cut away at
the arm holes on both sides.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.520
This buckram, this is for a strapless dress,
a strapless Christian Dior dress.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.030
So as you can see, I cut away at the top.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.940
So this has already been cut.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.269
And this is a finished mannequin.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.090
This is padded, it has felt and then batting
to give it some shape.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.019
It needed to be a little bit more curvy.

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.670
The garment, the black dress that's going
to be on this is a Givenchy.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.319
It's a chemise style but it has a bit of peplum
at the bottom.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.510
Once you put the garment on this mannequin,
all you're going to see is the garment.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.040
This whole thing is going to disappear.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.830
The lining is going to match the inside of
the dress, so when you look at this, you think

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.830
that...

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.510
Visually it's going to look like the inside
of the dress.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.489
So none of this white or any of this is going
to show.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.099
This is all just to support and create the
silhouette of the dress.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.200
These two buckram torsos were made from different
mannequins and when you first look at them,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.370
they look very similar.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.989
But kind of like people, they may have the
same measurements but the proportions are

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.040
really different.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.230
If you look at the bust line, the bust line
is really different than this one and the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.230
shape...

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.950
The shoulder line, the slope of the shoulder.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.159
This is a lot more square, but since this
is the jacket that is going on this is a very

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.180
form-fitting jacket, it needed to have the
slope of the jacket.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.609
That was important.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:15.760
So little details like that, measurements
and you know, the back of the shoulder blades...those

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:25.350
proportions.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.350
We also have fiberglass mannequins, which
are the traditional mannequins that you see

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.530
either in stores, in retail stores, or in
most exhibitions.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.230
It's the high fashion posture, sort of that
slouch.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.060
The bust line is different.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.750
It's a little bit lower, some from the 1980s,
the bustline would probably be higher and

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.070
larger.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.840
The 1980s the shoulder would be broader, this
is a smaller shoulder, more of a sloped shoulder.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.080
More of a relaxed, if you could say, natural
silhouette.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:08.950
We have dressmaker's torsos, and we also have
a 2-D mount, which is a form, and it's interesting

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.140
because it takes away the conversation from
the body and it really makes you focus on

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.670
the object's form.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:25.450
You know, I'd just do a strip here.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.890
Oh yeah.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.300
And then wrap it around and come back.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.920
We don't need to wrap it around the whole
back?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.850
Maybe just not as much.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.070
Maybe half of that.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.710
Because you will see up slightly.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:46.270
So, if it falls away, but I think half of
that will be fine.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.740
You start here.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.660
This is the entrance.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.550
The little black dresses, they're going to
be on platforms and they're going to be viewed

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.610
from the front and the side.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.490
There's a divider here, which is a scrim,
so from this side you'll see a silhouette

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.360
of the other black dresses.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.370
So you can see them from the back, but you'll
just see the silhouettes of the dresses.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.680
People project their experiences, their opinions
on to clothing.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.900
Men and women are going to go through this
exhibition and look at these garments, and

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.770
they're all going to feel something different
based on their perceptions and based on their

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.120
experiences.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.990
That's the great thing about clothing.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.490
It has that other layer that is so undefinable.
