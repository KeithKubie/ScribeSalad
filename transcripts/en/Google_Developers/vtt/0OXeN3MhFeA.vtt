[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.210
Fokus is a very
simple tool for people

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.430
who want to know
everything about analytics.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.990
We suck up the information
and present, very beautifully,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.780
on the simple dashboard.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
And this is something
very cool for people

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480
who want to have the
electronic pulse.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.640
The first time I
approached the person

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.520
that I was thinking
about as an investor,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.790
he told me that he didn't
see me as an entrepreneur,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.990
as a CEO of this
company, because I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.240
have lots of things to do.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.510
I have my own startup.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
I have my two
other things to do.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.540
I'm very active on social media.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.800
I do Aula Polska.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.580
I'm a blogger.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.619
I'm a person.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:46.160
I'm a mentor.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.660
So there's lots of things.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.090
You have to be well known
because of one thing.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.840
And then, it struck me
that I have to focus.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.800
That's also the
name of the company.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.420
So let's focus on something-- on
one thing-- and be good at it.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.930
And everything will follow.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.520
For many startups,
it's like you don't

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.290
know if your product is ready.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.660
You know that your product is
ready because of the pipeline

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.810
of your clients.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.640
But for you-- for
the entrepreneur,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.760
as a person, who
created the startup--

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.240
it's like a
never-ending process.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.670
You see your features
and you're thinking

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.570
about the next two, three steps.
