00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.969
Iteration seems like a very
specific process for most products.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.950
I mean, entrepreneurs,
you need to analyze data and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.050
act accordingly to improve your
specific monetization model.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.590
And it can vary a lot by product.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.930
But are there any instances where we can
provide specific, actionable tips for

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.070
a given product?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.230
&gt;&gt; Actually yes, companies in the game
industry seems to follow a few

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.810
proven paths for increasing revenue.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.760
First, promote certain items at
the right situation for heavy gamers.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.780
The challenge here is to
identify these players and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.770
to find the right situations.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.410
Second, offer an item
with a big discount

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.900
only to the potential paid users.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.740
The challenge is to
segment these users and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.600
control the exposure of this discount.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.070
Third, use ads for non paying users.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.330
The challenge is to blend the ads and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.620
protect the experience so
the users will still love the game.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.300
&gt;&gt; And for everyone else we've
got some key takeaways for

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.890
this lesson in the next video.
