00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.750
The speed of light is 3
times 10 to the eighth meters

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.600
per second.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.510
So as you can tell,
light is very fast,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.150
3 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.100
If it takes 5 times 10 to the
second power seconds for light

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.740
to travel from the
sun to the earth--

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.380
let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.630
5 times 10 to the second,
that's 500 seconds.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.510
You have 60 seconds in
a minute, so 8 minutes

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.720
would be 480 seconds.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.310
So 500 seconds would be
about 8 minutes, 20 seconds.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.230
It takes 8 minutes,
20 seconds for light

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.100
to travel from the
sun to the earth.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.070
What is the distance, in meters,
between the sun and the earth?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.880
They're giving us a rate.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.470
They're giving us a speed.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.880
They're giving us a time.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.070
And they want to
find a distance.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.050
This goes straight back
to the standard distance

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.760
is equal to rate times time.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.800
So they give us the rate.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.269
The rate is 3 times 10 to
the eighth meters per second.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.840
That right there is the rate.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780
They give us the time.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.305
The time is 5 times 10
to the second seconds.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.770
I'll just use that with a S.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.750
How many meters?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.090
So what is the distance?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.320
And so we can just move these
around from the commutative

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.692
and the associative
properties of multiplication.

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:42.400
And actually, you can
multiply the units.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.025
That's called
dimensional analysis.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:46.150
When you multiply the units,
you kind of treat them

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.110
like variables.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.447
You should get the right
dimensions for distance.

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:51.030
So let's just rearrange
these numbers.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.510
This is equal to 3
times 5-- I'm just

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.665
commuting and reassociating
these numbers and this product,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.640
because we're just multiplying
everything-- 3 times 5 times

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.439
10 to the eighth times
10 to the second.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.690
And then we're going to
have meters per second times

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.794
seconds.

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:23.460
And if you treated
these like variables,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.990
these seconds would cancel out
with that seconds right there,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.100
and you would just be left with
the unit meters, which is good,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.882
because we want a
distance in just meters.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:34.840
How does this simplify?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.560
This gives us 3 times 5 is 15.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.520
15 times 10 to the
eighth times 10 squared.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.450
We have the same base.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.450
We're taking the product,
so we can add the exponents.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.840
This is going to be 10 to
the 8 plus 2 power, or 10

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.440
to the 10th power.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.270
Now you might be tempted
to say that we're done,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.150
that we have this in
scientific notation.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.590
But remember, in
scientific notation

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.570
this number here has
to be greater than

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.010
or equal to 1 and less than 10.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.590
This clearly is
not less than 10.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.090
So how do we rewrite this?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.350
We can write 15 as 1.5.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.900
This clearly is greater
than 1 and less than 10.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.430
And to get from 1.5 to 15,
you have to multiply by 10.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.610
One way to think about
it is 15 is 15.0,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.955
and so you have a decimal here.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.870
If we're moving the decimal
one to the left to make it 1.5,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.090
that's essentially
dividing by 10.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.805
Moving the decimal to the left
means you're dividing by 10.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.930
If we don't want to change
the value of the number,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.530
we need to divide by 10
and then multiply by 10.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.220
So this and that
are the same number.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.960
Now 15 is 1.5 times
10, and then we

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.640
have to multiply that
times 10 to the 10th power,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.820
this right over here.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.400
10 is really just 10
to the first power.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.790
So we can just
add the exponents.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.620
Same base, taking the product.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.350
This is equal to 1.5 times
10 to the 1 plus 10 power,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.990
or 10 to the 11th power.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.980
And we are done.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.089
This is a huge distance.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:24.560
It's very hard to visualize.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.010
But anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
