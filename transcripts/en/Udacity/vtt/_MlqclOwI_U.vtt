00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.040
We developed the original Sunshine app
in parallel with the development of

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.400
material design in Android.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.790
For that reason the design already
incorporates some material concepts.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.840
We're going to take the design
a bit farther in that direction

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.900
with the help of a support library.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.250
While Sunshine functions on phones and
tablet's of all sizes

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.290
it wouldn't come close to be considered
a tablet optimized application.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.290
Material design could help us here.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.060
We can take advantage of patterns
that add extra space into and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.330
around our layouts to make things
feel more natural on these devices.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.560
The new support library makes it easy
to bring some material design to our

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.770
application.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.780
It implements toolbars and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
makes it generally easy to bring vibrant
material colors to our application.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.870
Finally, we're going to add motion and
dimension to our application.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.950
Some of this will only apply
to newer Android releases, but

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.580
we'll make sure that the experience
is good on all of our devices.
