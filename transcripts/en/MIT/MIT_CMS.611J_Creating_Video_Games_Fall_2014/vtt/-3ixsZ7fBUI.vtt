MIRIAM PROSNITZ: My
name is Miriam Prosnitz,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.740
and I was on Team Heatwave.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.910
You play and there are
characters who move around.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.410
And different people
who are at risk

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530
for being vulnerable
to heatwaves

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.150
move around the screen.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.395
So one person was in
charge of researching

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:20.940
who are those people?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.960
And another person
was in charge of OK,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.820
I'm going to make
a character object.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.590
And we split up all
of those, actually,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.590
right at the
beginning so that we

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.541
knew who to contact about what.

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.040
And then, based off of that,
we would come together and say,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.260
what needs to be done, and
whose job is it, and is that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720
still balanced in terms
of who's working on what?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.656
And it worked out
really well actually.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.270
Actually, funny enough,
I took this course solely

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.660
because I had no computer
science courses this semester.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.140
Because I was
abroad last year, I

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.790
did a full year of
engineering coursework.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.380
And I was like, don't need
any more requirements,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.990
might as well just
take one for fun.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.320
So here I am in
Creating Video Games.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.260
And so my goal was to write
code, and the funniest thing--

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.360
and I'm not representative
of my team at all--

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.240
I'm like the one
person in this class

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360
who has not written
a single line of code

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.790
this entire semester,
because I ended up

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060
being project manager a lot.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.150
And so what I learned is a
lot of the process-- a lot

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780
of making things
work, is really just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.580
emailing people, calling them
on the phone, being like,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.360
are you supposed to be at
this meeting right now,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.220
going and buying
snacks for a meeting.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.840
You think it's like
silly, you know,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.310
nobody really needs
to get snacks.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.180
But I've been told
by my teammates

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.860
that if I hadn't gotten snacks,
they wouldn't have come.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.220
So--

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.459
I learned a lot about
the project management

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.750
and the work that goes on
behind the scenes, which I've

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.240
seen before, but I just
didn't realize the scale of it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.790
in games.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.290
Something I would give
feedback about this class

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.700
is I really like the fast pace
of the first three projects.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.080
And this project, because
it was so much longer time,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.700
the team was so much larger, and
we had this kind of set topic

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.585
we had to deal with, I
didn't enjoy it as much.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.710
As I mentioned, one of the
main issues for our team

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.030
was passion.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.629
At the end of the
day, I can summarize

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.920
what you should do in a
heatwave in like two sentences.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.270
That doesn't make for a
very interesting game.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.000
So that's something I would
say, if I was to do it again,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.310
I would've played the game where
you play with the heatwave,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.500
and you try to attack
people, because that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.342
sounds like more fun.

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:31.820
And I think that's
the other thing

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.059
I learned about games--
that you really have to care

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.100
about what you're making.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.840
Somebody mentioned in
one of the presentations

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.900
that for the last project we
would submit these sprint task

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.790
lists, and they
wouldn't necessarily

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.929
be what people
actually would do,

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.220
because people were so busy
at the end of the semester.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.240
For my team, if it was the case
that we hadn't done something,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.600
I would put it on the
sprint task list again.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.282
But I didn't have to, and
if I hadn't done that,

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:02.990
then there would've
been a big divergence

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.465
between what we
said we were doing

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.240
and what we were actually doing.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.260
So as an educator,
I would really

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.600
say check-in on your team.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.150
See actually what they've done.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.930
Make sure they're
setting realistic goals

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.210
and following through on them.
