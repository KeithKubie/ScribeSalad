00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.906
- [Voiceover] Let's talk about lipids.

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:05.309
Now for those of you who are familiar with the term

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.884
you might associate it with things like fat molecules,

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.382
and that would not be incorrect.

00:00:10.382 --> 00:00:12.959
Fat molecules are a very common form of lipid,

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.862
in fact this is an example of a fat molecule,

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:19.089
or a triglyceride right over here.

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.583
Fat or triglyceride,

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.383
tryglyceride molecule right over here.

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.923
This one in particular is a polyunsaturated tryglyceride

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.827
and we have, we have a, go into in depth,

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:32.567
we go into a lot of depth on this

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:33.960
on the video on the molecular structure

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.224
of fats slash triglycerides

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:38.998
or on saturated and unsaturated fats.

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.182
But you see the tell-tale signs,

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.760
you see a glycerol backbone right over here

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.499
and three fatty acids, or what were three fatty acids

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.645
attached to what was a glycerol molecule.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.224
We go into a lot of depth on that.

00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:54.543
But fats are not the only type of lipids.

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.924
And so what makes all of these other things

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.595
that I'm about to show you also lipids?

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:00.975
What commonality do they have with fats?

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:03.436
Well lipids are just the general term,

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:06.118
the general term for a whole class of molecules

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.158
that tend to not be so soluble in water,

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:10.224
that tend to kind of clump up or ball up

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.605
when placed in water.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.786
So not, not so soluble,

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.083
not so soluble in water.

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.030
And I'm being a little bit careful with my words,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.049
I didn't say outright hydrophobic.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.543
There are definitely lipids that are outright hydrophobic,

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:27.762
but there are also some lipids

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:30.526
that have some end of their molecule that's hydrophobic,

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:31.838
but then other parts of the molecule

00:01:31.838 --> 00:01:33.788
actually might be hydrophilic.

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:35.321
And there's actually words for that.

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.482
So you have some lipids

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:39.139
that are just straight out hydrophobic,

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.661
hydrophobic.

00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:43.122
They literally try to avoid the water,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:46.557
they're non-polar molecules, so they just clump together.

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:49.518
But then there's some that have hydrophobic parts

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:51.619
and hydrophilic parts.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.943
And these are called,

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:55.056
and I always have trouble saying this word,

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:56.519
amphi,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:59.177
amphipathic,

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:02.161
amphipathic molecules.

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:03.778
Where some part is hydrophilic

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:05.078
and some part is hydrophobic.

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:07.040
And we're gonna see that in a few seconds

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.781
when we look at phospholipids,

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.018
which are crucial for the structure of cell membranes.

00:02:13.018 --> 00:02:14.620
And you're gonna see that a lot when you,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.153
when you go into biology.

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:17.801
So what are all these other molecules?

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.414
And let's think about what parts of them

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:23.338
might be hydrophobic and what parts might be hydrophilic.

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:26.333
When you look at fats you have this long hydrocarbon chain,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.515
there are any obvious, and there aren't any obvious,

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.476
there aren't any obvious charges over here.

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:36.295
In fact, there's aren't any, oxygen is more electronegative,

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.918
so you might have a little bit of a partial negative

00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:40.925
or partial positive charge.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.413
A partial negative at the oxygen

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:44.791
or maybe a partial positive end at the carbon,

00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.113
but carbon isn't, is still more electronegative

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:48.171
than say hydrogen,

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.575
so you're not going to be able to form

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:51.793
the type of polar bonds that,

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.755
the type of, I should say, hydrogen bonds

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:56.493
you would if you had hydroxyl groups here,

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:58.130
if this was an alcohol.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.453
And these hydrocarbon chains over here,

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:03.586
these are very hydrophobic,

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.791
so that's what makes fat not be so soluble in water

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.287
and clump up with you put it into water.

00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:11.029
This molecule right over here,

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.536
which we would classify as an ester,

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:15.927
and that's because we have an ester group,

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.226
we have an ester functional group right over here

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:20.850
where you have a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.568
and then single-bonded to another oxygen,

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.713
and then that oxygen's bonded to a long hydrocarbon chain,

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:26.747
and that carbon is bonded

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:29.986
to a long hydrocarbon chain right over there.

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.993
This is clearly going to be hydrophobic.

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:34.855
And this particular molecule

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:35.923
that we're looking at right over here,

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:39.996
this is a major constituent of beeswax.

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:43.391
Of bees, of beeswax.

00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.190
And if you've even dealt with beeswax,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.514
or really any type of wax,

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:49.533
and waxes in general are considered to be lipids.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.470
You can see they don't, they're not soluble in water,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.093
in fact they're often used to repel water,

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:58.390
to keep water from penetrating into something.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.468
So wax, and in particular beeswax,

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:02.371
and beeswax isn't made up of only this molecule,

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:03.672
this is one of the main constituents,

00:04:03.672 --> 00:04:07.086
it has other molecules mixed in there,

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.860
but this is also a lipid.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.393
Now what's this thing over here?

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.992
This thing I have one six carbon ring,

00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:18.043
another six carbon, whoops, I have another six carbon ring,

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.690
another six carbon ring, and then I have a five carbon ring.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.583
This is the tell-tale sign,

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:26.193
and let me circle these four rings right over here,

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.026
these rings are the tell-tale signs

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:31.429
that we are looking at a steroid,

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:32.185
at a steroid.

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.529
And in popular culture steroids have,

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.491
you know, you think of steroids as something

00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.450
that bodybuilders might inject illegally

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.505
to pump up their muscles,

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:44.004
but steroids are actually,

00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:45.362
when you think about it in chemical terms,

00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:46.582
they're actually referring to things

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:48.322
that have this general, these molecules

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:49.658
that have this general structure

00:04:49.658 --> 00:04:51.899
where they have this six carbon ring,

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.662
this six carbon ring, and another six carbon ring

00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:56.647
in this orientation, and then another five carbon ring.

00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:58.818
And this steroid that we're looking at,

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:00.500
this has an O-H group attached to it,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.567
so it's actually going to be an alcohol,

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:03.785
so a steroid that's an alcohol

00:05:03.785 --> 00:05:05.679
you would call a sterol,

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.036
sterol.

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.485
And this particular sterol is one that you've actually

00:05:10.485 --> 00:05:12.562
dealt with a lot, or at least you've heard about,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.525
this is cholesterol.

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:19.260
So this one in particular is cholesterol.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.861
And cholesterol is often viewed as a negative thing,

00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.937
people don't, people wanna lower their cholesterol,

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:26.842
but it's essential for life.

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:29.465
It's essential to the functioning of your cells,

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:33.134
and it is a precursor molecule for your steroid hormones,

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.096
which make you you.

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:37.418
And this right over here is a steroid hormone,

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:39.158
it's a very well known one.

00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:41.062
This is testosterone.

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:45.196
Testos, testosterone,

00:05:45.196 --> 00:05:48.423
testosterone, testosterone.

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:49.920
And you see the tell-tale,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.858
you have a six carbon ring right over here,

00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:55.933
another six carbon ring right over here,

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.419
the double-bond is in a different place

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.313
than cholesterol here,

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:00.415
you have a double-bond right over there.

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:02.935
Then you have another six carbon ring,

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:05.315
and then you have the five carbon ring.

00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:06.695
And instead of an O-H group here

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.995
you have a double-bond, you have a carbonyl group,

00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.119
you have a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen,

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.172
but it actually does still have an O-H group up here.

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:16.633
But this is a derivative of cholesterol,

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:20.000
this is a testosterone, it is a steroid hormone.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.695
This is another steroid hormone.

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.852
This is cortisol, cortisol.

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:27.778
Also can be derived from cholesterol.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:29.194
And you see the tell-tale signs.

00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:31.110
You see the six carbon ring,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.351
this has a double-bond right over there.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.831
You see another, you see another six carbon ring,

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.712
six carbon ring like this.

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:41.093
It's actually hard to see the double-bond,

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:42.638
so I won't even refer to them,

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:44.890
I'll just refer to the general shape.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.409
So you have a six carbon ring there,

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.587
six carbon ring there, six carbon ring there,

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:54.094
and then five carbon, whoops,

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:56.811
and then a five carbon ring just like that.

00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.745
So once again, they all have this steroid base structure,

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:02.917
but then they all, they also have other parts

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:03.974
that make them different.

00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:06.435
For example, that is different than that

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:08.372
is different than that.

00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:09.580
And just so you can visualize

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.171
these things in three dimensions,

00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.899
in an actual molecule their not going to look

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.059
exactly like this and even talk about what something

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.207
in an atomic scale looks like is kind of strange

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:19.540
because light behaves in weird ways,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.664
but you can imagine the molecule would look like this

00:07:21.664 --> 00:07:25.867
if you actually, this is kind of a ball and stick model,

00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:27.306
well here you're thinking about

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:29.385
what it actually might look like in space

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.382
where the white balls are hydrogen,

00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:34.401
the grey ones are carbon, and the red ones are oxygen.

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.966
So this is also, this right over here,

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:39.763
is what a cortisol molecule would look like

00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:43.140
if you think in a space filling visualization.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.786
Now I talked about amphipathic molecules

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:48.528
and phospholipids are probably

00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:50.792
the most well-known example of it.

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:53.369
And phospholipids, they have a lot in common

00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.423
with triglycerides in that you have

00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.790
this three carbon backbone right over here.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.448
Three carbon, three carbon backbone,

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.247
let me do that in a different color.

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:06.406
So you have a three carbon backbone right over here,

00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:10.350
so this is a carbon, that's a carbon,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.462
that's a carbon there.

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:13.522
Each of them are attached to an oxygen,

00:08:13.522 --> 00:08:14.869
so you can imagine that this

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.353
could have been derived from glycerol.

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:18.886
And then two of the carbons,

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:23.554
like in a triglyceride, are bound to a fatty acid like this,

00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:26.153
but then one of the carbons, the third carbon,

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:28.267
instead of being bond to a fatty acid

00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:30.165
like you have in a triglyceride,

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:32.823
it is bounded to a phosphate group.

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:34.750
So this right over here,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.967
this right over here is a phosphate group.

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:39.602
And this R could just be another chain,

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:43.885
another chain of, another organic chain, so to speak.

00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:46.881
But when we talked about amphipathic molecules,

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.043
I always have to say it slowly,

00:08:48.043 --> 00:08:50.712
so it's a bit of a tongue twister for me.

00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:52.768
We're talking about having a hydrophobic end

00:08:52.768 --> 00:08:54.103
and a hydrophilic end.

00:08:54.103 --> 00:08:56.203
Well what's the hydrophobic end here?

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:59.653
Well this, these, this chains from the fatty acids,

00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:01.607
especially the hydrocarbon chains right over here,

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.615
these are gonna be hydrophobic.

00:09:03.615 --> 00:09:07.468
Hydro, hydrophobic.

00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:10.734
While the phosphate end right over here it has charge,

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:13.674
charged molecules dissolve in water very, very well.

00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:17.076
And so this one over here is going to be hydrophilic.

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:19.234
It's going to be, it's going to be, I guess you could say

00:09:19.234 --> 00:09:20.929
it's going to be attracted to water.

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:22.253
And that's why phospholipids,

00:09:22.253 --> 00:09:24.087
and this is just one type of phospholipids,

00:09:24.087 --> 00:09:25.770
these chains could be different.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.486
We have a, we have a unsaturated chain here,

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:29.926
and then, a fatty acid chain,

00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:32.365
and then we have a saturated fatty acid chain on the left,

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:35.465
and this just actually just made up in this molecule,

00:09:35.465 --> 00:09:36.406
but, and they could be different

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:38.588
depending on the phospholipid you're talking about.

00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:42.187
But this general property of having a hydrophilic head

00:09:42.187 --> 00:09:44.451
and hydrophobic tails make them very well suited

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:45.959
for cellular membranes.

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:47.504
Because you could imagine,

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:52.089
so hydro, that end is hydro,

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:53.204
hydrophilic,

00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:56.246
and then you have these hydrophobic,

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:57.883
hydrophobic tails.

00:09:57.883 --> 00:09:58.926
Actually, let me see if I can copy

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.228
and paste this really fast.

00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:02.026
I actually can just draw it really fast.

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:04.153
So let me just draw a bunch of them.

00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:06.820
Whoops, nope, I'm having trouble.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.561
Alright, let me just switch back

00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:09.977
to my drawing tool.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:14.842
So let me just draw a bunch of the hydrophilic heads

00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:17.535
and then a bunch of the hydrophobic,

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.172
whoops, actually I'll draw a few more

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:21.794
hydrophilic heads out here,

00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:24.175
and then I'll draw the hydrophobic tails.

00:10:24.175 --> 00:10:28.134
Hydrophobic, hydrophobic tails, let me draw them,

00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:29.851
draw them really fast.

00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:34.495
I'm almost done right over here.

00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:36.883
Hydrophobic tails right over here.

00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:39.343
And this configuration that I've just drawn

00:10:39.343 --> 00:10:41.840
where you have a bilayer of phospholipid,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.322
of phospholipids, a phospholipid bilayer,

00:10:45.322 --> 00:10:48.167
this is how cellular membranes are constructed.

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:51.777
Because this you have water,

00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:53.483
or things that are very water based

00:10:53.483 --> 00:10:55.873
inside the cell, this could be inside,

00:10:55.873 --> 00:10:59.450
inside the cell, and this could be outside,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.052
this is outside the cell.

00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:03.571
And so the phosphate ends is attracted to the water

00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:05.486
and then, but the hydrophobic,

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:09.352
the hydrocarbon tails, those are going to,

00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:11.326
they're going to orient themselves in this way

00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:13.404
to get away, to get away from the water.

00:11:13.404 --> 00:11:15.167
Really they'll just let the phosphate,

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:18.209
the phosphate ends interact with the water.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:21.008
And so this forms a nice boundary for the cell.

00:11:21.008 --> 00:11:23.143
And we're gonna study that thoroughly

00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:25.431
as we go more into biology.

00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:26.870
So hopefully this gives you more appreciation

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.092
of what a lipid is and the different types of lipids.
