00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.960
PROFESSOR: Today
we're going to talk

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.100
about this topic of
vibration isolation, which

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.430
is a very practical
use of knowing

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.320
a little bit about vibration.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.240
So imagine a
situation you've been

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.530
in where there's an air
conditioner in a window,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.385
and it's causing
your table to shake,

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.360
or where you're trying to
work, or your bed rattles,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.550
or something like that.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.341
How many of you have
ever had an experience

00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:56.100
like that, something's
kind of annoying,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.905
messing up a lab
experiment, or whatever?

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:00.180
Yeah, you've all experienced
these things, right?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.900
So as clever
engineers, are there

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.480
simple solutions sometimes
to fixing these problems?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.650
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.200
I have a little quick demo
that I'm going to show you.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.420
You saw this the
other day, where

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.010
this is my little squiggle pen,
and it's got a rotating mass

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.620
inside.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.740
And we've looked at
rotating masses a lot.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.030
It has some unbalanced,
statically unbalanced rotating

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.560
mass.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.190
Could be a fan blade with a
hunk of chewing gum or something

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.540
stuck on a blade or
broken piece out of it.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.770
Puts in a force me omega squared
cosine omega t, basically

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.220
an F0 cosine omega t
kind of excitation.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.140
And if it happens to be a
flexibly-mounted, mass-spring

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.860
dashpot system, it'll vibrate.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.852
And so I showed you
that the other day.

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:57.310
We'll do this, and we'll need
to lower the lights a little.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.030
But today, I've set your bed.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.600
This is your microscope
here, this little one.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.250
Think you can see it
in the foreground.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.520
And this is the air
conditioner, or the water pump,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.650
or whatever is
causing the trouble.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.390
So this is running
at about 28 hertz.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.570
If I set the strobe
just right, I

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.420
can absolutely stop the motion.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660
It doesn't look like
it's moving at all.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.950
That's because the strobe
is at exactly the same rate

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.540
as the squiggle pen.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.570
Now I'm going to de-tune the
strobe a little bit so you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.630
can see the motion.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.180
There is the motion
of this main system.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.160
That's causing the problem.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.950
But it actually puts
vibration into the tabletop.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.120
And next door over here,
I have a little beam.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.494
And you can see
that little piece

00:02:52.494 --> 00:02:54.390
of white moving up and down.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440
It's just a little flat
piece of spring steel

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.150
with a magnet on the end as a
mass and a piece of white tape

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.480
so you can see it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.510
But notice it's going
up and down in synchrony

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.290
with the other one.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.720
So this is your microscope
sitting on a lab bench

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.280
some distance away.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310
The problem vibrations
are being created

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.980
by the original
imbalance in something,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.820
travels through the
floor, gets to your table

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.960
with the microscope on it.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.820
Now your microscope shakes.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.780
So the issue is, what
can we do about it?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.190
OK.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.370
Oh, I do-- yeah, no, I'll
leave this for a second.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.440
I'll turn it off.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.140
And then I'm going
to have you consider.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.691
So I want you to get in
pairs and talk about this.

00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:44.440
I want, as a group,
we're going to come up

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.070
with at least three
ways to reduce

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.820
the vibration of
your microscope--

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.330
relatively simple
ways to fix it.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.410
How would you do it?

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.240
So think about.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.290
Talk about it.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.850
And come up with three ways
of fixing this problem.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
I'm going to do one more
demo on this in a minute

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.390
and then put up the transfer
function for the force, the one

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.510
we had the other day, OK?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.220
The picture.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.520
All right.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.720
Let's have some suggestions.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.510
How would you go
about fixing this?

00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:24.812
All right.

00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:26.246
You had your hand up first.

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:27.441
AUDIENCE: We have it
on suspension systems,

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:28.125
and springs.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:28.791
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.875
So put some springs on what?

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:34.125
AUDIENCE: Like, have a table
where your microscope is,

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.538
and then have [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.270
PROFESSOR: So springs
support the microscope.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.000
All right.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.257
So I had this little magnet
here sitting on this beam.

00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:49.965
This is that
spring-supported microscope.

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:51.560
And I have done a
heck of a lousy job.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.410
This thing shakes like crazy.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.730
So what do you mean?

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.070
Not like that.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.150
How might you-- OK.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.660
So you think you could change
the properties of this system

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.074
so that it might do better?

00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:09.300
Let's think about that.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.420
OK, what's another idea?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.112
AUDIENCE: Change the
length of that spring

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:19.520
could change its
natural frequency.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.609
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:22.900
Are you talking about the
microscope one, the receiving

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.400
one?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.740
If you change the length
of it to make it longer,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.220
it makes it softer, actually.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.120
Make it shorter, it
makes it stiffer.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.620
So you would change
its natural frequency.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.370
Now, the two ideas together, if
you set the natural frequency

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.100
correctly, the system
on the receiving end,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.324
you can reduce its vibration.

00:06:42.324 --> 00:06:43.990
And I will demonstrate
that in a second.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.782
What's another idea?

00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:47.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320
PROFESSOR: Acid damping.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.820
OK.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.830
Well, that's a very
interesting suggestion.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.667
Damping, it helps
under one circumstance,

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:55.750
but not under some others.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.500
And we're going to
explore that today.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.960
This is all basically--
we've come up

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.181
with one of the three ideas.

00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:02.680
What else?

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:07.580
AUDIENCE: Attach
something that vibrates

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.224
180 degrees [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:10.640
PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.556
That's the fourth one.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.350
I mean, that can be
a little expensive,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.870
but these are like
noise-canceling headsets,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.545
right?

00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:18.420
Could we put in something
else somewhere else

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.710
on the table that
cancels the vibration

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.271
out where your microscope is?

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.270
Yeah, you could do that.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.980
A little expensive.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.550
What else?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.850
Yeah.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.516
AUDIENCE: You could
cushion [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:35.190
PROFESSOR: Where
would we put that?

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.794
AUDIENCE: You could do it
underneath [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:38.794 --> 00:07:39.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.043
And so that's generally
the same idea.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.640
So you're all treating
the microscope.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.090
Can you treat something
else in the system?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.360
So yeah, we'll fix
the microscope end.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.350
But that might knock it
down by a factor of 10.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.516
I want to knock it down by
at least a factor of 100,

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:53.794
if not a factor of 1,000.

00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:55.210
AUDIENCE: Fix the
air conditioner.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.607
PROFESSOR: Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.910
You know, put another piece
of gum on the other blade.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.760
Or clean it up, or balance
the rotor, in effect.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.650
Rotors are not manufactured
defective usually.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.650
They get rejected at QC
before it goes out the door.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.910
So fix the rotor.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.020
Can be a little expensive
sometimes, but worth it.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.500
They do maintenance checks.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.650
Actually, they
have accelerometers

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.620
built in to all expensive
rotating equipment these days.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.557
And it's called
condition monitoring.

00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:32.390
And when they get outside
of certain limits,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.161
they shut the thing
down and rebuild it.

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.110
In electric generator
sets, gas turbines,

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.000
jet engines on all aircraft
are all incredibly carefully

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.750
balanced in a way.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.890
They start getting
out of balance,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.260
they stop and fix them before
the things blow up on them

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.140
and you have a $20
million problem instead of

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.337
maybe a $20,000 tear-down.

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:52.710
All right?

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.930
So yeah, you fix the rotor.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.730
Third idea.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.840
Well, could you-- this
thing's shaking like crazy.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.980
What if you change the
length of this beam?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.016
Could you stop this thing
from shaking so much?

00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:18.050
And if you stop this
from shaking so much,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.170
would it put so much
excitation into the table?

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.670
No.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.855
So fix the rotor, isolate the
source, isolate the receiver.

00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:29.659
Now you get at least three ways.

00:09:29.659 --> 00:09:31.950
And the gentleman up here
came up with the fourth way--

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.770
active cancellation.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.660
OK.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.690
Great.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.224
I have a demo of one of these.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.890
Sometimes if you're
desperate and you're

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.560
trying to get some
sleep-- it's your bed

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.090
that's rattling
or something-- you

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.650
might want to try the following
that you can do very quickly.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.920
So we'll dim the lights again.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.220
We'll turn it back on.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.890
[VIBRATING]

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.830
Both are vibrating like crazy.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.370
All right.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.330
So one way to
detune the receiver

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:06.920
is to put a big weight on it
and change its natural frequency

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.170
by changing the mass.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.080
And now the little thing
is hardly shaken at all,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.370
because I've detuned just
by changing the mass.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.060
Accomplished the same thing
as switching the length.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.800
Instead of messing
with the stiffness,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.160
I've changed the
mass of the system.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.850
This is still
shaking like crazy.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.420
OK.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.200
So now it's back
to vibrating again.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.852
But over here is my source.

00:10:34.852 --> 00:10:36.810
I don't know if it'll
work so well in this one,

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.052
because the source is
a lot more massive.

00:10:39.052 --> 00:10:40.760
But I'm going to put
the same mass on it.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.996
Ooh, it made it worse.

00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:46.800
Ah.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.140
And that's another
good demonstration.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.950
Excellent.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:59.120
So we could come back
up with the lights.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.510
You got to be careful of that.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.090
You go to mess with one of these
systems, if you do it wrong,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.180
you make the matters worse.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.940
First consulting job I ever
had back in 1977 or something

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.390
like that, they had a
vibration problem on a ship.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.830
And the first consultant
in said, stiffen up.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.152
It was actually the exhaust
stacks on these 5,000

00:11:21.152 --> 00:11:23.360
horsepower diesel engines,
and they were 30 feet tall

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.870
and shaking like crazy.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.112
And the first guy said, stiffen
up those exhaust stacks.

00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:29.570
And he did exactly
the wrong thing.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.171
And it just shook
worse than ever.

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:33.670
OK.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.490
So now what I'm
going to show you--

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.970
what we'll put on
the board today

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.350
is a little bit of
mathematics to back up how you

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.880
go about doing the two things.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.400
One is isolating the
receiver, or the other one's

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.970
isolating the source.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.260
I'm going to start with
isolating the receiver.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.535
But we're going to start
with a little bit of math,

00:11:58.535 --> 00:12:00.520
a little math tool
that we need that will

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.520
make life a lot easier for us.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.470
Yeah, I'll work here.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.860
If you recall last time, now
would be the time to do it,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:25.420
we derived the transfer function
for essentially this system,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.970
where we had an
F0 cosine omega t.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.610
And we computed the
response, x of t,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:40.580
as some x0 cosine omega
t minus the phase angle.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.770
And we worked it
all down to where

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.240
we could plot it like that.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.910
But quite frankly, it was kind
of a lot of lines of math.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.035
And it was sort of painful.

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.230
I actually hated
doing it on the board.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.086
But it was easy,
because it was familiar.

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:54.960
It's just trig stuff.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.600
It was all trig and a
little bit of calculus.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.610
So we do that first, because
it all makes sense to you

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.490
mathematically.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.320
But there's a vastly
easier and quicker way

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.240
to do this, which we'll
address right now.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.900
And that's using
complex numbers.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.300
So we need a couple bits
of information here.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.935
One is Euler's formula.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.560
So if you have e raised
to the power i theta,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.630
you can show that that is the
same thing as cosine theta

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.910
plus i sine of theta.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.380
That breaks into a real
part and an imaginary part.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:53.630
So if we wanted to express this
excitation, F0 cosine omega t,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.380
in complex notation,
we would say

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.220
it is the real part,
which I'll denote

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:09.530
as Re, the real part of
F0 e to the i omega t.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:16.060
And I'm going to just specify
that F0 itself here, this

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.725
is real and positive.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.580
So this is real and positive.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.250
So the real part's
going to be F0 times--

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.780
and if you break down co ee
to the i omega t into its--

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.250
by Euler's formula, it
gives you cosine omega t

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.340
plus i sine omega t.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.970
And the real part is the cosine
part just according to this.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.470
OK.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.800
Now, another little fact
that I want to show you

00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.930
is if you have a complex
number, a plus bi,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.030
I want to express it as
some ce to the i theta.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.120
So you want to use
Euler's formula

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.170
to express a complex number.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.950
And if we draw it, the answer
becomes pretty obvious.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.190
This is a point up here, a, bi.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.530
And this is the imaginary
axis here and the real.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:36.460
And this point, this side is
a, and this side here is b.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.310
And this side here, the
length of this triangle, is c.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.870
And the angle in here is theta.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.160
So now if I ask you,
what's c, well, you say,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.610
oh, well, c is obviously
the square root of a squared

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.210
plus b squared.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:16:01.790
And theta is a tangent
inverse of b/a,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.400
which is the imaginary
part over the real part.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.610
If you want to express a
complex number this way,

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.770
well, the magnitude is
square root of a squared

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.890
plus b squared.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.820
And the phase angle
that you put up here

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.310
is tangent inverse of the
imaginary part over the real.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.810
OK.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:42.450
So now we have
the basic tools we

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.540
need to take on the
vibration problem.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.295
And so we have that
system up there.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.330
And our output, from the
way we derived it last time,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:05.724
the output is some x0
cosine omega t minus phi.

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:08.140
And one of the reasons it was
so painful doing it this way

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.140
last time is you
have to-- this is

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.630
cosine is a function
of both time and phase.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.670
And to break it apart
takes a lot of work.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.520
So we want to do the same thing,
but with complex variables

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.630
this time.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:28.620
So I want to express this
then as the real part of-- I

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:34.780
could say it's the real
part of x0 e to the i omega

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.200
t minus phi.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.970
And despite Euler's formula if
this is real, just the number.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.180
Than this breaks down into
cosine omega t minus phi and i

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.480
sine omega t minus phi.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.150
But here's the beauty of
using complex notation

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.230
and exponentials.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:09.030
This now becomes the real part
of x0 e to the minus i phi

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.945
times e to the i omega t.

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:13.740
If I could separate these two.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.290
And this is what
makes it so much

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.890
easier to use this approach.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:26.370
And I'm going to call this
part of it just some capital X.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.180
And it is a complex number.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:30.730
For sure.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:39.140
If I break this up into cosine
of minus phi and minus i sine

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.810
phi, it's got an i sine phi.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.830
So this is a complex number--
a plus bi kind of form.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.650
So in general, this
thing is complex.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.630
So this whole thing
is the real part

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.650
of some X, which I don't
know now, e to the i omega t.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.000
So now we can quite
quickly do the derivation

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.650
we did last time.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.760
We're talking about representing
linear systems by some kind

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.750
of black box-- has a transfer
function in it, which we call

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:26.700
H, in this case, x/F. Response x
per unit input F. And remember,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:35.360
we're talking about steady
state response only.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:47.730
And we have, as our input here,
some F0 e to the i omega t.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:53.130
And we have, as an output,
some X e to the i omega t.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.620
And we know that we're going
to use the convention that we

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:01.650
care about we have to
have real number answers.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.640
So we'll be eventually
actually using

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.970
the real part of the input and
the real part of the output.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.350
But to get there, we're going
to use complex notation first

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.560
and then separate out the real
and imaginary parts at the end.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:36.900
So for our system, we know
the equation of motion,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:51.110
so now it's some F0
e to the i omega t.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.190
There's our equation of motion.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:21:02.900
And I'm going to let x here
be this unknown capital X e

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.890
to the i omega t.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.260
And I'm going to plug it in.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.040
And the exponentials
are particularly

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.245
easy to deal with when
you're taking derivatives.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.790
So upon doing that, we
immediately get minus omega

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:35.450
squared M plus i omega c plus k.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.050
All of that times
Xe to the i omega t

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.190
equals F0 e to the i omega t.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.935
Immediately, I can get rid
of the time-dependent parts.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.420
And I can solve for x/F,
which is what we set out

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.160
to do the other day to find this
transfer function between input

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.830
and output.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.370
So if I solve for
x divided by F,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.200
I'm going to get all this
stuff and the denominator

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.660
on one side.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.290
And I'll write it out here.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.730
It simply looks like that.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.730
And now remember, I can
substitute in some things.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.790
I remember k/m is
omega n squared.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:10.920
And zeta in c over 2 omega n M.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.780
And I plug those
things in and just

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.250
rearrange it a little tiny bit.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.400
We should come up
with something like we

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:32.560
found before, so that x/F,
1/k, and the denominator,

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:40.570
1 minus omega squared over
omega n squared-- not quite yet

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:47.105
here-- plus 2 i zeta
omega over omega n.

00:23:51.327 --> 00:23:52.410
That's what it looks like.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.260
So you still have a
complex denominator.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:07.220
And this basically looks like
a number 1 over k times 1

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.960
over some a plus bi.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.810
There's your a term.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.840
Here's your bi term.

00:24:26.892 --> 00:24:28.850
And the way you deal with
something like this--

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.090
you have an a plus bi in the
denominator-- you multiply

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.900
the numerator and denominator
by the complex conjugate

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.250
in order to get this into
actually standard a plus bi

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.150
form.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.630
If I do that
symbolically here, it

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.190
comes out looking like a
minus bi over a squared

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.050
plus b squared.

00:24:56.108 --> 00:25:06.710
And that's 1/k e
to the minus i phi

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:12.240
over square root of a
squared plus b squared.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.125
Because now, see,
the denominator's

00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:20.120
just a real number.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.270
So this whole thing is,
in some form, c plus a di.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.410
You could break this into
a real part, complex part.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.680
We could say that's
equal to some magnitude

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.050
times e to the i phi.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:41.160
To get the magnitude,
you take a squared

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.840
plus b squared square root.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.100
It cancels.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.380
This is squared the
denominator, so you

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.760
end up with this part, square
root, in the denominator.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:59.470
This is what the-- we need
to know what phi looks like.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.040
Well, phi had better
come out like before,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:13.530
where now phi is minus tangent
inverse of the imaginary part

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.370
over the real part.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.250
And the imaginary
part has a minus here.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.710
That's why a minus pops up here.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.780
Imaginary part comes from this.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.410
The real part comes from there.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.680
The common denominator
stuff all cancels out

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.060
when you take the ratio.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:41.820
So this is tangent inverse of
two zeta omega over omega n

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.280
all over 1 minus omega
squared over omega n squared,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.220
as before.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.460
I've skipped a couple of steps,
but we cranked this whole thing

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.030
out before.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:02.160
This is the same steps that you
would go through to do that.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.850
We're just doing this to
get to the phase angle.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:20.550
But this now is exactly the
same thing we got before,

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.310
which we have plotted up there.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.380
We work with magnitude
and phase angle.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:36.650
So the magnitude of
x/F is the same thing

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.795
as saying the magnitude
of the transfer function.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.510
And that transfer function
looks like 1/k, the magnitude,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:56.060
all divided by 1 minus omega
squared over omega n squared

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:06.020
squared plus 2 zeta omega over
omega n squared square root.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.970
That is the same transfer
function magnitude

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:15.060
that we derived last time,
with a lot more work.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.200
And this approach,
using complex variables,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.470
you can use for any single
input, single output

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.660
linear system.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.270
And we're going to do it to
derive right away the transfer

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:34.905
function for the response of
this to motion of the base.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.325
So if you follow how we used
this complex variables in e

00:28:42.325 --> 00:28:45.290
to the i omega t's
to get here, we

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.170
can now apply the same tools
to do other transfer functions

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.755
to be a lot more
efficient about it.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.920
Before I jump to
this one, remind you

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.260
how, in practice, we use this.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.400
So if the statement
magnitude of x/F

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.980
equals everything
on the right there.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.020
Then in the way
we would normally

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.830
use this is to say, well,
if you want the magnitude

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.640
of the response, you take the
magnitude of the input force,

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.160
multiply it by the magnitude
of the transfer function,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.655
evaluate it at the
correct frequency.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.840
That would give
you the magnitude.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.620
If you want the time
dependence, x of t,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.810
well, that's the
magnitude of the force,

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.400
magnitude of the
transfer function

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:55.680
times the real part of e
to the i omega t minus phi.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.780
And this gets us back to
when you work this out,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.010
this is your x0.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:11.730
And this is your cosine
omega t minus phi.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.400
So once you know what
the excitation force is

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.640
and its frequency, you
put the force in here.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.670
You evaluate that thing on the
left at the correct frequency.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.170
And you write out
the answer directly.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.320
In one of the
homeworks for today,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.330
the question just had you
go through the exercise

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.770
of figuring this out at
three different frequency

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.700
ratios, like 1/2, 1, and
3, or something like that,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.950
would put you to the left of the
peak at 1/2, on the peak at 1,

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.810
and way off to the right
out at the right edge at 3.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.170
And you'll get three
different response

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.280
amplitudes and three different
phase angles that go with it.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.080
All right.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.340
So that's how you review.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.890
Did the same thing
a different way.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.330
And I'm going to move
on to base motion.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.720
But any questions
about this now?

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.220
Yeah.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.385
AUDIENCE: Was the e to
the negative ib included

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:20.965
in your F of x?

00:31:20.965 --> 00:31:21.760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.225
AUDIENCE: OK, so
why did the negative

00:31:25.225 --> 00:31:27.205
b appear again after
your final [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.560
PROFESSOR: The
very top expression

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.120
up there, it says
x/F. It says we're

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:45.420
trying to cast it in the
e to the minus i phi form.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.560
That's my goal.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.080
And I did that, because
we started over here

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.280
with the problem that
we had done before,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.380
where that's the way we
decided to write the answer.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.260
And it turns out that it's
just a convention in vibration

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:05.550
engineering that authors and
people have adopted to express

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.271
the phase angle as minus phi.

00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:08.770
They could have
done it as plus phi.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.306
The plots like this are phi.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:13.972
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:13.972 --> 00:32:20.870
But I guess what I'm wondering,
isn't [INAUDIBLE] x/F.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.110
PROFESSOR: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.280
It's in there before
you take its magnitude.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:39.290
So the Hx/F, when
it is-- this here

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.680
is left in complex notation.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.440
And this is Hx/F of omega.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.180
And it is complex.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.630
We take its magnitude.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.620
Then the magnitude is
not complex, right?

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.760
And so we take its magnitude.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.399
We get that expression.

00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:04.940
But when we take
its magnitude, we've

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.170
thrown away the
phase information.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.650
So we have to keep it
and put it somewhere.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:16.380
And so we put it in the
e to the i phi form.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.880
And I guess what I
should have done here

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.160
is now this is--
I've taken-- this

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:34.610
is Hx/F, same thing as
x/F, in complex form.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.620
And I've said, OK, if
I write it this way,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.476
I have just said
it is a magnitude.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.930
Times its phase information.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.410
I've separated its phase
information from its magnitude

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.548
by writing it this way.

00:33:51.548 --> 00:33:53.340
OK.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.330
And the phase then is that.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.920
And its magnitude is that.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.639
Good question.

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:01.139
All right.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.580
So now let's see if we
can kind of pretty quickly

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.450
do the same problem
for base motion.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.540
So this is our microscope now,
idealizes a mass spring system.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.844
So this is our microscope.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:50.810
Has some mass stiffness
damping motion, x of t.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.580
And how do you suppose--
where would you measure

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.100
that motion x of t from?

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.590
Like, to define
your coordinate here

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.985
is a major point in
the last homework.

00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:08.335
Is gravity involved?

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.380
But only as a constant term,
mg in the equation of motion.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.910
It's only there
depending on if you

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.630
write the equation of motion
in the less desirable way.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.420
Where is this measured
from do you guess?

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.580
Equilibrium position?

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.010
Static equilibrium position?

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.515
Or 0 spring force position?

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.300
How many suggest 0
spring force position?

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.970
How many suggest
static equilibrium?

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:36.470
OK.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.440
You got the message.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.570
This is from equilibrium,
because you don't

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.910
have to deal with the mg term.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.090
So this is measured
from equilibrium.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.900
That's the deflection of
the microscope support.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.880
This is the deflection of
the floor that's driving it.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.337
Then we know we've got that
table shaking like crazy.

00:35:56.337 --> 00:35:57.920
That's what's causing
this to vibrate.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.750
And we need a free-body diagram.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.740
And we approach free-body
diagrams just like before.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.940
You imagine positive
motions of x and x dot,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.830
positive motions of y and y
dot, and deduce their forces.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:24.410
So positive x gives
you a kx opposing.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:30.890
A positive x dot gives
you a cx dot opposing.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.290
A positive y gives you what?

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.460
A force that results on this.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.920
Positive motion of the floor.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.336
Positive or negative force?

00:36:49.336 --> 00:36:51.531
How many think positive?

00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:53.870
How many think negative?

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.090
How many aren't sure?

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.050
How many aren't awake?

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:58.650
OK.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.800
Look.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.120
If I push up on
this-- and now this

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.640
is fixed when you do
this mental experiment.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.120
You fix this momentarily.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.470
You cause a positive
deflection here.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.250
It compresses the spring.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.700
Does the spring
push back or not?

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.182
So if I'm moving upwards, which
way is the spring pushing?

00:37:18.182 --> 00:37:18.890
All right.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.210
But if I'm pushing
upwards, which way is

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.920
the spring pushing on the mass?

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.740
Up.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.210
So this one gives me a ky up.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.750
And the dashpot does a
similar thing-- cy dot up.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.870
And there's also an mg here.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.770
But there's also a kx
static, if you will, up.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.530
And they cancel.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.140
We know that.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.180
So we don't have to
deal with the mg terms.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.990
So now we can write
our equation of motion.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:57.880
And the equation of
motion for this system

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.100
is the mass times
the acceleration.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.380
That's got to equal
to the sum of all the

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.550
external forces-- one,
two, three, four of them.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:10.160
And I'll just save a little
time and board space.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.700
I'll put them on the correct
sides of the equation.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.730
So these are the x-- put the
x terms on the left side.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.250
cx dot plus kx.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:32.080
And on the right-hand
side, I get ky plus cy dot.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.120
This is my excitation.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.980
That's the floor motion.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.170
And this is my response
on the left-hand side.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:46.880
So I'm going to let
y of t, the input,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:56.000
be some y0 real positive
times e to the i omega t.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.080
And I'm going to assume that
the response is some x, probably

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.330
complex, e to the i omega t.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.520
So this is x of t here.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.931
Equals some x I don't
know e to the i omega t.

00:39:12.931 --> 00:39:15.055
And I'm going to plug those
two into this equation.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.470
If I just do that directly,
x is on the left side.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.020
y is on the right side.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:41.795
Then I find minus omega squared
m plus i omega c plus k, just

00:39:41.795 --> 00:39:57.710
like before, xe to the i omega
t equals k plus i omega c y0

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:01.320
e to the i omega t.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:07.340
And nicely, I can for now get
rid of the time-dependent part.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:18.120
And I can solve for
the response that I'm

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.450
looking for-- x over the
input is real and positive,

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.890
amplitude of vibration
of the floor.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:31.410
And that I will call
Hx/y of omega, a transfer

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.090
function, probably
complex, that I can then

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.920
deal with like I did above.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.820
And when I finish manipulating
things, substituting

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.560
in zetas and omega n squareds
and that kind of thing,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.600
this becomes-- well, first,
I'll write it this way.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.571
I can write this as a magnitude
times an e to the minus i phi

00:40:59.571 --> 00:41:00.070
again.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.050
That's where I want to go.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:18.710
And when I do that, 1 plus--
a little messier-- 2 zeta

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:27.260
omega over omega n
squared square root.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.425
This is just the numerator.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.890
And the denominator is just the
same as the other single degree

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.390
of freedom things.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.780
1 minus omega
squared over omega n

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:50.400
squared squared
plus 2 zeta omega

00:41:50.400 --> 00:42:00.070
over omega n squared square
root e to the minus i phi.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.350
So now it's the
transfer function

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.940
as before except the
denominator's a little messy.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.750
And there's no 1/k.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:14.010
And I am going to have a
messier expression for phi here.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:35.490
So there is something wrong with
one of the boards this morning.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.120
Kind of messy, complicated.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:30.930
Do I ever use it?

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:31.430
Rarely.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.920
What's important in these
things and what isn't-- really

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.750
what's important when you're
just trying to get a quick

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.700
solution to vibration
isolate something,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.950
you really want to know what
this is going to come out

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.910
looking like.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.090
You're trying to make
the response x small

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.635
compared to the input.

00:43:53.635 --> 00:43:54.760
That's the whole objective.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.775
Right now the table might be
moving a half a millimeter

00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:03.760
or something like
that, but this thing's

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.410
moving out here five or
six or seven millimeters,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.070
5 or 10 times that.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:13.390
And what we'd really like
is if the table's moving

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.120
a millimeter, you'd
like this thing

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.070
out here moving 1/10th
of a millimeter.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.690
So the real objective here
is to make this small.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.020
It's the magnitude
you care about.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.620
Phase you rarely even want
to know or need to know.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.200
So we're going to do
a sample calculation.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.850
Let's give an example here.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:50.280
So the source is at 20 hertz.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.420
So your unbalanced pump,
your unbalanced rotor.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:52.920
Yeah.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.836
AUDIENCE: How do we know
in the previous thing

00:44:54.836 --> 00:45:01.420
that the frequency of
oscillation has to be the same?

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.670
Like, why wouldn't
it be twice that?

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.270
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:06.761
That's a great question.

00:45:06.761 --> 00:45:11.340
And I haven't mentioned this
before, and I intended to.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.210
These systems that
we're looking at

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:18.220
are linear systems, which is
where we started the other day.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.840
Linear systems have some
interesting and very useful

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.250
properties that we depend upon.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:28.320
One was, I said, force
one gives you output one,

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.800
force two gives you output two.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.860
Force one plus two gives
you the sum of the outputs.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.110
The other feature
of a linear system

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.450
is steady state response after
the transients have died away.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:47.710
If the frequency of the
input is at 21.5 Hertz,

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:53.370
the frequency of the output
is at 21.5 Hertz, period.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.290
Linear systems, the
frequency of the input

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.340
is equal to the
frequency of the output.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.752
That's a really important
little factoid to remember.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:07.035
So I turn on the pump, the
pump's running at 20 Hertz.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:18.530
20 Hertz times 60 is 1,200
RPM, very common motor speed.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.120
So the pump's
running at 20 Hertz.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.820
So that fan, it's
got an imbalance.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.740
So that means you're
putting excitation

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.230
into the floor at 20 Hertz.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:42.290
And I want to reduce the
vibration at the microscope

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:47.700
by 90%.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.950
What that really
means is that my goal

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:57.710
is that the magnitude
of x/y is 0.1.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.380
And that's the magnitude of
this transfer function, Hx/y.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.170
So I want this transfer
function to be 0.1.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.340
So just look at the picture.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.050
Can I get that answer
to the left of the peak?

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.450
And what this plot shows
you is this magnitude

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.209
of the transfer function, for
a variety of values, a damping.

00:47:24.209 --> 00:47:25.750
And of course, the
lower the damping,

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.460
the higher the peak
gets at resonance.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.100
Right?

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.320
So no matter what
the damping is,

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.660
what is the curves all go
to in the left-hand side?

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.860
They go to 1.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.630
And that's really saying the
static response of this system

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:49.880
is if you deflect the floor an
inch, the table moves with it.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.690
Everything has to move
together when you get down

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.360
to 0 frequency input.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.210
So everything goes
to 1 on the left.

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.610
You go through
resonance at omega

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.200
equals a natural frequency.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.550
But out to the right, as
the excitation frequency

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.090
gets higher than the
natural frequency,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.280
the response drops off below 1.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.650
Which one drops the fastest?

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:18.741
As you increase omega
over omega n beyond 1,

00:48:18.741 --> 00:48:20.740
there's a whole mess of
curves to the right that

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.375
blend together.

00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:25.870
And they differ only in damping.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.000
Can you tell which
one is the-- let's say

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.690
if you go to-- at three,
there, the response

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:36.770
is at 0.1 for the lowest
curve on that curve, right?

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:40.354
And that's the one
with no damping.

00:48:40.354 --> 00:48:42.461
It's a little
counter-intuitive, right?

00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:42.960
All right.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.250
Well, let's come back to it.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:49.950
Damping does help,
but not at this point.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:57.250
So we need to find
a value of omega

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:02.290
over omega n which is greater
than 1 that satisfies this.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.920
That's what we're after.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.372
And this is kind of
messy to work with.

00:49:23.372 --> 00:49:24.830
And since I know
the one that works

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.470
the best is the one
with no damping,

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.182
we'll solve the no
damping one first,

00:49:29.182 --> 00:49:30.890
because it makes the
algebra really easy.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.130
And then we can go
back and say, now,

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.880
what happens if you
add some damping?

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.060
So for the case
there's no damping,

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.210
the numerator goes to 1.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.690
The denominator goes
to just 1 over 1

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.242
minus omega squared
over omega n squared.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.130
So it becomes that.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.480
That simple.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.505
And because I want to work
with this ratio bigger than 1,

00:50:15.505 --> 00:50:16.880
I don't want this
to be negative.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.841
And I want to mess with-- keep
carrying along absolute value

00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:20.340
signs.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.690
This is the same thing
as 1 over omega squared

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:28.590
over omega n squared minus 1.

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.560
I just reverse
this, because I know

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.380
we're going to deal only with
the ones greater than 1 here.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.185
And I need this to
be equal to 0.1.

00:50:38.185 --> 00:50:39.185
And that's just algebra.

00:50:39.185 --> 00:50:41.570
You could solve that.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:49.940
This implies that omega
over omega n equals root 11,

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.470
I recall.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:03.340
And that is 3.31.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.870
So this is saying on
that curve, if you go out

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.070
to omega over omega n equals
3.31 right about where

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:16.850
that arrow is, the curve for
zero damping drops down to 0.1.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.190
And now if, at that
frequency-- ah.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:27.130
So that means we have to
design the spring support such

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:34.430
that omega n is equal
to omega over 3.31.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:39.211
But omega-- where'd we start?

00:51:39.211 --> 00:51:41.615
So F equals 20 Hertz.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:48.555
Omega equals 2 pi f.

00:51:48.555 --> 00:51:49.680
Do I have that number here?

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.890
No, but-- so this tells me that
I need a natural frequency that

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:09.980
is omega over 3.31, or I need
an fn that is f over 3.31

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:15.430
is 20 Hertz over 3.31.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.100
And that number I do have.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.840
6.04 Hertz.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.480
So I need a support
whose natural frequency

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.920
is 20 Hertz divided by 3.31.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:37.350
I need a support whose natural
frequency is 6.04 Hertz.

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.660
And that's how you go about
designing a flexible base

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.090
to isolate something
from vibration

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:47.390
of whatever it's sitting on.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.900
All right.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:56.200
So my f here, 20 Hertz.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.610
But my fn needs
to be 6.04 Hertz.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:05.110
That implies multiply by 2 pi.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:12.100
I'm looking for 37.96
radians per second.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:17.700
And that's equal to square root
of k/M. So now what's the M?

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.690
Well, it's whatever the mass of
the microscope plus its base.

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:25.060
Whatever is being
supported by the springs

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.800
will have that mass.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.810
You have to choose the k.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:37.480
So let's say that M total for
this system is 20 kilograms.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.230
Solve this equation for k.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:56.756
And that implies that k is
28,827 Newtons per meter.

00:53:56.756 --> 00:53:57.256
OK?

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.720
So if we were to
design this system--

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.000
and it really mounts up
to in the case of this.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.530
Let's see.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.780
Beams.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:17.380
The stiffness of a
beam-- ah, that's a good.

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.590
We'll do this.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.760
We have a cantilever here.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.420
And we've got a mass on the end.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.350
But most of you have
been taking 2001.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.551
If you put a force
out here, P, what's

00:54:33.551 --> 00:54:35.300
the deflection at the
end of a cantilever?

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:37.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.720
So delta is PL cubed over 3EI.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:54.660
And the load, this force, is
equal to some k equivalent

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.610
times delta, right?

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:58.592
This is just a spring.

00:54:58.592 --> 00:55:03.430
And k times the displacement
is the force it takes to do it.

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.600
So P's my force.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.190
The spring constant
is somehow associated

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.370
with the rest of this stuff.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:22.610
So if I solve for P over
delta, I get 3EI over L cubed.

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.560
OK?

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.590
So if I'm running right at
the natural frequency here

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.700
and I want to reduce this
to a 1/10th of its motion,

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:35.400
I need to change the spring
constant of this cantilever

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:41.430
by a factor of-- well, I need
to change the natural frequency

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:51.960
by a factor of 3.31.

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:59.007
So my k equivalent here
is 3EI over L cubed.

00:55:59.007 --> 00:56:00.840
And that's what would
go into this equation.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.310
But I know that I have a
natural frequency right now.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:11.900
I want it to go down
by a factor of 3.31.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.850
So that means I
need to decrease k

00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:22.250
such that the square root of k
goes down by the factor 3.31.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:25.230
So how much do I have
to change the length?

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:38.060
Probably something like
the square root of 3.31.

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:38.880
Roughly 2.

00:56:43.424 --> 00:56:45.090
So if I double the
length of this thing,

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:46.423
do you think it's going to work?

00:56:48.832 --> 00:56:51.279
If I double the length of this
thing and turn it back on,

00:56:51.279 --> 00:56:53.195
then we shouldn't see
much motion out of this.

00:56:53.195 --> 00:56:56.402
[VIBRATING]

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.490
That's moving a lot.

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:11.210
It's moving a tiny, tiny bit.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.060
So it works.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.460
So that's one step of
vibration isolation.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.010
Now I'm going to show you a
vibration engineer trick, which

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.009
is a very handy thing to know.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:41.917
Where's my strong magnet here?

00:57:41.917 --> 00:57:43.750
So I've got another
beam just like this one.

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:50.480
I've got a pretty
massive magnet on it.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.850
So it makes another
cantilever beam

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.078
just like I got over there.

00:57:56.078 --> 00:57:57.410
OK?

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:04.760
So I claim that
with just a ruler,

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.130
if I clamp this
down at some length,

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:10.040
I claim, with just a
ruler, I can predict

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.699
the natural frequency of that.

00:58:18.092 --> 00:58:19.716
Take a couple of
minutes and see if you

00:58:19.716 --> 00:58:20.966
could figure out how to do it.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.080
Think about that.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.860
Just a ruler.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.030
Measurements that I can make.

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:32.702
I don't know how
long it actually is.

00:58:32.702 --> 00:58:33.910
I don't know how thick it is.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.490
I know it's steel, but you just
don't have enough information

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:40.200
to compute 3EI over L cubed.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.057
But simply with a ruler, I'm
going to be able to do this.

00:58:44.057 --> 00:58:44.640
Talk about it.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.605
Think about that while
I set up the experiment.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:17.800
OK.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.870
Who's got it figured out?

01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:23.210
Anybody want to
take a shot at this?

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.110
So there's my beam.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:36.890
I put the weight on it.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.430
What does the beam
do statically?

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:41.410
Bends a little, right?

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:55.230
kx static equals Mg, right?

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:56.760
Has to.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.660
So x static is what
I'm calling delta here.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.605
So k delta equals Mg.

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:10.205
k equals Mg over delta.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:33.600
Natural frequency equals
square root of k/M. Incredibly

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.450
simple, huh?

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:38.130
So what's the experiment
that I would--

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.780
what measurement would I make?

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.060
Delta, right?

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.490
Put my ruler up there.

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:48.220
I measure its static
position like that.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.520
Then I put my mass on it, and
I measure the static position

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.080
again.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.090
I measure the delta.

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:56.260
And I get a prediction.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.720
And I did this in my office.

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:22.230
And the delta that I
measured-- I actually

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.700
set it at a particular length.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.100
It was 18 centimeters.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:38.710
Delta measured, I think, 0.5
centimeters, or 0.005 meters.

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:43.330
And if you compute omega n
then equals the square root

01:02:43.330 --> 01:03:15.918
of 9.81 over 0.005.

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:17.605
And I want this in Hertz.

01:03:17.605 --> 01:03:20.320
So I can divide by 2 pi.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:29.960
This comes out as 7.05 Hertz.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:44.100
And Fn measured was 6.57.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.540
Pretty good but not perfect.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.584
And it's because I've made
an approximation that I

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:54.750
glossed over pretty quickly.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.580
What has been left out
of this system that

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.900
would cause the measured
natural frequency to be lower

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.267
than the predicted?

01:04:04.267 --> 01:04:05.100
What's been ignored?

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:05.599
Yes.

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:06.659
AUDIENCE: Damping.

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:07.450
PROFESSOR: Damping.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.420
Ah.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.330
Maybe.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.378
How much damping do we
have in this system?

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.890
Probably at least 10 cycles
to the k halfway, right?

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:22.620
Certainly less than 1%.

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.590
The damped natural frequency is
equal to the natural frequency

01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:29.530
of the square root of
1 minus theta squared.

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:32.000
So this is something
like way less than half

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:32.930
a percent difference.

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:34.263
So that wouldn't account for it.

01:04:34.263 --> 01:04:36.160
That's considerably more
than half a percent.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.336
So damping couldn't do it.

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:38.836
Yeah.

01:04:38.836 --> 01:04:40.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:43.060
PROFESSOR: Ah, the
mass of the bar.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.570
Does this flexure have mass?

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:48.070
Yeah.

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:50.970
It's probably on the order
of if you stack them all up

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.950
and compared to that, it
might even be as much as half

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:56.120
the mass of the end.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.590
And as it vibrates
back and forth,

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.940
does it have kinetic energy?

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.680
Yeah.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.190
We've ignored the kinetic
energy of the mass.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.940
And in fact, that's the
principal error here.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.280
We've left out the mass.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.780
There's actually a
pretty simple way

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.410
to-- using energy and just
thinking in Lagrange terms,

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.340
you can account for
the energy of the mass

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.380
in this single degree
of freedom system

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.090
and get a very
accurate prediction.

01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:21.180
We won't do that today.

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:25.618
But I think we'll do that
before the term's out.

01:05:25.618 --> 01:05:27.530
OK.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:35.540
This applies to any
simple mass spring system

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.240
in the presence of gravity.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.120
So here's a mass.

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:45.470
And actually, we're
doing the problem today

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:46.680
where I'm moving the base.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.990
So here's its base.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.070
So this is the table moving.

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:53.880
And if I do this, it
clearly makes that move.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.300
If I do this really fast,
it doesn't move very much.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:00.570
If I do it close to the natural
frequency, it moves a lot.

01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:06.290
If I move it very slowly,
as I go up one unit,

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.390
this follows me exactly.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.570
That's why that plot goes to 1.

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:15.240
At very, very low frequency,
the support and the mass

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.250
move exactly together.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:22.485
At very high frequency-- if
I can stop the transient--

01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:23.826
I can't do it very well.

01:06:23.826 --> 01:06:24.950
The mass doesn't move much.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:25.825
The base moves a lot.

01:06:25.825 --> 01:06:27.700
And at resonance, it goes nuts.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.410
OK.

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:31.800
The unstretched length of this
spring is about seven inches.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.500
The square root
of g over delta, I

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.150
ought to be able
to predict this.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:39.960
So I did a quick
calculation on that.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.310
It was like 1% error.

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:49.840
I measured it at 7.36
radians a second.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:58.477
And I predicted it at
7.43 measured 7.36.

01:06:58.477 --> 01:07:00.060
Same kind of thing--
ignoring the mass

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.460
of the spring a little bit.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.480
So g over delta is a great
little thing to remember.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:05.980
OK.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:18.730
So we have done all but one.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.460
Everything we've
started out with today,

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.280
we've said there's
three ways to fix this,

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.040
and came up with a fourth way.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.500
So in this case, soften
the spring support a lot,

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:33.820
so that the natural frequency
is way less than the excitation.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:39.350
We said, what about spring
supporting, softening, flexibly

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.585
amounting this source, so
that it doesn't put vibration

01:07:42.585 --> 01:07:43.210
on the table?

01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:45.750
That's the piece we
haven't addressed.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.664
So let's look into
that problem now.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:07.220
So here's our source, some
rotating mass eccentricity

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:12.510
causing an excitation.

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:16.810
So this has a force
F0 e to the i omega

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.270
t, which is coming
from the rotating mass.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.819
And it applies to the
floor, through the dashpot

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:27.660
in the springs, some
FT, I'll call it,

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:33.229
F transmitted to the
floor, e to the i omega t.

01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:40.390
And I want to know-- I need the
H force transmitted per unit

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:44.014
force input transfer function.

01:08:44.014 --> 01:08:45.180
That's what I'm looking for.

01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:59.420
So now free-body diagram.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.020
Now we're going to
make an assumption.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.880
We're going to assume that
the motion of the floor,

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.069
which we'll call y of t,
assume that y is much,

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:12.824
much less than x.

01:09:12.824 --> 01:09:14.420
It's generally true.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.580
Whatever's shaking
like crazy, the table's

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.410
not moving much underneath it.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:22.520
So I'm going to assume, for the
purposes of calculating forces,

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.970
that this is 0.

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:34.590
So for the motion x, what is
the force applied to the floor?

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:35.760
So F of t.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.319
If you have a positive
displacement x,

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.149
the force is kx.

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:53.330
You have a positive velocity
x, the force pulling up

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:57.700
on the floor through
the dashpot is cx dot.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:03.970
So the other way of
saying that is here's

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.240
our free-body diagram.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.680
Here's our F0 e to the
i omega t pulling up.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.800
It responds at some x.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.230
And the resulting forces
through the spring

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:23.540
and the dashpot we
know are kx and cx

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.340
dot opposing the motion x.

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.390
Well, by third law, if
these are the forces

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:34.360
on the spring and the dashpot,
then down here on the floor,

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.890
you better have some equal and
opposite forces, kx and cx dot.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:43.540
So this force
produces a motion x.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.310
The motion x produces forces in
the mass in the spring, which

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:53.180
make the force on
the floor, the spring

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.610
force, and the dashpot force.

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:56.110
OK.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:11.432
So this Ft is-- I
want to write it here.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.460
That's all that is-- positive.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:29.080
And I'm going to
assume a solution

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:35.800
that we know to work for x,
which is xe to the i omega t.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.790
We've plugged it in before.

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:43.510
So I plug that in here,
I get a k plus i omega

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:51.720
c, xe to the i omega t.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.710
So I can just express
my force on the floor

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.715
in terms of the motion x.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.500
And I'm looking for a transfer
function for force transmitted

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.490
over force in.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:46.760
But force transmitted
is my k plus i omega

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.550
c, xe to the i omega t.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:59.630
And the force in is
F0 e to the i omega t.

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:02.210
Cancel out the
time-dependent part.

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:05.800
And it says the transmitted
force over the input force

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.420
is this little complex
expression times the response

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.210
x over F. But we
know what that is.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:15.340
That's the transfer
function Hx/F.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:23.660
So this is k plus i omega
c times Hx/F of omega.

01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:33.360
So this gives us a slightly
different transfer function.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.935
Ooh, look at this.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.070
Before, when we did
x/y, we ended up

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:47.310
with k plus i omega c
y e to the i omega t.

01:13:47.310 --> 01:14:01.520
And when we did then x/y, we
got the same ratio as this.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.670
Exactly the same thing.

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:08.940
So I could write all this
out, but-- and let's say

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.280
I'll do this.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.712
Hx/y-- no, no, I won't do that.

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:23.270
What I'm going to tell you-- if
you just work through this now,

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:28.070
you will find that H force
transmitted over force in

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:30.390
is exactly the same as Hx/y.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:43.200
And that what we really care
about is what the magnitude is.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.510
So the magnitude of these
two things are the same.

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:52.740
And in fact, just work out to
that same expression as before,

01:14:52.740 --> 01:15:00.870
the 1 plus 2 zeta
omega over omega n

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:08.094
squared square root all over
the usual big denominator.

01:15:08.094 --> 01:15:13.370
So conveniently, for
vibration isolation,

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:16.820
the solution to the two
problems are exactly the same.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.220
So if you have that one, you
have the transfer function

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.630
xy that was projected on
the screen a minute ago,

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:28.870
it is also the force transmitted
to force in transfer function.

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:31.690
So you just have
to remember one.

01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:35.230
And if you now want
to-- we said, let's say,

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:39.180
doubling the length of this just
about accomplished the reducing

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.120
the vibration of the microscope
by this factor of 10.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.930
So if I doubled the
length of this one,

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.770
I would roughly
do the same thing.

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:53.440
I would change the
natural-- this thing is

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.300
right on the natural
frequency of this beam.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.375
That's why it shakes so much.

01:15:58.375 --> 01:16:01.040
And so it is this system.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.190
It's shaking like crazy,
putting force into the table.

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:07.310
The table is vibrating,
causing the other one to move.

01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:13.510
So now if I change this one,
then the same kind of idea.

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:17.210
Maybe roughly double its length.

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:20.880
Natural frequency diminishes
by a factor of 3 or so.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.195
The vibration of this
ought to go way down.

01:16:39.337 --> 01:16:40.920
And actually, our
little beam out here

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.908
is picking up more
than the other one.

01:16:43.908 --> 01:16:44.408
Shh.

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:52.777
So this thing is hardly
moving at all now.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.390
So by doing that, we've
essentially detuned it.

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:07.050
This is no longer running at the
natural frequency of this base.

01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:08.550
So it's no longer resonant.

01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:11.330
You're way out on the
curve to the right.

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:14.430
So the response of
this isn't very much.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.230
That means it doesn't transmit
much force to the base, maybe

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:18.860
down by a factor of 8 or 10.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:24.040
That means the table vibration
amplitude drops by that factor.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.260
Means that the base motion
over here is now a factor of 10

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.790
smaller than it
was to begin with,

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:32.210
so that we get a
reduction of 10 here.

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:36.660
And we get another reduction of
10 here, because we detuned it.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.750
So you might get a factor of 100
reduction by working on both,

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:40.250
you see.

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.970
You've treated the source and
you've treated the receiver.

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.000
But fortunately, they
use the same curve.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.466
So damping.

01:17:48.466 --> 01:17:50.090
When you do vibration
isolation, you're

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:54.145
trying to get well out on
this curve to the right.

01:17:54.145 --> 01:17:56.270
So there's a couple of
practical engineering things

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:58.545
that limit how far you can go.

01:17:58.545 --> 01:18:00.420
To get further out on
the curve to the right,

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.989
what do you have to do to the
spring in the system to get

01:18:03.989 --> 01:18:04.780
stronger or softer?

01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:10.480
You're trying to make the
natural frequency-- see,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.320
the excitation frequency
doesn't change.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.960
In order to get omega over
omega n to go bigger and bigger,

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.430
the excitation's
staying the same.

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:19.950
You're having to reduce
the natural frequency.

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:23.350
And so what do you have to
do to the spring constant?

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.660
Decrease it.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.340
What is the practical
limit of decreasing

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.190
the spring that
supports your pump,

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:34.340
or your washing machine,
or your air conditioner?

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:36.297 --> 01:18:37.880
PROFESSOR: Pretty
soon it's just going

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.754
to-- if it's too heavy--
you put it on there,

01:18:39.754 --> 01:18:41.670
it's just going to squash
the springs, right?

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:44.920
So you can't-- there's limits
to how soft you can make springs

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.652
to support heavy machines.

01:18:47.652 --> 01:18:49.860
So there is a practical
limit to how far to the right

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.570
you can go.

01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:53.910
But normally, you get out
there as far as you can.

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:57.410
And then if the real
system has damping,

01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:01.030
does it improve or
degrade the performance

01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:04.020
of your vibration
isolation system?

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:06.340
Well, the more the damping
you have, the higher up you

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.650
are on those curves.

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:11.320
So the damping decreases
the performance.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:17.730
But every system has to-- when
you first turn on that motor,

01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:19.130
the system has to spin up.

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:23.220
And you're going to have to
go through that resonance,

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.930
so that you want some damping.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:29.100
Because if you've got
your scanning electron

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:33.380
microscope or your laser
interferometry system set up

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:39.730
on a spring-supported table,
if that table has no damping

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.550
and you walk in the
door and bump it,

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:45.950
it is going to sit there
and vibrate all afternoon

01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:48.460
at its natural frequency due
to the initial conditions.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:52.290
So you need some damping
to prevent problems,

01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:54.220
either response to
initial conditions,

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.860
or bumping it, or whatever.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:59.660
Or even as the system
turns on and speeds up,

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.650
it'll have to go
through that resonance.

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.370
And it'll vibrate like crazy
as it does, and then finally

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:07.370
settle down at the
higher frequency.

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:08.780
So you need some damping.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.090
But damping does degrade the
steady state performance.

01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:14.050
And I'm out of time.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:15.925
And we'll see you in recitation.

01:20:15.925 --> 01:20:17.500
Thanks.
