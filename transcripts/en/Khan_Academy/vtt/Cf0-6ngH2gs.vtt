00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.885
- Let's say we are dealing with

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:05.354
a geometric series.

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:08.047
There are some things that we know about

00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:10.439
this geometric series.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.453
For example, we know that the first term

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:15.867
of our geometric series is a.

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.433
That is a first term.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.724
We also know the common ratio
of our geometric series.

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:25.292
We're gonna call that r.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:29.368
This is the common ratio.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:34.199
We also know that it's a
finite geometric series.

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.946
It has a finite number of terms.

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:44.946
Let's say that n is equal
to the number of terms.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:52.198
We're going to use a notation S sub n

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:57.264
to denote the sum of first.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.240
n terms.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.003
The goal of this whole video
is using this information,

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.185
coming up with a general
formula for the sum

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:09.885
of the first n terms.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.999
A formula for evaluating
a geometric series.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.231
Let's write out S sub n.

00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:17.509
Just get a feeling for
what it would look like.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.765
S sub n is going to be equal to,

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:21.417
you'll have your first term here,

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.514
which is an a and then what's

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:25.233
our second term going to be?

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.273
This is a geometric series so it's

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:30.786
going to be a times the common ratio.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.530
It's going to be the first
term times the common ratio.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.018
The first term times r.

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:39.298
Now, what's the third term going to be?

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.438
Well, it's going to be
the second term times

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:42.559
our common ratio again.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.562
It's going to be ar times r or ar squared.

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:50.490
We could go all the way to our nth term.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.794
We're gonna go all the way

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:55.255
to the nth term and you might be

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:59.575
tempted to say it's going to
be a times r to the nth power

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:01.843
but we have to be careful here.

00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:03.945
Because notice, our first term is really

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:05.577
ar to the zeroth power,

00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:07.527
second term is ar to the firsth power,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.895
third term is ar to the second power.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.291
So whatever term we're on the exponent

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.727
is that term number minus one.

00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:17.171
If we're on the nth term it's going to be

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.634
ar to the n minus oneth power.

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:23.336
We want to come up with
a nice clean formula

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.922
for evaluating this and we're gonna use

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:27.432
a little trick to do it.

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:31.958
To do it we're gonna think
about what r times the sum is.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.081
We're gonna subtract that out.

00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.215
We're gonna take the r times that sum,

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:39.486
r times

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:42.838
the sum of the first nth terms.

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:45.534
Actually, let's just multiply negative r.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.102
Something that we can
just add these two things

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:50.633
and you'll see that it
cleans this thing up nicely.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.816
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:54.902
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:57.222
well if you multiply

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.268
a times negative r,

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:05.533
we will get negative ar.

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:07.925
I'm just gonna write it
right underneath this one.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.795
So if you multiply this times negative r.

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.550
I'm just gonna multiply everyone of these

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.676
terms by negative r.

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:13.804
That's the equivalent of multiplying

00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:15.011
negative times the sum.

00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.015
I'm distributing the negative r.

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.962
If I multiply it times this
term, a times negative r,

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:26.508
that's going to be negative ar.

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:30.366
Then, if I multiply ar times negative r

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:33.136
that's going to be negative ar squared.

00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:37.493
You might see where this is going.

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.484
And just to be clear what's going on,

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:42.965
that's that term times negative r.

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.998
This is that term times negative r.

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:50.831
And we would keep going all the way

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.555
to the term

00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:59.053
before this times negative r.

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:03.028
So the term before this times
negative r is going to be,

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.183
let me put subtraction signs,

00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:11.125
it's going to be negative a

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:15.646
times r to the n minus one power.

00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:19.542
That was the term right before this.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:22.861
That was a times r to the n
minus two times negative r

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.045
is gonna give us this.

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:25.523
It's gonna get us right over there

00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:27.659
and then finally we take this last term

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.076
and you multiply it by negative r,

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.087
what do you get?

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.341
You get,

00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:32.758
negative a

00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:37.721
times r to the n.

00:04:40.664 --> 00:04:41.882
You multiply this times the negative,

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:43.344
you get the negative a and then

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:45.715
r to the n minus one times r,

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:47.139
or times r to the first,

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.089
well this is going to be r to the n.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:50.946
Now what's interesting here is we can

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:54.475
add up the left side and we can
add up the right hand sides.

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:55.584
Let's do that.

00:04:57.373 --> 00:04:59.980
On the left hand side we get,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.087
S sub n minus r

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.535
times S sub n

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:10.181
and on the right hand side

00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.261
we have something very cool happening.

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.252
Notice, this a, we still have that.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:17.805
The a sits there but everything else,

00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:18.944
except for this last thing,

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:21.344
is going to cancel out.

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:25.503
These two are gonna cancel out.

00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:29.906
These two are gonna cancel out.

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.524
All we're gonna have left with is

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.742
negative ar to the n.

00:05:33.742 --> 00:05:37.106
It's going to be a minus a

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:40.751
times r to the nth power.

00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.040
Now we can just solve for S sub n

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.914
and we have our formula,
what we were looking for.

00:05:45.914 --> 00:05:47.879
Let's see, we can factor out an S sub n

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.432
on the left hand side.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:53.741
You get an S sub n, the
sub of our first n terms.

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.016
You factor that out,

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:56.677
it's gonna be times

00:05:57.787 --> 00:06:01.338
one minus r is going to be equal to

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:02.686
and on the right hand side we can

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:04.541
actually factor out an a.

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:08.015
It's going to be a times

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:11.732
one minus r to the n.

00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:14.399
To solve for S sub n, the
sum of our first n terms,

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.372
we deserve a little bit
of a drum roll here,

00:06:16.372 --> 00:06:18.184
S sub n is going to be equal to

00:06:18.184 --> 00:06:21.085
this divided by one minus r.

00:06:21.085 --> 00:06:25.324
It's going to be a times

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:28.930
one minus r to the n

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.690
over one minus r.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.501
And we're done.

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:37.141
We have figured out
our formula for the sum

00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:40.155
or for the sum of a finite

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:43.666
geometric series.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.229
In the next few videos or in future videos

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.756
we will apply this and I encourage you,

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:49.776
whenever you use this
formula it's very important,

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.298
now that you know where it came from,

00:06:51.298 --> 00:06:53.054
that you really keep
close track of how many

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:54.751
terms you are actually summing up.

00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:57.078
Sometimes you might have a sigma notation

00:06:57.078 --> 00:06:59.583
and it might start it's index at zero

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:00.698
and then goes up to a number,

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:01.568
in which case you're gonna have that

00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:02.952
number plus one term.

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:03.742
So you're going to have
to be very careful.

00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:05.345
This is the number of terms.

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:06.784
This is the first term here,

00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:07.876
we define it up here.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:11.057
N is the number of
terms, the first n terms,

00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:13.123
r is our common ratio.
