00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.190
So, we're back. What's the answer Micheal? How many rows do we have?

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.350
&gt;&gt; So if it was just one variable we're splitting on, then

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.039
it need to be true or false, so, that's two rows. If it

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.650
was two variables, then there's four combinations and three, would be eight,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.700
combinations. So, generalizing the end, it ought to be 2 to the n.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.480
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, there are 2 to the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.230
n different rows. And, that's what always happen when

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.350
we're dealing with n, you know, n attributes, n

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.170
boolean attributes. There's always 2 to the n possibility.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.980
Okay, so I get just halfway there and I get to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.720
your point about, combinatorial choices, among

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.760
the attributes. But ,that's only the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.130
number of rows that we have. There's another question ,we need

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.300
to ask which is, exactly how big is the truth table itself?
