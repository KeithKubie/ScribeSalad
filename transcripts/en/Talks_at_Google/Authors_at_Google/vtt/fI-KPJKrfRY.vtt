00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.900
NAVI RADJOU: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.730
It's a great pleasure
for me to be here

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.960
with you to talk about frugal
innovation, which is also

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.730
the topic of my new book that
just got published by Economist

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.580
a few weeks ago.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.100
So I thought it's
better to begin

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.360
with some kind of background
on what is this concept called

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.460
frugal innovation and trace
its origins a little bit, which

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.960
in a way connects to my own
professional development.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.910
I've been a
management consultant

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.030
to companies in the US and
Europe for about 15 years,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.730
and about 10 years
ago, we began to hear

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.440
some interesting comments from
senior executives in companies

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.130
that we consulted.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.880
They began to note a couple
of things about the innovation

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.540
model.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.840
The first one is that
innovation is becoming

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120
more and more expensive.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750
As you may know, it
costs a lot of R&amp;D money

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.480
to do innovation to the point
where last year alone, PwC

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.940
estimates that large
companies in the world

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.120
spent about $647 billion in
R&amp;D. So the first thing is

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.180
it costs more money to do
R&amp;D. That's the first thing.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.890
The second issue is that R&amp;D
is also becoming more resource

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.550
intensive.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.350
If you look at areas like
apparel industry, electronics,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.930
it takes a lot of natural
resources to make these items.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.750
For example, it's nice to have
the latest fashionable jeans,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.180
but it cost about
10,000 liters of water

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.630
to produce one pair of jeans.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.810
Or you take Kingfisher,
which is Europe's largest

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.800
home improvement retailer.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.140
They consume the food which is
the equivalent of a mini forest

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.280
the size of
Switzerland every year.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.390
So clearly, natural resources
are required as well

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.914
to come up with the latest
and fanciest products as well,

00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:51.330
and we know that
natural resources

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.480
are dwindling as well.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.680
The third factor is that
most companies are telling us

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.580
that actually,
they're having trouble

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.079
not just inventing ideas, but
actually commercializing them.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.120
And one of the reasons is
because these companies

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.490
are stuck in very rigid
processes that prevent them

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.449
from innovating
very, very quickly.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.750
And this is a nice quote
from Beth Comstock,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.390
the CMO of General
Electric, who says

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.350
"We're not innovating
fast enough,"

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.350
and "We need to
systematize change."

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.930
So there's a need
for speed as well,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.790
which is increasing
in large companies.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.010
And then the next
important phenomenon

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.275
that we don't talk about is that
latest and fanciest innovation

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.706
is great, but the real
question is, is it

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:34.430
really what we call
trickle down so that it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.080
benefits the entire society?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.445
Not really sure.

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.330
Take financial
services sector that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.900
invests in amazing
technologies every year

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.530
in terms of mobile
tools, et cetera,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.980
but the fact is that 68 million
Americans, just about one fifth

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.850
of the US population
today, is under-banked.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.980
They don't have access
to the full gamut

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.060
of financial services we take
for granted like debit card,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.380
credit card, or
a saving account.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.474
So clearly, there is some
problem with innovation

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:02.890
because on one
hand, it's becoming

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.140
costlier, more
resource intensive,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.540
and yet it's not
benefiting everyone.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.430
So we told ourselves,
we need to look

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.570
for a new model of innovation
somewhere in the world that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.020
will be less costly, more
eco-friendly, more flexible,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.774
and then more inclusive.

00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:22.190
So we told ourselves,
where can we

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.410
look and find this new model?

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.750
Well, we said, let's go to these
emerging markets like India,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.430
China, Africa, and
Brazil because they're

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.480
growing very quickly.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.020
As you can see, over
the last 10 years,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.720
they're outpacing
the Western world

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.346
in terms of economic growth.

00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:37.970
So when we went to
the emerging markets

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.060
and we began to look at how
innovators, entrepreneurs

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.525
actually innovate, we
discovered that they

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:45.460
have a very unique mindset.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.740
Let me give you one example
of such an entrepreneur.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.070
Mansukhbhai Prajapati
is a porter by training

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.950
who actually invented the
world's greenest fridge.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.600
It's called MittiCool.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.510
It consumes no electricity,
it is made entirely of clay,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.820
and can consume food and
vegetables for about five days.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.160
And this is a boon for
a country like India,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.264
where 700 million people
live off direct city grid.

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:12.555
So the first thing we noticed
among these entrepreneurs

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:16.550
in emerging markets is that
they had this amazing ability

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.120
to turn constraints
into an opportunity,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.410
in particular
resource constraints.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.040
Let's look at another example of
an innovation that illustrates

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.980
this kind of resilient mindset.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.760
This is in Peru, a country
that has a 95% humidity rate

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.295
and only receives one inch
of rainfall every year.

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:40.710
A local engineering college
invented this giant advertising

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.220
billboard that absorbs
humidity in the air,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.420
condenses it, purifies it,
and then generates over

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.970
90 liters of drinkable
water every day.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.620
So they take what is
abundant, humidity,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.160
to address what is scarce,
which is lack of water.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.960
And now what we begin
to see is that you

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.475
have amazing innovators
in emerging markets who

00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:04.050
are using this kind
of frugal ingenuity

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.040
to begin to deliver services
on a larger scale in areas

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.420
like health care, education,
energy, for example,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.325
and finance in emerging markets.

00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:13.450
So this is Dr. Devi Shetty.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.290
He's a cardiologist who was
the personal surgeon of Mother

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.260
Teresa and today operates
a giant health city

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.990
in southern India where
he can perform a heart

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.120
surgery for $3,000, whereas in
the US, it costs about $50,000.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.960
And it doesn't do
that as a charity.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.280
That means everybody pays.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.060
Even the poorest people
can avail the service,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.434
except they pay using
a micro payment model.

00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:41.600
So this is not philanthropy.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.340
This is a for-profit model
that is also inclusive.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.460
And then the biggest
continent in the world

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.110
that is going to teach
us a lot about this kind

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.434
of frugal innovation is Africa.

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.725
It's a country where we have
two interesting phenomena,

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:59.410
and I think many of you I
heard are mobile experts,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.920
so you like statistics.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.130
80% of Africa is under banked.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.380
They don't have bank accounts.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.170
They don't have
access to electricity.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.470
They don't have access to
many services or bank account,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.250
of course, but 80% of
Africans have a mobile phone.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.250
So what you begin to see is that
mobile connectivity is becoming

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.970
the foundation for delivering
all kinds of services

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.580
that we have in the
West, whether it's

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.940
banking services, energy,
education, health care,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.780
you name it.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.870
So this is M-Pesa-- you might
have heard about it-- in Kenya,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.790
which is a mobile
service that enables half

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.400
the population to send, receive
money using their mobile phone

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.695
without having a bank account.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.730
50% of the country's GDP is
transacted with the service.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.530
So what happens is that
like a mobile iPhone--

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.360
I'm sorry, Android, whatever you
want to use, again, a platform.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.600
Once you have a platform
like Android, iPhone,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.230
then you can start plugging
apps on top of that.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.030
So now what's happening is
that this telephony platform

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.940
is enabling Kenyans
and the rest of Africa

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.110
to avail other
kinds of services,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.580
not just products that we take
for granted, but basic services

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.540
like solar energy.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.750
Now they can buy this
kit for a few dollars.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.040
It's called M-KOPA.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.170
It's a home solar system, and
this allows them essentially

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.380
to get solar energy on
a pay as you go basis.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.272
So they just make a
micro payment daily,

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:22.980
and as long as they
make a micro payment,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.854
they can have access
to the system.

00:07:24.854 --> 00:07:26.270
And you might have
heard yesterday

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.540
that in Tanzania, the
government decided

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.200
to leapfrog from
candlelight, which

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.052
is the main source of
energy, to solar light

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:35.510
by installing this
kind of solution

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.854
into one million houses in 2017.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:40.520
So what Africa is
teaching us is they're

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.470
going to leapfrog directly
from traditional banking

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.170
to mobile banking, from
candlelight to solar light,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.920
using, among other things,
mobile connectivity.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.980
So we wrote our first
book on this concept

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.132
of frugal innovation
or frugal science

00:07:56.132 --> 00:07:58.340
because we noticed that even
in the scientific world,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.040
this kind of frugality
can be useful.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.210
As a case in point, this is
a spatial mission launched

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.180
by NASA called Maven for Mars,
and this satellite actually

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.170
entered Mars's orbit on the
22nd of September last year.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.720
Two days later, India's
own space mission

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.190
was completed when Mangalyaan,
their own satellite,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.180
entered Mars's orbit.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.970
The difference is
that they carried out

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.740
this project 10 times
cheaper than NASA

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.787
and three times faster
by essentially doing

00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:35.620
a lot more software
simulation, for example,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.539
instead of making
physical prototypes

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.924
and things like that.

00:08:38.924 --> 00:08:40.299
So this is called
frugal science.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.520
It's basically a
cost effective way

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.170
of conducting scientific
experiments and space

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.190
exploration as well.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.680
So we actually
wrote a book on it

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.109
about two years ago called
"Jugaad Innovation."

00:08:51.109 --> 00:08:52.150
"Jugaad" is a Hindi word.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.335
It means an
improvised fix, a kind

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:58.580
of MacGyver spirit of innovating
with limited resources.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.240
And then after that, we began
to notice that actually,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.680
wait a second, this kind
of frugal innovation

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.540
becomes more and more relevant
in the Western world as well.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.400
Why is that?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.890
Because first of all, since
the economic recession

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.640
began in 2008, we begin to
see more frugal behavior

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.070
among consumers in
the US and Europe.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.620
Today, the top 10% richest
Americans account for about 60%

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.100
consumer spending in America.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.140
Wages are stagnating, and
that means that middle class

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.730
Americans and
Europeans are looking

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.650
for more value with the limited
money they're willing to spend.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.920
So as a result, we begin to see
some what we call permanently

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.900
value conscious behavior,
like people seeking discounts

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.490
more and more, or people looking
for private labels instead

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.000
of brands.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.790
And then more importantly,
there's a frugal lifestyle

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.410
that people are
choosing by saying

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.590
I want to live with
less, not because I'm

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.295
constrained to do it, because
I want to do that way.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.670
So this is the first thing is
that consumers are becoming

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.160
more value conscious, but
the real more important trend

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.090
is that consumers are becoming
values conscious as well.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.310
This is a global
study done by Nielsen

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.270
that shows that 55%
of consumers are

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.910
willing to pay even extra money
for brands from companies that

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.330
are socially and
environmentally responsible,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.890
and two thirds of
people around the world

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.210
want to work for
companies that actually

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.495
are socially and environmentally
responsible as well.

00:10:23.495 --> 00:10:24.870
So it means that
they're not just

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.640
seeking more value
for money, but they're

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.230
looking for more values
as well from brands.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.360
So as a result, we
might say, well,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.155
what does it mean
for big companies?

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:38.260
Well, we'll come to that in a
moment, but what is exciting

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.650
is that this is leading
actually consumers to turn

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.480
to what we call prosumers.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.500
It's basically a play on words
between producer and consumer.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.280
That means that they're
not passive users

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.580
of goods and services.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.730
They become active producers
of goods and services or value

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.910
creators themselves.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.090
And this is actually enabled
by sharing goods and services

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.310
among consumers themselves,
which is the sharing economy,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.910
and sometimes consumers making
their own products, which

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.230
is the maker movement
we'll talk about as well.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.180
And overall, these are becoming
the two pillars of what

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.480
I call the frugal economy.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.870
A frugal economy
is, in a nutshell,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.140
an economy where supply
can meet demand in a cost

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.566
effective, environmentally
friendly way.

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.190
So this is actually
enabled, as I said,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.310
by the sharing economy, which
is the first pillar of this.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.080
And this is something, as
you know, it's about Airbnb,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.080
it's about car sharing, and
this is actually exploding.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.440
As a matter of fact, this
is the most recent study

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.170
that has been published by PwC
that shows that the sharing

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.370
economy on the B2C side is
going to explode from about $13

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.920
or $15 billion today to
$335 billion dollars,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.100
20 times higher,
in about 10 years.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.680
Now, this is just the tip
of the iceberg, folks.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.360
This is the B2C side
of sharing, and we'll

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.690
talk about later what
happens if you transpose

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.900
this model of sharing goods
and services and assets

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.530
to the corporate
world in the B2B side,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.490
and that's where it's going to
get even bigger than this one.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.949
So that's the first
trend, the fact

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:09.573
that the sharing
economy is taking off,

00:12:09.573 --> 00:12:12.090
and it's taking off very,
very quickly because of one

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.150
important factor, is that
this is an economy which

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.110
doesn't require fixed assets.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.330
Take an example in the
hospitality industry.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.640
Today, Airbnb has become
the fifth largest hotel

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.979
chain in the world without
owning a single hotel.

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.020
So in the balance sheet,
there's no fixed assets.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.520
Not only that, they can
keep expanding very quickly.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.000
The scaling up is very seamless.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.950
So this is Brian Chesky, the
CEO who says provocatively

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.843
that Marriott is planning
to add 30,000 rooms in 2014.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:43.330
We will do that in two weeks.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.720
So it's a rapid
scale up as well,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.270
which makes it very threatening
for established companies.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.940
So this is on the
sharing economy.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.064
The second movement, of
course, you know very well,

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:55.900
is the maker movement, which
allows everyday citizens

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.140
to essentially come up with
their own technical devices

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.680
or technology devices.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.360
They make something
in their garage

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.440
or in their kitchen
table, and there

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.860
was no venue where they
could actually showcase

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.440
their MacGyver inventions.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.850
And that's where the Maker
Faire began, as you know,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.470
in San Mateo where I
live on the left side,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.130
and then eventually
is now popping up

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.870
in every city around the world.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.060
Every mayor of every city
wants to host this now.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.106
It took place in Rome
two years ago, in Paris,

00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:24.730
and I think it's
popping up everywhere.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.500
People call this the
TEDx for tinkerers.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.440
TED is for thinkers, Maker
Faire is for tinkerers.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.670
And to the point where this
is becoming so strategic

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.800
is because you begin to see
some of the building blocks

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.330
that are powering
this maker revolution,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.940
and this is the open
source hardware movement.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.620
Whether it's the Raspberry Pi
that you know very well, which

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.780
is a $30 personal computer
the size of a credit card

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.510
invented by Cambridge
University, which

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.550
is revolutionizing
computing, and this is today

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.390
downloaded over
five million units

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.605
have been sold
already, making it

00:14:00.605 --> 00:14:02.730
the fastest selling personal
computer in the world.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.176
On the right hand side is a
single board microcontroller,

00:14:06.176 --> 00:14:08.770
Arduino, also an
open source hardware,

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.440
which allows you
to create devices

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.400
that can control and interact
with the physical environment

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.740
using sensors and actuators.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.890
Over one million
units sold already.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.340
So these are becoming
essentially the building blocks

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.800
of the maker revolution, and to
the point where President Obama

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:33.470
actually even hosted an event
at the White House in June

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.670
last year, which was the first
Maker Faire at the White House.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.110
And he said very interestingly
that today's DIY,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.229
do it yourself, is
tomorrow's made in America.

00:14:44.229 --> 00:14:45.770
So in other words,
the maker movement

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.260
is assuming more
and more strategic

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.540
relevance as well
because-- and I apologize,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.551
I'm going to go back to the
previous slide, this one.

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:54.050
Why?

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.840
Because now, you begin to have
amazing platforms where people

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.280
can go and come up with not
just some small inventions

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.740
for personal purpose, but
they could actually start

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.240
making companies out of this.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.780
And this is places like
tech shops or fab labs

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.090
that are opening up in major
cities around the world,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.560
but people have access
now to cutting edge

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.696
industrial tooling equipment
and things like 3D printers.

00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:19.070
Of course, in
these pictures, you

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.010
might say, well, we see some
people tinkering and coming up

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.850
with some interesting solutions
for their personal use,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.270
but you can actually start
disrupting industries

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.730
from this platform.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.930
This is what
happened with Square,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.490
which is turning now
every mobile phone

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.530
into a mobile payment device.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.925
And this actually was
prototyped and invented

00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:43.900
in a tech shop in San
Mateo in the west coast,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.600
and today, it transacts over
$30 billion in payments.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.120
So this is the point, is
that the cost of innovation

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.980
is going down.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.970
That means the barriers to
entry are lowering as well.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.860
And this is why, as I
said, President Obama

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.820
highlighted this as being
very, very important.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.590
He even has a senior adviser
now in the White House

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.030
to advise him how the
maker movement can

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.920
become a very important
economic force in coming years.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.910
So interestingly,
I was the adviser

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.870
on a documentary film called
"The Maker" that I recommend

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.850
you to see, which
actually documents

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.860
exactly how this maker
movement is revolutionizing

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.710
the society and the economy
in the Western world.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.950
And I have to say,
interestingly, I

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.680
assisted in the premiere
of it in the Mountain View

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.750
headquarters a
couple of months ago,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.260
and I had the
pleasure to even visit

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.927
your maker space in Mountain
View called The Garage.

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:37.760
I don't know if you
have one here in London,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.250
but this would be
interesting to think about as

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.030
well, how to create a maker
space as well across Google

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.110
campuses to promote the
spirit of making as well.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.230
So what I want to transition
now is to show, actually,

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.750
how some entrepreneurs are
using this frugal innovation

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.110
mindset to create
solutions that are not just

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.030
fun or interesting and sexy, but
actually to solve real problems

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.770
in health care, education,
finance, farming, et cetera.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.640
So let me give three examples
that will really fascinate you,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.290
and many of them are
in the books as well.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.609
The first one is in
the health care sector.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.619
It's called CellScope.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.760
They are a Berkeley spin off.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.630
They make an optical
attachment that you

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.280
attach to your smartphone,
and it converts it

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.300
into an otoscope.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.910
So a mother can insert
it in a daughter's ear

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.860
and see if there's
an ear infection.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.320
It just has to send the
video-- it's a short video

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.350
image-- to a doctor, and
then within two hours,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.560
the doctor can
send the diagnostic

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.140
if it's a problem or no problem,
and if it's a problem, what's

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.379
the prescription?

00:17:44.379 --> 00:17:46.545
Down the road, they can
also replace this attachment

00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:48.470
with another attachment
that can convert

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.140
this device into a dermascope
so you can check your skin

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.490
condition at home.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.960
This is called the
consumerization

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.790
of health care, which is more
and more technology tools using

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.890
mobile platforms are being
given to the consumers

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.470
so they can take care of health
themselves in a primitive way.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.720
This is the first
revolution you begin to see,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.730
which is essentially what
I call hardware startups.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.880
In Silicon Valley, primarily,
you have software startups,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.530
but you see a plethora of
hardware startups coming up

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.049
as well.

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:16.590
So this is in the
health care sector.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.280
If you move on to the farming
sector, this is my neighbor,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.120
and I have a product
with me, actually.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.910
I will check it.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.500
It's called gThrive,
very fascinating.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.660
As a background, California
is the fifth largest producer

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.300
of food in the
world, but we have

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.787
a huge problem is that
water is becoming scarce.

00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:35.245
And very soon,
within two years, we

00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:37.161
are going to have a huge
problem in California

00:18:37.161 --> 00:18:38.410
with water shortage.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.640
So farmers in California
have a challenge,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.780
which is to do more with less.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.340
So my neighbor has launched
a startup called gThrive.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.870
So these are wireless sensors
designed like a plastic ruler,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.270
and you just essentially
stick in different parts

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.460
of your farming
field, and you start

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.150
collecting detailed information
on the soil conditions

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.340
and ambient environment like
temperature and luminosity,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.190
et cetera.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.880
And it allows,
essentially, farmers

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:13.020
to optimize the use of water,
energy, and labor, while also

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.610
increasing their production
and the quality of the crops

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.560
as well, the yields.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.459
And the solution pays for
itself within 9 to 11 months.

00:19:23.459 --> 00:19:24.625
It's very, very interesting.

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:27.092
You can maybe take a look at it.

00:19:27.092 --> 00:19:28.050
So this is what I mean.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.130
It's also interesting because
the first prototypes they built

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.180
used Arduino chips.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.440
That means that the
cost of innovation

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.090
was quite low at the
beginning for them to get it.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.030
So this is for me the
more exciting kind

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.270
of innovation of the
future, these hardware

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.540
startups revolutionizing
our health care or farming.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.590
There's one more sector
I want to touch upon

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.260
as well, which is directly
core to your sector as well.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.520
This is a French
entrepreneur called

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.810
Paul Benoit who has launched
an amazing startup called

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.830
Qarnot Computing, which
makes digital radiators.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.500
So they have processors
inside that actually

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.100
use the heat generated
by these processors

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:14.550
is harvested to then
heat houses and offices.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.730
So this is an
amazing alternative

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.150
to data centers, which we know
are very energy intensive.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.220
And today, data centers consume
2% of the world's energy

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.760
consumption, and 50% of the
energy utilization in data

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.540
centers is to cool off the
servers because engineers

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.920
think that heat is a waste
we have to get rid of.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.150
So this engineer, Paul Benoit,
says no, actually, it's

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.690
not a waste.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.760
Waste can be valorized.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.230
We can reuse the waste
to do something else.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.990
So essentially, it's a
distributed computing model,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.440
an alternative to
centralized data centers.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.019
And it turns out.

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:53.810
I was very excited.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.950
Just before I left
my hotel room,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.610
this press release
just came out.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.480
BNP Paribas, which is one of
the world's leading banks,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.350
just teamed up with a
startup to actually take

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.740
5% of their risk
management computing

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.630
and transfer it
from data centers

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.350
to their distributed farm.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.900
So this is also, you can
call it frugal computing,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.800
which is also an
eco friendly way

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.730
as well of powering the system.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.250
So now I want to
transition and wrap up

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.370
with the most
important part, which

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.170
is how can traditional
companies essentially learn

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.080
to do more with less, in light
of the fact that consumers

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.790
are becoming more
value conscious,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.110
and values conscious as well?

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.890
We have these
entrepreneurs trying

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.230
to disrupt their
industries as well.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.300
So this is where
the answer to that

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.900
is essentially to learn
to innovate differently.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.340
First of all, to innovate
in a more frugal way,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.430
that means with fewer resources.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.150
Secondly, make sure
that they come up

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.090
with affordable and
sustainable products

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.080
to deliver better value
to consumers as well.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.220
In other words, do more
and better with less,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.970
and that's what we
call frugal innovation.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.110
In a nutshell, frugal
innovation is about-- and many

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.290
of you being engineers,
I would be not credible

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.700
if I don't have a formula
somewhere in the slides.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.230
So essentially, it's about
maximizing value while trying

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.560
to minimize resources.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.020
So it's doing that
simultaneously, if you like.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.190
So the question
is value for whom?

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.700
Essentially, value for,
of course, shareholders--

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.230
we know that-- but
also for consumers,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.840
and more importantly,
to society at large.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.607
And secondly, it's about
minimizing resources.

00:22:28.607 --> 00:22:30.690
Again, what kind of resource
we are talking about?

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.730
Well, naturally, financial
resources, but also

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.180
natural resources and
time, because time

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.020
is the scarcest
and most valuable

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.266
resource in our business world.

00:22:42.266 --> 00:22:43.640
So essentially,
it's about trying

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.750
to do more with less
or better with less.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.490
So in our book, actually,
that you will get a copy here,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.270
we actually have
identified six principles

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.340
that companies can implement
to actually change everything

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.980
they do in the company, from
R&amp;D to manufacturing, sales,

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.730
and marketing in order
to embed this frugality

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.440
to the day to day activities.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.040
I will not bore you with the
details of these six principles

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.748
that you can learn
from reading the book,

00:23:06.748 --> 00:23:09.030
but I want to maybe
synthesize all six

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.885
in the form of four best
practices or four key takeaways

00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:15.160
that I found that would be
quite interesting for you

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.540
to remember.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.350
The first one is about
developing products

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.180
that embed four key
qualities or attributes.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.010
The first one is
affordability, as I

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.370
said, because consumers
are value conscious,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.000
but it's not about low cost.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.990
Frugal solution is not low cost.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.310
It's about making
something more affordable

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.110
but also three other attributes.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.541
Make it simpler to use.

00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.040
And I always say--
I'm not saying it

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.630
because I'm at
Google-- but the idea

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.570
is that Marissa Mayer said
very nicely in this quote

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.310
in the first book.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.326
The user interface of Google is
that when you enter google.com,

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.940
it's very simple,
but behind, you

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.470
have billions of
algorithms working.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.220
So the difference
is, as she says,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.990
it's like a Swiss army knife
with all the tools folded

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.720
with a Swiss army knife
with all the tools exposed,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.560
which is quite scary.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.350
So this is called
simplexity, which

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.050
is you can have simplicity
from a user perspective,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.140
but the complexity happens
in the back office.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.830
So that's a way of thinking
about simplicity as well.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.490
And then sustainability
is important as well,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.790
which is a resource intensive
model is not working anymore,

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.690
and then quality.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.820
That's why something
cheap doesn't

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.300
mean it's something shoddy.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.830
It has to be good
quality as well.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.496
So I want to give you
some companies who

00:24:27.496 --> 00:24:30.930
are trying to integrate the four
dimensions to really disrupt

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.940
the sectors.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.150
The first is in the
automobile industry.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.195
This is an example
from Renault-Nissan,

00:24:36.195 --> 00:24:38.885
a Japanese car alliance between
Renault, the French car maker,

00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:41.500
and Nissan, the
Japanese car maker.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.050
In 2005, they launched
the world's cheapest car,

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.050
at least in the Western world,
called the Logan, which I think

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.300
may be sold here under
the name of Dacia, which

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.570
has now become the entry level
product for the Renault brand.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.090
What is amazing is that
initially, this product

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.040
was designed for
emerging markets,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.210
and it gained a lot of
traction in the Western world

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.947
as well, especially
in Western Europe.

00:25:03.947 --> 00:25:06.030
After the economic recession,
more and more people

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:10.620
now flocked to dealerships
to buy these entry level cars

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.180
to the point where the sales
as part of the total sales

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.150
revenues of the company
was less than 1% in 2005.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.900
Today, that counts for
over 40% of the company's

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.882
total revenues.

00:25:22.882 --> 00:25:25.670
It has become the cash
cow for this company,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.670
and Dacia is the fastest
growing brand in Germany,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.610
the country of BMW.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.320
As a matter of fact, Volkswagen
has announced their own plan

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.746
to make their own low cost
cars to compete with Renault.

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:41.370
And they're not
stopping here, Renault.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.090
Now they're writing
the next chapter

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.260
in the frugal innovation
journey, which is going

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.600
to be unveiled in May in India.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.756
This is called CMF-A, which
is a new car platform which

00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.380
is being developed in India that
will be shared between Renault

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.295
and Nissan that will enable
them jointly to produce

00:25:56.295 --> 00:26:00.280
a next generation car that will
be even more affordable, even

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.180
more comfortable than what they
have had in the past in India.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.030
And initially, they will be
commercialized in the south.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.632
That means India, Africa,
and South America, and down

00:26:09.632 --> 00:26:11.340
the road, it might
even be commercialized

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.850
in the Western world.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.280
So this is an example of
combining good enough quality,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.130
as I call it, within
affordability and simplicity

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.889
as well.

00:26:21.889 --> 00:26:23.430
Of course, when I
say frugal product,

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.730
I talked about not just
being affordable but also

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.810
being sustainable, that is,
using fewer natural resources.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.660
And here, Kingfisher,
headquartered

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.730
in the UK, which is Europe's
largest home improvement

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.510
retailer, they are
pioneering something

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.035
called the circle economy,
which is a movement launched

00:26:40.035 --> 00:26:43.360
in the United Kingdom by
Dame Ellen MacArthur, which

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.760
is essentially
designing products

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.940
in an eco friendly way.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.460
So first, in their case, all the
products over the next 10 years

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.020
will use only recycled
materials or materials

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.936
that can be easily renewed.

00:26:55.936 --> 00:26:57.560
And then, at the end
of the life cycle,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.240
every product can
be disassembled

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.990
and the raw materials
can be reused

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.800
to make new products
in a continuous loop,

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.290
so nothing goes to landfill.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.720
This is called closed loop
innovation, as they call it.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.275
So they want to apply these
principles of eco design

00:27:12.275 --> 00:27:15.730
to their 40,000 products
in the portfolio, which

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.984
is mind boggling.

00:27:16.984 --> 00:27:18.150
So they're not the only one.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.790
About 100 other companies are
joining this circle economy

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.425
movement to
fundamentally rethink

00:27:22.425 --> 00:27:25.070
how they design,
manufacture, and dispose

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.580
of the products over time.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.760
Then, moving onto the
next principle, which

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.670
is equally interesting,
is to say, well,

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.090
it's nice to have one
or two products that

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.240
are frugal and
sustainable, but how

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.170
do you fundamentally
rethink your whole supply

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.660
chain to make it frugal
so you can reduce

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.080
the gap between
supply and demand,

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.413
as I said at the very beginning?

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:46.020
The definition of
frugal is that you

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.567
reduce the gap in time
and space and resources

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:49.650
between supply and demand.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.500
Well, today, it's not
very easy because look

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.340
at the value chain.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.130
You have people making
products far away

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.840
from where consumers live in
large quantity, mass produced,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.000
ship them over
miles or kilometers

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.410
away from where consumers
live, and then people

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.500
drive to supermarkets
to buy them in bulk.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.990
So the whole model essentially
is very energy intensive

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.040
and generates a lot of waste.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.370
But imagine a new value chain,
where essentially, supply

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.410
meets demand much closer.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.200
Of course, with things like 3D
printers, maybe in 10 years,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.850
we will get to the reality where
we can make our own products,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.200
but meanwhile, we need a
stepping stone to get there.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.170
And this is where, I think,
what Google is doing of course,

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.070
with Project Arrow actually
embodies this spirit because

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.960
in a way, with
the modular phone,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.315
you essentially push the
production capabilities

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:38.720
down to the consumer.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.030
The last mile becomes the
first mile of the value chain.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.140
It's a fundamental revolution.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.210
So as a result,
this modular phone,

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.300
I believe, is going
to revolutionize also

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.120
the value chain in
the tech industry,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.160
in a way, because
essentially, you

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.001
produce much closer
to your customer,

00:28:55.001 --> 00:28:56.750
and it's also more
sustainable because you

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.370
can select to replace only
the components that you

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.000
want to replace.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.936
So now you might say,
well, this is interesting

00:29:03.936 --> 00:29:05.310
because, as you
can see visually,

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.250
a cell phone may have about
50 components or less than 100

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.080
components, but what about
more complex products,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.430
like a car, which has
14,000 components?

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.220
What about drugs, like
process industry, so complex?

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.290
How can you make that
much closer to demand?

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.815
Well, that's coming as well.

00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:23.680
Novartis, one of
the world's leading

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.850
pharmaceutical industry, has
teamed up for the past 10 years

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:32.430
with MIT to pilot, and now
they're rolling out in 2017,

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.890
a new manufacturing technique
called continuous production.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.320
So continuous production
or continuous manufacturing

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.660
is a way of manufacturing
drugs in a micro factory that

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.740
is no bigger than this,
and this micro factory

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.960
can produce drugs in a
continuous mode 10 times

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.030
faster than larger factories
and 50 times cheaper

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.530
and can reduce carbon
emissions by 90%.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.326
And literally, it can
fit in a container

00:29:58.326 --> 00:29:59.950
and can be shipped
to places if there's

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.810
an epidemic or something where
we have to ramp up production

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.700
very quickly.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.350
So even in drug
manufacturing industry,

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.450
we can start bridging the gap
between supply and demand.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.400
And another example
of, I would say,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.850
the second best
practice is to say,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.610
well, it's nice to
reinvent your supply chain,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.570
but can you reinvent your
entire business model

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.240
to make it more frugal?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.640
And here, I think there's
an amazing example, which

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.050
comes from the health
care industry, which

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.630
is pioneered by a health
insurance company called Aetna.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.270
They are a 160-year-old
health insurance company

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.950
and they're completely
disrupting the US health care

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.630
system by shifting to what is
known as a value-based care

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.460
model.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.670
So if you think about
why that's revolutionary,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.315
because today, doctors and
providers, like hospitals,

00:30:44.315 --> 00:30:46.145
are paid on the
number of procedures

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:48.860
they do, like how many
surgeries they perform,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.010
how much medicine
they prescribe you,

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.250
but they don't care whether
you're getting healthy or not.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.620
So the health outcomes
is not dependent on them.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.341
The value-based care says
that we will pay providers--

00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:01.840
like health insurance
companies will

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.480
say-- we will pay you, reimburse
you, only if the patient gets

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.480
better.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.000
So they make them more
accountable and also more

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.990
cost effective in
how they operate.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.140
So to make that reality,
Aetna is actually

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.310
disrupting itself, their
160-year business model,

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.560
to become, as they call it,
the Google of health care,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.310
or the Intel insider
strategy, as they

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.170
call it, which is
essentially to provide

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.590
the kind of technologies
that hospitals

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.050
need to make the transition
to value-based care.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.310
And if they make the
transition, McKinsey

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.900
estimates that
the US health care

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.692
system can save about $1
trillion in the short term

00:31:37.692 --> 00:31:39.150
because it's so
wasteful right now,

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.720
and this model can create more
accountability and more cost

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.040
effectiveness as well.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.470
That's a very
interesting example

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.886
that you'll find
also in the book,

00:31:45.886 --> 00:31:47.930
where we delve into
more details about how

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.600
Aetna is making the shift.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.850
Another very disruptive
business model transition

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.860
is Unilever, which is a large
consumer goods company, which

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.630
is actually moving to a very
eco friendly business model.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.220
Their chairman and
CEO, Paul Polman,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.891
announced in 2010 the intent
to become the world's cleanest

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.390
and most environmentally
sustainable

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.310
company by doubling
revenues by 2020

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.120
while reducing environmental
impact by 50%, which

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.360
is a huge task because they're
going from a 40 billion

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.720
euro company to an 80 billion
euro company, at the same time,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.510
reducing their environmental
footprint by 40%, which

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.030
is a mind boggling initiative.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.580
They're halfway to that
transition process.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.310
And again, this is a case
study from the book as well.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.870
The fourth one I
want to conclude on,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.600
which is my favorite
best practice,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.750
is imagine the sharing
economy, as I said-- Airbnb

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.710
we are sharing apartments.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.870
We are sharing cars--
that's fine, but imagine

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.340
what happens if
companies begin to build

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.170
collaborative ecosystems where
they can start sharing assets

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.239
and resources?

00:32:52.239 --> 00:32:53.780
That may sound a
bit science fiction,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.140
but it's starting to happen.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.270
In Scandinavia, this is
an eco-industrial park,

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.240
Kalundborg in Denmark,
where about 12 companies are

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.340
co-located in a park,
and essentially, they

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.250
exchange their
production waste and they

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.710
share their resources, like
energy and information as well.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.000
And as a result, they
massively reduced

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.770
the use of water, energy,
but also carbon emissions.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.920
And this is called
industrial symbiosis.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.260
That means essentially,
you operate like nature

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.650
in a very symbiotic way.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.830
And this is something we
begin to see more and more.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:32.030
For example, Mars,
the chocolate maker,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.900
they actually share
a distribution truck

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.497
with rivals in Germany.

00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:38.080
So the idea is that
instead of keeping

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.650
the trucks idle for a
couple of hours a day,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.240
why don't we use it to ship
other companies' products?

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.260
So this is the idea
of B2B sharing,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.515
which is going to begin to
disrupt a lot of sectors

00:33:50.515 --> 00:33:51.800
as well.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.990
But the real exciting
part is once you

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.770
begin to share your
employees with others.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.860
What I mean by that is you
begin to get your employees

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.459
to collaborate with other
companies' employees.

00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:03.250
Why do you do that?

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.666
Well, because the
best innovations

00:34:04.666 --> 00:34:07.430
come not by keeping
everybody inside the company,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.219
but actually by cross
fertilizing ideas.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:14.969
So Ford Motor Company has
opened a tech shop in Detroit

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.080
where they allow their
own employees, essentially

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.880
in their spare time,
to go there and mingle

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.949
with employees from
other companies

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.350
to get new ideas on how to come
up with disruptive solutions.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.139
And interestingly--
I didn't plan

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.870
it-- some of their
upcoming mobile solutions,

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.260
with the telematics, are
going to come from this place,

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.270
by the way.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.800
Why?

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.130
Because they're telling to
their mobile developers,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.830
hey, the software
is fine, but you

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.989
need to test it in a real car,
so why don't you come here,

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:47.170
and you can actually prototype
it and test it in a real car

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.134
and get very quick feedback.

00:34:49.134 --> 00:34:52.900
So you can apply lean
startups in the real world.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.719
So what happened is that two
years after they launched this,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:01.240
the number of patentable ideas
within Ford went up by 100%

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.450
without having to invest
more in R&amp;D, which goes back

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.030
to my first slide.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.430
If you want to
innovate more, you

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.880
don't have to invest more in
R&amp;D. You need to give more

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.817
freedom to employees to tinker.

00:35:13.817 --> 00:35:15.900
And this is the model
that's going to be expanded.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.660
BMW, I believe, is opening
their own maker space in Munich.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.150
I believe it's this
month or next month.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.440
So this is exactly the B2B
side of the maker movement,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.970
where essentially, companies
begin to set up their own maker

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.620
space.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.156
You'll find more case studies,
examples in our website,

00:35:34.156 --> 00:35:35.655
frugalinnovationhub.com,
where there

00:35:35.655 --> 00:35:38.760
are gazillions of
video testimonials

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.470
and best practices there.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.670
But at this point, I'm happy
to entertain some questions

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.849
from you as well.

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:46.847
Thank you.

00:35:46.847 --> 00:35:48.843
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:51.564 --> 00:35:52.480
I know it's lunchtime.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.080
It's always hard to-- I offered
you some food for thought,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.560
hopefully.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.940
Yes, please.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.580
AUDIENCE: What do you see
as the main driver for this?

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:09.490
Is this the
[INAUDIBLE] recognition

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.924
of that current model
[INAUDIBLE] resources,

00:36:13.924 --> 00:36:17.350
or is it consumer driven?

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.990
NAVI RADJOU: All three,
which is why it's exciting,

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.240
because check, check, check.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.440
Of course, to be super blatant,
if it's only for the last two

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.520
you said-- save the
planet, who cares?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.050
I mean, it's important, but
for shareholders, it's not.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.130
So this is why it's
disruptive innovation,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.660
because you have to try to
make sure that shareholders

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.960
are happy because whatever
you do has a return for them.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.930
At the same time, it
makes you look good and do

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.820
the right thing for
the society and planet,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.977
and then it's good
for the consumers,

00:36:46.977 --> 00:36:48.810
but you then add a
fourth one, which I think

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:49.893
is very important for you.

00:36:49.893 --> 00:36:51.970
It's the employees,
the future employees.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.000
The reason why
Unilever is doing it,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.220
one of the key corporate
officers driving

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.810
their sustainability
initiative is their chief HR

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.380
officer, human resource
officer, because they say,

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.507
well, the only way we can
attract talent in the future

00:37:07.507 --> 00:37:09.090
is not by giving
them a bigger salary,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.020
but by having a moral purpose.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.020
That's what I said earlier
in the study as well.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.300
So it's essentially a way of
pleasing shareholders, pleasing

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.580
activist investors, pleasing
consumers, and hopefully

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.860
attracting talent
as well, which is

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.070
why also it's not
that easy to do,

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.060
because when you make the
transition in a couple

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.030
of years, you have to reinvent
everything in the company,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.720
so that involves a cost.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.400
That involves a financial
cost, involves human cost.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.450
So initially, you may take a
dip in your sales revenues,

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.120
so you need to have
strong leadership

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.030
to withstand any pressure
you may have from investors,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.440
so that's what
happening with Unilever.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.610
Many of the investors
are criticizing

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.840
that the company is caring
more for the environment

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.890
than shareholders,
but he thinks,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:02.090
Paul Polman, that he's doing the
right thing over the long term.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:04.976
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask you
what stops people [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:11.812
The United States [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:11.812 --> 00:38:13.270
NAVI RADJOU: I
think you will begin

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:18.400
to see that some
industries, what happens

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.820
is that nobody will do it until
one company begins to do it.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.620
So that's why I gave the
example of this bank, which

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.500
is partnering with
Qarnot Computing.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.280
Banking sector is
notorious for it.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.510
The moment one company does
it, everybody else will follow.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.520
So that's why I
always say, I would

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.300
rather try to change one
company in an industry

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.410
than try to change
the whole industry.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.930
So there's going to be the
peer pressure effect that's

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.199
going to kick in very soon.

00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:45.490
So I think, adding to your
gentleman's question, that's

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.710
the fifth factor, is as
others begin to do it,

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.400
I need to get going as well.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.710
So right now, we
did some research.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.410
I would say only 5% of
the largest companies

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.120
in the world are
doing it, but that's

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.222
enough to begin to create
insecurity in other companies

00:39:02.222 --> 00:39:04.430
that say, oh my god, are we
missing out on something?

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.150
We need to get doing it as well.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:13.630
Other thoughts, questions,
comments, reactions,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.836
or anything you want?

00:39:15.836 --> 00:39:16.570
Yes, please.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.100
AUDIENCE: One of
the cited downsides

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.815
of doing manufacturing
in China, for example,

00:39:20.815 --> 00:39:23.985
is that there is a strong
black market of people

00:39:23.985 --> 00:39:26.542
who will copy the process
and [INAUDIBLE] factories

00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:27.504
after hours.

00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:29.820
If you start moving
manufacturing

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.672
closer to the
consumers, is there

00:39:31.672 --> 00:39:35.050
a concern that companies will
only use older manufacturing

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:35.550
processes?

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.950
They won't do the
innovation where

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.350
there are far more people
who can then borrow what

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.710
they see as their processes?

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.830
NAVI RADJOU: I think with the
open source movement, what

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.167
you'll begin to see is that
actually, when you operate--

00:39:50.167 --> 00:39:52.250
I'm going to give you a
very specific example that

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.380
comes to mind.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.200
There is some initiatives
in France right now around

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.320
distributed computing
where actually, they

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.160
believe that by
sharing more knowledge

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.680
and having a
distributed computing

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.710
model for digital manufacturing,
they can accelerate

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.330
the innovation in the
manufacturing process

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.300
because more people
involved means that you

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.050
get more perspective, and
this is the whole open source

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.690
movement.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.280
Actually, collectively,
the whole system

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.240
gets better and more resilient.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.220
And then there's a second
part of the question,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.440
which is important, is that it
also means that a lot of things

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.380
may be open source.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.210
You might say, well, somebody
can grab it and run with it,

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.720
and there's a very
nice statement

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:39.465
by the CEO of NanoSatisfi, which
launches nano satellites using

00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:41.590
Arduino chips, which is a
mind boggling initiative,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.750
by the way.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.510
And he says, look, we use
open source technology,

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.770
and we know that somebody
can take it and run with it

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.780
and build their own
thing, but by the time

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.640
a large company can
take an idea from us

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.280
and actually build a solution,
it will take many years.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.170
By that time, we'll
be light years ahead.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.160
So in other words,
the ethos of startups

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.820
is that they are
much faster, and that

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.630
means when you're
smaller, you're nimbler.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.880
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.510
That also means that by the
time a large company, a Goliath,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.540
tries to steal
something you're doing,

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.000
but because of the bureaucracy,
it will take them so long

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.970
to actually commercialize
it, you'll already

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.650
be multiple versions ahead.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.940
So collectively, it's better
to share than to hoard,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.420
and that's why I say
in the 20th century,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.360
people believed that
knowledge is power.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.860
And today, power is about
sharing and finding knowledge,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.412
and that's why you come
in innocently, by the way.

00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:36.370
I'm just transitioning.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.619
People ask me, what is the
role of Google in the maker

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:40.110
movement, things like that?

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.990
The more you distribute
things, guess what happens.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.580
There's more friction
in the marketplace.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.320
There is more need for
discovery of services.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.760
As long as centralized--
this is an economic theory.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.760
It's called the
theory of costs, which

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.190
is the idea that the reason
you centralize everything

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.409
is that you know exactly
what's happening in the system.

00:41:59.409 --> 00:42:00.700
You have a corporate directory.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.340
You can find names
and everything.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.920
But the moment
you distribute it,

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.700
everything becomes so
distributed that you cannot

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.300
easily find potential partners,
so the search becomes super,

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.360
super, super vital.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.270
So this is where I
get excited for you

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.290
because I think that Google can
play a very interesting role

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.530
by leveraging, I would say, its
core, the real essence of what

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.400
it is, which is search,
and think about how it can

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.300
transpose that in
this model to reduce

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.644
the friction in
this frugal economy.

00:42:29.644 --> 00:42:32.060
If you do that, then the economy
becomes even more robust.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.980
Other thoughts,
reactions, questions?

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.610
I'll give you a free book
if you ask a question.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.610
AUDIENCE: I was interested
in your thoughts

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.450
on the environment when you
talked about Google making

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.936
a positive impact, especially
on the environment.

00:42:50.936 --> 00:42:53.924
A lot of makers, a lot
of production and--

00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:58.270
NAVI RADJOU: It consumes
more resources, right?

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.540
NAVI RADJOU: Yeah.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.460
I had the same thought as you.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.995
In 2006, when I started looking
at it, I first was excited.

00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:09.020
I'm a technologist, so
I thought, that's great.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.561
And then, yes, I
said, wait a second.

00:43:10.561 --> 00:43:13.230
This is actually creating
more waste or something.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.170
And this is the good news.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.900
This is what's going
to happen, next thing.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.400
The first maker movement
was more about, I would say,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.100
having fun, and it was
really about technology

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.701
centric movement.

00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:28.200
But you might see--
and it's already

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.970
happening-- the next wave
is a more sustainable maker

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.840
movement, if I can
call it that way.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.380
So the maker movement
is going to go

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.977
into two dimensions over time.

00:43:36.977 --> 00:43:38.560
The first dimension
is going to become

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.760
what they call social making.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.005
That means before making was
an individual act, the tinkerer

00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:45.750
alone in their garage.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.500
Now it's going to
become collaborative,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.770
so that's the first dimension.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.129
That's why the tech shops
and things like that.

00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.170
That's also where I think--
we can talk offline--

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.461
but where Google can play a
big role, which is building

00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:56.840
the communities around makers.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.150
That's the first dimension.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.750
Second dimension is make
it more sustainable.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.490
So here, what's happening is
that there are companies now

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.740
who are beginning to make
the 3D printers themselves

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.740
using recycled components.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.920
And then what about
the materials you use?

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.020
Well, there's a whole
cottage industry coming up

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.040
to say, well, what if you use
recycled materials to make

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.026
things?

00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:20.400
And then once you
make the stuff,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.540
can you use end of life
cycle these products

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.200
you make and bring
it back in the cycle?

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.280
So every principle I
talked about in the area

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.020
of sustainability, you can
apply that to the maker movement

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.290
as well.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.080
But beyond that, there is
a more convincing argument

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.630
about the making.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.570
So the 3D printers is
the tip of the iceberg,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.730
but underneath, there's
a science behind it,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.230
and this is called
additive manufacturing.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.240
This is a whole new
way of manufacturing

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.600
which the 3D printers
use, which is essentially

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.910
by adding layers and
layers, which is much more

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.240
sustainable than using the
traditional way of making

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.835
things, where you take a
big chunk of wood or plastic

00:44:58.835 --> 00:45:01.370
or metal and you
chop off anything

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.200
you don't need to
get what you want,

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.864
which creates a lot of waste.

00:45:04.864 --> 00:45:06.280
Here, with additive
manufacturing,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.560
you don't create that waste.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.150
Nothing is wasted, essentially,
to the raw materials.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.040
So that's why the science
underneath the maker movement,

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.390
that is the one that is going
to be a value generating

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.700
area for B2B
companies, whether it's

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.880
Google or GE or Siemens or IBM.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.250
That's where people
are going to go after.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.570
And in the process, as
scale kicks in as well,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.359
it will also make it more
sustainable over time.

00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:34.900
That's a very good
question because I

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.510
had the same doubt
for a long time,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.051
but now I'm getting
excited because I

00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:41.330
can see how, with
the social aspect

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:45.920
and the environmental awareness,
this could become actually

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.000
a much more
sustainable alternative

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.860
to traditional
manufacturing over time.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.670
Yes, please.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:53.590
Judy.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.890
AUDIENCE: I'd love to
hear a little bit more

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.575
about the frugal supply chain,
because one example I've seen

00:45:59.575 --> 00:46:02.302
out there, but I haven't seen
it anywhere in the UK or even

00:46:02.302 --> 00:46:05.060
in the US, but it's
almost a machine

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.365
you can go to to get
the book that you want

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:09.185
printed because they
were trying to reduce

00:46:09.185 --> 00:46:13.330
the mass printing of
[INAUDIBLE], which I know

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.250
is not helping you.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.000
NAVI RADJOU: Yeah.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.930
Actually, it does.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:17.430
Trust me.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.330
I will explain why in a moment.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.052
AUDIENCE: So can you talk a
little bit more about examples

00:46:22.052 --> 00:46:25.050
that you're seeing in
this frugal supply chain?

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.730
NAVI RADJOU: So what Judy is
asking is a very profound idea.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:36.910
Essentially, we are going to go
from just in case manufacturing

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.406
model or design principle.

00:46:38.406 --> 00:46:39.780
That means what
happens in design

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.869
is that-- I don't
think Google does that,

00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:44.410
but some of your rivals I know
do that, which is essentially,

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:48.280
just in case design is let's put
all the features in something

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.870
just in case there's a use
case that requires the customer

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.300
to use that feature,
and then you end up

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.570
creating a very bloated system.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.050
As a result, the
supply chain also

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.700
gets bloated because
you have to plan

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.240
for all these raw
materials you need

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.810
to make the product possible.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.650
So the design is where 70%
of the life cycle costs

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.610
are determined.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.730
So the more you make the design
cleaner, simpler, whatever

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:15.731
you want to call it, the more
you can have downstream effect.

00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:18.230
So I'm starting with the answer
because in the supply chain,

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.200
design is the first
stage, in a way.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.830
So I call this just in case
design, which is essentially

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:28.150
that you design just for the
70% needs of the customers,

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.249
and then you
incrementally add things.

00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:33.790
So that directly comes to, let's
say, a sector like printing,

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.640
because one of
the problem I have

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.985
is that it sounds interesting.

00:47:36.985 --> 00:47:40.004
For example, if I want
to update a case study,

00:47:40.004 --> 00:47:41.920
somebody says, hey, there
is a new case study,

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.461
well, I have to wait six months
before the next release comes

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.050
out.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.440
If I go with the just
in time writing model,

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.200
I can create a book
where I only have the six

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.580
principles with some
examples, and then I

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.990
can make it evolutionary.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.740
And then you might
say, well, that's fine,

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.370
but you still have to print it.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.180
So indeed, yes, there's
a big revolution

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.410
coming in the printing
industry, and the same thing

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.610
like Novartis I talked about.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.659
There's two companies
creating now-- I

00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:11.200
don't know if Google
is financing it,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.637
I forgot-- but it's
actually micro printing.

00:48:14.637 --> 00:48:16.470
This is going to be
interesting because this

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:20.150
is going to allow bookshops that
are dying to actually become

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.661
printing houses.

00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:23.160
Why?

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.510
Because statistics show
that 60%, for example,

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.045
of French people have
memoirs they've already

00:48:30.045 --> 00:48:34.210
written sitting in drawers
they haven't printed yet.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:37.150
Now they can just ship the
file to the local bookshop

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.240
and have it printed.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.430
So this is the device that
completely creates high quality

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.390
book like this with a
nice cover, everything,

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.240
in a small batch.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.400
So yes, this is
where we are heading.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.430
It's micro manufacturing.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.370
And GE, for example, is
moving to the next level

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.800
by partnering with a startup
called Local Garages, which

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.339
makes do it yourself cars.

00:49:01.339 --> 00:49:02.880
Essentially, they
are micro factories

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.960
where you can go and
build your own car

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.540
using open source design.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.590
And they partner
with Local Garages

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.750
to create what they
call First Build.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.750
These are micro factories they
want to open around the world

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:20.840
where consumers can come and
co-create kitchen appliances.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.100
So essentially, that's
something that GE,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.970
known for mass
manufacturing, realizes

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.610
that we have to go to the
micro manufacturing model.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.930
This is going to
absolutely revolutionize

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.890
publication
industry, appliances,

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.260
you name it, even drug industry,
as I said, in the future.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:39.169
I think initially, the
motivation will be cost,

00:49:39.169 --> 00:49:40.460
but I think it's not just that.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.543
I think the bigger factor,
and I haven't mentioned

00:49:42.543 --> 00:49:47.200
that explicitly, is a
desire for consumers

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.720
to create themselves things
and have personalized items.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.845
This is called IKEA effect.

00:49:53.845 --> 00:49:57.060
If you Google, you'll find
some TED Talks on that.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.420
70% of consumers
will keep products

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.770
longer if they were involved
in the creation of it.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.750
This is real,
profound values that

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.587
is going to accelerate
the development

00:50:08.587 --> 00:50:09.545
of micro manufacturing.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.980
Other thoughts, questions?

00:50:18.745 --> 00:50:19.715
Sure.

00:50:19.715 --> 00:50:22.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] any
major companies [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:22.625 --> 00:50:23.604
Or is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:24.270
NAVI RADJOU: No.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.640
It's actually a good point.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.560
Actually, far from it.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.220
Everybody's rebelling
against it because you

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.500
can think about how disruptive
it is for some incumbents.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.920
But it's an interesting way
to answer your questions,

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.670
not companies rebelling, but
companies' investors rebelling.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:44.355
Case in point, Aetna, the health
insurance company, their CEO,

00:50:44.355 --> 00:50:46.105
when I interviewed
him, Mark Bertolini, he

00:50:46.105 --> 00:50:48.260
was saying that the
investors are not

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.870
very happy he's making
the shift because they

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:54.540
are sitting on a lot of
cash, double digit margins.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.670
They keep signing more patients
as customers-- life insurance,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:00.740
they're selling.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.320
So why change?

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.706
So he says, well, very
simple, and I'm rephrasing

00:51:04.706 --> 00:51:05.830
what he said from the book.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.626
He says, well,
because if you keep

00:51:07.626 --> 00:51:09.750
running on the track we
are running, in five years,

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.850
there's no more track left.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.520
We might as well
forfeit the race.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.430
So that means that we have to
proactively begin to shift,

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.200
and that's where push back
begins, because whether it's

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.150
senior management in the company
or investors, they're like,

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.180
why do you want to
change the model that

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.100
is working very well?

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.280
So that's why it takes a lot
more guts for senior management

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.660
to say, well, everything's
going well right now,

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.605
but in five years, the drug
industry won't be like this.

00:51:36.605 --> 00:51:39.980
So you have to see something
others don't see and then

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.960
stick to it, and the
next step is to really

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.340
impart that vision to
everybody in the company

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.900
so they believe in what you see
as well, and that takes time.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.760
So the rebellion will
happen within, of course,

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.300
but also from the
investors as well.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.555
But I think that if customers
are going to ask for it

00:51:59.555 --> 00:52:01.680
and you're not going to
attract the right employees

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.980
in the future, I think those
are factors strong enough

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.260
to get any company to change.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.649
At one point, you have
to realize that investors

00:52:11.649 --> 00:52:13.440
are powerful, but
they're not the only ones

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.668
that you listen to.

00:52:15.668 --> 00:52:18.163
AUDIENCE: Why do you
think that attitudes

00:52:18.163 --> 00:52:22.155
about manufacturing [INAUDIBLE]
to decentralize [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:22.155 --> 00:52:24.467
[INAUDIBLE] increase
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:30.551 --> 00:52:32.550
NAVI RADJOU: So additive
manufacturing initially

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.820
will be led by GEs,
Siemens of the world,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.854
building big factories.

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.520
And what they're
looking at essentially,

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.760
can we take that additive
manufacturing process

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.530
and bring it not to make large
scale production big factories,

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.020
but embed them in
these micro factories

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.500
I talked about earlier.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.930
So that won't happen overnight.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.850
So I agree with you.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.540
It will be a couple of years
before we can transition

00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:00.380
to this micro factory model
of predictive manufacturing,

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.375
but in the short term,
it's to first create

00:53:02.375 --> 00:53:04.500
the proof of concept to
see if it can be done, even

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.500
on a large scale.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.480
And then eventually,
it will be brought

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.210
to micro factories over time.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.660
But it will be absolutely
led by large companies who

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.560
have the wherewithal in terms
of science and technology

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.120
development capabilities.

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.190
That's why GE is looking into
it, Siemens is looking at it.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.660
I can't name some other
companies, but at least seven

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.650
to eight large companies
from the industrial world,

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.870
and also from the
IT technology world,

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.930
are looking at how
to revolutionize

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:33.140
additive manufacturing.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.340
So my hope is that as
more large companies

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.650
jump into it, that will create
more innovation to make it much

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:43.740
more accessible in terms of
bringing it down in scale

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.420
so it can be embedded
in a micro factory.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.870
And it won't happen, I would
say, in the next five years,

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.579
but over 10, 15
years, it will happen.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.260
Great.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.330
So I think we have
come [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.100
So thank you very much
for your interest,

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.540
and you can grab a
book on the way out.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.140
Thanks a lot.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:02.740
Thank you.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:07.290
