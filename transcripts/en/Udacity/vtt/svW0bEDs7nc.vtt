00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.740
Now let's look at several
attacks on the web.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.720
The first is the cross-site
scripting attack.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.980
Many websites allow
user to input data and

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.670
then simply display or echo data back.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.760
The website include the user input data
in the HTML page to the user's browser,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.930
such websites include social
networking sites, blogs, etc.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.080
But what if the users are attackers,
and the user input is malicious?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.190
Let's use an example to illustrate.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.500
Suppose a website echoes
the user-supplied data, such as name,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.730
back to the user.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.310
Suppose user Joe visits a website,
and he supplies his name, Joe,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.950
to the website, then the website will
send back a page saying, hello Joe.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.480
Now, suppose,
instead of sending the user's name,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.670
Joe, to the website,
the browser sends a script as his name.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.870
What's going to happen?

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.390
The website will take this
script as the user's name and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.570
echo it back to the web browser.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.110
That is the script will be included
in the HTML page sent to the browser.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.310
Therefore, when the browser displays
this webpage, the script will run,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.100
the webpage will display Hello World.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.010
Now, this is a benign case.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.220
Now what if the script is malicious?

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.180
When the browser gets the HTML
page from the web server,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.560
it would just execute the script.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.240
So if the script is malicious,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.470
then the malicious script will
be executed by the browser.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.210
But why would the browser send
a malicious script to the website

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.860
without a user knowing about it?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.570
How can this happen?
