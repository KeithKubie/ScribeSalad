back and went to colleges and there was
 

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.130
back and went to colleges and there was
a massive explosion in the number and

introduced into the work of libraries
 

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.600
introduced into the work of libraries
and it was very disruptive it was a

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:14.610
and it was very disruptive it was a
 

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.210
and it was very disruptive it was a
period of severe economic strain we had

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220
period of severe economic strain we had
 

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.770

great aspirations coming out of the
 

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.570
great aspirations coming out of the
period of popularization but we didn't

unionization of library workers and this

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.050
unionization of library workers and this
 

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.500
unionization of library workers and this
created interesting tensions if you look

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:33.510
created interesting tensions if you look
 

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.290
created interesting tensions if you look
at the status of library directors which

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300
at the status of library directors which
 

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.330
at the status of library directors which
I have during this period from nineteen

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:38.340
I have during this period from nineteen
 

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.460
I have during this period from nineteen
seventeen to nineteen eighty you have an

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.470
seventeen to nineteen eighty you have an
 

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.400
seventeen to nineteen eighty you have an
enormous displacement of leadership in

academic libraries individuals who enter
during the period of popularization but

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:47.460
during the period of popularization but
 

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.610
during the period of popularization but
couldn't cope and lead during this

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620
couldn't cope and lead during this
 

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.400
couldn't cope and lead during this
traumatic period of discord and if we

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.410
traumatic period of discord and if we
 

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.350
traumatic period of discord and if we
think about coming out of the 60s what

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360
think about coming out of the 60s what
 

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.060
think about coming out of the 60s what
was going on in the larger social and

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.070
was going on in the larger social and
 

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.460
was going on in the larger social and
cultural and economic world we know how

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:58.470
cultural and economic world we know how
 

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.570
cultural and economic world we know how
disruptive that was but by 1990 I think

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:02.580
disruptive that was but by 1990 I think
 

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.340
disruptive that was but by 1990 I think
we had gotten our wrapped our minds and

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.350
we had gotten our wrapped our minds and
 

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.590
we had gotten our wrapped our minds and
our capacities around that discord and

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600
our capacities around that discord and
 

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.420
our capacities around that discord and
therefore I look at this next twenty

period of decadence it's when we really

period of decadence it's when we really
 

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.240

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.809
the larger community there always will
be a place for sanctuary in the library

01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:13.819
be a place for sanctuary in the library
 

01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:17.349
be a place for sanctuary in the library
and I think we need to help define those

01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359
and I think we need to help define those
 

01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:18.759
and I think we need to help define those
spaces but what we've learned in

01:03:18.759 --> 01:03:18.769
spaces but what we've learned in
 

01:03:18.769 --> 01:03:21.099
spaces but what we've learned in
Colombia I believe is that users help us

01:03:21.099 --> 01:03:21.109
Colombia I believe is that users help us
 

01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:23.380
Colombia I believe is that users help us
to define those spaces and really

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:23.390
to define those spaces and really
 

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:26.579
to define those spaces and really
managed in a large way of the cultures

01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:26.589
managed in a large way of the cultures
 

01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:29.739
managed in a large way of the cultures
and conditions of spaces around the

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:29.749
and conditions of spaces around the
 

01:03:29.749 --> 01:03:30.940
and conditions of spaces around the
library so your observation is

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:30.950
library so your observation is
 

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.380
library so your observation is
absolutely correct I was just trying to

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:32.390
absolutely correct I was just trying to
 

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:36.009
absolutely correct I was just trying to
move us in that direction yeah I think I

01:03:36.009 --> 01:03:36.019
move us in that direction yeah I think I
 

01:03:36.019 --> 01:03:38.410
move us in that direction yeah I think I
think we're just exactly in the same

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:38.420
think we're just exactly in the same
 

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:43.120
think we're just exactly in the same
place and and while I would say we

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:43.130
place and and while I would say we
 

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:46.089
place and and while I would say we
should think about that language gym in

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:46.099
should think about that language gym in
 

01:03:46.099 --> 01:03:48.880
should think about that language gym in
the sense of I think that playing our

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:48.890
the sense of I think that playing our
 

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.249
the sense of I think that playing our
brand and our iconography of library has

01:03:51.249 --> 01:03:51.259
brand and our iconography of library has
 

01:03:51.259 --> 01:03:54.670
brand and our iconography of library has
gotten us super far we're also beloved

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680
gotten us super far we're also beloved
 

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.769
gotten us super far we're also beloved
for that reason you know that if you let

01:03:56.769 --> 01:03:56.779
for that reason you know that if you let
 

01:03:56.779 --> 01:03:58.509
for that reason you know that if you let
our users vote a lot of a vote for

01:03:58.509 --> 01:03:58.519
our users vote a lot of a vote for
 

01:03:58.519 --> 01:04:01.479
our users vote a lot of a vote for
sanctuary but I don't know that I'd use

01:04:01.479 --> 01:04:01.489
sanctuary but I don't know that I'd use
 

01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:03.940
sanctuary but I don't know that I'd use
the word sanctuary except with you know

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:03.950

you said all of you that aren't

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:31.190
you said all of you that aren't

directors and have been ignoring your

directors and have been ignoring your
 

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.559
directors and have been ignoring your
questions but I think it's important

01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:35.569
questions but I think it's important
 

01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:37.599
questions but I think it's important
that people at all levels of our

01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:37.609
that people at all levels of our
 

01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:39.640
that people at all levels of our
organizations are actually answering

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:39.650
organizations are actually answering
 

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:42.520
organizations are actually answering
those questions and wondering if in the

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:42.530
those questions and wondering if in the
 

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.160
those questions and wondering if in the
idea of turning vision into action what

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.170
idea of turning vision into action what
 

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:47.500
idea of turning vision into action what
are some good strategies for trying to

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:47.510
are some good strategies for trying to
 

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.390
are some good strategies for trying to
get it so that my answers to those

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400
get it so that my answers to those
 

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.059
get it so that my answers to those
questions are in alignment essentially

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:52.069
questions are in alignment essentially
 

01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:53.410
questions are in alignment essentially
with Ann's answers to those questions

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:53.420
with Ann's answers to those questions
 

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.000
with Ann's answers to those questions
and how can we sort of spread that

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.010
and how can we sort of spread that
 

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:59.079
and how can we sort of spread that
vision and action throughout the

01:04:59.079 --> 01:04:59.089
vision and action throughout the
 

01:04:59.089 --> 01:05:02.079
vision and action throughout the
organization yeah and I that's a great

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:02.089
organization yeah and I that's a great
 

01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:04.539
organization yeah and I that's a great
that is just a great comment because

01:05:04.539 --> 01:05:04.549
that is just a great comment because
 

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:09.010
that is just a great comment because
it's it it's more of what I was talking

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:09.020
it's it it's more of what I was talking
 

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.559
it's it it's more of what I was talking
about how important our processes are

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:11.569
about how important our processes are
 

01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:13.270
about how important our processes are
you know we absolutely were nowhere

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280
you know we absolutely were nowhere
 

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.700
you know we absolutely were nowhere
without you know without vision and

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:15.710
without you know without vision and
 

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.079
without you know without vision and
knowing what we're talking about and

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:17.089
knowing what we're talking about and
 

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:20.170
knowing what we're talking about and
inspiring people but I think that we

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.180
inspiring people but I think that we
 

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.020
inspiring people but I think that we
just all need more effective processes

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.030
just all need more effective processes
 

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:27.190
just all need more effective processes
it within our institutions and when we

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200
it within our institutions and when we
 

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.770
it within our institutions and when we
get together in places like this because

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:29.780
get together in places like this because
 

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.770
get together in places like this because
we need everybody's brain and we need

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:32.780
we need everybody's brain and we need
 

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.400
we need everybody's brain and we need
everybody's idea so we've I know at my

at NYU we've experimented with a number

01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:40.099
at NYU we've experimented with a number
 

01:05:40.099 --> 01:05:42.309
at NYU we've experimented with a number
of different formats for example for our

01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319
of different formats for example for our
 

01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:44.319
of different formats for example for our
all staff meetings that's really going

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:44.329
all staff meetings that's really going
 

01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:47.940
all staff meetings that's really going
way into the you know organization of

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:47.950
way into the you know organization of
 

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:52.299
way into the you know organization of
sort of we have the format that seems to

01:05:52.299 --> 01:05:52.309
sort of we have the format that seems to
 

01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:55.140
sort of we have the format that seems to
be working the best is kind of these

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:55.150
be working the best is kind of these
 

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.940
be working the best is kind of these
table discussions that people can join

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:57.950
table discussions that people can join
 

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.829
table discussions that people can join
and then switch in the middle and join

01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839
and then switch in the middle and join
 

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.630
and then switch in the middle and join
other other ones and learn from each

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640
other other ones and learn from each
 

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.849
other other ones and learn from each
other that's so we can spread it really

01:06:03.849 --> 01:06:03.859
other that's so we can spread it really
 

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:06.370
other that's so we can spread it really
widely smaller settings more kinds of

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:06.380
widely smaller settings more kinds of
 

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.799
widely smaller settings more kinds of
forums more kinds of working groups so

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:08.809
forums more kinds of working groups so
 

01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:12.400
forums more kinds of working groups so
there's kind of no end to the good

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:12.410
there's kind of no end to the good

processes that can work I make for quick
 

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.680
processes that can work I make for quick
observations one I think the process

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:17.690
observations one I think the process
 

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.780
observations one I think the process
that generates priorities in actions

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:19.790
that generates priorities in actions
 

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:22.089
that generates priorities in actions
needs to be as embracing and

01:06:22.089 --> 01:06:22.099
needs to be as embracing and
 

01:06:22.099 --> 01:06:23.680
needs to be as embracing and
collaborative as it can be so

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:23.690
collaborative as it can be so
 

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.630
collaborative as it can be so
individuals across the organization take

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640
individuals across the organization take
 

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.430
individuals across the organization take
ownership of the things that the library

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440
ownership of the things that the library
 

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.069
ownership of the things that the library
sees is important second I've taken the

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079
sees is important second I've taken the
 

01:06:30.079 --> 01:06:31.539
sees is important second I've taken the
position that if you want to see a

01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:31.549
position that if you want to see a
 

01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:34.930

library's true strategic plan priorities

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:34.940
library's true strategic plan priorities
 

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.930
library's true strategic plan priorities
look at its budget

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:36.940
look at its budget
 

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.120
look at its budget
too often we set goals and directions

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:39.130
too often we set goals and directions
 

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.130
too often we set goals and directions
and then we don't invest in those

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:41.140
and then we don't invest in those
 

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.930
and then we don't invest in those
priorities so I think we have to put

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:42.940
priorities so I think we have to put
 

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.000
priorities so I think we have to put
significant and appropriate resources

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.010
significant and appropriate resources
 

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.190
significant and appropriate resources
behind those priorities which means

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200
behind those priorities which means
 

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.740
behind those priorities which means
other things don't get done third we

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:49.750
other things don't get done third we
 

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.410
other things don't get done third we
need a process of assessment we need to

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:52.420
need a process of assessment we need to
 

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.510
need a process of assessment we need to
be able to evaluate have we made

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520
be able to evaluate have we made
 

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.640
be able to evaluate have we made
progress are we achieving those goals

progress are we achieving those goals
what are the measures of success and

01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960
what are the measures of success and
 

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.620
what are the measures of success and
lastly I have found that providing

lastly I have found that providing
 

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:03.630
lastly I have found that providing
opportunities within the organization

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640
opportunities within the organization
 

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.690
opportunities within the organization
for the teams and individuals who

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:06.700
for the teams and individuals who
 

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.910
for the teams and individuals who
actually do the work to advance these

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920
actually do the work to advance these
 

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.160
actually do the work to advance these
priorities should have a bully pulpit to

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:11.170
priorities should have a bully pulpit to
 

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.650
priorities should have a bully pulpit to
share with their colleagues what they

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:13.660
share with their colleagues what they
 

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.200
share with their colleagues what they
have done what they've experienced that

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:16.210
have done what they've experienced that
 

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.569
have done what they've experienced that
allows them to take credit for the work

01:07:18.569 --> 01:07:18.579
allows them to take credit for the work
 

01:07:18.579 --> 01:07:20.849
allows them to take credit for the work
that they've done but it also gives them

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:20.859
that they've done but it also gives them
 

01:07:20.859 --> 01:07:22.319
that they've done but it also gives them
an opportunity to reflect and think

01:07:22.319 --> 01:07:22.329
an opportunity to reflect and think
 

01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:24.900
an opportunity to reflect and think
about what they've done as they take the

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:24.910
about what they've done as they take the
 

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.670
about what they've done as they take the
next steps in moving those goals forward

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680
next steps in moving those goals forward
 

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:32.400
next steps in moving those goals forward
I have a quick question I think we have

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:32.410
I have a quick question I think we have
 

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:36.059
I have a quick question I think we have
time for one more maybe in listening to

01:07:36.059 --> 01:07:36.069
time for one more maybe in listening to
 

01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:39.300
time for one more maybe in listening to
both of your your talks I was struck by

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:39.310
both of your your talks I was struck by
 

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:42.030
both of your your talks I was struck by
what we're not doing and I would like to

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:42.040
what we're not doing and I would like to
 

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.800
what we're not doing and I would like to
pose it posed the question to but either

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:43.810
pose it posed the question to but either
 

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.470
pose it posed the question to but either
of you do we lack ambition as a

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480
of you do we lack ambition as a
 

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:56.780
of you do we lack ambition as a
profession I was hoping for a response I

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:56.790
 

01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:01.829
don't think so I just I you know so Jim

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839
don't think so I just I you know so Jim
 

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:04.140
don't think so I just I you know so Jim
might disagree with me but I see a lot

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:04.150
might disagree with me but I see a lot
 

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:08.339
might disagree with me but I see a lot
of incredible stuff going on I i see i

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:08.349
of incredible stuff going on I i see i
 

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:11.550
of incredible stuff going on I i see i
see that you know just think how we

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:11.560
see that you know just think how we
 

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.490
see that you know just think how we
could have not made the transition just

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:14.500
could have not made the transition just
 

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.349
could have not made the transition just
think you know where we could be and

01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359
think you know where we could be and
 

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.420
think you know where we could be and

priority of my concern and I've used the
 

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.370

suggests that that humans did not just
 

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:12.360

were actually evolving at different
 

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.999
were actually evolving at different
points around the around the world I use

01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:18.009
points around the around the world I use
 

01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:20.640

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:22.450
libraries and teams of libraries working
 

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.140
libraries and teams of libraries working
on the same stuff all over the place not

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:25.150
on the same stuff all over the place not

connecting not working with each other
 

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:29.430
connecting not working with each other
so i think we waste a lot of

part of your organization but I sort of
 

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.440
part of your organization but I sort of
circled around it and I got the

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:16.450
circled around it and I got the
 

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.270

you and now my question is really
circling back to something Jim said

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:34.150
circling back to something Jim said
 

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:38.280
circling back to something Jim said
about how we can align ourselves more

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:38.290
about how we can align ourselves more
 

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.650
about how we can align ourselves more
closely so you know why do we why does

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:40.660
closely so you know why do we why does

closely so you know why do we why does
every library have an acquisition

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040
every library have an acquisition
 

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.200
every library have an acquisition
department and why does every library

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:43.210
department and why does every library
 

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:45.540
department and why does every library
have a digitization department and while

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:45.550
have a digitization department and while
 

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.250
have a digitization department and while
digitization is pretty close to my heart

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:47.260
digitization is pretty close to my heart
 

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.130
digitization is pretty close to my heart
so i was trying to even think about how

01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:50.140
so i was trying to even think about how
 

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.260
so i was trying to even think about how
we would align ourselves i mean we

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.270
we would align ourselves i mean we
 

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.240
we would align ourselves i mean we
already are trying to align ourselves in

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:54.250
already are trying to align ourselves in
 

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.940
already are trying to align ourselves in
terms of standards and processes and

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:56.950
terms of standards and processes and
 

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:00.870
terms of standards and processes and
tools and even that is difficult I mean

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880
tools and even that is difficult I mean
 

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.400
tools and even that is difficult I mean
everybody has their opinion about

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:02.410
everybody has their opinion about
 

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.740
everybody has their opinion about
standards and

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:03.750
standards and
 

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.470
standards and
way things should be done so how do you

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480
way things should be done so how do you
 

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.080
way things should be done so how do you
actually see that happening in the real

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:09.090
actually see that happening in the real
 

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.600
actually see that happening in the real
