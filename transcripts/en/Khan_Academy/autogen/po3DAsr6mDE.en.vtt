00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:02.423
 Do you know Carl Castle? 

00:00:02.423 --> 00:00:08.840
 His and the others from National Public Radio can be found at npr.org/community. 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.223
 Here's the NPR news program called All Things Considered. 

00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.273
 You are reported by Robert Siegel and All Tech Considered is on the show. 

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:24.918
 Nowadays, you can practically learn everything from video on YouTube. 

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:28.217
 (First of all you put a tie around your neck ...) 

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:31.001
 A South Carolina man teaches you how to tie a tie. 

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.984
 His video has been viewed on YouTube more than 650,000 times. 

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.918
 Or maybe you always wanted to learn to play the piano. 

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:42.167
 (Now we'll make a minor chord. Middle finger ...) 

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:48.551
 Today we'll talk to All Tech Considered the man who dedicated his life 

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:51.568
 creating video tutorials on YouTube. 

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:56.135
 Sal: Welcome. The theme of this presentation is the multiplication of fractions. I think you'll be happy 

00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:02.401
 because you will find that this is one of the cases when multiplying something is easier than adding. 

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.301
 Don't you believe? So let's look at it. 

00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:06.218
 Robert: This is Salman Khan. 

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:08.301
 Not the famous Bollywood actor 

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.352
 but a former investment fund analyst, now an author of educational videos. 

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:15.318
 Has more than a thousand video tutorials on YouTube 

00:01:15.318 --> 00:01:20.168
 from ordinary multiplication through fractions to polynomial approximations of functions. 

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:23.268
 And today we can welcome him to California, our studio in Silicon Valley. Welcome. 

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:23.902
 Sal: Thanks. 

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:27.001
 Robert: Your YouTube channel is called Khan Academy. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.868
 Why did you decide to become an online tutor? 

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:36.102
 Sal: It was quite natural. I started to remotely teach my relatives 

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:36.836
 in New Orleans. 

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:40.519
 Back then, as you said, I worked as an investment fund analyst in Boston. 

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:44.301
 My cousin Nadia had problems with the basics of algebra. 

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.868
 I suggested that I could teach her at a distance, 

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:52.835
 for example, via a conference call 

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.418
 or chat via Instant Messenger or something. Finally, we started using Yahoo Doodle. 

00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:02.119
 Soon it was said among relatives and friends, so I had about ten, fifteen students. 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.801
 And then it became difficult to organize, to reconcile my work and their football training, 

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:11.218
 moreover, I had to explain the same things again and again according to my students' age. 

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:16.551
 So I started recording lessons. They were as conceived as when I was teaching Nadia. 

00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:22.051
 Subsequently, I uploaded videos to YouTube so that my or your great-grandchildren could learn from them. 

00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.617
 Robert: I've seen a few videos, and I noticed you never saw them on them. 

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:30.870
 There's just a cursor that draws on a black background while you talk. 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.201
 How do you do that? 

00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:36.368
 Sal: I used MS Paint at the beginning, 

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:39.151
 I created a black background and then used bold colors. 

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:44.251
 I used a shareware program, I think it's called ScreenVideo Recorder. He was $ 20. 

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.769
 So I simultaneously recorded my desktop and my voice. 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 So the videos were made. It felt like 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.252
 the fastest and cheapest way to create decent quality videos. 

00:02:53.252 --> 00:03:00.618
 Then one viewer gave me the Camtasia recorder software to record a desktop for $ 300 

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:04.901
 and I'm currently using other shareware, I think it's called SmoothDraw2. 

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:10.535
 I have it on drawing and I use a small Wacom graphic tablet. 

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:14.186
 Robert: Let's see what areas your video tutorials cover. 

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:17.417
 Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology. 

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:20.751
 Sal: And in the area outside of science, it is mainly economics and finance. 

00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:23.968
 A large number of materials were created last year during the financial crisis. 

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:27.135
 I transferred my investment fund funds to cash 

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:30.251
 and then I started reading the Federal Reserve System Act. I read it about 10 times 

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.301
 just to see what the federal reserve chairman can do, 

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.603
 and I said to myself: How can I best use the time I devoted to learning something? 

00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:40.035
 What to create a series of videos about Partial Reserve Banking and the Federal Reserve? 

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:43.817
 I do not want to limit myself to mathematics and science alone. 

00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:50.885
 Robert: There's one thing I noticed when I watched a video about stocks. 

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:57.218
 I think you said there that a share of $ 1 per share may not be cheaper than 

00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:59.352
 share of $ 10 per share. 

00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:03.001
 And at that moment, a Google ad message will appear on the screen 

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:08.019
 which sends me to a site with different penny stock stocks. 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.905
 This is advertising, and it is based on the assumption 

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:15.401
 that you will follow the video content. 

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:20.685
 Who is the advertiser of these ads? How many of your courses include advertising 

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:24.917
 and what opinion do you have on such a combination of education and advertising? 

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:29.668
 Sal: This service is provided by YouTube and its effect is that it is on YouTube. 

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:31.620
 I'm getting some of the revenue. 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.252
 It's about $ 1500 for Khan Academy Inc. 

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:39.001
 which is a non-profit organization. 

00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:44.135
 So the money goes directly to the organization, definitely not part of my paycheck. 

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:47.484
 Robert: Considering your previous job, you think that without advertising 

00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:51.985
 is this project self-sufficient? Is there a career to do? 

00:04:51.985 --> 00:04:55.668
 Can it work when people have access to free videos? 

00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:59.602
 Sal: Currently, the project is not self-sufficient. 

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:03.818
 I often joke that the project is funded by Mr. Salman Khan's account in Bank of America. 

00:05:03.818 --> 00:05:07.968
 My wife gave me the ultimatum that she must earn the project on her within a year 

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.201
 but I think it will be more benevolent. 

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:15.901
 The project has no outside support besides financial donations from viewers. 

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:22.801
 That's about $ 1500 a month. 

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:23.936
 And then those ads on YouTube. 

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:27.352
 If the ad were more aggressive, I don't want to 

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:30.885
 I would probably make a few thousand dollars a month more. 

00:05:30.885 --> 00:05:32.551
 As the number of viewers increases, 

00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:34.900
 which is about 15-20% per month 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.235
 I am relatively confident that within a year only this source of income should cover my salary. 

00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:43.784
 Robert: Are you your boss and the only employee? 

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:44.885
 Sal: Yes at the moment. 

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:49.602
 About two months ago, volunteers suddenly appeared 

00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:50.985
 to translate videos. 

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.717
 One of them is a chemistry teacher from Uruguay who created the first translation. 

00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:59.834
 There is an effort to translate into Arabic, Polish, Portuguese, German. 

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:03.300
 But I've created all the content so far. 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.868
 Robert: You act as a very natural teacher in the videos, so I think 

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:13.168
 Whether you are studying in a technician at Massachussets and trade at Harvard or then as an analyst 

00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:14.885
 ever thought you would become a teacher? 

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:18.270
 Sal: I taught high to earn some money. 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.318
 I worked as an MCAT instructor for a year at the University of Princeton 

00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:27.067
 and I also taught second grade students at Devotion School in Brookline. 

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:33.385
 I enjoyed it, but the economy and the investment funds were a little bit more fun. 

00:06:33.385 --> 00:06:42.336
 Robert: Could you create a video comparing the investment fund analyst's and the teacher's salary. 

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:49.201
 Real-time communication with students does not work in online learning. 

00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:56.118
 Do you think this may be another plus in teaching? Does it play a role? 

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:59.802
 Sal: I think that's the advantage I have over traditional teachers 

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:07.285
 judging by my experience with traditional teaching. One of the hardest things to do is sit against a class of 20-30 pupils 

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:12.351
 of which five seem to perceive you. The rest are just staring at you 

00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:16.668
 and you do not know if they are bored or they do not follow the interpretation. It makes you uneasy and you don't know what to do. 

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:21.901
 I will explain something to my computer in ten minutes, as if to explain it to you or your cousin, 

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:26.951
 and then upload it to YouTube. It takes about half an hour. 

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:34.168
 In the first hour of uploading a video, a hundred people watch the video, and I wait to see if five stars 

00:07:34.168 --> 00:07:40.451
 and write to him "that's great" or "I can handle the tomorrow's test" or anything else. 

00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:44.535
 I'm waiting for feedback from viewers. That will give me the courage to work on. 

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:52.735
 Robert: Salman Khan, lecturer in mathematics, science, economics and many other things at khanacademy.org. 

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:55.000
 Robert: Thanks for coming. Sal: Thanks for the invitation.
