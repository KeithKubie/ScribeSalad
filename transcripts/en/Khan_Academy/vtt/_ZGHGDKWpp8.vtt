00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:03.990
- [Voiceover] Let f of x
be equal to negative one

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.514
over x minus one squared.

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:09.404
Select the correct description
of the one-sided limits

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:11.370
of f at x equals one.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.460
And so we can see, we
have a bunch of choices

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.697
where we're approaching x
from the right-hand side

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:18.003
and we're approaching x
from the left-hand side.

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.347
And we're trying to figure
out do we get unbounded

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.966
on either of those, in the positive,

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.802
towards positive infinity
or negative infinity.

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.556
And there's a couple of ways to tackle it.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:28.984
The most straightforward, well,

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.746
let's just consider each
of these separately.

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.067
So we can think about the limit of f of x

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:37.990
as x approaches one from
the positive direction

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.823
and limit of f of x as x approaches one,

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:48.413
as x approaches one
from the left-hand side.

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:50.074
This is from the right-hand side.

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:52.371
This is from the left-hand side.

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:54.444
So I'm just gonna make a
table and try out some values

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:58.966
as we approach, as we approach
one from the different sides,

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.966
x, f of x, and I'll do
the same thing over here.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:08.202
So, we are going to have
our x and have our f of x

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:14.163
and if we approach one from
the right-hand side here,

00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:16.319
that would be approaching one from above,

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.569
so we could try 1.1, we could try 1.01.

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:25.992
Now f of 1.1 is negative one
over 1.1 minus one squared.

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:34.275
So see this denominator here
is going to be .1 squared.

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:38.358
So this is going to be,
this is going to be 0.01,

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:44.091
and so this is going to be negative 100.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.424
So let me just write that down.

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:48.184
That's going to be negative 100.

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:51.721
So if x is 1.01, well, this is going to be

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.138
negative one over 1.01 minus one squared.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.114
Well, then this denominator
this is going to be,

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:04.364
this is the same thing as 0.01 squared,

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:10.116
which is the same thing
as 0.0001, 1/10000.

00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:16.170
And so the negative one 1/10000

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.433
is going to be negative 10,000.

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:22.433
So, let's just write that
down, negative 10,000.

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:25.817
And so this looks like, as we get closer,

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:28.733
'cause notice, as I'm going
here I am approaching one

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.002
from the positive direction,

00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.756
I'm getting closer and
closer to one from above

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:35.303
and I'm going unbounded
towards negative infinity.

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:37.911
So this looks like it
is negative infinity.

00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.686
Now we can do the same thing
from the left-hand side.

00:02:40.686 --> 00:02:43.353
I could do 0.9, I could do 0.99.

00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:50.912
Now 0.9 is actually also
going to get me negative 100

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:54.829
'cause 0.9 minus one is
going to be negative .1

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.926
but then when you square
it the negative goes away

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.259
so you get a .01 and then
one divided by that is 100

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.556
but you have the negative,
so this is also negative 100.

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.661
And if you don't follow those
calculations, I'll do it,

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:11.243
let me do it one more time
just so you see it clearly.

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:13.933
This is going to be negative one over,

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.788
so now I'm doing x is equal to 0.99,

00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:18.311
so I'm getting even closer to one,

00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.971
but I'm approaching from
below from the left-hand side.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.804
So this is going to be
0.99 minus one squared.

00:03:27.358 --> 00:03:31.525
Well, 0.99 minus one is, is
going to be negative 1/100,

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:37.026
so this is going to be
negative 0.01 squared.

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.338
When you square it the negative goes away

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:43.649
and you're left with 1/10000.

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.862
So this is going to be 0.0001

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:50.751
and so when you evaluate
this you get 10,000.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.615
So that, or sorry, you
get negative 10,000.

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.684
So in either case,
regardless of which direction

00:03:56.684 --> 00:04:00.851
we approach from, we are
approaching negative infinity.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.539
So that is this choice right over here.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.258
Now there's other ways you
could have tackled this

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.615
if you just look at, kind of,

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.775
the structure of this expression here,

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:12.105
the numerator is a constant,

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:14.037
so that's clearly always
going to be positive.

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.243
Let's ignore this negative
for the time being.

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:17.978
That negative's out front.

00:04:17.978 --> 00:04:20.636
This numerator, this one is
always going to be positive.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:23.984
Down here, we're taking at x equals one,

00:04:23.984 --> 00:04:26.254
while this becomes zero
and the whole expression

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:29.513
becomes undefined, but as we approach one,

00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:32.561
x minus one could be positive or negative

00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.503
as we see over here, but
then when we square it,

00:04:35.503 --> 00:04:37.984
this is going to become positive as well.

00:04:37.984 --> 00:04:39.607
So the denominator is going to be positive

00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:42.602
for any x other than one.

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:44.607
So positive divided by
positive is gonna be positive

00:04:44.607 --> 00:04:46.064
but then we have a negative out front.

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:48.015
So this thing is going to be negative

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.196
for any x other than one,

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.485
and it's actually not
defined at x equals one.

00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:54.585
And so you could, from
that, you could deduce,

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:56.707
well, okay then, we can
only go to negative infinity

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:59.403
there's actually no way
to get positive values

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:00.903
for this function.
