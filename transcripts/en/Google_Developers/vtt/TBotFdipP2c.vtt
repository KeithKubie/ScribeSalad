[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.620
ANNA RYS: TurboTranslations
is a website

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.240
where you can order fast,
professional, people-powered

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.810
translation 24/7, so
whenever you need it

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.030
and whenever you
need it quickly.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.696
GRZESIEK MIKLASZEWSKI:
TurboTranslations

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.190
is built on Ruby on
Rails web technology.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.140
At first it was built in PHP.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.050
It was a little project like
a prototype, a very basic

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.420
prototype, and then we
rewrite it to Ruby on Rails.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.615
Ruby on Rails is a
good technology tool

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:31.490
for fast prototyping.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.640
In startups,
especially, you have

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.850
to see if different things
work or not-- landing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.150
pages, some [? pivots, ?] some
features that are not actually

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.630
working, but clients
think they are working,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.970
and you can promote them.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.480
In Ruby on Rails, you can
fastly develop such features.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.290
And if it works, it's OK.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.550
We can develop it later.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.060
If not, we can just remove the
code and start another one.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.890
ANNA RYS: We're planning to
expand our startup, starting

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.220
with Europe, for two
reasons, basically.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.140
One of them is that we're
here and we know the market.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.990
And it's just easier for us to
go to France, even personally,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.270
and talk to the customers
there, as opposed

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.290
to going to the US or Asia.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.730
And the other reason is that
all of competition is in the US

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.570
and in Asia.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.730
So that's something we would
like to avoid, you know?

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.810
It's really important
to our clients

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.480
that they see that there's
a face behind what's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480
happening to their text.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.710
They don't want to
send it to a machine

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.120
and not be sure it's
going to be good enough.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.860
I mean, we do believe that one
day-- maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.520
20 years from now-- let's
say Google Translate will

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.040
be good enough to cover 90% of
translation needs worldwide.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.630
But there will always
be translations

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.710
that need to be done by humans.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.760
And our clients
really appreciate

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.720
that we communicate
with them personally

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.030
and that the translators also
do that and that they actually

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.880
see that there are people behind
this product and not machines.
