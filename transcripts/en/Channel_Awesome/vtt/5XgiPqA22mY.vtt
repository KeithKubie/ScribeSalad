00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.340
I've talked a lot about Prince of Egypt before on Nostalgia Critic

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.060
Both on the "Top 11 Underrated Nostalgic Classics" and the Old vs. New of "Prince of Egypt vs. Ten Commandments"

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.560
So I'll try to keep this relatively short and try to save stuff I haven't said before

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.840
The story I think is a safe bet you probably know

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.600
The pharaoh has decided that the slaves have grown too large in size

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.680
So he sends his soldiers to perform mass genocide

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.740
But one family wants their baby to live, puts him in a basket, and sends him floating down the river

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.340
Where, oddly enough, the basket comes across the queen and decides to adopt the baby and call him Moses

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.980
Years later, Moses grows up and realizes his true heritage

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.520
Disgraced by who he is he leaves his brother and family behind, and finds a life of peace far away

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.940
But that doesn't last for long, as God himself comes down and tells Moses that he is to be the deliverer of the Jews

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.760
Moses returns, finding his brother is now pharaoh, and the epic battle begins between pharaoh and Moses over what will happen to the Jewish people

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.960
The film is gorgeous! This is one of the best looking  animated films I've ever seen

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.540
I'm not even really a big fan of Egypt, or the desert. But, by God! The shots and the angles they get in it! It's just unbelievable!

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.320
So much attention is being drawn to how to tell this story faithfully but not exactly the same as the Ten Commandments

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.060
And it does exactly that. It has its own unique style and its own unique look

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.780
Even the characters are different

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.340
The relationship between the brothers seems genuine

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.120
They both now have grown up, and they both now have new responsibilities that they wish to honor and do not wanna break

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.440
But at the same time, they're still family. And this is what makes great drama!

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.180
That's Val Kilmer as Moses and Ralph Fiennes as Rameses, and both of them are fanastic

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.520
Even the other celebrity voices! Though distracting at times, like Jeff Goldblum or Patrick Stewart, still match well to the character and tone that the movie's trying to get across

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.300
It's just distracting in that you can tell it's their voices, but you warm up to them pretty quick

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.260
Something else I've never talked about is the music. The music is also wonderful

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.660
I think the theme they have for the Burning Bush is one of the most comforting, nicest themes I've ever heard

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720
It's just a great sound and creates this wonderful mood

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:40.400
Now some people can and have been turned off by this movie because, well, while Ten Commandments just intended for adults, this is more older children and adults

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.980
That is to say, there ARE songs, there IS some comedy relief and there ARE some weirdly drawn characters

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.200
And yes, that can be distracting at times, like half the time there's no segway into the songs

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.800
Steve Martin and Martin Short as the High Priests are a little odd and out of place at times

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.760
And horrible to say, but, because it is sort of a Disney style, maybe it could have benefited more from a little bit more than Disney design

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.840
I mean some of them look good but others do look kind of odd...

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.720
But with that said, the distracting moments are never too distracting

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.540
And you know what? I like the songs. I think they help move along the story and they do it in a very visually and musically interesting way

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
So I don't mind them. I think they really work

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.340
But many would argue if you're really gonna tell the story of Moses and you want to step up your animation company and make it more adult, you should probably leave some of this stuff behind

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.160
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel that it was TOTALLY true

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.380
Especially with something as heavy as the story of Moses

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.560
But I also understand the need to appeal to a general public

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.860
And, like I said, I think they work it in pretty well

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.800
So I stand by it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.180
At least by the songs

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.740
I do feel bad this movie is not more appreciated and maybe it is because Ten Commandments was just such a landmark

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.960
And even though this was a good film, yeah, it's probably not really a LANDMARK in any way

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.520
At least, not in the way that most people view cinematic landmarks

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.100
But I still think it's a good, strong film

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.520
Better than Ten Commandments, in fact

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.240
It has great characters, it has a timeless story, it has  wonderful music, it has breathtaking animation with some breathtaking visuals

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.320
Even if you're one of those people that can't fully get into it, I still say check it out

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.120
Because there is some really great stuff in it

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.420
And I think the story of Moses deserves to be told from a different point of view, and this is a very smart point of view

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.240
What else can I say?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.120
I love it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.020
I've seen it a million times before, and I'll definitely see it a million times again
