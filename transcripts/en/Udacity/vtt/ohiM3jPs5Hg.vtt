00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.430
All right. So it's great that we can visualize the

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.610
winning percentage of the Red Sox from 1960 to 2010.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.189
But what if we wanted to do a slightly more

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.170
complex analysis to try to understand what is driving that

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.400
winning percentage. We'd have to incorporate more variables. But how?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.600
One way is that we can use the visual cues

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.460
that we're familiar with to encode even more information into

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.170
the chart. For example, let's go back to our scatter chart.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.800
We can use the size of the points to represent the number

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.510
of home runs hit by the Red Sox players that year. Dots

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.840
that are larger meant that more home runs were hit that year

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.720
whereas smaller dots mean that fewer home runs were hit. Hopefully, what

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.410
we would see is that bigger dots occur when the winning percentage

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.730
is higher. I've filled the plot in with some dummy data just

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.140
so that you have an idea of what this might look like.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.340
We can even double up on visual cues. For example maybe we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.480
also use the saturation of the red color to indicate

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.490
how many home runs are hit. So our larger dots

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.890
will be a more intense shade of red, whereas our

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.870
smaller dots will be a less intense maybe almost pink shade

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.500
of red. A redundant visual cue can help reinforce what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.910
might be a challenge to see if we only used one

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.420
visual cue. So by using both size and color here,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.370
hopefully we really hammer home to the viewer that there were

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.230
more or fewer home runs in a given year.
