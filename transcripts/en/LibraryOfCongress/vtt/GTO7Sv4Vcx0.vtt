00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.000
Wonderful to see you all here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.960
My name is Marie Arana, and
I am the literary director

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.580
of this festival.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.510
Very happy to welcome you here.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.070
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.690
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.480
Now, sitting next to
me, I want to announce,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.850
is not Secretary
Madeleine Albright.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.110
[laughter]

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.640
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I will be talking
about fascism, however.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.110
&gt;&gt; And before we start, I
just want to take a moment

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.500
to say a very big thank you
to our sponsors and donors.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.310
This festival would not happen
without the funding from people

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.550
like you, sponsors, donors.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340
Go down to the expo floor,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.860
please tell them
thank you very much

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.820
for putting this festival on.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.160
No amount is too small,
so if you're willing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.590
to contribute, we
ask that you do.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.710
It is, it takes a lot
of money to put this

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.280
on to give it to you for free.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.900
So, thank you very much.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.020
Yes. [applause] We want
to keep doing that.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
We want to keep giving
it to you for free.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.490
Now this is, I'm sitting next to
Amy Tan, who is the only author

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.830
at this festival, we've
got 115 authors here today,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.510
who was chosen by PBS'
The Great American Read.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.110
[ Applause ]

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.390
Chosen as a book by the
public, by the American public,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.770
and there's going to be
voting on all of the 100 books

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.940
that were chosen, chosen
for having written a book,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.050
it was the Joy Luck Club,
that changed their lives.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.350
And yeah, wow.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I didn't--
thank you whoever voted.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.990
&gt;&gt; Joy Luck Club was followed of
course by A Kitchen God's Wife

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.080
and The Hundred Secret Senses
and The Bonesetter's Daughter,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.270
all of her fiction, which
has been extraordinary,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.080
and the nonfiction as well.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520
Saving Fish from Drowning,
The Valley of Amazement,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.900
and now the wonderful
memoire that she's written,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.380
that she's given to
us, and we're going

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.510
to be talking about today.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:37.460
But I have to say, Amy, and I'll
start with this, I am Hispanic.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.260
When I read your book, Joy Luck
Club, I felt a real connection

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.440
because you, it is
families who come

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.190
to this country bringing
their own culture,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.910
bringing their own tradition,

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.820
coming here with a
completely different universe,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.780
and suddenly you are
American, generations change,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.460
distances grow, tell us about
you, how you feel about--

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.010
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I thought it, yeah,
I thought it was so ironic

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.570
because when I was
writing that book,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.980
I thought no one is
going to get this book.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.760
This is going to be so
weird because are going

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.080
to say nobody had
a family like that,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.650
and a lot of the stories were
based at least emotionally

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.030
and situationally on my family,
and so I was so surprised

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.600
when Chinese American women
or men said this book was,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.040
they identified with it.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.920
But then, as you said, I
had people from all sorts

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.340
of backgrounds tell me that.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.770
&gt;&gt; Well the interesting thing
to me is that reading it

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.280
and reading books like yours,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.150
Maxine Hong Kingston's
Warrior Woman, these books,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.340
you realize that there's another
way to think as a citizen

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.270
of this country, as a part

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.650
of this fantastic
American experience,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.480
we all come with different
heads and different histories.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.430
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I think that we
also come with a similar heart,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.960
and that's where it comes
from, this connection,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.700
and if you can get people
to feel what you're feeling

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.810
in the story, you have more
of a chance to have them,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.100
this book, to be universal.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.550
I never intended
it to be universal.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.690
I never intended for my emotions
that were very private to,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.990
you know, link with that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.480
of other people,
and it surprised me.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.400
I was grateful that they
found that resonance.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.440
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm sure we have a
lot of people in the audience

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.340
who have been inspired,
as I was, by your fiction

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.140
and by what it says
to us as a country.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.810
But now you've written
this wonderful memoire.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.980
You don't call it
a memoire, right?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.280
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: No, no.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.580
It was a book about writing.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.940
That's originally what I
thought it was, you know,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.830
people tell you what
you've actually written

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.810
after you've written
it, including my editor,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.510
who said it's a memoire,
it's, and I said no,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.300
it's a book about writing.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.280
But because it has so many
examples of my writing

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.530
from my real life, they ended
up calling it a memoire.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.610
&gt;&gt; Your life has
actually, and your family,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.160
and your background,
and your roots,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.330
have really informed
every single thing

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.630
that you've written.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.810
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I try to
get away from that.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.420
[laughter] But when you're
writing about, you know,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.710
the way, what has
shaped your writing,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.410
it's not simply the stories,
the context of the stories.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.350
It has to do with the way you
think, your whole cosmology

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.080
of the world, and
how things happen.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.710
It's what is important to
you and morality and family

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.530
and consciousness and
also what you think

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.340
about between the
moment you were born

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.930
and the moment you died but
including the moment you died.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.290
So these go into the
writing, and so I had to talk

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.360
about what feeds the writing.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.500
But you said something once,
or wrote something once

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.520
that is coming to mind
right now, which is,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.470
you said I didn't write this
or write what I've written

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.120
to be remembered in the
minds of other people.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.420
Some writers do.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.720
You know, I want
to become immortal.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.020
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I don't
write for prosperity.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.320
&gt;&gt; I want to become immortal.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.620
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.920
&gt;&gt; You said I don't want to
be, that's not why I'm writing.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.520
&gt;&gt; Why are you writing?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.820
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I want to
write in the moment.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.550
I mean my whole purpose of
writing is almost to capture,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.130
like a diary of myself
and what I was thinking

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.840
about at the time, and if I
have in my mind that I'm writing

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.790
for posterity, or, you
know, to be in the library,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.470
somebody might look it up, you
know, a hundred years from now,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.210
then I would get stuck.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.350
I would write for
a different reason.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.970
And so in my mind I always
have to tell myself this is

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.890
for the moment, and
if it ephemeral,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.510
if it's gone next year or ten
years from now, that's fine.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.260
And my motives then,
my intentions

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.010
for writing are very
clear to me.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.160
&gt;&gt; This book, and it really
is to me, it seems a primmer

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.340
for writers because it really
goes into the way you think.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.960
Not only the way you think
it goes into your brain.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.600
You're talking about the
brain process, you're talking

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.320
about amygdala, which where
memory is supposedly held.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.420
And you're talking about
your own sort of trepidations

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.190
about the way that
your brain works--

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.490
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.530
&gt;&gt; And, you know, where is it
coming from and do I have it,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.990
and it's a very candid--

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.860
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: You know, when
people say it's candid,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.530
I think what did I
say that's so candid?

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.400
Or you're very brave,
and I think, oh,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.500
maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.830
I wanted to know also because I
was brain damaged for a while.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.010
I had Lyme disease that
went into my brain,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.950
and it really made me foggy.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.750
It made it hard to
remember anything,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.270
and then I became curious
about how the brain--

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.700
I hope you can see I recovered.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:17.750
I was [applause]-- so one of the
things that happened in thinking

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.370
about the brain and how
it works, I discovered

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.380
in taking this sort of
medication for seizures,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.890
which this is what
Lyme left me with,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.170
that this medication made me
too happy, which you think,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.690
well what's wrong with that.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.210
Well, if you're laughing
at what people are saying,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.970
and it's not supposed
to be funny,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.750
it can be rather distressing.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.680
So, I found also this had to do

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.150
with neurologically something
going on, and I tied it then

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.090
to the idea that our brains
have these emotions in them,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.140
they really are triggered
also viscerally,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.320
and my stories have that too.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.670
So one of things I did was
to take a visceral emotion

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.520
that I had about a vague
memory and then follow it.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.520
As I moved forward with
it, then I would feel this,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.570
I would feel nervous, I would
be aware that I was shaking

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.000
or that I would have something
going on in my stomach

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.800
that felt uncomfortable, and I
just kept following the story

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.530
to see where it went, and I feel

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.440
that I uncovered this
very traumatic memory.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.440
Even if it did not
happen exactly the way

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.600
that I wrote it down,
it is in essence part

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.010
of my life during that time.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.920
So that is part of my writing,
and you know, I say this,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.020
it's not a primmer
for a lot of people.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.660
This doesn't happen
to you where you go

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.740
into a PTSD moment, that's okay.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.570
It is my, the thought process,
the brain, and emotional,

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.850
the emotional memory
process that I go

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.900
through in the writing.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.290
&gt;&gt; You say that you started
this book by opening boxes

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.820
and looking at letters, and as
you were looking at the insides

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.880
of these boxes and what they
collected and the whole lifetime

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.010
of and other people's
lifetimes, that it was like,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.230
and I love the expression,
you said it was like the force

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.400
of glaciers [inaudible].

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.730
You have this image of,
you know, oh my gosh,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.490
you know, whole force going on.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.410
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Things that
have been frozen in time

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.630
that suddenly were
revealed to me.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.390
These were books of
memorabilia from my family.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:45.010
I actually had 80 boxes,
and I took it down to seven,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.400
and I had, you have to
realize, I was desperate

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.790
to finish this book, and I
was writing a chapter a day,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.660
which is absolutely insane.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.880
It usually takes me
years to write a book.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.630
I was going to finish
it in about four months,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.880
and it was an experiment
in part.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.840
So I would take things out of
this, and it would be a letter

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.330
from my mother to me,
and it was a letter

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.630
when she was really upset

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.370
and hinting she was
going to kill herself.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.980
And I took that, and
I wrote something.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.340
And it might have been about
her language and something

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.970
about what she was saying
underlying these words.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.570
Or I'd pick something up,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.000
and I'd suddenly realize my
parents were illegal immigrants,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.300
oh my!

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.640
You know. And that fed into some
of the things they said to me

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.270
that turned out to be lies.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.570
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.690
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: And one of them
was taking an old report card

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.200
out from an art teacher
that said about my art,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.840
which I loved, I wanted to be an
artist, she has no imagination,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.060
[laughter] which is essential
for a deeper creative level.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.420
So I gave that dream up.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.040
Thank god he didn't
say that about writing.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.140
&gt;&gt; I want to point out that
she has one of her sketches

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.530
in the book, at least one--

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.830
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.130
&gt;&gt; Of a, of a, of a, of a--

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.430
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: A bird.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.730
&gt;&gt; Of a bird.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.030
With every little feather in it.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.330
It's a wonderful sketch.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.830
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I draw
every day now.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.900
I'm into nature journaling.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.660
But part of was something
revealed to me in this book

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.990
which was that so much of my
life, my childhood was governed

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.290
by expectations and the idea

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.430
that something would
become public.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.850
And I still am governed by
that slightly, you know,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.230
the idea that maybe
if I write something,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.880
some people are going
to read it.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.990
But with the drawing, I do this
for myself, and I don't have

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.690
to show it to anybody, or I show
it, and it could be really bad,

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.160
and I don't care, you know,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.100
because they did it
for pure pleasure.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.300
No one is paying
for it, you know.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.630
So that was another thing
I discovered in the book.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:58.430
There was one, it was almost a
devastating discovery during the

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.450
writing of the book, and
it was about being told

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.830
that I was going to be a doctor
when I was six years old.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.730
Somebody had tested me, and
then that was my parents,

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.490
and my parents said to me,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.360
she said you're going
to be a doctor.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.680
And then they say, and so
you can be a concert pianist

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.780
and a doctor.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.230
[laughter] And then she said,

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.490
but she said you're not
very good with words.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.920
Your English is not that
good, but that's okay,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.200
you don't need a lot of
words for being a doctor and,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.160
you know, playing the piano.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.470
Well, this prediction
or mandate followed me

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.770
for the rest of my life.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.710
I mean even to the moment
that I was writing this book

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.930
and I realized every time
I felt inadequate or dumb

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.970
or that I had never lived
up to this expectation--

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.780
&gt;&gt; I hope you still
don't feel a failure.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: It's not that
I'm a failure in comparison

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.620
to what other people might
perceive, but within my mind,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.610
there is always something
there, and it has, there's no,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:08.390
the problem is there's no
clear notion in my mind of what

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.560
that is supposed to be that I am
supposed to reach and say, yes,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.480
I fulfill this potential.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.120
So because it's so vague, you
know, I'm always not there,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.740
and I did, I did sort of
erase it partially when I came

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.130
across this lie that I never
was supposed to be a doctor.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.060
And it turned out the
test, this is a great thing

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.650
about the internet, you can
find out this test I took

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.590
in the first grade, and
the woman came every year

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.290
for two years, I mean twice
a year for five years,

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.830
and then she stopped, which
made me think that I flunked

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.810
and she wasn't going
to come anymore.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.810
It was a different kind of test.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:53.110
I found it on the internet by
googling 1958, first grade,

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:58.800
Oakland, IQ longitudinal, and
the first thing that came up,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.180
it was a landmark
research on kids

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.860
who read early, and guess what?

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.630
Out of 5003 kids, there were
49 who could read early,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.530
and I was one of them.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.100
And my parents had lied--

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.400
&gt;&gt; And the school
didn't like that?

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Well, you weren't
supposed to teach kids to read.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.550
There was a, you
know, a prohibition.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.720
Parents are not supposed to
teach because you were going

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.240
to teach the wrong methods

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.150
and your child would be a
problem child from then on,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.920
you know, a chronic
bed wetter or whatever.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.360
And people followed
this to the hilt.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.710
I mean kids today, they
read text messages.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.670
You know, they're,
they're, is insane.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.420
At age two they're, you
know, they're reading.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.030
&gt;&gt; So were your parents
terrified

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.510
that they had an early
reader on their hands?

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.530
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: No, they would
not say to the woman,

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.150
and she kept asking them,
how did she learn to read?

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.650
And they said, oh, you know,
her brother is brilliant.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.610
Her brother is so smart,
and he didn't learn to read.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.010
He started first grade.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.520
He followed the rules, and
he was doing great later.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.430
No, we don't-- and
finally it came

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.070
out that I had been copying
his textbook and I'd say

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.800
to my brother, what
does this mean,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.910
and my brother was
teaching our cousins,

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.950
who didn't speak English, and
he had a little classroom.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.930
You have to imagine, here's a
little six-year-old boy telling

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.560
our older cousins,
no, wrong, you know.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.330
[laughter] And I was sitting
there in the classroom.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.420
So I have learned to
read probably from that.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.330
&gt;&gt; It's an amazing story,

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.690
and your parents were worried
because, you know, they thought,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.460
because they were
illegal immigrants.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.760
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.060
&gt;&gt; This was going
to compromise them.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.860
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: That's what
I, that's what I realized.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.310
You know, I always thought
my father was so honest

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.950
because he was a minister.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.420
He was an electrical engineer
by, you know, to make his money

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.770
to support us, but he was by
devotion a Baptist minister,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.450
and I thought, how
could he have lied.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.460
And they lied about a number
of things, and I realized then

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.910
when I found the documentation
that they were illegal

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.070
and there were these letters
with the word deportation

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:17.590
that they were among many people
before and today who have to lie

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:22.240
in certain ways, not morality
ways, but in ways, having to do

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.970
with documents, so they
don't imperil themselves

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.270
and their families.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.110
So lying and saying we
don't know how she learned

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.410
to read, you know.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.710
We followed the rules.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.690
We knew we should, they
said that like three times.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.160
We knew what the rules were.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.020
We didn't break them, you know.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.950
And it was her brother
who taught her.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.170
[laughter] Send him
back to China.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.830
[laughter]

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.610
&gt;&gt; By the way, speaking
of going back to China,

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.690
I want to ask you this, as a,
you know, I was born in Peru,

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.690
and I came to this country
when I was 10 years old.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.380
My mother was American.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.920
My father was Peruvian, and
every time I went back to Peru

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.750
after that it was, well
you're not really Peruvian,

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.050
you know, you're an American.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.500
You're not really, you know,
you're not one of us anymore.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.800
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.480
&gt;&gt; Do you have this experience?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.780
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I grew up with that.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.830
I grew up with a sense
of shame, both ways.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.700
Shame that I was Chinese in a
school that was primarily white

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.950
and then shame, you know, when
I went among family friends

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.960
who were Chinese or in
a restaurant or any kind

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.350
of situation around
Chinese people

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.400
that I couldn't speak Chinese,
that I knew nothing about China,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.830
and I had trepidations about
writing the Joy Luck Club

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.700
because people would
say you know nothing.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.240
You got it all wrong.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:51.390
Even my mother had said when we
first went to China that, I was,

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.020
this was how naïve I was.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.440
They said, you know, when we
go, what if they think I'm one

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.830
of them and they won't
let me come back.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.940
She just said, you know,
they just look at you

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.770
and the way you talk
and the way you walk

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.980
and they know you don't belong.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.280
Later, she claimed, and
a lot of people claimed

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.750
that I was really so
Chinese, you know.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.120
My Chinese did improve
because I have half sisters

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.300
who speak nothing but
Chinese, and it came back,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.430
so I know that I spoke
it when I was a child.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.760
It was in there, the
roots of that language.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.240
And now when I speak Chinese
people say, oh, you're so good.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.530
My Chinese is not that good,
but, you know, everybody thinks

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.510
that I'm just so
talented at being Chinese.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.120
[ Laughter ]

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.860
&gt;&gt; Coincidence there.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.690
This memoir, sorry--
this book about writing--

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.520
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: It's okay,
it's shorter to say memoir.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.960
&gt;&gt; Is actually, was
actually an unintended memoir

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.430
if I can say that, because
it's, tell us how it started.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.390
It started with a
conversation through emails

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.460
with your editor, Dan Halburn.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.760
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.040
&gt;&gt; I would, my editor and
I are very good friends.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.560
He is a dream editor.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.660
He's one of those, if
you're not yet published,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.780
you think you're going to have
an editor like this person

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.810
who loves everything that's
going on in your life,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.870
loves your husband, loves, you
know, wants to know what you had

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.820
for dinner, and we would
write these emails,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.760
and he so much enjoyed the
emails, and he was often saying,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.060
how did you think of that?

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.550
Or I loved what-- and he
decided we should do a book

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.850
about our emails.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.150
He said it would be easy.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.230
You know, we'll just
choose a bunch of them,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.800
put them in a book,
and that's it.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.450
And I thought, great.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.400
Well, I started looking through
them, and I said this is going

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.290
to be a book about egotism.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.880
And it's going to be so
boring, and I told him,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.180
I said, we can't do this.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.480
And because I had already
signed this contract

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.230
and something had
gone out in the world

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.190
that said this book is coming,

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.170
I had to put a book together
about, and think of the book,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.880
the emails were a lot about
writing and our relationship

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.790
as a writer and the kinds of
things I would talk about as,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.690
you know, my insecurities
as a writer.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.230
So, you know, this is going
to be a book about writing.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:30.410
And in that book, there are
some very, very rough pages

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.950
where I just wrote them as I
was, they were part of the book.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.370
I just wrote them down,
and I just put them in.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.130
But there are some emails.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.020
I told Dan, I said, okay, you
know, you suggested this book.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.840
I'm going to put them in, and
we're going to include yours,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.230
and you tell me which ones.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.880
And then he freaked
out, and he said, okay.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.620
I'm going to choose the email.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.700
So in the book there
are a number of them

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.710
about our early relationship
as a writer and editor talking

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:06.050
about the book, and I think it's
good insight also into the kind

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.260
of difficulties that
a writer has.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.540
That it's not perfect, and
if anything, people say,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.010
well can you just
write this for me.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.350
They don't realize it
is far more difficult

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.030
to write a little piece
as a writer than it is

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.210
for any other person because
you sweat over every word,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.510
and you think it's horrible,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.770
and you try doing
it again and again.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.430
But the emails, they were
just off the top of my head

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.220
because they were just to Dan.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.390
And so I put them in there.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.360
You'll get to see how
insecure I am as a writer.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.050
&gt;&gt; It's a very revealing book,
and I think in the process

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.390
of your talking about writing,
you tell us about your life

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.110
because you really
didn't become a writer

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.340
until you were in your 30s.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.640
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.940
&gt;&gt; You've been a linguist.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.240
You've been an educator.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.540
You've been a bartender.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.090
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Pizza slinger.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.390
Yeah.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.790
&gt;&gt; Pizza slinger, car hop.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.740
All of you out there
who have jobs like that,

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.580
you can also become Amy Tan,
because these are the things

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.790
that feed you in the
process of being who you are.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.570
And the corporate, you were
writing corporate materials

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.230
and things like that,
that sort of thing.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.530
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.800
&gt;&gt; So how, tell us a little
bit about your decision

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.340
to actually site down and write
fiction and how that came to you

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.600
and how the impetus for
writing the Joy Luck Club

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.900
actually happened.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.990
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: There
was no single moment

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.230
that I said I'm going
to write fiction.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.430
It's almost hard
to think, you know,

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.040
if there was a one day
revelation, but one of the times

00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.060
when I was motivated was after
reading Louise Erdrich's book,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.590
Love Medicine, which is about
a community of people in there

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.920
and different voices,
and I realized

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.220
that I had these stories,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.810
but they were all
in different voices.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:14.370
Now, they were primarily my
voice, but I had different ways

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.180
that I wanted to see my life,
through the voice of mother,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.330
daughter, and different
situations.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.010
There was another moment
when I started reading again,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:29.470
and I was writing the corporate
business articles, and I was,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.940
I was good at it,
and I have to admit,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.520
I was good at writing the
corporate things about,

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.270
or employing motivation
materials, you know,

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.090
why you should work harder
for the same amount of money.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.240
Very, very good at that,
and I had a lot of clients

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.730
as a freelancer,
but I was unhappy.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.620
I would go down in my
office every day and I said,

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.330
will I be doing this
in in 10 years.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.300
And I was making good money,
so it was hard to walk away,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.270
and I said, I hate it,
I hate it, I hate it.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.900
Then I would sit down
and I'd start working.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:09.200
And I knew that I liked to
write, and so I thought,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.030
well maybe I'll do this other
kind of writing, and I started,

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.700
and I wrote things that
were not very genuine.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.890
I made myself a German
American girl, and, you know,

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.070
rich parents and all
that kind of stuff.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.370
And it wasn't good.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.670
It was not very authentic.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.720
And then I gave up on the idea

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.020
that this would ever
be published.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.030
I'd just do it for myself,
and I started writing things

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.240
that eventually would be
part of the Joy Luck Club,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.100
and I went to writer's
workshops.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.580
It wasn't a very good story.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.510
I had a lot of problems
with it, but the questions

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.250
that were asked of me
that I had asked of myself

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.080
and what I discovered about
myself made me realize

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.340
that week I was going to write
fiction the rest of my life.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.210
I was not going to
get published.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.920
I wasn't delusional.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.660
I said, I will keep at this,
so it's really important,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.610
just the way that I'm
drawing every day.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.170
This is important for me.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.160
I don't have to have
it out there

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.410
in the world, but
it's important.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.070
And so I started to
write with that notion.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:19.110
I would, and to give me a goal
so that I wouldn't give up,

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.040
because I have this
dilatant tendency

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.050
to start something
and then drop it.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.640
I said, I will work to
be published when I'm 70.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:36.510
I have a little bit to go
still before I reach that goal.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.400
When I'm 70, if I get
a short story published

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.320
in a good literary
magazine, I will be happy.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.070
That's my goal.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.030
&gt;&gt; You're a very
adventurous soul.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.620
I know this because
in this book you talk

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.510
about going cave
diving, spelunking.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:00.020
You go, you've had accidents
on the Italian autostrada.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.770
You have had, you
know, hotel break-ins.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.390
You've been mugged.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.290
A million things
have happened to you.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.740
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: That's not
adventurous, that's bad luck.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.230
[laughter] Or good,
because I'm alive.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's live subjects
to write about, but I think,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:26.760
you know, for all that bad luck
and adventure that you've had,

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.210
the greatest adventure
I think is your family.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.240
The story, the treasure
trove, if you were writing

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.120
about a German girl with,
you know, with rich parents,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.150
I mean the real treasure
trove was in your family,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.590
the stories in your family,
the extraordinary sort

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:51.520
of revelations that came
to you later in life

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.690
about your grandmother,
who was a concubine

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.640
and committed suicide
because she hated that life,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.740
about your mother, who was,
it was an arranged marriage

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:12.010
that she hated, and then left
her children behind in China

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.340
to come to the United States
to be with your father--

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.610
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: And kept
this a secret.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.740
&gt;&gt; And kept it all a secret.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.040
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.860
&gt;&gt; And all of this was
emerging, I assume,

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:28.390
as you were in this process of
doing your corporate newsletters

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.780
and barhopping and
pizza deliveries,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.290
all of this information
was coming.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.780
Extraordinary stuff
to write about.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.630
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Well, I
always thought, you know,

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.290
that my life contained nothing
that would ever go into a book,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.720
that it was boring,
because to me a writer,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.990
I'd read through one
thing, as an English major,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.670
books only by male writers
except for Virginia Woolf,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.450
that was the only one, and so I
believed that you would have had

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.280
to go through war, like Kurt
Vonnegut, or you would have had

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.940
to go through, you know, hunted
animals like Earnest Hemingway,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.430
and I didn't have
any of that history.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.100
Who would want to read
about a Chinese girl

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.600
and her crazy family and her
mother who just, you know,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.480
has these horrible traumas
in her life she's trying

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.090
to get you to understand.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.330
And that's why it was
so important for me

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.300
to realize I have to write
for my own reasons and not

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.890
to impress anybody else, and
once I got rid of that notion

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:39.610
of ever getting it published,
it enabled me to do it.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.900
But, you know, I, to this day, I
keep thinking, I'm going to run

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.580
out of family material,
you know,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.090
I can move on to something else.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.280
And then I get another
revelation, you know.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.110
It just, it just never ends.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.190
You know, one of the
things that I thought

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.340
that my grandmother
was a very modest woman

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.930
and that she was quiet
and she was old fashioned,

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.340
that was what was told to me.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.870
She was raped and then
became a concubine by force,

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.230
and then I found these
photos and a book that showed

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.710
that the exact costume she
was wearing was the one worn

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.680
by courtesans.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.470
And I thought, oh my god.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.840
I mean the one thing
you can say about that,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.690
not that she was
necessarily a courtesan,

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.630
she was not old fashioned.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.880
This would be like, you know,
your grandmother dressed

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.050
up as Britney Spears, and no,
she was not old fashioned.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.870
And that was a thrill
to me because, you know,

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.650
I suddenly said, of
course she wasn't.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.800
I mean look who came
out, my mother.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.840
My mother, she's vain,
she wears nice clothes,

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.360
she's very consumed with,
you know, being respected.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.220
And that also came from
her mother, who demanded

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.500
to be respected and
wasn't and killed herself.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.830
I became my mother's daughter,
and I have attributes that come

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.780
from her, a certain
obsessiveness

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.080
where if I'm bothered

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.430
by something I cannot
stop talking about it.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.340
But I'm unlike here
because I'm not suicidal.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.620
I'm, you know, I
have my choices.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.680
So it, you know, those
revelations where you find

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.320
out facts, you find out
about yourself as well.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.610
I find, you know I find
myself in these revelations.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:36.220
Now there's one big
revelation to me.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.980
In doing the research for
this book, I found evidence

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.280
that my father and mother
knew each other in Chongqing

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.350
in a certain year when they
were sent to be in this place,

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.570
when the Japanese were
bombing their city.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.000
They had met years
earlier, had fallen in love.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.460
My mother had a baby,
and I was always told,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.290
she was told she was
born in Shanghai.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.870
She was born in Chungking
and Chongqing.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.050
My mother and father were there,
and my sister did not know

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:14.410
who her father was, and it was
a possibility that her father,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.760
my half-sister, that her
father was my father.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.140
We were in the midst of
trying to find out how

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.470
to get tests done,
and the DNA tests,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.610
you cannot see the father's
side, because as a female,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:33.600
you are XX, not XY, and
trying to find a way

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.430
to discover what this was

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.140
and piecing together
facts, and then she died.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.180
So she wanted to know.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.990
She knew that was a possibility,
and she died, suddenly,

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.400
in March on a trip to Egypt.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:57.500
I still have her DNA sample, and
if I could ever, ever find a way

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:04.250
to get some inkling of the
paternal side, I will do that.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.650
&gt;&gt; More mysteries
ahead, in other words.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.950
.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.250
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah,
more mysteries.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.900
Your mother loved being
in your books, I think,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.210
or having been mirrored in
your books, did she not?

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.320
She loved that aspect.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.080
And a lot of people
say, whoa, you know,

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.460
what did your mother think,

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.180
thinking she would have
been appalled, disinherited,

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.750
not that she had any money, but,
you know disown me or something.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.820
And in fact, she loved it.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.910
At the very end of reading, and
my mother was not a big reader,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.350
she said it was so easy to read,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.090
and I knew that what she
meant later is she saw

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.240
that I understood things about
her that she no longer had

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.370
to explain, what upset
her, what irritated her,

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.760
what made her furious,
that that was in the book

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.850
and that I understand
that about her.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.550
Oh, one of the funny things
I discovered in looking

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.220
through the memorabilia is

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.530
that my mother was
getting a graduate degree

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.850
in American literature.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.500
That was on her student visa.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.760
And the only American literature
she ever read was my book,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.280
many, many years later.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.580
[laughter] Yeah.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.880
&gt;&gt; She was precious.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.320
I mean she had some sort of--

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.620
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.020
She was going to make
American literature.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.410
[laughter]

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:34.830
&gt;&gt; You were a teenager when
you lost your older brother,

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.160
the brilliant, Peter,
was his name.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.460
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, Peter, yeah.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.280
&gt;&gt; Who was a bit older than you,

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.630
I think a few years
older than you.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.930
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: A year
and a half, yeah.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.790
&gt;&gt; And then six months after
that, your father died.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.090
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.730
&gt;&gt; Both died of brain tumors.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.580
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Brain tumors.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.790
&gt;&gt; And two quick
losses in succession,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:02.370
which must have been an
extraordinary force of,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.560
tragical force on your mother,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.500
but on you as a teenaged
girl, how did that--

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.090
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: The deaths
of my father

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.490
and my brother affected
me, I would say,

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.890
the most because of the way
my mother reacted to that.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.850
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: She went
a little insane,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.780
and she believed we
were all going to die,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.950
and she became even
more suicidal.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.240
And at one time there
was a thought of all

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.590
of us going to heaven together.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.050
But I was a daddy's girl.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.860
I adored my big brother,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.730
and I don't think I'm just
remembering him in a way

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:48.800
that comes from grief,
transformed over time.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.160
He and I did things.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.460
He showed me things.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.980
Like he taught me how to read.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.790
He played with me.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.060
We read books together
later in high school

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.730
and talked about them.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:08.010
And so I was profoundly
sad and isolated,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.470
but it was my mother's reaction.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.370
I'll tell you how insane
she was during that time,

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.730
and understandably so.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.360
You lose our husband, your
connection to the adult world,

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.860
because you don't speak
English that well,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.030
and you lose your son, who
it turns out I discovered

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:30.880
in reading the memorabilia
was her favorite,

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.160
and also was my father's
favorite.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.110
Now this was devastating when
I thought I was the favorite.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:45.170
You know, this made her a
little insane, and she ended

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:52.170
up taking us to Europe, and
on the basis of the fact

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.480
that Holland was clean.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.140
She found a can of Dutch
cleanser under the sink,

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.100
and she decided that we'd go to
Holland because maybe my father

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.410
and brother died because
of some kind of germ,

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.560
and that's where we went.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.320
We ended up in Switzerland,
you know,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.100
and every time I tell people
I graduated from Switzerland,

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.710
they think I was, you know,
some rich girl, you know,

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:20.130
went to a finishing school,
but that wasn't the case.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.390
&gt;&gt; That was a phenomenal
turn in events.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.560
Do you speak French, then?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.640
I mean were you in
a French school?

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.390
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Well, the
sad thing is that most

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.630
of the people there,
the students,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:37.360
they could speak English fairly
well, so my French is very bad.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:43.200
I speak better Spanish
than French by the way.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.550
But I'm learning.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:51.000
I'm an autodidact, and I read
Le Bon and I write letters

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.090
to people in French who
are friends who are French.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:58.280
&gt;&gt; Which leaves me to ask
you, who were your models?

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.550
Who were your, when you were
thinking about actually sitting

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.630
down and writing this for
yourself, even if it took you

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.750
to age 70 to get it done,
who were your models?

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.010
Who were the people
who most inspired you?

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.820
Who were your, those
[inaudible].

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.600
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I would say
they were the writers

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.650
that I was reading at the time,

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.260
and that's why I always tell
people, if you really do want

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.740
to be a writer to just keep
reading and reading and reading.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.880
Not to copy other
people, but to be inspired

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.610
by the fact they have
amazing, unique voices.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.600
So Louise Erdrich, definitely.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.990
She is one of our greatest,
greatest writers today,

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.660
and also Jamaica Kincaid.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.200
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Who is a writer you
don't hear a lot about today,

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.450
but her book, Annie John, was,
I read that numerous times.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.470
It had, seemed so simple

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:59.910
but it has this seething power
underneath it, every sentence.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:07.960
And, you know, Isabel
Allende, who has these stories,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.690
also these secrets, and
a family from the past,

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.290
ghosts from the past, and
people call it magical realism,

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:20.340
but you say, no, no, it's
what really happened.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.570
And I love that part
of it, that, you know,

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.830
it didn't have to
be fantastical.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.200
So there were many,
and I do have

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.610
to say they were mostly women.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.190
But there were writers,
other writers that I,

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.980
and Maxine Hong Kingston
was another one.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.230
Richard Ford, who I love.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:42.200
And some of the writers
that I read in college,

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.740
but it had to do with
the writers I was reading

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.590
at the time and feeling
more and more this urge

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:54.460
that I was now older,
and I had to make sense

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.460
of the life I had
lived thus far.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.070
&gt;&gt; All of this is in this book,

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.350
which is really a
wonderful book.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.500
I couldn't recommend it more,
but I want to take you back

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.040
to a moment that you
talk about in this book,

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.200
and it's 2001, it's March.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.990
You had just Bonesetter's
Daughter, and it was a book

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:25.200
that was inspired really by
your mother's gradual decline

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.310
into Alzheimer's as I
recall, and then complicated

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.750
by your editor's
bout with cancer.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:38.110
So there was this,
trying to write this book

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:43.060
about your mirror on
your mother's experience,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.840
your editor, and then falls into
this tragic state of affairs,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.360
and you race to finish the book
for her sake, as I remember.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.440
You go to New York to finish it.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.740
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.300
&gt;&gt; And then you, Lyme disease
comes into the picture somewhere

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:07.560
in there, and you're in
New York, strangely enough,

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.700
as fate would happen, when
the twin towers are struck,

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.670
and you watch from the street.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.740
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I watched
the first one fall

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.600
from the CNN building on 37th.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:26.370
I was the trivia
answer to which segment,

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.240
who was the person
being interviewed

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.730
who was cancelled
as a result of 9/11.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.030
They said one minute to live,
then it was 30 seconds to live,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.040
and I was sitting on the stool,

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.630
and suddenly the room
just broke into chaos.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.330
And people were cursing at
each other, and I thought,

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.720
how strange, you know, that they
would not temper themselves even

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.370
if they were irritated.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.870
And then I saw on all of the
monitors an image of a building

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:56.590
on fire, and having done many
interviews over the years,

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.890
I knew whenever there was
hard news, like O.J. Simpson,

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.700
you know, a glove was found,
that I would be cancelled.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.090
So I just knew that a building
on fire, I was cancelled,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.880
and I was going to
take this off.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.170
And then I see there's
nothing behind a building,

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.400
it's just sky.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.980
And then I heard somebody
say it's a commercial jet.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.770
We have a witness, and
I realized what it was

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.650
and what was happening
around me.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:27.940
We saw together in that newsroom

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:33.130
with all those newscasters
the second tower being hit,

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.830
and somebody saying, it's war.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.730
And I watched the
second tower fall

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.680
as I was walking
back to our house.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.200
We had a loft.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.090
My husband was there, and
I just had to get home.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.130
I was walking on the street,
and I saw it come down,

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.050
and I said, I'm dreaming this.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.890
This can't be real.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.190
And I don't even
remember hearing it.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.730
It was so surreal, I just
watched this come down.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.000
And we live 10 blocks from
the World Trade Center.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.910
All these people were
running up our street covered

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:16.380
with this cement dust, many
of them looking shell shocked.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:22.690
And there was such an amazing
camaraderie, a coming together

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.920
of the whole city
during that time.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.520
But of course, this was one

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.580
of those moments you
say, I'm going to die.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.550
What is my life about,
what is important.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.800
&gt;&gt; Amazing sort of
confluence of events.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.440
I'm going to ask one more
question, but I want you

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.690
to think about questions
that you will ask

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.400
because I will open
it up to all of you.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.680
There are microphones
in the aisles,

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.960
and please ask a
question of Amy Tan.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.540
My last question to you

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:58.900
in interview is what can
we expect from you next?

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.380
What are you working on?

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.680
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Oh, expectations.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.960
[laughter] It's the question,
you know, my editor asks me.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.390
Actually, he's fine.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.520
We're having dinner,
and he knows never

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.730
to ask me that question.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:24.190
It's a novel, and the title
of it is the Memory of Desire.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.050
&gt;&gt; The Memory of Desire?

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.350
&gt;&gt; Of desire.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.720
Now it's going to be
either one of two novels.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.660
It's once that I dreamt
of about three years ago.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.550
The entirety of this book
I dreamt on New Year's Day,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:41.120
like a gift, and I read
over, I wrote down the notes

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.420
about what I had dreamed,

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.200
and a lot of times you dream
these things and they turn

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.910
out to be nonsense, but
it made complete sense.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.590
It even had the subplots, all
the characters and locations.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:57.780
The other was a book I
started about ten years ago,

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.620
and I found this
draft in that pile

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.310
of memorabilia, and I loved it.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.020
And I thought, why
did I abandon this.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.900
And when I read that again,
I thought maybe I'll do this.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.390
And I had sent it to
Dan also a while ago,

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.690
and he could not let go.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.990
He kept writing about a month
back and forth about this

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.350
but not wanting me to write
about wanting me to write

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.610
about this novel we
had talked about.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.670
So, I don't know, it's
going to be that or that,

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.180
and I don't know if the
title will be the Memory

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.290
of Desire, but there you go.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.290
It'll be a surprise,
just like everything

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:35.770
in my life is a surprise.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.300
&gt;&gt; Well, I can't
wait to read it.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.430
Do we have any questions,
people who would like to come up

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.160
and ask something of Amy?

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.100
Come on up, don't be shy.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.530
This is a good chance to
connect with an author.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:53.110
I have to tell you that there's
not very much in this world

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:57.140
that lasts forever, but when
you come up and ask a question,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.510
it gets archived in the
Library of Congress.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.040
[ Laughter ]

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.340
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Your sound bite.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.640
&gt;&gt; So make it good.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.180
You can say you're an
audio file forever.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.700
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Your great
grandchildren will see it

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.000
in the Library of Congress.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.300
&gt;&gt; Please, no pressure.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.600
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: No pressure.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.070
&gt;&gt; So thank you so much
for all of your books

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.960
and for being here today.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.260
Sorry, I can see you up there.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.560
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Yeah.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.000
&gt;&gt; I was just struck by the
beginning of your conversation

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.690
when you said that one of the
things that surprised you most

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.080
when you wrote the Joy Luck
Club was how universal it was

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.800
in terms of people telling
you it reminded them

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.720
of their own experience.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.170
I'm just thinking of
the moment we're in now.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.230
Crazy Rich Asians has
broken all records in terms

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.280
of box office receipts.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.040
Is that also part of what is
important to you to see as sort

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.940
of broadening of the
popular culture acceptance

00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:00.150
of all things Asian or is the
more humanistic approach more

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.890
important for you?

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.850
&gt;&gt; You know, in terms of
film, I loved that film,

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.370
and I loved it for two reasons.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:12.490
I thought it was a fun film,
but the fact that it was

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.850
so successful, breaking
box office,

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.110
number one at the box
office, I felt this is going

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:22.420
to give Asian Americans a
chance to act in movies,

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.420
and they don't have to
be Asian American movies.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.720
They can be anything.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.400
The stories can be anything.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.640
I don't think that
story is universal

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.230
because it does not represent
every Chinese person.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:39.920
We're not crazy rich all of us.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.670
Just as Pretty Woman does not
represent all pretty women.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:48.930
But there is an expectation
people have had in the past,

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.660
and I hope that they'll get away
from that looking at this movie.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.170
It's just a fun,
romantic comedy,

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.220
and a satire on rich people.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.370
Next question.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:05.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard you say, I
can't see you, I heard you say

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.090
at one point that
you're a linguist,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:14.790
and how do you approach
dialect and creating voices

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:20.430
in different, with accents, what
have you thought about that,

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.730
and you do really well.

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.130
So I want to learn from you.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.670
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: I do love language.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.200
That's why I became a linguist.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.630
What I hear though mostly has,
that's more important to me,

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.540
has to do with imagery, and that
does reflect in the way I look

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:41.280
at my mother's speech, which
includes a different way

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.480
of expressing it in Chinese.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:49.690
It's a context that has
historical, her history,

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:54.600
personal history, and a lot
of emotion over the years.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:00.260
I looked at the changes
in my mother's language

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.370
from the time she was a little
girl speaking Shanghainese

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.660
and Mandarin and English
and then back to Chinese

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.550
and Shanghainese when
she had Alzheimer's.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.640
What I, I don't have
to work at what her,

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.630
these accents or the dialect is.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.440
It's simply what I heard.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.020
And so I, I'm sorry
I can't help you

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.470
and say this is how you
do it, but if you were

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:31.640
to have a character who had
a different way of speaking

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.770
from the mainstream, I
think it would be to go

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.350
and have conversations
with that person.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.030
Not simply overhearing
what they're saying,

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.180
but really getting into
an emotional conversation

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.790
about some ongoing topic and
how they express themselves.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:55.070
Not simply phonological features
of that but how it comes out.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you, next.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:57.990
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Hi.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.290
&gt;&gt; My name is Meiyung.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.520
Thanks for your presentation.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.600
Yeah. My name is Meiyung.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.560
Thanks for your presentation.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:12.250
You had a good [inaudible] in
Chinese to write a good book.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:17.320
But I'm thinking that if a
person who writes another book,

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:24.660
a different kind of book, and so
far [inaudible] is always talk

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.890
about fake news and some people,

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.580
maybe their driver
license will be denied

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.620
if they would try
to choose some work.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.740
If somebody is writing this type
of book and will be restricted

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.870
from publishing or
get a copywrite,

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:47.690
do you have any suggestion,
that you can write another book

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.990
or something [inaudible].

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.330
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Thank
you, thank you.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.880
Whether or not you write
a book and it's original

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.490
or whether it's fake or
whether you have copyright,

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.590
if you write what is true
to yourself and the way

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.050
that you think, not just
the story context itself,

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.680
that's always going
to be original.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.540
And if somebody,
I've had people say,

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.740
well your character
is not depictions

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.270
of real Chinese people.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.570
They're fake.

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.520
That is there perspective,
their reality, that they wanted

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.110
to see characters in a
certain way, just as they said,

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:27.310
you know, Pretty Woman is not
about every single pretty woman.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.960
We as writers, and I assume
you would like to write a book

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.950
or you have written a
book, that it is authentic

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.830
to you and to your emotion.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.040
Over here, please.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.270
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm delighted
to be here to say this.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.940
I'm a high school teacher
in a public school.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:55.400
I teach reading and English
to students with disability,

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.460
and we're about to start
your book, The Joy Luck Club.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.940
I never taught it before, and
I'm excited, but I just thought,

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.080
is there anything I
could take back to them

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.440
that you might say to them?

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.790
These are 10th graders mostly.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:17.360
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: First of all, I
don't think that everybody

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:23.170
in the world, every student is
going to like a book equally,

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.620
and I think they have to know

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:28.990
that that is fine,
absolutely fine.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.120
There's a way you might
look at a book differently,

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.410
not for the story necessarily,
not for the characters,

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:38.460
but perhaps asking if
there's one image in the book,

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:44.070
one scene that really struck you
as interesting, and just to go

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:49.180
into what that scene is about
and why it appealed to you.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.130
The other is that we often read
books because they do resonate

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:58.280
with our lives, and to ask
a student if they would

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.610
like to share, now these
are very personal questions,

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:04.670
but if they would like to share
something about their own family

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:09.060
that feels similar and
the kind of pressures

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:13.150
or expectations their
parents have had

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.710
that seems similar like this.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.780
And did they feel
they were understood,

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.320
because when I was
reading as a kid,

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.850
what I loved were those
stories that made me feel

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:26.450
that I had a friend, somebody
who finally understood me.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.100
Yes. I understand that.

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.700
Next question.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:35.730
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you very
much for being here.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.140
You mentioned after
9/11 when you were going

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.690
through the streets that it
was the kind of experience

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.800
that brings home to you
what is meaningful in life

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.260
and what is important.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.830
What was that for you?

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:56.080
What were those revelations
to you on that day afterwards?

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.910
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: It had to do with
family, and I was very glad

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:03.170
that I had lived a life that
was focused in that direction.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.200
When I started writing, I asked
myself that question again.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.060
What is the most important
I should keep in my mind.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.150
And that, I reflected
back on my life

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:20.710
and said the things I wanted
to do, meaning how I thought

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:24.730
about things, how I treated
people, I was content with,

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:31.160
that I hadn't done anything I
should be feeling shameful of.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.710
So what you should think
about seems to come

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:35.250
at the very moment
you think you're going

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.720
to die, and I was prepared.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.070
I said, it's okay.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.370
Now I'm going home.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.370
I just want to reach
Lou and be together,

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:47.240
and if it happens
together, that's fine.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.540
Thank you.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the question.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.140
Another question please.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.440
We have time for two more.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.780
&gt;&gt; Okay. You mentioned
that you have

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.830
at times had trouble completing
things that you started

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.620
and that you had to let go,
if I understand correctly,

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.830
of the fact that you
wanted it published

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.130
in order to complete that.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.180
Is that what you were saying
earlier, because I'm trying

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:13.570
to figure out how you managed to
go from starting to completion.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.630
Because I've started a million,
and I can never complete.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.460
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: Oh, that.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.100
No, what I meant was I would
start different hobbies

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.920
and then I would let them go,

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.670
but that's true about
books as well.

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:29.060
I wanted to keep writing and not
simply get disinterested and go

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.660
on to jewelry making,
for example.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:38.260
But I let go of books that
ceased to intrigue me or ceased

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.920
to be something that I feel
and become more mechanical,

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.520
where I'm interested only in
how to get to the next chapter

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.740
without feeling how
the story is going.

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.610
Now what happens is you
put it aside enough times,

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.000
you'll pick it up much later

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.620
and you see the direction
is clear now

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.000
or the character is
clear, and you're going

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.680
to change it, but
it makes sense.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.060
So what I would say is
put those things aside.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.850
Don't spend months
and months agonizing.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:12.200
Move on. Or simply write
as fast as you can.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.200
Don't think about the
sentences or where it's going.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.020
Just do stream of consciousness
and see if anything comes

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.260
out after that that works.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.090
Now I say all this and I
don't do it and I wish I,

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:25.580
and that's why it takes me,
and I know I should do that,

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.820
and it's in the book,
because I did it in the book,

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.120
and it worked in the book.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:33.920
It just, I have to apply
it now in this next novel.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.220
We'll see.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.520
You'll get yours done.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.820
I'll get mine done.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.860
&gt;&gt; One last question please.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.230
&gt;&gt; First I want to say it's an
honor and thank you so much.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:46.420
This has been very interesting,
and I really appreciate it.

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.520
I also appreciate the
fact that you a linguist.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.190
I am an interpreter and
translator, so it's awesome

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.760
to see a colleague up there,
or you were a colleague.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.060
My question is this.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.740
When you have a story to tell,
and it's integral to your story,

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:03.020
you speak about certain
subjects that you feel

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.800
like you can't leave
out of your story,

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.240
but you want to protect people.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.840
How would you deal with that
or how have you dealt with it?

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.550
Because the intention is you
don't ever want to hurt people.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.560
You make your peace.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.180
You feel good now and
everything else, but you feel

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:21.630
like it's part of that story,
and you want to tell it.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.900
&gt;&gt; Amy Tan: There have been
very few stories where I've had

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.200
that concern, and mostly,
you know, it would have been

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.590
about my mother, but she
gave me full permission.

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:32.610
She wanted me to write more
about her as a matter of fact.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.440
She wanted me to devote
whole book about her,

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.570
which is the Kitchen God's Wife.

00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:42.930
In this last book, I did have
some moments about family.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.070
You know, over time
you have these moments

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:49.380
where family have betrayed you

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.760
or disappointed you
in a certain way.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.410
And I learned something about
betrayal and forgiveness.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.550
And it's not what you think.

00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:00.630
What I decided is that
forgiveness has a lot

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:04.140
to do whether you want to
continue with the relationship.

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:09.310
And so I had to decide because
of the nature of the rest

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.410
of the story that I
had to include that.

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.600
Well what I did was I just,
I didn't include the name,

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.540
and I just changed the
relationship to a different one,

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.250
and I put down the good things
that person said as well.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.900
So it wasn't just this person
was completely vile and vicious

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:37.000
and mean as she really was.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.140
[laughter] And, you know, you
just, you find a way to do it,

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:46.360
never with hate or disgust.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.500
There was one story, one
chapter I did leave out,

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.820
and I really struggled
over, and it was a story

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.080
about being molested
by a minister.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:02.640
And it was a life-changing
experience, and it was a letter

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:09.200
that I would have written to
him and what it did to me,

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.460
coming out of that room
and how I was changed.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.530
And I decided not to include it

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.250
because it changed the
nature of the book so much.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:20.980
It was just like, oh my
god, where is this going.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:26.630
And there was also a church to
consider that it might damage,

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:30.100
and I didn't think that this
person, who is long gone

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.570
from the church now should
affect the church now,

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:40.080
but I did write that letter to
the church to say when you talk

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:44.320
about your legacy and all the
people you've helped and saved,

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.050
you have to claim this as your
legacy as well, and you have

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.180
to make amends for it.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.730
So I say it now, and I'm glad I
have the opportunity to say it,

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:55.960
but I did not include
it in the book,

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.750
and those are the reasons I
considered what damage would

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.350
it do.

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
