00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.780
The primary concern of OOD relates to the individual classes and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.290
relations in the class model in our, analysis diagram. This process is sometimes

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.390
called object design. Before considering object designs however, several other

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.920
preliminary topics need to be discussed. In particular the inter model.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.740
Consistency among your diagrams. The actual steps in going from analysis to

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.850
design. Some system design considerations. Abstraction mechanisms you might use.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.033
And, I want to take a moment to talk about as,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.930
a somewhat, different approach called collaboration-based design.
