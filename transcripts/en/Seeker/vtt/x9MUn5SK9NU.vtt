00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:06.750
People are a little freaked out about a recent
deadly superbug outbreak in Los Angeles.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.040
But what are superbugs?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.190
And why are they such a problem?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.970
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.150
The recent outbreak at a UCLA hospital was
caused by a strain of carbapenem-resistant

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.990
Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
According to the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) CRE can lead

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.019
to death in up to half of seriously infected
patients.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.000
CRE is a kind of superbug, a bacteria that
evolves resistance to most antibiotics.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.250
Hospitals tend to be the epicenters of superbug
outbreaks.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.109
The combination of high use of antibiotics
and lots of sick people pack into one place,

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.160
seems to be a breeding ground for them.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.850
Some bacteria aren’t transmitted all that
easily, they're not like a cold which can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.910
travel on a sneeze.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.350
Caregivers like nurses, can spread bacteria
through touch.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.079
But let’s say a nurse, touches a wound or
stool sample of an infected person and they

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.460
don’t wash their hands enough.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.000
Then they touch another patient, who is already
vulnerable because of their own wounds or

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.010
weakened immune systems.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.370
Sometimes super bugs can live on an instrument,
like an endoscope, which is properly cleaned

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.630
between procedures.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.690
It seems this is what went wrong in UCLA.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.630
Caregivers didn’t realize the patients carried
CRE and normal sanitization methods weren’t

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.690
enough to kill it.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.610
From the discovery of penicillin in 1928,
we lived in a golden age of treatment for

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.200
bacterial infections.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020
These drugs saved millions of lives.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.820
But scientists fear this hayday is coming
to a fast end.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880
Bacteria have evolved faster than we can keep
up.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.670
It’s become an arms race and we’re losing.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.060
We are now defenseless in the face of certain
strains of bacteria.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.280
According to the World Health Organization,
one of the most common superbug MRSA, is 64%

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.450
more deadly than non-resistant strains of
the bacteria.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.860
Dr Keiji Fukuda, WHO’s Assistant Director-General
for Health Security says “the world is headed

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.530
for a post-antibiotic era, in which common
infections and minor injuries which have been

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.200
treatable for decades can once again kill”.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.430
Antibiotic resistant bacteria is a growing
epidemic, according to the CDC, mostly because

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.790
too many doctors over-prescribe antibiotics
and patients don’t use them properly.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.769
We’re also exposed to antibiotics that are
overused in farm production.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.280
Unfortunately research into new antibiotics
has been slow.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.439
In the past 30 years, there has only been
one promising new antibiotic class.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.099
Recently, researchers from Northeastern University
identified a potential new antibiotic found

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.250
in dirt in a “grassy field in Maine”.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.099
In tests, the compound, teixobactin, killed
off a ton of bacteria, even ones that are

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.510
currently resistant to most antibiotics.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390
But it’s still a few years away from reaching
patients.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.840
At least there’s some hope.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.170
So what do we do in the meantime?

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.709
For the strains frequently found in hospitals,
it’s crucial for caregivers to wash their

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.920
hands often and sterilize equipment properly.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.540
Doctors need to prescribe antibiotics only
when necessary.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.090
Antibiotics don’t work for viruses, which
cause things like the common cold and flu.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.099
As for what you can do, don’t take antibiotics
unless prescribed and take the whole course

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.190
of them to make sure you’ve killed them
all.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.269
Maybe reduce your use of antimicrobial soap,
too.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.620
In 2014 Minnesota banned the use of antimicrobial
soap citing some health concerns including

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.519
the rise of resistant bacteria.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.819

soap might be a problem, check out Trace’s
