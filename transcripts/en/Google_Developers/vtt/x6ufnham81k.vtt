DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Morning
everyone.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.810
I hope the keynote was good.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.100
My name is Dror Shimshowitz.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.520
AJ CRANE: And I am AJ Crane.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.730
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: And we're with
the YouTube product team.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.290
We work on creators
and curators.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.995
And we're here to tell you how
to get with the program.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120
Lots of the talks at I/O, over
the next couple days, will be

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.460
super technical, lots
of API discussions.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.030
But today, we're going to talk
to you about the softer side

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.780
of things, how you can use
YouTube as a great content

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.710
platform in order to tell the
world about your company and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.570
your startup.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.220
So let me just take
a quick poll.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.095
Who here, their company, has
a YouTube channel already?

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:46.220
Can you raise your hand?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.690
It's about 2/3.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.290
That's more than I expected.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.950
What about a Google+ page?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.330
Facebook fan page?

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.690
Twitter handles?

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.970
Everybody, especially
for the latter ones.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.290
So the first question I'd like
to ask is, how come everybody

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.370
has a Google+ page and a Twitter
handle, but not a

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.620
YouTube channel?

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.480
AJ CRANE: Well, it might
be because making

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.710
video is really hard.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.990
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So that's
exactly the myth that we want

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.360
to dispel today, that you too
can start creating videos and

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.800
get your own YouTube
channel going.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.330
And in order to prove that
point, we wanted to start off

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.020
by going down to Ojai,
California and check in with a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.740
local business down there, who
has been using YouTube very

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.120
successfully, over
the past year.

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:55.895
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.740
-You probably thought this
deer was alive, and this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.222
coyote was alive, and this
pheasant was alive.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.124
Nope.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.960
They're not They're dead.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.690
They've been taxidermised
by Chuck

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.930
Testa, Ojai Valley Taxidermy.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.590
I specialize in the most
life-like dead animals

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.300
anywhere, period.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.095
-Look at that antelope
driving a car.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.120
-Nope.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.461
It's just Chuck Testa.

00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.766
-Oh no, there's a
bear in my bed!

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.360
-Nope.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.255
Chuck Testa.

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:31.475
-Hold on a second.

00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:32.440
[GROWL]

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.883
There's a leopard feeding on
an impala out on my deck.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:36.326
-Nope.

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:39.790
It's just Chuck Testa with
another realistic mount.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.490
Ship to me from anywhere.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.160
Call Chuck Testa for the
most lifelike dead

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.735
animals around, period.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.960
-Did that rhino just
order a drink?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.020
-Nope.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.790
-Check Testa does not
taxidermise pets.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.646
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:59.350
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: And if we go
below, we see he's gotten 12

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.900
million views.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.260
So in all seriousness, the point
is, if a local business

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.580
in Ojai, California, which is
not super high tech, can make

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.800
good use of YouTube, then we
think you can as well.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.900
So what we're going to do today
is, first, we're going

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.930
to catch you up on all the
latest and greatest with

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.260
YouTube, show you how far we've
gotten with the product.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.230
Then the heart of the
presentation, we'll talk to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.820
you about all the great ways
that you can use YouTube for

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.200
your startup and your company.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.400
And then we'll wrap it up with
some more tactical tips and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680
tricks and then open
it up to questions.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.650
So first, how far has YouTube
gotten in the last few years?

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.160
YouTube is now watched by most
people on the web each month.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.910
Whether they are coming the
directly to the site, or they

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.610
watch our embedded player, which
is on lots of sites and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.570
blogs throughout the web, lots
and lots of people consume

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.400
online video.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.820
And most of those people
are consuming

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.930
YouTube content today.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.900
It's a huge audience, and
it continues to grow.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.040
And in fact, YouTube is now the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.680
third-largest site on the web.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.670
So think about, if your company
is not on YouTube,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.400
you're not on the third largest
site, you're not on

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.180
the second-largest search
engine on the web.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.769
Beyond coming directly to the
site, when people watch

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.360
YouTube videos, they
love to share them.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.240
This is very social content.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.290
And so, whether it's 700 videos
shared on Twitter every

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.430
minute or on other social
platforms or people just

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.110
emailing and sharing out links
in lots of different ways,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.980
this content is inherently
viral.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.800
And even if a consumer doesn't
have a habit of coming to

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.940
YouTube each day-- like maybe
my mom, she's not a big

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.995
YouTube user--

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.570
I'm sending her videos all the
time, and she watches them,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.060
because I'm her son, and
I sent it to her.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.020
So YouTube is increasingly
getting in front of most of

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.200
the consumers and the viewers
on the web, whether or not

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.950
they come directly
to the site.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.860
Another important thing to
realize is that YouTube is now

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.950
far more than a website.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.860
We're on most of the phones out
there, over 350 million,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.840
pre-installed on
a lot of them.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.500
And mobile viewing of
the site is growing

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.620
by leaps and bounds.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.990
It's tripled in just
the last year.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.980
And I think it's clearly a
question of when, not if,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.700
mobile viewing of YouTube
videos will

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.980
surpass desktop viewing.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.630
So if you take a step back,
and you think about people

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.850
watching YouTube videos, not
just on the site, but on

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.540
embedded players throughout the
web, and increasingly on

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.770
their phones, and now
increasingly in the living

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.700
room, where YouTube is on more
and more connected devices

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.370
from Google TV to Xbox to things
like the Q, YouTube

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.310
will just become a pervasive
part of people's lives.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.040
And not only will we have 800
million and growing users

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.690
every month, but even throughout
their day, they're

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.950
going to watch more and
more YouTube content.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.440
So to show the spirit of what
this pervasive YouTube

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.910
environment might look like, we
put together a quick demo.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.156
So let me show it.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.876

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.030
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So hopefully,
that gives you a

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.990
sense of the increasing
deployment of video screens in

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.970
our world and in our life and
what it's like for consumers

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.830
to have YouTube at their
fingertips, morning,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.190
afternoon, and evening.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.350
So now, let's think about how
you guys and your companies

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.970
can make the best use
of this platform.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.790
So let me turn it over to AJ.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.670
AJ CRANE: So hopefully Dror has
convinced you that YouTube

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.330
is the best platform for
connecting with the world, on

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.620
hundreds of millions of
devices, using video.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.140
But you might be thinking, I
don't need to connect with the

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.750
whole world.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.309
And I've never made
a single video.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.630
So today, we want to give you
some ideas for creating videos

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.409
and how you can connect
your business

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.659
with the right audience.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.730
So the key to success on
YouTube is content.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.250
So without any content on
YouTube, your brand is

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.730
invisible to this increasingly
massive audience.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.850
But most people don't have much

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.830
experience creating video.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:02.570
So we wanted to share a couple
ideas to get you guys started.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.110
So if you remember one thing
from today's presentation, it

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.220
should be this.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.730
People don't come to YouTube
to catch up on the latest

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.830
commercials.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.280
They come to be entertained
and informed.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.260
And they're always just one
click away from other enticing

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.930
related videos, so it's really
important that you make your

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.170
videos engaging and something
that people

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.180
actually want to watch.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.170
So this means creating content
and not creating commercials.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.170
So to test this out, we wanted
to show you guys two 15-second

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.240
clips of different videos and
then have you guys vote on

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.490
which one you want to
watch the rest of.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.030
So here's the first.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.380

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.700

like this before.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.810
It's the new 3M Surgical
Clipper by Remington.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.010
Hospitals are now using it,
replacing blades, to shave

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.490
patients for surgery safely
and comfortably.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.150
And you can benefit from this
advanced technology

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.930

of how our

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.970
So if you don't hook them within
the first 15 seconds,

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.960
it's really easy for them
to leave your content.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.900
So it's super important that
you hook them in the first

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.290
couple seconds.

blades, an aloe vera

lubricating strip,
and a pivot head.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
It's so gentle a toddler
could use it.

And do you like spending $20 a
month on brand-name razors?

I'm good at tennis.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.680
And do you think your razor
needs a vibrating handle, a

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.380
flashlight, a back scratcher,
and 10 blades?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.200
Your handsome-ass grandfather
had one blade and polio.

Looking good, papa.

Stop paying for shave-tech
you don't need.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.610
And stop forgetting to buy
your blades every month.

Alejandro and I are going to
ship then right to you.

We're not just selling razors,
we're also making new jobs.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.830
Alejandro, what were you
doing last month?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.540
-Not working.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.650
-What are you doing now?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.410
-Working.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.805

deciding where you're going to
stack all those dollar bills

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:30.010
AJ CRANE: So making great videos
isn't just about making

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.960
people laugh.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.940
Video can also be used to help
your business in lots of ways.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.330
So first, it's important to
think about what your goal is.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.440
So since you're here at I/O, we
thought that we might have

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.990
a lot of companies that are
getting started, so we chose

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.060
to focus on these three goals.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.940
First is just getting the word
out about your brands and

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.200
raising awareness.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.020
Second, using video
to raise money.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.950
And then third, using video to
learn more about what your

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.010
audience thinks about your
product or service.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.276
So let's start with PR.

00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:13.100
The obvious first video for any
new company to create is a

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.990
product video that explains
exactly what your product does

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.130
and how it works.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.550
These product videos are really
great for you to share

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.010
with any of the press or
bloggers that might be

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.970
covering the launch of
your new product.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.500
The reason being is having a
video included in the blog

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.360
post actually makes sure that
your message is clear and that

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.920
none of the important features
or functionality is overlooked

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.060
when the article is released.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.270
Because there's nothing more
frustrating than having your

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.280
favorite feature not be
included when the

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.720
news story comes out.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.900
So here's an example of a
company named CakeHealth that

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.925
put together a great video
to be included in

00:13:53.925 --> 00:13:55.408
a TechCrunch article.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.040
So including the video in the
article is not only great for

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.010
you, as the product owner, to
make sure that nothing gets

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.480
lost, but it's also great
for the bloggers.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.420
So having a video makes it
really easy to make sure that

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.550
your story's on point and that
you're not missing anything.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.710
So while the product videos
are great, you can't

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.440
just stop at one.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.000
It's not a one-time thing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.040
Instead, this should be an
ongoing thing as you develop

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.380
new features.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.770
So this is especially important
for really complex

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:39.100
products that are better said
broken into more digestible

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.220
chunks for today's increasingly
ADD audience.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.930
Salesforce has done a really
good job of this.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.870
They actually have almost 3,000
videos on their channel

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.670
and have accumulated 9
million views, across

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.760
all of those videos.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.950
And this is almost as effective
for them as a second

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.640
sales force.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.030
And if you come to think of
it, videos are a very

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.110
cost-effective way to generate
sales leads.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.270
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: What if your
audience [INAUDIBLE] or they

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.776
just don't have that
attention span?

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:14.430
AJ CRANE: Good question.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.420
So animation is a great
fit for certain

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.540
products and audiences.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.240
So back at the Tube, we recently
launched a feature

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.710
called suggested edits.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.110
And so this feature is really
targeted at the kind of user

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.070
who doesn't want to download
editing software, doesn't want

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.750
to watch tutorials and
screencasts on how to use that

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.950
editing software.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.880
Instead, they just want to click
a button and have their

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.340
video work.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.580
So instead of doing a
screencast, we created this

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.790
quick, fun, 30-second animation
that got the message

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.620
of the new feature across
in a super casual way.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.870
So let's take a look.

00:15:57.342 --> 00:15:57.840
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.500
-Hey, you.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.660
Enjoy uploading videos to
YouTube, but have problems

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.300
with shaky footage?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.900
YouTube now automatically
detects problems with your

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.310
videos and can color correct and
stabilize shaky footage.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.080
So you can worry more about
free-falling, ten-hanging,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.990
two-wheeling, top-roping,
pet-wrangling, and

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.020
face-planting, and less
about a steady camera.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.770
So keep those videos rolling
in, and keep an eye out for

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.485
more innovations from
the YouTube team.

00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:35.245
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.940
AJ CRANE: So animation is also
great if you're a little

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.480
camera shy.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.070
It's a great way to not have
your face on camera but still

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.150
get the message across.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.260
The other thing you might be
thinking is, I don't have the

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.060
budget to create an animation
like this.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.230
So stop motion is also
a great alternative.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.800
And I'm going to show you
guys an example of

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.050
that in a couple minutes.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.970
So in addition to product
videos, you can also use

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.950
sight, sound, and motion to get
the word out about your

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.250
brands without even mentioning
your product.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.380
So Etsy, as some of you might
know, is a really awesome

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.859
platform that allows artisans
from all over the world to

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.810
sell their products online.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.880
While the platform and the
technology is super cool, the

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.930
best thing about Etsy is this
huge community of artisans

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.690
that makes them unique.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.030
So what they've done in their
channel is, instead of

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.260
uploading product videos,
they've created videos that

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.220
tell the backstory about
their brand and add

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.620
color to their community.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.700
So here's a quick one from
one of their artists.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.750
And you'll notice that the video
barely mentions Etsy.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.250
But still there's a lot for
improving the awareness of

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.875
their brand.

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:55.605
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:59.940
-I think, in general, there's
a reaction against digital

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.270
technologies.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.020
They don't seem very personal.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.190
And they don't seem very
different from each other.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.290
And I think people
are looking for

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.770
something that's different.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.900
There is definitely a
relationship between a person

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.300
who wears a mechanical watch
and the watch itself.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.890
Because you are winding it,
you're giving something to the

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.450
relationship, and you're getting
something back again.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm David Sokosh, and I'm the
owner of Brooklyn Watches.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.197
I owned an art gallery in--

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:29.051 --> 00:18:31.840
AJ CRANE: So that should just
give you an idea of the kind

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.150
of content they're uploading.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.430
It's really great.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.020
So if you still have no idea
of what you might want to

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.740
create content about and what
kind of content will suit your

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.560
brand, Dror is going to share
some ideas on how you can get

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.642
inspired and get some ideas
for your next video.

00:18:47.642 --> 00:18:49.930
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So one thing
we think is really important,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.080
if you're going to create
content for YouTube, is that

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.310
you just be familiar with what
content is already on YouTube.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.820
So what we do at work all
day is we watch videos.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.880
That's really a tough
part of our job.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.570
And we're accepting
applications, because we need

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.930
more people to watch videos of
cats and things like that.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.650
But it's actually really
important to, at least, get a

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.360
taste of what the community and
the YouTube audience is

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.000
already watching.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.440
But if you don't have time all
day to watch YouTube videos,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.430
we have a few tools that can
help you quickly come up to

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.260
speed on what's popular.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.680
So the first is we maintain a
blog called YouTube Trends.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.420
And we have a team that scours
YouTube and sites all over the

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.380
web to see what's popular,
what's trending, and tries to

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.570
pick up the memes fairly early
and bring them to the

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.360
attention of the audience for
the YouTube Trends blog.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.470
So I encourage you guys to
follow that blog, every day.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.200
About four times a day,
they update the site.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.120
You can also go into
YouTube Charts.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.150
And for each category, each
vertical, each type of

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.500
content, you can see what's
been the most popular.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.540
So for comedy or sports or
different topics, you can see

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.760
what's worked really well.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.070
Now, if you want to get
even more analytical--

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.480
actually, before I talk about
analytical, I want to talk

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.860
about cats.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.780
So there are a lot of cat
videos on YouTube.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.590
And they do all sorts of
interesting things.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.940
And so you might wonder, how
do these cats come up with

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.830
what they're going
to do on video?

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.690
Well, we think that they watch
YouTube, and they copy what

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.900
other cats are doing.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.380
So we encourage you guys
to do the same.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.720
But if you want to be more
analytical about it, our real

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.840
power tool is the Trends
Dashboard, especially if you

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.920
know what audience you're
going after.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.310
So let's say your product is
targeting Buffalo or is

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.190
targeting males that are 15 to
24, you can dive in, slice and

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.280
dice the data, and see which
videos are appealing to that

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.370
demographic.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.150
You can go to different cities,
different countries,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.800
and just see what's playing
well across the world.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.570
And this can be really powerful
for helping you

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.200
understand your intended
audience.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.310
So if you're still not inspired,
and you still don't

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.100
know what kind of content to
create, or you don't have the

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.020
budget, or you don't have the
time, the next thing that you

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.190
should look at is the
community itself.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.530
There's a very vibrant
community on YouTube.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.490
And there's a chance that
they're already creating

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.460
content for you.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.100
So here's an example of a
channel called Rokenbok.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.480
This is a company that makes
small, toy trucks.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.620
They are really fun.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.550
And their users are constantly
uploading videos to YouTube,

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.100
playing with the little,
remote control trucks.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.720
And what Rokenbok has done is,
they have found these videos

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.860
across YouTube.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.030
They've pulled them together
into a playlist, that they

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.640
call Customer Videos and put
it on their channel.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.130
And they have, essentially,
outsourced the production of

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.760
video to their users and
their community.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.640
All free of charge.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.170
So this is a great tactic.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.040
We call this curation.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.570
And we'll come back to some
other ways that you can curate

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.720
content later.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.910
Now, if you don't already have
a vibrant community like

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.460
Rokenbok, then you should
think about potentially

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.250
creating one.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.150
So a lot of you guys may know
Fred from Saturday Night Live.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.880
He just started a channel
a couple months ago.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.390
And he uploaded a video with
a few simple instructions--

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.870
we'll watch it in a second--

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.550
in order to get a
community going.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.180
So let's take a look
at what he did.

00:22:22.544 --> 00:22:23.050
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.510
-Hi, I'm Fred.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.700
I'm doing a project called "Be
Serious for 30 Seconds." And

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.280
what it is, is user-submitted
videos.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.040
That's you.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.360
Send in a video, and it's got
to follow these rules.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.520
Number one, it has
to be serious.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.870
There cannot be any comedy
whatsoever in it, no humor, no

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.560
smiles, not even, like,
ironic comedy.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.350
It has to be 30 seconds
or less.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.090
It can have no more than
two people in it.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.550
There has to be at least one
five-second dramatic pause,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.140
five seconds of total silence.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.335
There has to be one cutaway
of an object.

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.430
You have to do your best
acting job possible.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.060
And then the last thing
is, it has to

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.276
end with a door slamming.

00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:03.920
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.170
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Got that?

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.420
But this has actually
worked really well.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.510
In just the last two months,
he's gotten close to 300

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.910
submissions.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.620
These videos have been viewed
almost half a million times.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.500
And he has jump started
this community.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.690
And I think we can learn some
interesting things from this.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.790
The first is that a quarter of
the people who submitted

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.880
videos were first-time
uploaders to YouTube.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.140
They had never created
a video before.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.550
But because Fred gave them this
sandbox, this kind of

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.680
construct, and seven very
explicit instructions on what

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.110
to do with a 30-second video,
he motivated them and gave

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.970
them a framework to work with.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.890
And all of a sudden, they were
creating and uploading.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.420
Also, if people upload to
YouTube, and they don't have a

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.000
large audience already, then
they may think, nobody will

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.980
watch my video.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.670
But if you can provide the
community for them, you can

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.590
bring an audience and say, if
you create videos with our

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.570
products, we'll pull them into
our channel, and we'll show

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.930
our larger audience, then that
motivates people to create

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.920
videos for you.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.200
So this is a really interesting
tactic.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.020
And if you have passionate users
of your product, then we

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.150
encourage you to try and build a
video community around that.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.750
So actually let's watch one
of the submissions.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:36.900
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:59.102
-[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:24:59.102 --> 00:24:59.574
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:59.574 --> 00:25:01.410
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Simple.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.660
That was a submission
from Germany.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.870
This brings up another really
interesting tactic that works

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.600
well on YouTube, which
is leveraging

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.170
other people's community.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.270
If your channel doesn't yet
have a lot of subscribers,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.950
then we encourage you to find
other channels, which are

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.410
relevant for your product,
that already

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.010
have a lot of followers.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.050
So what we find on YouTube are
a lot of review sites,

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.270
especially in the
tech industry.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.960
And these sites, these channels,
are really popular

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.680
on YouTube.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.120
A couple examples are ijustine
and TechnoBuffalo.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.260
And they have hundreds of
thousands of subscribers.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.480
And what you can do is, you
can reach out to these

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.730
bloggers, you can send them
video, send them content about

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.980
your company or products.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.460
And they love hearing
from people.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.460
They love getting content that
they can then feature and

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.920
create videos for their
own audience.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.570
So a running theme throughout
all of this is, don't just try

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.590
to go it alone, in terms of
getting an audience and

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.890
creating content.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.950
Think about YouTube as a more
collaborative community to

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.200
accomplish a lot of
these things.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.030
And then finally, once you
have some viewers on your

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.030
videos, it's not just about
raising awareness, but you can

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.610
also drive those eyeballs
back to your site.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.680
So let's take a look at
what's that Zagg did.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.190
They're an advertiser
on the site.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.860
And they've done a very
effective job in driving

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.110
viewers back to their
own site.

00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:31.956

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:03.508 --> 00:27:06.140
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So you see
very heavy use of branding and

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.870
then, on the bottom of the video
was an annotation that

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.880
they overlaid.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.880
And those are actually
clickable.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.660
And they can take [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.430
back to your site.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.130
If I clicked on that, it
would go to Zagg.com.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.330
And this is a feature that we'll
be opening up soon to

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.140
all channels where, if you have
verified your domain with

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.350
Webmaster Tools, then you'll
be able to link, from your

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.360
video, directly in the video
itself, back to your site.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.910
So we just went through a lot
of content, so I wanted to

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.050
summarize real quick.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.260
Raising awareness is probably
the number-one use case for a

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.910
lot of people using YouTube.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.320
And in order to do that
effectively, we think it

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.010
should be an integral
part of your PR.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.820
Focus on creating a lot
of product demos.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.280
But don't just talk
about the product.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.190
Also talk about the backstory
and add some color and

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:03.230
authenticity to your videos.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.920
Use the site to get
inspired, see what

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.280
other people are doing.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.090
Really leverage the community
in lots of different ways.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.710
And then once you've built up
an audience and views on

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.460
YouTube, be sure to drive them
back to your site, where you

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.790
can sell them products or more
deeply engage with them.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.830
But raising awareness is not
the only thing you can do.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.750
So let me hand it back to A.J.,
who can tell you how

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.480
YouTube videos can help
you fundraise as well.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.180
AJ CRANE: So video is also
emerging as a really popular

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.010
way to pitch a company to
potential investors.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.540
Filming a video allows you to
make your message really

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.000
clear, demo your product,
introduce people to your team,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.460
all using a video without buying
a single plane ticket,

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.720
hopping on the 101, or, worst
case scenario, putting on a

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.170
suit, going to an office.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.750
So let's take a look at this
company called Pebble that put

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:04.140
together a fundraising project
on Kickstarter and created

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.430
this video as part
of the project.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.934
So here's the video
they included.

00:29:15.934 --> 00:29:16.395
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:16.395 --> 00:29:17.440
-Hi, Kickstarter.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.180
My name is Eric.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.230
This is my smartphone.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.350
And this my Pebble.

00:29:26.485 --> 00:29:29.130
Pebble is a watch that
you can customize.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.560
It runs a lot of cool and
useful apps and connects

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.190
wirelessly, by Bluetooth, to
your iPhone or Android

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.120
smartphone.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.460
This is our dream team.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.400
It started with a prototype
built from cellphone parts.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.690
That led us to our first
commercial product, the

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.530
Impulse Smartwatch,
for BlackBerry.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.450
The number-one question we
received was, when will the

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.330
watch work with my iPhone?

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.990
Well, we're proud to
say that we can

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.960
finally answer that question.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.956
This is Pebble.

00:30:00.956 --> 00:30:05.177
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:05.177 --> 00:30:08.500
AJ CRANE: So as you can see,
they explain the product.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.540
They introduce the team.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.610
They told their backstory and
also mention some obstacles

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.000
that they're overcoming.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.500
It actually worked
great as a pitch.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.110
And it was a success.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:25.145
So their Kickstarter project
ended up raising over $10

00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:29.175
million for the company, which
was much more than they had as

00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:30.760
their target.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.870
The other interesting fact about
including video in your

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:40.630
Kickstarter pitch is that
pitches that include a video

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.480
raise nearly double as much
money as those that don't.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.730
This is a stat from Indigogo.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.870
So the Pebble video was pretty
well produced, very clear, and

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.550
they clearly had some great
equipment doing it.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.180
But you don't only need to
have these well-produced

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.040
videos in order to
pitch a project.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.750
Here's another example from a
company called MaKey MaKey

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.780
that creates keyboard
input devices.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.280
And they created a really
fun, stop-motion video.

00:31:16.232 --> 00:31:55.750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.247
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.380
AJ CRANE: So this is also a
great example of creating

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.600
content and not commercials.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.780
So this is, obviously, very
entertaining to watch, and

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.420
also was very successful
in their pitch.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.210
So YouTube recently announced
a new feature where you can

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.600
actually link off to a
Kickstarter project or an

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.360
Indigogo project using the
annotations that Dror just

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.720
mentioned, that overlay
your videos.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.430
So now I'm going to hand it
back over to Dror to talk

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.310
about how you can use video to
learn more from your audience.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.710
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So everything
we've talked about

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.230
thus far is going outward,
broadcasting to the world.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.790
But YouTube is a
two-way medium.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:40.640
And it's a great chance to
interact with users and hear

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.050
from them as well.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.170
So if you have users of your
product already, we encourage

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.660
you to start using various
features of YouTube to better

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.920
connect with them and
better service them.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.400
The first thing we want to
talk about is tutorials.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.370
So if your product is very
visual or very complex, and

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.540
it's hard to explain in a help
center, it might be best to

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.170
shoot a screencast and show
visually exactly how it works.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.190
Or if your audience doesn't have
a lot of time or doesn't

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.780
want to read through help center
articles, it's also a

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.130
great tactic.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.030
So, in this case, we
have drchrono.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.140
They create iPad apps
for doctors.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.520
And doctors probably aren't
going to read instruction

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.810
manuals or go through
your help center.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.790
But in a very short tutorial--

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.850
a minute and 21 seconds--

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.280
they explain to them how to
electronically sign the

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.830
documents in their app.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.730
So they chunk things up into
little units, make it very

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.690
digestible, and show exactly
where, in the app, they need

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.630
to do what.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.160
And this is very effective.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.840
Also, if you have a developer
community in your platform for

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.900
other companies, it's a great
tool, where you can teach the

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.620
community, and then they can
also take the assets and teach

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.440
their own customers as well.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.530
How many folks are familiar
with Google+ Hangouts?

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.330
Great.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.330
We love Hangouts.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.540
And we've been starting to use
it a lot for Google products.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.030
So Google Developers Live, over
the past couple weeks,

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.370
has been holding dozens and
dozens of Hangouts.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.900
And a lot of Google products and
Google product teams are

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.090
using this as a way to connect
with users, better explain the

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.239
product, hear feedback.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.880
And you can even conduct focus
groups using these Hangouts.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.360
One thing that you should
consider doing is holding

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.370
regular office hours.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.770
So you can say to your users,
every Tuesday, from 9:00 to

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.350
11:00, we'll be hanging out.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.730
And it doesn't matter where
you are in the world,

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.560
you can patch in.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.679
You can ask us questions.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.150
And it's a great way to support
your users and also

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.570
show more of the human
side of your company.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.150
Now, we know that the
limitation on

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.770
Hangouts is 10 people.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.679
And you may have a
lot more users.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.790
And so there's a fairly new
feature called Hangouts On Air

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.219
where you can live stream your
Hangout on your YouTube

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.449
channel for the entire world.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:55.949
And so that's not limited
to 10 people.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.530
As many people who want
to watch the live

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.650
stream can do so.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.790
You can also choose to make the
recording of the Hangout

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.710
On Air available on
your channel.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.230
And so, if Tuesday 9:00 AM is
actually middle of the night

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.110
in Tokyo, somebody can still
come in, on their own time,

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.150
and listen to the Hangout and
get access to that information

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.970
as well, whenever they
want, in the future.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.690
There are other ways to conduct
research on YouTube

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.200
instead of doing actual
focus groups.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.740
So the first is, I mentioned
before, YouTube is the second

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.430
largest search engine.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.320
You should go in and search
for your company and your

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.560
products and see if there's
already existing

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.900
content on the site.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.910
So here's an example of a
company called AR Drone.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.040
By the way, they are in the
YouTube Sandbox the rest of

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.030
I/O, so I encourage you
to check them out.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.820
And there are lots and lots of
people uploading unboxing

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:53.270
videos and videos using the
AR Drone hovercraft.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.170
And these are great, because
when you watch these videos,

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.550
as the creators of the product,
you can see, how are

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:03.420
people reacting when they
first get the product?

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.410
What's confusing?

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.850
What's exciting?

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.800
These videos are completely
unsolicited, so

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.250
they're very genuine.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.630
And you can see exactly how
your users are using your

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.900
product without having to pay
them or set up focus groups or

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.830
ask them questions, which might
be leading questions.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.330
And so we encourage you
to use this tactic.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.340
Let's take a very quick look at
one of the unboxing videos,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.640
just to get a flavor of it.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.280
So I skipped forward to about
10 minutes into the video.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.040
Here we see some annotations
that the user has added.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.104
And we'll just watch
a little bit.

00:36:44.104 --> 00:36:44.580
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.008
-There we go.

00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:46.960
It's my living room.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.710
So its should be--

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.830
start.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.830
And we're off.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.680
Fairly loud.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.790
I don't know if you
can hear me.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.660
And makes quite the breeze.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.620
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.060
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Quite
the breeze.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.720
Maybe that could be a marketing
campaign for them in

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.970
the future.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.510
The other great product that we
have, that most people may

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.200
not be familiar with, is
YouTube Analytics.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.190
So it's like Google Analytics,
but it's for the video content

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.930
that you create.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.660
And there are a few things
that you can do

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.160
with YouTube Analytics.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.670
The first is you can see where
your audience is coming from.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.150
So if you have videos on
YouTube, and people watch

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.040
them, you can see what
cities and countries

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.470
are they coming from.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.630
You can see what their
demographics are, in terms of

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.880
age and gender.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.340
Just for example,
we have a lot of

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.380
music artists on YouTube.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.540
And they put up their videos.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.830
And then they notice that their
music is being watched

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.870
in countries like Sweden, even
though they've never marketed

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.420
there, they've never
been there.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.110
And so we've heard of a lot of
cases where artists decide to

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.920
go on tour and go visit some of
these communities, because

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.680
they have found a
new audience.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.940
So a lot of you may be building
products, which you

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.460
think are intended for the
US, but may have a

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.920
great, global audience.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.990
And YouTube analytics can show
you exactly where your

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.590
audience is coming from.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.090
Another great thing you can see
on Analytics is the source

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.830
of traffic for your videos.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.070
So where are your videos
coming from?

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.390
Are they all coming
from Search?

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.980
Or are there certain sites or
other YouTube channels that

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.570
are driving a lot of traffic?

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.830
So if you remember back to
ijustine and TechnoBuffalo, if

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.890
you see that some of these
channels are driving a lot of

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.470
viewers to you, you probably
want to pick up the phone and

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.560
get in touch with
these channels.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.810
They're sending you
a lot of traffic.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.490
You could probably deepen that
relationship and get even more

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.010
love from them.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.900
The other thing you can do with
Analytics is you can look

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.656
inside the video.

00:38:54.656 --> 00:38:57.400
And in this particular case, we
see a chart that shows the

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.080
drop off curve of how people
watch the video.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.210
This was interesting for
a couple reasons.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.510
The first is, as a video
creator, you can see what's

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.120
engaging about the video.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.950
And you can continually hone
your craft and figure out how

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.450
to make better videos
going forward.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.200
But you can also put different
products and features

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.600
throughout your video and use
this, as a proxy, to see what

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.960
are people interested in.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.910
If people are always skipping
between minute three and four,

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.580
maybe they don't like the
features or what you're

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.060
talking about in that video.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.060
And that's very cheap market
research for your product

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.310
development.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.870
So we threw a lot at you.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.530
And we want you to remember
some of this stuff.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.740
So we're going to pause here, in
terms of all the different

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:41.400
goals and use cases that you
can use YouTube for.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.150
But before we turn it over for
questions, we did want to go

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.800
through some more tactical items
for how to really make

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.050
your YouTube channel shine.

00:39:54.446 --> 00:39:58.700
AJ CRANE: So as we saw in the
beginning of the session, lots

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.820
of you have YouTube channels.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.230
But just as a quick refresher,
for those who don't know much

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.530
about channels, every user who
has ever uploaded a video on

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.630
YouTube has a channel.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.610
And this is both your identity,
across the site, and

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.680
the landing page for users to
find and browse your videos.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.210
So once you've built a brand
through your content, it's

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.050
also really important that you
can brand your channel page as

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.540
well and that it matches
your brand off YouTube.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.220
So Rokenbok, the company that
Dror mentioned before, has

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.060
done a really great
job of this.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.720
It's really clear to see what
their brand is and calls to

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.860
action, back to their site,
where you can go buy the toy.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.340
And lo and behold, Chuck
Testa has also done an

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.730
awesome job at this.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.170
Chuck Testa has a
really on-target

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.560
background image here.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.560
He's got a taxidermised bear
wearing sunglasses.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.170
And it fits really well with his
personality and his brand.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:58.090
And so his channel is a great
way to let that shine through.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.820
One more thing that Chuck does
really well, that we wanted to

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.890
mention here, is having a
consistent upload schedule.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.476
So this is something
that we tell all of

00:41:05.476 --> 00:41:07.370
our creators to do.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.680
Just like I need to know when a
new Mad Men episode is going

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.120
to reappear on my DVR, it's
also great to know when my

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.760
favorite channels on YouTube
are going to

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.870
be adding new content.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.550
So this gives them a consistent
time to come back

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.160
to your channel each week.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.490
So Chuck does Taxidermy
Tuesdays, and it works out

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.932
really well for him.

00:41:29.932 --> 00:41:31.600
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Now, if you're
not uploading every

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.480
week, and you just can't get
into that regular cadence,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.740
this is, again, where you can
use curation to really fill

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.980
out your channel.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.050
GoPro, the small camera maker,
does a great job of this.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.430
They continually find videos
that other people have made,

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.380
using GoPro cameras, and they
pull them into their channel

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.180
by commenting on them.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.340
So this does a couple things.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.190
It fills their channel feed with
fresh content, every day.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.220
But it's also providing a
shout-out to the community.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.860
In the case of the first video
they say, sick edit.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.280
Thanks for sharing.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.070
It really helps tie the
community together.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.960
The other thing that you really
need to do, beyond

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.250
creating videos, is engaging
with your audience.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.520
So in the top left, we see
that Chuck Testa is

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.580
continually replying
to comments.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.260
He's on his channel at least
a couple times a week.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.200
And even if it's just throwing
a "nope" on there to keep

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.630
things on his message and let
viewers know that he's

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.770
around-- he didn't just post
these videos a year ago and

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.690
hasn't been back since--

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.470
this can be really effective.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.110
In the bottom right, we
see the Fine Bros.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.270
They're very popular vloggers
on YouTube.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.090
And they do a couple interesting
things with the

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.840
video down here.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.170
The first is they picked up on
Chuck Testa as a meme, and

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.030
they played off it.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.490
So they showed the Chuck
Testa video to kids and

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.700
filmed their reaction.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.660
And they got a couple million
views on this video, being

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.710
inspired by another creator.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.560
But then you also see,
in the blue--

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.220
maybe it's hard to
read the font--

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.190
they ask viewers to submit
suggestions for what videos

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.860
they should create next.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.970
And this is a very effective
tool, very effective

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:06.330
technique, to both tell your
audience that you're including

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.020
them, that they get to decide
what content gets created in

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:09.980
the channel.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.990
And it also improves the odds
that the next video that you

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.760
can create will be relevant to
your audience, because you

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.360
have asked them, and they have
given you suggestions.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.100
And then finally, a lot of folks
may think they need to

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.160
get fancy video equipment,
whether it's cameras or

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.540
editing suites, things
like that.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.140
Our suggestion to you is
to just get started.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.710
We've been designing and
investing a lot in YouTube

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.580
tools, so that even people
shooting with shaky cellphone

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.450
cameras can quickly upload their
content to the site.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.760
And we have a lot of free tools
to stabilize, color

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.610
correct, trim.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.730
So it's much more important
to get started and

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.660
get content on there.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.930
And the free tools on the site
can make it look fine.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.300
And then if you're ready, with a
large audience, to invest in

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.850
more sophisticated equipment,
you can do

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.920
that at a later point.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.680
So finally, just a few resources
for after today.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.710
The Creator Hub is the single
place that you should start,

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.770
if you're looking for all sorts
of links on the various

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.090
things we've talked about.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.830
We also have a Creator Playbook,
which is 100-page

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.380
PDF you can download.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.220
And it goes through lots of case
studies, many more than

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.670
we're able to touch on today.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.950
The Trends Dashboard that
we mentioned before.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.800
And then finally, we have a
special section of YouTube

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.920
just for Developers.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.060
And for developers, there are
going to be four other talks,

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.000
all but the 4 o'clock
will be here today.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.650
And you could learn all about
the API and lots of other

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.440
great ways of using YouTube
in your own

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.920
applications and sites.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.660
So final word goes to Chuck
Testa, who wants to remind you

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.250
to make content and
not commercials.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.470
Hopefully, we gave you guys
some great ideas.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.310
And we really want you to get
going and start creating

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.640
videos and connecting with
your users in the world

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.490
through video content.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:58.650
Thanks for coming.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.490
And now we'll open it
up for questions.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.640
And anyone who asks a question
gets a fancy YouTube sock,

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.580
also known as a Tube sock, which
is also very important

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.190
to wear while you're
filming videos.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.559
AJ CRANE: Go ahead.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:18.451
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:21.380
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Oh sorry, if
you could, please, go to the

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.740
mic to ask your question, which
is right behind you.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.490
Thank you.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.890
AUDIENCE: So let's say I have
this great YouTube video, and

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.270
I want to reach out
to my audience.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.730
What are the things I should do
after I create the video?

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.305
What should I do next?

00:45:48.305 --> 00:45:51.390
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So merely
uploading a video to YouTube

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.480
may not be enough, especially if
you don't yet have a lot of

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.090
subscribers to your channel.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.820
So we encourage you to
do a few things.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.100
The first is share the video on
social networks, Google+,

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.580
Facebook, Twitter.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.900
In fact, you can connect all
those accounts to your YouTube

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.930
account and automatically have
your content syndicated to all

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.870
those platforms.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.570
And then find channels that
might find your video relevant

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.020
and communicate with them.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.900
They usually have their contact
information somewhere

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.990
on their channel page,
so reach out to them.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:20.800
Say, hey, here's a new
video I created.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.230
Are you willing to feature
me in your channel?

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.750
A more advanced approach is to
do a collaboration, where you

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.160
create a video together with
them, and it gets featured on

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.320
their channel and shown to
their large audience.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.570
Thank you.

00:46:38.077 --> 00:46:40.390
AUDIENCE: So after you get
started, and you've got a

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.240
number of communities together,
and a number of

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.835
people adding their
videos to it.

00:46:45.835 --> 00:46:48.110
If you get some negative videos,
do you have, as your

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.780
channel owner, the ability
to block or take

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.905
those videos down?

00:46:52.905 --> 00:46:54.810
AJ CRANE: You don't have
the ability to block

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.200
user-generated content that
might be about your brand,

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.420
uploaded by someone else, unless
it contains copyrighted

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.070
material that you own
the rights to.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.140
But in general--

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.050
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: What
you include in your

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:09.350
channel is up to you.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:12.580
So the playlist that you create
and the things that you

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:16.130
comment on and add into your
channel is your explicit

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.060
action to do that.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.140
So you don't have to include
any negative videos

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:21.830
that are out there.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:25.700
AJ CRANE: And another idea is
to include a video response.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.610
So if someone has created a
negative video, you could do a

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.770
video response and try
and turn it around.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for actually
monetizing the video itself,

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.220
if you're making an
entertainment video, not

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.360
necessarily an advertisement
for the product that you're

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.425
doing, what would you suggest
be good ideas for monetizing

00:47:51.425 --> 00:47:52.840
the video itself?

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.180
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: So a
very timely question.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.720
We have the YouTube
Partner Program.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.470
Partners are video creators
who monetize on the site.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:04.590
And we're now opening that
up to just about anyone.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.350
So as long as your account is in
good standing, meaning you

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.590
haven't violated the terms of
service of the site, you're

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:13.640
not uploading pirated material,
then you can go into

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.570
your video manager, opt in to
become a YouTube Partner.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.580
And we will start sharing
revenue with you right away.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.327
So I encourage you to
look into that.

00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:28.970
AUDIENCE: Similar question,
like the previous one.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.840
Except become the YouTube
partner, or as a YouTube

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:38.310
Partner, can I use the space as
an advertisement, like in

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.976
the design or somewhere?

00:48:40.976 --> 00:48:42.280
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: You mean the
background around the--

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the bar.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:47.580
AJ CRANE: So it's against out
terms of service to sell your

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.160
background image or your
annotations to an advertiser.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.870
But you can use those as
supported branding or

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:59.045
value-add to whoever might
be your sponsor.

00:48:59.045 --> 00:49:00.305
AUDIENCE: That's possible?

00:49:00.305 --> 00:49:03.770
As a supported value-add
it is OK?

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.350
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: As long
as it's not technically

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.290
advertising.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.160
But the most effective
advertising on YouTube is

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.070
video advertising.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.900
That has the highest CPMs.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.310
And so the pre-rolls in front
of the videos are what make

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.200
the most money.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.950
And if you become a YouTube
partner, and you opt into that

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:21.695
ad format, that's how to best
monetize your content.

00:49:21.695 --> 00:49:24.470
AUDIENCE: One more question,
then [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.960
So regarding the video
advertisement, can I select my

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.572
own videos for that?

00:49:29.572 --> 00:49:30.934
AJ CRANE: For?

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.390
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: For the ads?

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for ads.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:33.973
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: No.

00:49:33.973 --> 00:49:35.270
So we use AdWords for video.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:36.900
It's an auction.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.710
And it finds the highest
monetizing and most relevant

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.310
videos for the audience.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.360
And it may be different
for different people

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.110
watching your video.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.780
For example, if they're from a
different country, or if they

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.740
have different interests, based
on their watch history,

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.910
we may serve up different ads.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:56.420
And that system tries to
optimize both the advertising

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.240
revenue and the user
experience.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.437
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:49:59.437 --> 00:50:01.922
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Thank you.

00:50:01.922 --> 00:50:03.390
AUDIENCE: I have two
quick questions.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:08.960
One, I ended up creating our
YouTube channel for our

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.910
company way back when.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.280
And now we have 100-plus
videos.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.140
But it's associated to
my Gmail account.

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.280
I don't want that anymore.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.300
AJ CRANE: So soon, we'll
have a solution for

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.910
you, coming very soon.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.740
But that's been kind
of legacy issue.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.430
But we're working towards some
more Google+ integration that

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.920
will allow you to have multiple

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.460
admins for each channel--

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.070
AUDIENCE: And that was
my other question.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.520
AJ CRANE: --and also
own multiple

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.490
channels with one account.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.220
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.090
AJ CRANE: But we don't have
it yet, but coming soon.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:40.720
AUDIENCE: Fantastic.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.970
Thanks.

00:50:46.372 --> 00:50:50.050
AUDIENCE: What's, like, a good
best practice for handling

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.611
negative comments?

00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:54.960
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Yeah, comments
are kind of the Wild

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.270
West of video.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.930
One approach is you can
turn off comments, and

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.450
some brands do that.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.950
We don't encourage that, because
it kind of cuts off

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.880
the community.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.290
And we think that the best
comments will rise to the top,

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.050
in the top comments section.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.550
We're also working on
some improvements to

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.650
the comments system.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:16.990
So, hopefully, we'll have
an update on that in

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.240
the next few months.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.130
AUDIENCE: I have a question on
best practices to limit the

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.240
visibility of videos, if you
have IP or something that

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.660
you're posting, you guys
thinking about doing,

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.420
basically, something similar to
circles, or do you have any

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.960
other ideas for controlling
IP and videos?

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.200
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Yes, so
currently, we have three

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.770
privacy states for
YouTube video.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.640
You can make it private, which
means you can specify a

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.190
limited number of people
to watch it.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.880
You actually name them.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.920
You can make it public, and
that's the other extreme.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.380
And then we also have unlisted,
where only people

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.540
with the link will discover
the video.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.630
If anyone gets the link, they
can watch it, but it's

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.710
security by obscurity.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:06.140
We're also working on some
additional forms of sharing.

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.390
So stay tuned on that as well.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.550
Any more questions?

00:52:15.788 --> 00:52:19.050
AUDIENCE: Right now, is the
best option for this

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.030
community, live streaming on
YouTube, going through

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.790
Google+, and then using--

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:24.810
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ:
Hangouts on Air?

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.360
AUDIENCE: Hangouts on
Air back to YouTube.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.820
That's the best live streaming
option right now?

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.040
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Yes,
that's the one that's

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.170
available to everyone.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.070
We also have a live
streaming product.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:34.500
But right now, that's available

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.760
to higher-end partners.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:39.120
There's a lot of setup cost
involved in that, and it's not

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.810
yet a self-serve offering.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.670
We hope to make that available
in the future.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.405
But for now, Hangouts on
Air is your best bet.

00:52:45.405 --> 00:52:46.170
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.420
Thanks.

00:52:51.659 --> 00:52:54.690
DROR SHIMSHOWITZ: Any
more questions?

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.330
Well, thanks everyone
for coming.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.240
We're really excited about
the future of YouTube.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.770
And we hope you jump on the
platform and help us build

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:06.030
this great platform for video
content going forward.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.630
Thanks for coming.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:07.880
AJ CRANE: Thanks.
