00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hello everyone, welcome the first one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.790
 chrome of the shift I am alberto 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 joint in this video series 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.110
 we'll talk about those integrated tools 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 in chrome that can give us support 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.730
 in the development of our applications 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.170
 web in particular will not be one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 detailed presentation of each 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 single component of the beatles but more 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.010
 what else a demonstration of how 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 these can help us in a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 hypothetical development workflow for 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 any specific doubt you can 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 then I refer you to the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.120
 official documentation you can 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.120
 find on the site of developer sti google 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.420
 well let's see first 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.040
 the application we'll be working on that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.400
 we will use to make ours 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.830
 this is the chromology of the tools 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.770
 here it is called shuriken and it is a small one 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.170
 play that works so on the left 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 we have a bag that contains flowers 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 and if I can, however, this button 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 add a pair to the belt that is there 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.620
 on the right I can then press the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.100
 button that is here and launch them with 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.440
 suppose this fantastic animation 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 that this application has been there 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.690
 requested by a customer is ours 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.310
 hypothetical leader send us some gods 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.470
 notifications telling us that they are there 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 changes or controls that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 we should carry out on our own 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.080
 application because maybe there is something 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 that doesn't work as it should 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 let's see then which is his first 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 message and tells us hi alberto i would 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 a couple of requests 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 you should add button 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.210
 frequent est questions to the menu you should 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.560
 make sure you like it to be red when there 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.580
 almost over with the mouse 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 now you will see black and then you should 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.910
 redo the style of the belt that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.830
 actually it doesn't really fit the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.590
 rest of the page then usually 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 we are used to working with the editor 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.760
 of the source code on the one hand and the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.790
 browser on the other side making changes 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.430
 in the editor maybe by passing the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.190
 code for a bill process is after a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 some time see these on the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.310
 browser 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.290
 this may not be exactly 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.000
 immediate especially when 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.580
 we didn't want to do simple things 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.459
 prototypes in this case the ideal 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 just to make them brand browsers in 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.720
 developer tools so let's go to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.270
 open them to open them we can go with 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.069
 the menu went away tools developer tools 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.440
 we can use the key combination 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.440
 or in this case since we have to 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.599
 edit html elements we can 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.870
 select in this case the most 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.840
 near where they will have to work click 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.209
 with the right and do the inspect elements 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.770
 doing so opens up developer tools 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.439
 on the page the mans with those 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.170
 actually selected this operation 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.490
 there is very convenient in case for 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.260
 example we are working 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.820
 with a very large application too 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.770
 maybe thousands of items save us 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.600
 the effort to go and look for that one 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.230
 specific element within the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 facts then as you see here not only 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.960
 we can display the html code but 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.120
 we can also modify it doing this 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.170
 there is enough to definitely click in 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.220
 this case we take the parent to be able 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.390
 element more than one we will have to create 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.860
 we do and jackson to whom this 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.150
 item turns into a box of 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.260
 text that we can modify in the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.020
 which we can add new element 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.310
 type out and see veiling was 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.920
 added same speech applies to the css 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.680
 below we have css of the element 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.570
 selected right now here 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.170
 we can click anywhere and 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.460
 change the current selector however for 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.740
 the request we have in this 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.920
 moment we have to do an operation in 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.500
 more specifically we were asked to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.600
 change the properties that come 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.970
 applied for cover status ie 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.080
 when there is the mouse over this 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.960
 element here to change them we can 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.700
 use this option here 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.250
 allows to force a state 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.080
 particular on an html element indeed 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.660
 you see that at this moment the button 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.240
 with is as if there were as if he had 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.170
 always mouse over 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.990
 furthermore, the relative has appeared 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.000
 css code that is applied for 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.880
 this was we can that of 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:58.730
 modify it and see that it is applied 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.730
 we can remove the forced state 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.030
 we can see that this state comes 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.940
 applied to all the elements because 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.130
 was applied to the elements 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:15.210
 inside the small delta nav 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.150
 problem when I refresh 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.129
 on the page 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.610
 however, these changes are lost 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.259
 chrome comes to our rescue in this 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.929
 case because there is a very feature 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:32.589
 interesting that is called workspace e 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:35.499
 allows us to work on the browser and the 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:38.050
 changes we make may come 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:41.139
 automatically saved in the respective 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.819
 fan source to do this let's go 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.249
 in the options in we select workspace 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.550
 and add the folder where we have 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.949
 our application that we were giving 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.099
 chrome permission to write to 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:58.479
 this folder and if we go to the tab 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:02.679
 sips school we can open the file 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:10.779
 html for example is going to insert 

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:14.649
 directly here the new complaint 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:17.469
 and restarts we can see that the 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:19.829
 Population has been added itself 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.449
 speech of course for the css file 

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:28.449
 around here 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:31.479
 I open the css file here I can go to 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:36.729
 change the format code to search 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:40.809
 directly the property over can 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.849
 add a new property 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:44.679
 now as you can see, however, to save and me 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.229
 this little yellow triangle has appeared here 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:50.429
 above that indicates to me that the 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:53.610
 file is not yet associated with a file 

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:56.379
 in my application folder 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.050
 to make it be associated 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:03.189
 I can click on it with the right do but 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:06.309
 tour file system source which i 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:08.649
 already suggests which file which then 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:14.050
 matches and then you told me 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:18.459
 restart them inspector doing so them 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:21.240
 I open the file I can go back to 

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.240
 edit 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.310
 in this case, if you don't, you don't like it 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.590
 page also change ignition six 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.669
 never been applied is saved in the file 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:43.460
 source for the last change on 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:46.160
 belt here I had already saved the 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.810
 property to apply and you can see 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.740
 that at the same time as the 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.210
 comment 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.030
 the properties are then applied to me 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:59.750
 we have immediate feedback on the 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:04.870
 changes we are doing other things than 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:08.270
 we can do with html elements are 

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.229
 inspect the properties see the back 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.440
 collins from the geom 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:14.270
 or break points that are activated in the 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.949
 time when there are changes to 

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:22.639
 a certain html element we can 

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:25.130
 see very kind is also if we 

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:27.680
 we select an html element and we have 

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.849
 the console or press this button 

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:35.779
 here to press heskey here if buttons 

00:08:31.849 --> 00:08:37.550
 we use the special pain whine 0 

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:39.830
 we see that this is the element that we 

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.140
 we have selected we also have a 

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.820
 dollar one was the item and selected 

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.600
 previously and so on so if it 

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.130
 we want to do some operations 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.140
 javascript 

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:51.170
 on these elements we can do them 

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.529
 directly this way without going 

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.850
 to look for them for example 

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:57.880
 document.getelementbyid or something 

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.880
 similar 

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.970
 in the next installment we will see how 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.400
 within chrome we can emulate 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.779
 other devices as we can for 

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.520
 example to test the responsibility 

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.350
 of our application 

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.579
 we will also begin to work on 

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.020
 javascript code 

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:14.060
 in particular the code that comes 

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.920
 executed following an operation that 

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.540
 we have carried out on the page you can 

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.540
 in other words the events of the dom
