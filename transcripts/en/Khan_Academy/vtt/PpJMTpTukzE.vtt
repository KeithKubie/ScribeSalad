00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:03.323
- The light emitted by
high-intensity-discharge

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:06.635
car headlights are very
effective in activating

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:09.086
the reflective paints of road markers,

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:12.230
thereby making driving at night safer,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.910
and maybe we have no error.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.123
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:16.175
What's the subject here?

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:18.743
Well, the subject here
is the light emitted by

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:21.643
high-intensity-discharge car headlights.

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.716
Now is this a singular
subject or a plural subject?

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:27.355
Well, we're really just
talking about the light.

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:28.207
We're talking about the light,

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:30.543
and then they tell us what type
of light, the light emitted

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:33.443
by high-intensity-discharge
car headlights.

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:36.770
So the light is clearly singular.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.559
When you read the entire subject,

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.863
you might get a little
confused because it ends

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:42.846
when you're talking about

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:46.013
emitted by high-intensity-discharge
car headlights.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.206
And you see that headlights,

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:48.299
your brain might be saying,

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.447
you know, maybe this is plural.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.256
But remember, we're really
talking about the light,

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:54.918
and this whole part that
I'm underlining in green

00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:56.586
is really just describing

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.718
the light that we're talking about.

00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.407
So the subject is really
a singular subject.

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:05.853
So the verb that goes with
it also needs to be singular,

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:08.866
but if we look at underlined
part A right over here,

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.316
are is not the singular version of is.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.715
It's the plural version.

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:14.066
So this right over here is plural.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.506
It should be singular.

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:17.904
And to really test why this sounds strange

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:20.566
or why this doesn't make sense is,

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.276
ignore this green part right over here

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:23.466
and just test it out that way.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.346
If I just said, the
light are very effective,

00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:28.265
that makes no sense.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:33.265
I have a singular subject
with a plural verb.

00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.986
So this has to be a singular verb.

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.633
It has to match the subject.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.246
This is much better.

00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:40.502
The light is.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:43.586
Singular subject, singular verb.

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:46.326
The light is very effective.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.329
So the error is in part A.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.166
This are should be an is.
