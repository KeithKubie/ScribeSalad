00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt;Heath Row: Thank you for coming to Authors
at Google today.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.770
My name is Heath Row.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.520
And I'm here to introduce Bonnie Schneider.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.019
Bonnie is a meteorologist appearing on various
media platforms, including CNN and HLN.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.390
She's also an author of a new non-fiction
book, "Extreme Weather," which you should

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.570
have copies of.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.400
Bonnie is the on-camera extreme weather expert
and co-executive producer of a new special

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.619
on the DIY Network called "Last House Standing,"
premiering at the end of March.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.120
Produced by Tara Productions, it's a one-hour
special that shows homeowners everything they

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.620
need to know about being proactive to protect
their homes from hurricane-force winds, torrential

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.550
rains, and devastating earthquakes.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.730
Being in Southern California, hopefully we'll
learn a little bit today about mudslides,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.530
wildfires, and the Santa Ana winds.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.660
Ladies and gentlemen, Bonnie Schneider.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.660
[applause]

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.079
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: Thank you all so much
for having me.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.640
It is such a pleasure to be here at Google
and to be in California.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.850
I was just here a month ago to shoot this
special, "Last House Standing," for DIY.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.760
We went to Northridge, the site of a major
earthquake in 1994, and recapped what happened

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.430
and retrofit some homes.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.479
So, I look forward to sharing that special
with you.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.450
I have a handout on it on the DIY Network
on March 30th.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.020
Well, without further ado, I wanna get to
my book, "Extreme Weather," which really was

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.590
an amazing experience for me to write.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.670
And I'm so excited that the book is finally
out.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.579
It seemed like it took forever to get it all
together--to get it written and on the shelves.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.710
And now, it's here.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.590
So, this book is a survival guide to all types
of extreme weather.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.049
Here in California, a lot of people outside
of California, think you guys have perfect

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.290
weather all the time, but you, as residents,
you know that's not the case.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.549
There's quite a bit of extreme weather in
the State of California.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.940
And through the research of this book, I actually
spoke to many experts in California as well

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.579
as storm survivors in California.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.880
You can see my book covers many topics, including
flash floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfire,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.450
heat waves, snowstorms, tsunamis, all types
of natural disasters.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
And specifically for two of the chapters,
I spoke to storm survivors here in California.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.920
And the first one was the land slide chapter.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.849
And some of you may remember the devastating
land slide that occurred in La Conchita, California,

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.170
in 2005.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.170
People were killed.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.170
It was a real tragedy.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.189
It was in January, so right around this time
of year.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.319
One of the women I interviewed was a young
woman--18 years old--and she was staying in

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.510
La Conchita because she was in school in Santa
Barbara.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.190
And she was heading to class.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.260
The winter semester had just begun.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.200
They just finished the Christmas break.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.780
And it had been raining for days, but she
still wanted to get a head start and head

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.780
out to school.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.070
So, she got on the road heading from La Conchita
to Santa Barbara, only to find mud flow ahead

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.400
of her and behind her.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.900
Eventually, they shut down the highway.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.090
And while it was inconvenient, she figured
that was really the worst of it.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.159
Officials came and told her she had to leave
her car on the road.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.849
And she did, along with many other residents.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.489
And they took them back to town.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.840
And she decided she'd just sit it out and
go back to her house.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.770
So, she goes to the upper level of her house,
which was where the living room was.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.909
And just when she picked up her cell phone
to make a call, she noticed that a side of

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.659
the wall was buckling in.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.680
And something told her this wasn't an earthquake
because it wasn't a shaking motion.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.459
It wasn't happening on both sides of the house.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.909
It was just one side of the house.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.630
So, instinctively, she grabbed her phone and
started to dart down the stairs to exit the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.630
house.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.580
And just then, she felt dirt coming on top
of her face and hitting her in the eye.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.610
And that's all she remembers.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.430
The entire house collapsed around her.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.960
And just by sheer luck, she was on that staircase.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.770
So the staircase, the way she fell, acted
as a barrier.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.670
And along with a bookcase that collapsed just
at the top of her, but not on her, it gave

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.610
her a triangle area where she could breathe
and survive this devastating landslide.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.890
Unbeknownst to her, there was a neighbor of
hers who was heading in the other direction

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.700
on the highway when the mud flow closed it.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.220
He was heading home from work, He was an ER
nurse, returning from Santa Barbara to La

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.560
Conchita.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.840
And he had done an overnight shift.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.750
And instead of going home to bed, he got on
his bicycle and decided he's gonna look around

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.120
the neighborhood and see what's going on.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.660
Well, sure enough, he saw-.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.360
First, he heard that popping sound of the
landslide.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.620
And then, he saw it, the whole hill side crushing
down on the town and on homes.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.220
So he got on his bicycle and he started just,
he got off where he thought was the worst

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220
of the area.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.030
And he just called out, "I'm here to help.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.580
Can I help you?"

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.560
And he heard muffled cries of not just Nicole,
the young woman who was trapped, but many

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560
people.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.930
So, he just listened to where he could hear
the loudest sound and just dug with his hands.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.530
And he managed to find Nicole and rescue her.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.960
And she had a bad gash on her leg, but she
survived.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.370
And miraculously, these two were reunited
again.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.960
And Bill, the man who found Nicole, was invited
to her wedding about a year or two later.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.800
And her grandmother grabbed his hands and
just said, "You saved our daughter's life."

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.850
And I have stories like this throughout the
book at the beginning of every chapter of

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.229
"Extreme Weather," people that I've interviewed
directly.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.050
Some of the stories you've never heard before.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.460
Some are exclusive to the book.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.480
But this book isn't just about survivor stories,
even though every chapter has one.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.800
It really gets into practical, how-to advice
because I think all of us can agree that extreme

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.139
weather can happen at any time to any one
in any circumstance.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.479
And this was just a young woman going to school
and she got caught up in almost a tragedy

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.020
of loss of life.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.050
But she survived.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.490
So many of the people that I interviewed were
on their way to work or to school or on a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.490
vacation when this extreme weather struck.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:06.010
So, it was my goal with this book to provide
readers with the information they would need

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.930
to be proactive to prepare for extreme weather.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.890
And that means not only preparing, but also
giving practical advice of what to do if you're

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.961
in your car and the road floods, what to do
if you're on foot during a snow storm, or

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:22.949
how to react in you're in an office building
and there's an earthquake, which can happen

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.470
right here where we are.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.070
So, the book "Extreme Weather" talks a lot
about those scenarios, including tornadoes.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.070
[plays video clip]

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.350
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Oh, my God.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.350
[wind noise]

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.350
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Oh, my God.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.060
Don't even get by the balcony.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.200
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Ya think?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.340
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Ya think?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.910
&gt;&gt;Male #1: It looks like it's going that way.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.330
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [ ] Oh, my God.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.610
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Dude, look at all the trees.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.319
&gt;&gt;Female #2: You have to [ ] now.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.319
[end clip]

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.280
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: What you just looked at,
that was actually footage of the beginning

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.520
of what was coming into Tuscaloosa, Alabama
just this past year.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.940
Tornado season has been tremendously difficult
across the South, Midwest, much of the country

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.280
in 2011.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.610
Five hundred and fifty two people lost their
lives in tornadoes.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.630
That's record-breaking numbers for April and
for May.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.840
And this one in Tuscaloosa was an EF-5 tornado,
which means winds greater than 200 miles per

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.840
hour.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.090
Another EF-5 we all heard about last year
was in Joplin, Missouri.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.270
So, tornadoes are one example of extreme weather,
but I think it's important to show because

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.410
everybody thinks it's gonna happen to someone
else.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.919
[plays video clip]

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.620
&gt;&gt;Boy #1: I looked at my dad and he goes,
"Buddy, it's gonna hit us."

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.470
And I'm just staring at him.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.570
I'm like, "No, it can't hit us."

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.759
And he goes, "It's gonna hit us.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.759
We have to go downstairs now."

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.250
[end clip]

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:48.419
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: So, the question is, how
do you prepare whether it's a flash flood,

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.460
a hurricane, a tornado, a snow storm, wild
fire?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.979
There's so many different types of natural
disasters that happen across the country.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:00.840
And not only do we wanna protect ourselves,
but we also wanna protect our family and our

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840
pets.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.830
The woman that you see in the picture in the
corner of the screen holding the cat, that's

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.830
Mary.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.520
And Mary is someone I interviewed in the early
stages of this book.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.449
Actually, when I was writing the book proposal
a couple years ago.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:18.660
And she's a Hurricane Katrina survivor that
I found on Facebook and contacted her that

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.660
way.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.569
And she said to me, when I sent her an email,
"I found you on a survivor page of Hurricane

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.569
Katrina."

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.270
And I reached out to her that I was writing
this book.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.520
And her message back to me was, "If you are
indeed the real Bonnie Schneider, I will talk

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
to you.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520
If you're some kind of imposter, I won't."

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.760
[laughs] I was thinking, "Of course I'm me."

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.479
But she turned out to have an incredible story.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.080
I just scratched the surface from what I read
about her comments on Katrina.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.460
This woman was separated from her beloved
pets during Katrina, like many people were.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.550
And you'll read in the book what happened.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.610
I don't wanna give away the story.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.850
But it's an incredible story of what happens
when you're in that dire circumstance of having

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.830
to evacuate with very little notice and you
have animals to take care of.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.570
So, that's something that I talk a lot about
in "Extreme Weather."

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:09.640
In fact, every chapter of this book features
advice on how to care for your pet as well

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640
as your family.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.720
So, even if you're looking at the wild fire
chapter, I interviewed an animal expert here

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.130
in California who treated animals injured
in wild fire and has practical tips for that.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.900
So, each chapter is specific to whatever your
interest is.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.220
And you're, maybe you're traveling to Florida
or to the Gulf Coast during the summer season

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.620
and you're interested in learning about hurricane
preparation.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.880
There's that information for you as well if
you travel.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.690
So, a lot about what I talk about is how to
prepare.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:45.029
And you could do a lot to prepare before the
storm hits or before the disaster hits.

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:49.630
And one of those ways, and I think the main
thing you'll find I echo throughout the book,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.170
is to have a NOAA Weather Radio.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.000
Does anyone have one of these already at home?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.991
That's actually a pretty good number because
most of time when I ask that question, no

00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:57.991
hands go up.

00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:58.991
So, that's great.

00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:01.140
A NOAA Weather Radio is a special kind of
radio.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.779
It doesn't mean it's necessarily very expensive.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:06.360
You can get some for under 30 dollars.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.680
But what this radio does is it's tuned in
to a special frequency from NOAA and the National

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.740
Weather Service.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.560
And this way, you can get these updated watches
and warnings for your area.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.350
One of the reasons these radios are so important--and
some of them have hand cranks.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.660
If you lose power you wanna make sure they're
battery operated because you can't rely on

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660
electricity.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.790
You might lose it during a storm.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.010
But the most important feature, I think, that
these radios have is they have an alarm mode.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:36.920
So, if your area is under a tornado watch
or you're under any kind of weather advisory

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.740
and you go to bed and you're wondering, "Well,
what happens if the storm hits and we're all

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.959
asleep?"

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:46.529
This radio will wake up and it alerts you
that your county is under a warning.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:51.380
And it will give you the information you need
if you needed to evacuate or to seek shelter,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380
for example.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.110
So, this is something that every family should
have.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.250
And another reason you should have it is because
so many of us go on vacation or we go away

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.250
for the weekend.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.220
And the last thing we're thinking about is
how the forecast is gonna be because you just

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.290
wanna get out and get out and enjoy your vacation.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.899
Well, some of the people that I interviewed,
especially on national campgrounds, said that

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:13.800
that's a huge problem that people don't check
the forecast before they go.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.769
And they set up camp and they're susceptible
to lightening or to flash floods and things

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:19.769
like that.

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:23.760
So, just knowing what the weather is and keeping
track of it before you head out and while

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.760
you're away is so important because many of
these situations, I found in my research,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.910
could be avoided.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.490
Of course, sometimes they can't, but if you
can do anything to be proactive, it's important

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.670
that you do that.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.610
Now, during the time of a storm, many of us
might find ourselves at home, stuck.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.290
I know in Atlanta, Georgia last year, Atlanta
is a city that typically doesn't see a lot

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.290
of snow.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.550
So when it snows, the whole city shuts down.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:54.430
And for us, in January of 2011, we had a snow
and ice storm and I'll never forget it because

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.640
we didn't have power, some of us for a week
or two.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.950
Imagine that.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.149
And not only do you not have power, but the
roads are covered with ice 'cause there's

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:01.660
not enough snow plows.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.839
So, you can be homebound in these situations.

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.829
And it can happen here in California as well.

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:10.260
So, you may have heard have your food supplies
and your water supplies.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.370
But I give more information in the book that's
very specific.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.900
How much food should you have?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.170
For how many people?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.170
What if you have pets?

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.089
How do you calculate that?

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:21.600
What about prescription drugs if you have
that?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.160
Or, someone who has special needs in your
home.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.110
How do you take care of them as well?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.070
So, I'll give specific advice, a checklist
on these emergency supplies--it's one of the

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.519
final chapters of the book--that you can take
with you and see, do you have everything you

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.519
need at home?

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:37.519
What do we need to buy?

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.910
And it's just, this way it's peace of mind
that you have everything.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.790
And I just wanna point out something that
may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised that

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.790
sometimes it isn't.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.560
If you keep a lot of canned goods, make sure
you have one of these--a manual can opener.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.690
Because if you lose power and you're using
the electric can opener, you're gonna really

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.430
wanna get to your supplies then you won't--.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.709
So, that's something very important to remember.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.660
Now, sometimes a disaster happens and we're
not homebound.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.660
We have to get out.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.180
Now, this was really evident to me in the
wildfire chapter I did.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.120
I interviewed quite a few firefighters and
captains here in Los Angeles, Los Angeles

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.050
County Fire Department.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:21.450
I talked to people in Malibu, who had been
through extreme fires in 2007 and they were

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.450
evacuated.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.230
And they really told me what it was like to
have that knock at the door and say, "OK,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.230
you have to leave now."

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.950
Or, "you have ten minutes."

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.139
What do you do?

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:34.399
So, this picture actually is from Hurricane
Rita in 2005.

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.560
And this is outside of Houston, Texas.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.600
So, this is what it could look like on the
highway when everyone's trying to get out.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.680
You can even see some people just gave up
and pulled to the side of the road.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.890
So, you wanna make sure that your family has
a disaster plan.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.329
And there's a lot of different factors that
go into that in terms of making sure everyone

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:55.580
in the family knows what their role is if
you had to evacuate.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.589
Does everyone know where you'd meet in the
house?

00:13:58.589 --> 00:13:59.830
How to reach each other?

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.060
If you all have cell phone numbers, make sure
it's all grouped together for friends and

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.470
family so quickly, you can reach each other.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.500
And another thing, I mentioned earlier about
pets.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.279
And this is really key because again, this
could really be a big concern.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:16.639
If you have a pet and you wanna take it to
a shelter, make sure you have the proper carrier

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:20.149
because some people will come up to a shelter
with a cardboard box full of kittens and they

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:21.149
won't take you.

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:22.930
So, you have to have the proper carrier.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.990
And you're probably wondering, "Well, I could
have the carrier, but my dog or cat is stubborn

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.990
and they won't get in it."

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:34.029
There are tips in the book on how to teach
your animal how to be more comfortable in

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:35.029
a storm situation.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:38.610
A lot of dogs, for example, are frightened
during thunderstorms.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.500
And that sound of the thunder really frightens
them, or the flash of lightening.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:48.330
So, I have some tips on how to keep everybody
calm and evacuate in a orderly way.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.079
And in terms of reaching everyone, and this
is something everyone here at Google is probably

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:58.130
even more familiar with than most of the people,
is how do you use social media in a natural

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.600
disaster emergency?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.779
During last year's tsunami and earthquake
in Japan, in March of 2011, we saw incredible

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:11.139
use of Twitter and Facebook and all sorts
of social media to communicate because a lot

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:13.649
of people couldn't communicate with their
cell phones.

00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:16.699
So, how do you use social media in a weather
emergency.

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:20.260
Well, the first thing you wanna do is make
sure that you know how to use social media

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.160
and not wait till the disaster hits.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.209
And I give some practical advice as well as
tips on who to follow on Twitter and maybe

00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:30.510
some things that you didn't already know--free
information that's available to you--because

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:36.329
you wanna make sure that even if you're working
here at Google, you might be the most technologically

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:41.240
savvy person in your family, make sure everyone
in your family can use, can upload photos

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.770
and communicate possibly with a geolocation
tool so you can find each other.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.690
Because often in a disaster, I mentioned the
wildfire knock at the door, that could happen

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:55.269
when parents are at work, kids are at school,
someone's at a friend's house.

00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:59.589
And that's why social media can really come
in handy and help you.

00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:02.490
And I think that that's a really unique chapter
to the book.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.709
And I'm happy that we were able to include
that in there.

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:08.860
So, the book really is a survival guide.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.910
And it's really a tool that you can consult.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:11.980
Read it once.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.920
It has a lot of bullet points, so it's a pretty
easy read, but it's something you can go back

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920
to.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.209
And if you're traveling, you can take a quick
glance.

00:16:19.209 --> 00:16:24.800
For example, I know that we can be threatened
by tsunami, here on the West Coast.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.700
And just recently, there was a tsunami warning
actually along, up and down the West Coast.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.690
But for many, you don't encounter tsunami
unless maybe you're traveling or you don't

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.130
think about it, for example.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.509
And in the tsunami survivor I interviewed
for this book, I have to tell you, that story,

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:45.680
even as I was writing it, I was glued to my
computer because it's so incredible that this

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680
man survived.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.860
He was on vacation in Phuket, Thailand in
2004 when that tsunami hit.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:58.010
And he literally saw the sea pull back, far,
far back, so it was as if he saw the bottom

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.010
of the ocean.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.840
Imagine what that would look like, that site.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.650
And how disconcerting it is to look out and
expect to see the sea, but you see sand and

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.240
little puddles of water with fish popping
up.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.530
So, he saw the water recede and pull back
before the horrible waves of the tsunami came

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.030
in and killed so many there.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.660
So, his first person account that I'm able
to tell in this book is really riveting because

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.240
he's from California.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.780
And he worked overseas and that's where he
was vacationing over the Christmas holiday.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.190
So, he found himself on vacation having to
seek higher ground in this tsunami, something

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.620
he didn't really grow up understanding or
knowing what to do.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.471
So, knowing about these different phenomenon,
well, you may not think it applies to you

00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:41.471
right now.

00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:44.090
You may find some day you'll be somewhere
and it's good to know.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.559
So, I really wanted to get all this information
out to everyone in a really concise and easy

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:50.559
way.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:55.260
As a meteorologist, I had the experience of
talking about these events when they're happening

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.960
in breaking news and that situation.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.520
But I find what really is on my mind is that
I really, if I can do anything to help people

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.900
prepare and have them feel more empowered
and less frightened, frankly, of extreme weather,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.780
then that's really what I'm setting out to
do with this book.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.241
I can remember I had just started at CNN in
2005 and it was the summertime and I was so

00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:22.580
excited to be working there.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.750
And a month later, Katrina hit.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.080
And I was only on the air a couple months.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.210
And I remember driving.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:33.860
It was ten o'clock at night and my job was,
they said to me, "You're gonna cover overnights--midnight

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.220
to four AM."

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.220
And I thought, "OK.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220
That sounds good."

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.760
So, the weather advisory for Katrina that
we were getting from the National Hurricane

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.000
Center from the local National Weather Service
along the Gulf Coast, it was so dire and the

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.450
language was so--.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.450
It's so indelible in your mind.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.700
You can't forget how serious the warnings
were.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.120
I mean, we remembered that at the time.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.950
So, I was driving to work and I was holding
onto the steering wheel.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:05.179
And I remember I was thinking like, "Is everyone,
do people realize how serious this is?"

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:06.570
Because people can get very complacent.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.030
If a hurricane doesn't hit year after year,
then they say, "Oh, it's gonna happen to someone

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.030
else."

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.980
Like you saw on that video when that young
boy said, "Well, it's not gonna hit our house."

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.890
So, that was really the beginning of the idea
for this book for me, is that I wanted to

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.100
be able to get that information out.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.880
For example, in a tornado, you may know that
the best place to be is a safe room in your

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.250
house--a closet, a bathroom, or a basement.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.830
But I also give you some other tips.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.809
For example, if you're driving or you find
yourself in an open area, I just wanna try

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:41.820
to cover all bases of where you could possibly
be when extreme weather hits.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.760
So, that's a little bit about my book.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.630
And it was really something I'd been working
on for a long time.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.660
And I'm really delighted to share all with
you.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.510
And that's a little review I got from Kirkus.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.000
That was the first review I got.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.520
So, and that's what I was happy with that
review for many reasons, but one is that it's

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.960
a lightweight book and I wanted people to
be able to tote it with them when they travel

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.740
and keep it in their car or give as a gift
to someone, just so you can show that you

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.280
care and you want your family to stay safe.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.320
So, that's a little bit about my book.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.820
I just wanna mention also, you can see that
the forward is written by Max Mayfield.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.929
You may have heard of Max.

00:20:17.929 --> 00:20:20.650
He was the former director of the National
Hurricane Center.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.559
During Katrina, he was on television all the
time back then.

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:26.870
And Max really is a legend for all of us meteorologists.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.990
And he is really incredible too, I've had
the opportunity to interview him on CNN.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.740
And so, for him to write this forward was
a real honor for me and it's a privilege.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:42.400
And I hope you all read it because he really
really knows firsthand what can happen during

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.809
the worst case scenario when you're prepared
and when you're not prepared.

00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:50.860
And he's been around a lot longer than me,
so he can really give you that firsthand information

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.059
right at the top of the book.

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:54.370
So, that's a little bit about the book, "Extreme
Weather."

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.210
And I thank you so much for having me here.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:02.300
I'd really love to hear your questions specific
to anything you have here in California or

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.750
anywhere in the country.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.750
Yes.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.870
&gt;&gt;Female #1: For us here in California, you're
in a workplace.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.690
Can you outline for us the best places to,
how we should evacuate or you should stay

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.690
within the building?

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:24.450
I know a lot of people have a tendency to
try to leave the building immediately when

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.450
there's debris and that sort of stuff.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.450
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: Yeah.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.940
And that's actually true because in the research
I did for the earthquake chapter, I found

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.690
that people do rush out of buildings.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.450
And that's sometimes how some of the worst
injuries occur because debris can be falling

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.750
off a building.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:41.530
Really the best advice that I received for
the earthquake chapter is to drop, cover,

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.530
and hold on.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.720
Wherever you are, get under a desk and hold
on.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.740
The earthquake itself won't last usually that
long, but you wanna stay under something that

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.360
can protect you from debris.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.140
With the risk of running out of the building,
you're risking getting hit by something on

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.140
your way out.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.730
Obviously, you wanna stay away from any windows
and that's true of any extreme weather events.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.059
And whether you're at the workplace or whether
you're at a hotel on vacation or you're at

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:11.799
a friend's house, always be aware of where
the exits are and how you could get out.

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:15.220
For example, in the tsunami chapter, I talk
a lot about being aware of how to reach higher

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.280
ground.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.280
And that's also true if you're camping because
people find themselves in areas that can flood

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.659
and you could be in a tent or that sort of
situation.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:28.230
So, you wanna know all the escape routes and
the way to evacuate quickly.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:33.740
Does anyone else have a question?

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.490
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I was gonna ask about the worst
natural disaster that you've seen.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.870
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: I would probably say--.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:46.179
I recently, for the DIY's special, I had the
opportunity to go to Tuscaloosa just a month

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:47.179
ago.

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:49.539
And remember, that tornado hit last year in
April.

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:56.180
So, here it is, almost a year later, and you
can still see the exterior of a building completely

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.299
gone and all the damage.

00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:00.770
And it's amazing.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.820
I mean, I don't think I would have believed
it if I didn't see it in person.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.750
And I'm seeing it after a lot of the area's
been cleaned up.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:11.830
So, seeing the devastation of a tornado, I
think, has a real impression on me.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.780
But reporting even from the studio and talking
about all these different disasters also stayed

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.780
with me.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.880
And I've had the opportunity to talk about
everything on the air that's in the book.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.750
I haven't seen everything personally, but
I've had a chance to at least explore reporting

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.830
on it.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.230
And through the book, interviewing people
who were there.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.230
Does an--?

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.700
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Question here.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.679
What do you think is kind of the biggest disaster
waiting to happen?

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:36.679
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: That's a good question.

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:38.370
I think it really depends on where you are.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.500
I think that 2011 was an epic year for extreme
weather.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.000
We had 14 natural disasters, costing billions
of dollars for the country.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.180
The worst of it, more than half of the people
that were killed were killed in tornadoes.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:57.570
So, I do think that because of the growth
of the population and the development of where

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.360
people are living, more people will be impacted
by extreme weather.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.150
So, it really depends on where you are in
terms of what could be the worst situation.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:11.020
And we're seeing a lot of stuff that people
have said to me and I use Alabama as an example

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.020
when I was just there.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.830
We don't see these big tornadoes in Alabama.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.429
They think, "Well, this is something you'd
see in Oklahoma."

00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:20.890
Well, this type of extreme weather can happen.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:21.890
And it can be devastating.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.070
I mean, here in California, just about every
year, we have the fire season where we're

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.390
talking about homes being evacuated.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.929
And sometimes, you're talking about tens of
thousands of people having to leave their

00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:34.929
home.

00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:37.520
So, it depends on where you are and how you're
impacted.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.049
Last year also, we had record drought and
fire in Texas for example, and the heat that

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:44.250
persisted there.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.250
It was incredible.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.890
Last year we had so many days where we had
consecutive triple digit days in Dallas for

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.890
example.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.679
Record-breaking heat even in Newark, New Jersey.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:56.890
So, the extremes are definitely happening
all over, wherever you are.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.340
I haven't gone to any place yet--I've been
traveling a little bit for this book--that

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.760
hasn't had something where they have that
perfect weather.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760
Any other questions?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I'm quite interested in tsunamis
actually.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.760
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: OK.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Obviously two massive tsunami's
within in the last ten years.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.400
And I just moved to this neighborhood and
you see the tsunami warning signs, evacuation

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400
signs, around here.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.970
Do you know much about how prepared we are
in Venice?

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:25.720
Like, for instance, my house had to have tsunami
coverage, on my insurance for my house.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.750
Do you know about--?

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.779
&gt;&gt;Bonnie Schneider: I'm not sure about the
specific city is prepared, but the fact that

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:34.360
you know that you're in an area at risk for
tsunami is really half the battle.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.340
A lot of the interviews I've done for this
book, people didn't know they were in an area

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.390
where a landslide could occur or a tsunami
could occur.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:49.429
So, tsunami warnings have improved and they
especially improved after 2004.

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:52.580
So, we can be more prepared and seek higher
ground.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.580
And you're right.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.470
We've had two huge tsunami events related,
of course, to two massive earthquakes immediately

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:59.470
preceding them.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.690
So, the risk is there.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.300
And it's important that you know that even
here in the US because I think until Japan

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.039
hit, and then we had that advisory and warning
we had on the West Coast--.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:13.620
Remember that camera that was poised watching
Hawaii and we're all waiting to see what happened?

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.720
I mean, I think that really woke people up
that this could happen in the US.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.080
Anybody in the back?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.020
[laughs] Any questions?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.020
No.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.020
OK.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.039
Well, thank you so much for having me.

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:29.440
I hope you enjoyed the lecture and I hope
you enjoy the book.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.730
OK, thank you.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.250
Thank you.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.010
[applause]
