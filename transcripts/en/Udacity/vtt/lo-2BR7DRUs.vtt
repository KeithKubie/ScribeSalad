00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.160
It's actually quite straightforward 
to make your apps content provider

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.560
available to third party apps.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.240
The key is to modify the export flag
in the manifest entry here to "true".

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.572
As simple as that.

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:15.264
Any app that knows the content URI,
can use the content resolve

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:17.587
would access it
the same way that you do.

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:20.290
Now depending on 
the sensitivity of your data,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.000
you may want to protect it 
by requiring specific permissions

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.820
to read or write to the database.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.060
So if you want to, you can 
effectively limit access

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960
only to other apps you've created,
or to third party apps

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.260
which know the permissions 
and users agree to.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.970
Then you just need 
to publish this contract

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.630
to interact with the content provider, 
specifically the URI and column names.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.690
And you've created a simple API 
for all of your data.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.100
And as simple as that, 
you've created a new API,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.930
just for your data.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.456
This is exactly the same approach

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:50.702
used by many of the 
native content providers,

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:54.460
including the Contacts Database, 
Media Store, Calendar and Call Log.
