<i> If you need to 
 move to a different house</i>

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.037
<i> you might call City of Angels,</i>

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.705
<i> an up-and-coming
 moving company</i>

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.473
<i> that serves the L.A. area.</i>

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.542
<i> But lately,
 owner David Sassounian</i>

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.711
<i> has been finding it hard
 to stay profitable</i>

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.480
<i> with the rising cost
 of labor in his industry.</i>

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:19.152 line:0%
- For us, our most expensive
cost is our employees, for sure.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.521
<i> - But after spending some time
 watching David's movers,</i>

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.556
<i> I realized there might be
 a simple solution</i>

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.258
<i> to all of his problems.</i>

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.660
<i> So I paid him a visit
 to see if I could help.</i>

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.429
Your movers
are very in shape.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.397
- Our guys are in shape,
yeah.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.100
- I mean, lifting
all those boxes and furniture.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.601 align:start position:0%
<i>That's a great way
to get fit.</i>

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.637
- Yeah, the guys are getting
a great workout.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.439
They're always getting
a great workout.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.607
<i> - And that's the idea.</i>

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.842
<i> You see, the average
 gym member in America</i>

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.479
<i> spends over $700 a year
 to perform physical labor</i>

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.214
<i> that's very similar
 to the work</i>

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.083
<i> that David's employees do.</i>

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.851
<i> So if we can make
 a convincing argument</i>

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.786
<i> that moving
 boxes and furniture</i>

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.822
<i> is a better workout
 that going to the gym,</i>

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.691
<i> David could tap into
 an endless supply of labor</i>

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.526
<i> that would actually pay him</i>

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.595
<i> for the opportunity
 to move stuff.</i>

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.473
- People don't usually
pay to work...

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.074
for somebody else.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.442
- I think you'll get
a lot more people

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.077
if they just think
it's a workout,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.378
and we don't tell them

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.647
that they're actually
doing free labor.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.615 align:start position:0%
<i>I mean,
that's just my opinion</i>

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.118
as someone who knows
a lot about marketing.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.219 align:start size:50% position:50%
<i> - I don't know.</i>

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.753
I don't know
if I can convince people

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.322
to do that.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.590
<i> - David was skeptical</i>

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.791
<i> but agreed to give me a chance</i>

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.726
<i> to prove that this
 would work.</i>

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.261
<i> Launching a fitness craze,
 however,</i>

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.196
<i> would be no easy task.</i>

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.598
<i> I didn't know much
 about this stuff,</i>

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.633
<i> but it seemed like
 every popular workout</i>

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.136
<i> was based on
 a charismatic figure</i>

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.671
<i> who's a living example
 of what the workout can do.</i>

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.373
<i> I know I'm charismatic,</i>

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.742
<i> and since the workout
 was my idea anyways,</i>

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.812
<i> I thought it would be easiest
 if I just did it.</i>

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.348
<i> But after reviewing
 the promotional images I took,</i>

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.150
<i> I realized I just
 didn't have the body</i>

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.585
<i> to be a convincing
 fitness authority.</i>

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.421
<i> So I sent my producers
 to a local fitness convention,</i>

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.290
<i> and they found
 a professional bodybuilder</i>

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:06.592
<i> who seemed interested
 in being a spokesperson.</i>

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.628
<i> So later that week,
 I brought him to my office</i>

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.564
<i> to see if he could impress me
 enough to get the job.</i>

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.700 line:0%
- I'm older,
but watch me.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.169 line:0%
Look at me.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.037 align:start position:0%
<i>I can outperform you.</i>

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.741
I can--you know, I look
just as good as you do.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.444
I see this as an opportunity
really for me to teach.

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.513
<i> - Jack said
 all the right things,</i>

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.516
<i> but what I really cared about
 was his body.</i>

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.500 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> - Yeah, you've got--</i>

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:49.202 align:end position:100%
seems like you've got
a good bod.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.670
- Thank you.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.005
<i> Jack got the job.</i>

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.674
<i> And because his role as
 spokesman would be so crucial,</i>

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.677
<i> I prepared an extensive
 contract for him to sign.</i>

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.078 size:84% position:58%
In the event of your death,

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.680 align:end position:100%
we have the rights
to your name, likeness.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.647 align:start position:0%
- Sure, sure.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.316
- DNA as well.
-<i> Okay.</i>

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.550 align:end position:100%
- Is that--
are you comfortable with that?

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:05.685
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.686 align:start position:0%
- That's fine.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.654
<i> - With Jack on board,</i>

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.688
<i> I walked him through
 my concept</i>

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.190
<i> for a new workout called
 The Movement</i>

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:14.160
<i> that would consist entirely
 of moving boxes and furniture</i>

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.128
<i> from one location
 to another.</i>

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.197
<i> My plan was to position Jack</i>

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.433
<i> as the guru behind
 this workout</i>

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.068
<i> in the hopes
 I could convince people</i>

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.436
<i> he got his amazing physique</i>

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.638
<i> solely from lifting
 household items.</i>

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.574 align:start size:75% position:25%
Let's see some attitude.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.042 align:start position:0%
<i>Beautiful.</i>

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:31.644
<i> And to really
 sell this idea,</i>

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.579
<i> I hired an obese look-alike</i>

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:36.549
<i> to pose as Jack
 before he lost the weight.</i>

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.818
<i> Now that The Movement
 had its figurehead,</i>

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.654
<i> I wanted to legitimize Jack
 with his own book.</i>

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.022
<i> So to get
 the job done quickly,</i>

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:46.125
<i> I contacted a ghostwriter
 who advertised his services</i>

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:48.628
<i> on Craigslist
 and invited him to my office</i>

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.264
<i> to see if he was right
 for the task.</i>

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.698
- What I'm looking for
is someone who knows

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.567
a lot about fitness.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.702 line:0%
- Okay.
-<i> Is that you?</i>

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.504 line:0%
- Yes.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.139 line:0%
- You know, for my own
due diligence,

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:01.607
I need to know
you're a good writer

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.676
before hiring you,
obviously.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.278
- Yeah.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.780
- So can you come up with
an original sentence right now

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.316
and tell it to me?

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.085
- Um...

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.457
Okay.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.661
Um, the candles flickered,
the sheets were still,

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:26.032
but all the energy in the room
surrounded Roman and Kenzie.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.702 size:84% position:42%
Kenzie stepped forth and...

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:33.239
gently touched Roman's arm.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.741
He suddenly felt weak in
his legs and trembled and fell

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:40.579
as if his Achilles heel
had been struck by a blade,

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:44.750
but all it was
was simply a woman's touch.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:46.686
- Wow.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.787
That was a good sentence.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.322
- Thank you.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.590
- Obviously this book
would be more fitness, but--

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:53.559
- Yeah.

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.828
<i> - Austin seemed like a pretty
 good fit for the project,</i>

00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:57.663
<i> so I gave him as much
 information as I could</i>

00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:00.066
<i> about the workout
 and its founder, Jack.</i>

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.702
- What did he do
when he was younger?

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.570
- As a child?
- Yeah.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:05.804
- Some things I don't know,

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:09.008
and you're just gonna have
to fill in the blanks yourself.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.610
- Okay.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.079
- All right then.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.747
-<i> With Austin off
 to write the book,</i>

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.549
<i> I had a cover designed,
 highlighting the fact</i>

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.117
<i> that Jack got his body</i>

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.386
<i> only from moving
 boxes and furniture</i>

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.055
<i> and that he'd never been
 to a gym in his life.</i>

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:24.657
<i> The problem was, in reality,</i>

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.026
<i> Jack goes to the gym
 religiously.</i>

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.395
- I'm in the gym
six to seven days a week.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:31.063
<i> - With The Movement
 about to go public,</i>

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:33.132
<i> I couldn't risk Jack
 being seen at a gym,</i>

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.568
<i> or else we'd be exposed
 as a fraud.</i>

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.737
<i> So I set up a private
 workout space</i>

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.439
<i> so he could maintain
 his body in secret.</i>

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:43.075
So you think this will work
to maintain those muscles?

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:48.080
- If this is, you know,
what I have to do,

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:50.516
uh, I can--
I'll make it work.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:52.618 align:start position:0%
- All right, well,
you gonna have a workout or--

00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:53.786
- Sure.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.621 align:start position:0%
- All right, uh...

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.192
Have fun.

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:01.627
<i> I felt confident
 moving forward</i>

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.828
<i> now that our secret
 was safe,</i>

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:05.331
<i> and I was thankful
 that Jack was so committed</i>

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.633
<i> to The Movement.</i>

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:08.701
<i> And a couple days later,</i>

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.370
<i> Austin returned
 with the completed book.</i>

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:13.572 align:start size:34% position:66%
Steve Jobs?

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:16.008 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.713 align:start position:0%
I was one of his
childhood friends.

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:21.714 align:start size:34% position:66%
- Oh, okay.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:23.716
<i> Austin had taken a
 few liberties</i>

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.351
<i> with Jack's life story,</i>

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.053
<i> but for my purposes
 it would work.</i>

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.789
<i> So I rushed published
 a bunch of copies</i>

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:32.491
<i> and mailed them to media
 outlets throughout the state</i>

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.727
<i> in the hopes
 I'd get some interest.</i>

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.795
<i> And as luck would have it,</i>

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:40.032
<i> we soon got the big break
 we needed.</i>

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.768
-<i> So I have some exciting news.</i>
- Okay.

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:46.038
- One of the most popular
morning news shows in the state

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.641
wants you to talk about
The Movement

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:51.444
live on air tomorrow morning.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.245
- Oh. Okay.

00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:54.313
Wow.

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:55.481 align:start size:56% position:44%
-<i> How do you feel?</i>

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:57.483
- I felt, uh--

00:06:57.516 --> 00:07:00.986
I felt like a--
I felt a rush go right by me.

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.656
I mean, that is phenomenal.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.291
- Just so you know too.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.526
I gave them this book...
-<i> Okay.</i>

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.094
- That I had ghostwritten
about your life.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:10.496
- Mm-kay.

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.032
- Obviously the author
didn't know anything about you.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.033
- Right.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.201 align:end position:100%
<i> - So he kinda made
 some stuff up.</i>

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.268
- Okay.

- It seems like
a big part of it

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.638

I don't know what that is, but
you might want to bring it up,
