00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.401
SPEAKER 1: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.608
We're going to talk more
about new capabilities we're

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.570
releasing, as well as
the improvements we're

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.990
making to the platforms and
tools you use every day.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.780
SPEAKER 2: Today, we are
excited to announce the new app

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.460
model for Android.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.430
Using the Android App Bundle,
a new publishing format,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.860
you can dramatically
reduce app size.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.220
We're announcing Android
Jetpack, the next generation

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.610
of Android APIs to accelerate
Android development.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.630
Jetpack is a set of
libraries and tools.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.780
Jetpack's APIs are
integrated with the IDE, too.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.400
For instance, Android Studio now
includes a navigation editor,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.620
which works with the library.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.710
You told us work on
Emulator boot time.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.521
SPEAKER 3: Ready, set, go.

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.104
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:49.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.960
SPEAKER 3: I was not cheating.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.090
It was not running
in the background.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.590
SPEAKER 2: Slices are a cool,
new way to drive reengagement.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.970
We wanted these to
be easy to build,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.590
so you'll find templates
that are rich and flexible.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.424
And because it's Jetpack,
Slices work on 95% of devices.

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:08.840
SPEAKER 4: And
starting today, you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.190
can deeply customize the
appearance of your action.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.040
First, we're making
it even easier

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.620
for you to promote your
action with something

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.290
new we call Action Links.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.820
Right there at the bottom.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.860
These are hyperlinks
that you can

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.090
use from anywhere that point
directly into your action.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.610
Once users opt in,
Action Notifications

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.150
gives you a way to connect
with them about new features

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.980
and content.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.320
These notifications
work on the phone,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.710
even if users don't have
your Android app installed.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.730
And you'll be able to
reengage with your users

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.820
on speakers, smart displays,
and other Assistant-enabled

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.780
devices.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.990
After somebody engages
with your action,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
you can prompt them to add
your action to their routine

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
with just a couple of taps.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.520
SPEAKER 5: And we're incredibly
excited that Service Worker,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.180
the underlying new API
that makes PWAs possible,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
is now supported on
all major browsers,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.880
including recently Edge
on Windows and Safari

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.580
on both desktop and mobile.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.280
This is probably the most
important leap forward

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.800
for the web in the last decade.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.580
Today, we're launching
Lighthouse 3.0, which

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.850
makes Lighthouse's performance
metrics even more precise,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.930
and its guidance
even more actionable.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.630
I'm happy to share that AMP
is evolving in some big ways.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.340
Now, all AMP content
benefits from

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.220
a fast, free,
privacy-preserving cache

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.410
that optimizes page
loads, but they've

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.960
had these Google.com URLs.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.530
So we're fixing that with a new
standard called web packaging.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.710
We're expanding Chrome
OS to support developers

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.020
with the ability to securely
run Linux apps on Chrome OS.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.824
[CHEERS]

00:02:56.824 --> 00:02:58.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.690
So this means that many of
your favorite tools, editors,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.390
and IDEs now work
on Chromebooks.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.830
SPEAKER 6: We're
proud to announce

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.170
Material Theming, a major update
to the material design system.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.530
Today, we're also
releasing two new tools

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.570
to make it faster to go from
design to implementation.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.670
Material Theme
Editor-- this plug-in,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.980
for the popular
application Sketch,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.830
helps designers
create and customize

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.260
a unique material theme.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.440
This is the tool used by
product teams at Google

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280
to review and comment
on design iterations.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.760
To make a material yours,
get started at material.io.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.520
SPEAKER 7: Cloud TPUs are
now available to everyone,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.380
and getting started is as
simple as following this link.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.970
We've released a ML Kit
in beta, an SDK that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.700
brings Cuckoo's machine
learning capabilities

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.090
to mobile developers
through Firebase.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.030
We believe success
in AI should be

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.205
determined by your imagination,
not your infrastructure.

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:12.670
SPEAKER 8: Predictions applies
ML to your analytics data

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.560
and predicts the future
behavior of your users,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.930
so you can take proactive
actions to optimize your app.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.810
For example, you can lower
the difficulty of your game

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.140
for users who are likely
to abandon it, or send

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.410
special offers to users
who are likely to spend.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.020
We're bringing together
Google's machine

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.570
learning technologies
from across Google

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.450
and making that available
to every mobile developer

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.700
working on Android and iOS.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.840
And since ML Kit is
available through Firebase,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.330
it's easy for you to take
advantage of the broader

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.669
Firebase platform.

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.460
SPEAKER 9: We're rolling
out a major update

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.500
to ARCore to help you create
even richer, more immersive

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.850
and interactive experiences.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.320
That's why we've created
Sceneform, a brand new 3D

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.260
framework that makes it
easy for Java developers

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.290
to create ARCore applications.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.050
Today, we're introducing
Augmented Images,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.540
a new capability in
ARCore that makes

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.080
it possible to attach AR
content and experiences

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.960
to the physical images
in the real world.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.260
With Cloud Anchors, we
actually allow multiple devices

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.560
to generate a shared,
synchronized understanding

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.310
of the world, so that multiple
phones can see and interact

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.060
with the exact same digital
content, in the same place,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.334
at the same time.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.250
SPEAKER 10: Wow, that
was a lot, very quickly.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.780
Now, we still have a lot of
Google I/O awesomeness coming

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.635
your way.

00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:41.510
Hit that subscribe
button, so you can stay up

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.120
to date with all the sessions
and things happening here

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.930
at Google I/O. See you around.
