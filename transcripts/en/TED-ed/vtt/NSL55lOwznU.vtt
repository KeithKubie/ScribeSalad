00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.588
Whether she’s describing 
bickering families,

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:12.358
quiet declarations of love,

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:13.988
or juicy gossip,

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:18.808
Jane Austen’s writing often feels as 
though it was written just for you.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:22.443
Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness 
informs her heroines,

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:27.523
whose conversational tone welcomes readers
with a conspiratorial wink.

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:31.943
It’s even been said that some readers 
feel like the author’s secret confidante,

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:36.381
trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.792
But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:42.362
is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:46.642
of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance.

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.852
Written in the early nineteenth century,

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:51.282
Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:54.082
of the upper classes in rural England.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.732
From resentment couched in pleasantries

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:59.202
to arguing that masks attraction,

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.902
her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:06.456
But while romance is a common 
thread in her work,

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:10.836
Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.950
Instead of lofty love stories,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.040
her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.513
They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:23.633
and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.795
As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society,

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.055
Austen’s characters can usually find humor

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.865
in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk.

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:35.945
As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter,

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:38.685
“For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:41.285
and laugh at them in our turn?”

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:44.805
And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:49.485
Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances.

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:50.889
At the time she was writing,

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.529
a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women,

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.489
and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.079
and the economic benefits 
of making a match.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.079
The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums 
this up in "Mansfield Park;"

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.891
“I would have everybody marry 
if they can do it properly:

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:13.501
I do not like to have people 
throw themselves away.”

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:18.661
Unsurprisingly, these themes were also 
present in Austen’s personal life.

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.829
Born in 1775,

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.179
she lived in the social circles 
found in her novels.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.459
Jane's parents supported her education,

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.279
and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.302
But writing was hardly lucrative work.

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.542
And although she had sparks of chemistry,

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.052
she never married.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:40.912
Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters;

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:45.222
often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities,

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.530
and rich inner lives.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.880
These headstrong heroines provide 
an entertaining anchor

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.450
for their tumultuous romantic narratives.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.260
Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet 
of "Pride and Prejudice,"

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.400
whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.492
Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot 
of "Persuasion,"

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:10.352
who chooses to remain unmarried 
after the disappearance of her first love.

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:11.659
And Elinor Dashwood,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.089
who fiercely protects her family 
at the cost of her own desires

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.719
in "Sense and Sensibility."

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.919
These women all encounter 
difficult choices

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.449
about romantic, filial, and 
financial stability,

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.411
and they resolve them without 
sacrificing their values–

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.601
or their sense of humor.

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.399
Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.799
They often think they have 
all the answers.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099
And by telling the story 
from their perspective,

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.539
Austen tricks the viewer into believing 
their heroine knows best–

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:46.077
only to pull the rug out from under 
the protagonist and the reader.

00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:49.781
In "Emma," the titular character feels 
surrounded by dull neighbors,

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.141
and friends who can’t hope 
to match her wit.

00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.691
As her guests prattle on and 
on about nothing,

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.371
the reader begins to agree–

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.561
Emma is the only exciting character 
in this quiet neighborhood.

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.951
Yet despite her swelling ego,

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:09.691
Emma may not be as in control 
as she thinks – in life or love.

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:11.748
And Austen’s intimate use of perspective

00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:14.528
makes these revelations doubly surprising,

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:18.428
blindsiding both Emma and her audience.

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:21.358
But rather than diminishing 
her host of heroines,

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:26.588
these flaws only confirm “the 
inconsistency of all human characters.”

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:30.586
Their complexity has kept Austen 
prominent on stage and screen,

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:34.446
and made her work easily adaptable 
for modern sensibilities.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.466
So hopefully,

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:38.446
new readers will continue 
to find a friend in Ms. Austen

00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:42.446
for many years to come.
