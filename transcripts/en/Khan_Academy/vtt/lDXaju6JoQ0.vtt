00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.090
Let's try to calculate
39.1 minus 0.794,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.210
and so pause the video
and try this on your own.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.649
All right, I'm assuming you've
given a go at it, so now

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:14.940
let's work through it together.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.148
So I'm going to rewrite this.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:21.660
It's 39.1 minus-- I'm going to
line up the decimals so that I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.110
have the right place values
below the right place

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.240
values-- minus-- this
0 is in the ones place,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.790
so I'll put it in the
ones place-- 0.794.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.130
And now we're ready to subtract.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.770
Now, how do we subtract
4 from nothingness here,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.030
and 9 from nothingness here?

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.670
Well, the same thing
as nothing is a 0.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.797
And so now we can start to
think about how to subtract.

00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:50.130
Well, we still have the problem.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.070
Well, we're trying
to subtract 4 from 0,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.660
so we're trying to
subtract 9 from 0.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.580
So what we could do
is take this one tenth

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.000
and try to regroup it
into the hundredths place

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.730
and the thousandths place.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.600
So let's think about this.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.576
If we make this-- actually
that's not actually

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:09.700
going to solve our problem.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.100
Well we could do
it, but then we're

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.849
going to have zero
tenths, and we're still

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:14.120
going to have a problem here.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.840
So actually let me
go to the ones place.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.890
So let me get rid
of a ones, so that's

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.919
eight ones, which is
going to be 10 tenths.

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.210
So that's going to now--
we're going to have 11 tenths.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.390
The 10 tenths from here
plus 1 is 11 tenths.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.090
Now let's take one
of those tenths

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.890
so that we have 10 tenths,
and give it to the hundredths.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.120
So that's going to
be 10 hundredths.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.050
And now let's take one
of those hundredths--

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.120
so now we have nine hundredths--
and give it to the thousandths.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.650
So that's going to
be 10 thousandths.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.830
Now we're ready to subtract.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.180
So 10-- let me do this in
yellow-- 10 minus 4 is 6.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.610
9 minus 9 is 0.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.067
10 minus 7 is 3.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:55.150
We have our decimal point.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.410
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.990
And then we have 3
minus nothing is 3.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080
So we're done, 38.306.
