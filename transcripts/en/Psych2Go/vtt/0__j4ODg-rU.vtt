00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.840
"The link between child imagination and creativity," wise words from Hayao Miyazaki.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.320
One of Hayao Miyazaki's very first memories is a bombing that he witnessed when he was just four and a half years old.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.240
He remembers waking up in the night, seeing his city in flames, and fleeing while holding on to his father's hand.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.380
Despite the danger, he was unafraid,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.220
because seeing the light from the burning buildings meant that the sky was as bright morning

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.320
Miyazaki created vivid worlds for many to remember that stems from his stirring childhood.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
This is why Studio Ghibli is more than just an animation company.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.900
It became home to millions of people who choose to believe in something more.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.220
But what's the secret to Miyazaki's creativity?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.960
And how do his stories come alive with such a vigor, hope, and fragility?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.180
As much as discipline and perseverance play the backbone into all of his works,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.480
there's one important ingredient he, and many artists, embrace.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.320
Imagination.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.580
It's true, the most creative geniuses are the ones who never really grow up.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.840
The world can be a scary and dreadful place.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.440
Children are smart enough to understand that when the lights go out every night,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.440
but they are also resilient enough to stand up to those monsters.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.800
When they witness something terrible happening,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.040
they can't help but combat it with their creativity, to make their sadness and fears go away.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.240
It's a curious thing, how playing keeps the brain young and healthy.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.120
Miyazaki states, "The greatness of a mind is determined by the depth of its suffering."

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.720
Creativity had two phases: intuition and analysis.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.720
It's not so much about finding a muse, but rather, research shows, it's about exposure and experience.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.120
It's only from experiencing pain, pleasure, and everything in between

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.220
that allows an individual to understand other perspectives, problem solve, and come up with new ideas.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.160
So, what helps Miyazaki stay focused?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.920
One word: escapism.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.500
It's only when the individual observes the world and recgonizes monotony in darkness,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.320
that they feel an urge to cling and absorb to a different reality.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.440
Although Miyazaki lived through the terrors of World War II, he still treasured the idea of flying.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.060
Spellbound by his father's company that manufactured fighter planes for the war,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.480
he didn't see them as destructive weapons, but escaped these harsh reality through his dreams instead.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.840
This is where make-believe comes in.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.160
Erase the idea that imagination always stems from rainbows and butterflies,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.580
research shows that an individual is more likely to tap into their imagination in response to tramatic events.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.980
At first glance, looking at the colorful animations of Miyazaki,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.800
one might assume that he's a cheerful jokester, but Miyazaki has admitted to being quite pessimistic.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.940
Still, he wants to persevere hope in his films for kids, to build the courage to face to world in all its horror.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.920
Miyazaki states, "When one of my staff has a baby you can't help but bless them for a good future.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
Because I can't tell that child, 'Oh, you shouldn't have come into this life.'

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.180
And yet I know the world is heading in a bad direction.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.600
So with those conflicting thoughts in mind, I think about what kind of films I should be making."

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.580
Portraying emotions truthfully is probably the greatest asset that he has brought to his films.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.440
As his characters always search for something,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
whether it means making a delivery, discovering their talents, or finding their parents,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.540
Miyazaki does his best to illustrate the complexity in the simplest of actions.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.800
He had a talent of finding adventure within the mundane, and relentlessly held onto hope,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.140
despite what he grew up seeing.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.420
Without the power of flexibility,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.800
he wouldn't have opened doors for us to explore his mind that learned resilience through the creative arts.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520
