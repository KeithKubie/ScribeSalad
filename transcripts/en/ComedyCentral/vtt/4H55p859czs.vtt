00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.114
- I'm mad drunk, right?

00:00:02.114 --> 00:00:04.305
And one member of the cast suggests

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:06.533
that I go take a shit on the cop car.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.283
(dub step music)

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.332
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents:

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:27.501
World of Blunder.

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.810
If you've never been this show before,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.701
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.205
about real shit that happened.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:33.319
Give it up for a very funny man,

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:35.118
Mr. David Koechner everybody!

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.285
(audience applauding)

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.435
- Hi.

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:44.237
Yeah.

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:49.445
This is eight years ago,
this is my travel story.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:53.516
I travel to Louisiana to
make money for my family.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:55.512
I have five kids now,
we have five kids now,

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:56.863
at the time we had two.

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:57.851
Go down there.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:00.824
I knew some of the cast
members, it was a fun thing,

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:02.020
not too long, alright?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.661
Get down there day before
the principal shooting

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.674
for photography, I'm not gonna
tell you what film it is,

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:08.522
I'm gonna change names as we go through

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:10.557
(audience laughing)

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.034
'cause I'd like to keep working.

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:14.251
(audience laughing)

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:17.168
So get down there and my friend MC,

00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:19.812
he and I are staying at the same hotel,

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.923
and right out the hotel
about, I don't know,

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:25.837
four blocks across a parking lot

00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:27.063
are a couple of restaurants.

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:29.257
So we have a couple, three, four beers,

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.526
gonna call it a night.

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:31.822
Alright.

00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:34.322
It's like 8:30 Louisiana time.

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:38.400
Heading back and we run
into some more of the cast

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.843
heading into another establishment

00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:42.527
near the first establishment.

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:45.951
They said come with us, like ahhh okay!

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.946
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.927
We go in there, now these
kids are younger than

00:01:49.927 --> 00:01:54.111
I am and they're having car bombs, right?

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.516
So that's an ale of some kind

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.449
and then you drop a shot in it.

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:00.297
I have three or four of those.

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:02.234
(audience laughing)

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:03.734
They go down easy.

00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:06.908
I've been doing it a long time.

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:09.159
(audience laughing)

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.328
I'm better at this than anybody you know.

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:15.860
(audience laughing and cheering)

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.693
It's not a joke, that's
a tale my liver tells.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.819
So at this point, it's
nine o'clock Louisiana time

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.798
which means it's seven o'clock LA time,

00:02:27.798 --> 00:02:32.316
so I'm gonna go outside, call
home and tuck my kids in.

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:35.103
I'm a good dad, thank you.

00:02:35.103 --> 00:02:35.936
Aw.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.474
So I'm out there, I'm speaking to my wife,

00:02:39.474 --> 00:02:41.814
talking to the kids, like I
said we had two at the time,

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:42.647
fine, fine.

00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:44.606
Now I just had, I don't
know how many beers

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:46.858
and I had not gone to the
bathroom, so I kind of,

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:48.255
there's a parking lot
here and I go to this

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:50.667
other abandoned parking lot area

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:54.564
where there's a few bushes
and I start relieving myself.

00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:57.066
So I'm getting near the end of my relief

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.794
and I see a car pulls
up, and I'm like really?

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:00.627
Here?

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:03.108
There's plenty of spots
closer to the restaurant

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:05.597
why is this dick parking here,
oh he wants to watch this?

00:03:05.597 --> 00:03:07.727
Okay, so I shake it off and zip it up,

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:09.920
still on the phone with my wife,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.753
and out steps two police officers.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.430
Oh, well, hello guys.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.434
"Why don't you come here a minute."

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:19.828
Alright.

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:22.757
He writes me a ticket for public urination

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:26.565
as he should, I'm fine with that, great.

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:30.486
Drunk, alright hey, you know
what, shouldn't have done it.

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:33.603
(audience laughing)

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:36.662
But then he tells me I have a court date,

00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:38.630
and I'm like, huh?

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.674
Can't I just pay it?

00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:42.395
"No, you gotta appear."

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:45.031
You know what, I don't live here.

00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:46.833
"I don't care you have to appear."

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.189
(groans) Guy, guy,

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.306
look I'm sorry but I don't live here

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:55.624
and I'm not gonna fly back
in two months to do this.

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:57.559
"I don't care you gotta pay
it," and I'm like (groans).

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.201
Now, I'm mad drunk, right?

00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:03.405
So I go inside and there's
this table of about

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.923
20 people from the cast and crew

00:04:05.923 --> 00:04:09.716
having more drinks or
whatever and I'm pretty upset

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:11.637
and I'm telling my friends about it.

00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:13.765
One member of the cast suggests that

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.018
I go take a shit on the cop car.

00:04:16.018 --> 00:04:19.018
(audience laughing)

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.478
To him that seems appropriate revenge,

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:28.006
let's balance this thing out
here, you gotta come back.

00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:31.479
Well, clearly he deserves
a turd on his car.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.479
(audience laughing)

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.927
I kinda think about it.

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:40.662
I head outside and my buddy MC

00:04:40.662 --> 00:04:43.767
follows me out 'cause he'd seen
what was goin' on in my eye

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:47.655
and he goes, "Koechner you
get your fuckin' ass home!"

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.488
I comply.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.089
Yes sir, you're right,
I'm gonna go to the hotel,

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:57.043
short walk, short stumble over.

00:04:57.043 --> 00:05:01.210
So I'm there, and a couple
hours later I'm in my hotel room

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:05.816
and the door opens, someone
is letting themselves

00:05:05.816 --> 00:05:09.029
into my hotel room and
I'm like what the hell?

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.662
People are coming into
my room, I'm like what

00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:12.938
the hell's goin' on, and I'm
hung over at this point, right?

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:15.045
It's two o'clock in the morning and I see

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:17.239
four police officers enter
the room, and I'm like

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.974
what, what's going on?

00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:21.485
I'm thinkin ' fuck, man. (laughs)

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:26.120
You guys take this peeing
in public really serious!

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.910
They go, "Alright we're
gonna go down town."

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.411
I'm like, why you wrote me
a ticket, what's goin' on?

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:31.685
"You know."

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:33.362
I'm like, I don't know.

00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:37.529
So they handcuff me and then
they throw a t-shirt over me.

00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:41.518
I get into the police car with

00:05:41.518 --> 00:05:45.113
the gentleman that wrote me
the ticket, and I'm like,

00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:46.939
what is going on guys?

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.767
And he's like, uh-huh.

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:51.031
(audience snickers)

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:52.577
And so I see these cop cars,

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:57.134
the other three take off
this way, we take off

00:05:57.134 --> 00:05:58.051
another way

00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:03.350
and then we're kinda
like on a county road,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.987
not the regular road, and I'm like

00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:05.975
dude what's goin' on?

00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:08.162
What's goin' on, I'm sorry
I shouldn't have pissed

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:10.880
in the parking lot, but
you gave me the ticket,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.337
I don't know what's goin' on.

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.482
"Oh, is that all you did?"

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:17.143
I'm like yeah, what's goin' on?

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.060
"You know."

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.269
But I'm honestly was just flabbergasted,

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:26.895
like what in god's name has
happened and been pinned on me

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.179
so I get there, to the station, thank god.

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.179
(audience laughing)

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:38.290
Yeah, it's not safe in
the back of a cop car.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.110
So they put me in an
interrogation room and some

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.974
guy comes in and is like,

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:45.779
"What do you gotta say for yourself?"

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.188
I'm like, I don't know, I got a ticket,

00:06:48.188 --> 00:06:49.941
is this a joke, is this a prank?

00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.369
Is this some kinda prank thing,

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.419
'cause I have to work
in the morning, early.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.553
And this is not funny, "Uh-huh.

00:06:56.553 --> 00:06:58.223
"Alright, well we heard
something 'bout something

00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:00.562
"went on after you left
the bar, is that right?"

00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:02.599
I'm like, I don't know, I
left the bar, I went home.

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:03.905
"Oh did ya?

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.798
"We've heard otherwise."

00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:07.539
I'm like, what the fuck?

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.784
So then that happens,
they send another guy in

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:12.135
and then they send a young guy in.

00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:15.097
"I know you, I like your movies."

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:16.769
(audience laughing)

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.679
He tries to warm up to me, right?

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:22.846
He's super good-cop who I'm
gonna confess whatever to,

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:28.417
and they got me handcuffed
to a fucking pipe, right?

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:30.396
And I'm like, what is going on here?

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:32.251
He goes, "You really don't know, huh?

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.084
"You really don't know?"

00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:34.596
I said I don't know!

00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:36.815
Please someone explain why the fuck

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:40.123
you drug me out of my hotel room

00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:42.359
and put me to the fuckin' station

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:44.859
at two o'clock in the morning.

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:48.112
Then they open the door
to the interrogation room,

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:50.781
and they open the door to an office

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.719
on the other side where the
police officers are gathered

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:55.136
around the phone,

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:01.304
put it on speaker, they
got the waitress from

00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:03.432
the establishment on the phone.

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:05.844
"Alright, go ahead and
tell us what you saw."

00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:07.671
"Well, I don't know if I saw anything,

00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.848
"but I heard about it."

00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:11.707
And I see their faces drop a little bit,

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.202
like, "Uh-oh, our case
is kinda unraveling."

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.202
(audience laughing)

00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:20.803
"Well, now tell us, you saw something?"

00:08:20.803 --> 00:08:24.444
"No no, they's just talking
about it there at the table."

00:08:24.444 --> 00:08:28.741
So here's what had happened in my absence.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.460
The one gentleman who had insisted that

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.543
I should probably shit on the cop car

00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:38.116
then was kind of wildly
exclaiming that I had done it.

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:41.079
And then, apparently,
several people at the

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:43.480
table went and started
looking at the cop car

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.670
like this, you know,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.971
where did it happen, where did it happen?

00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:48.873
And then this waitress was a friend

00:08:48.873 --> 00:08:50.696
of the police officers and

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.610
she went right to their table and said

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.536
the guy you gave the
ticket to shit on your car.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.778
(handcuff noises)

00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:00.611
What's goin' on?

00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:02.706
So anyway, she didn't
see anything, I'm like,

00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:06.578
guys I didn't shit anywhere,
I didn't shit in your cop car,

00:09:06.578 --> 00:09:08.546
nothing happened, alright?

00:09:08.546 --> 00:09:11.867
So they let me go, now the
lieutenant of the bunch,

00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:14.009
whoever the guy is, I
think he's a lieutenant,

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:18.482
drives me home and he
asks me a couple times,

00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:20.432
"Did you do it?"

00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:24.144
I'm like, if you're asking
if I urinated in public, yes.

00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:26.144
Did I shit anywhere, no.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.173
"Okay."

00:09:28.173 --> 00:09:31.354
So he walks me up to my room,

00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:33.414
he doesn't just go, okay get out.

00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:37.581
We go up to my room and he's
leaning in the door jamb here,

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.822
and I'm like, fuck man, I gotta sleep,

00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:43.504
I gotta work in two hours now.

00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:45.907
And you know my trade, I
look good, that's my thing.

00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:49.222
(audience laughing)

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:52.385
Fatties gotta look good on camera.

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:55.356
And he's just chattin'
with me and I'm like fuck.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.121
"Would you submit to a DNA test?"

00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:00.371
I'm like, for fucking what?

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:05.282
Will someone show me the shit on this car?

00:10:05.282 --> 00:10:06.115
I go yeah!

00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:08.722
He goes, "Okay."

00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:11.389
He's like, "Who'd you vote for?"

00:10:12.227 --> 00:10:15.118
(audience laughing)

00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:17.126
I'm like, fuck man.

00:10:17.126 --> 00:10:21.600
So, I'm an actor, so I
do a little bit of this,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.380
you know it doesn't
matter who we voted for,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.895
'cause we're all Americans.

00:10:26.895 --> 00:10:28.463
Let me tell you another
thing, I would never do

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:31.549
what you thought happened out there.

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:34.347
I have a brother-in-law
that's in the force

00:10:34.347 --> 00:10:36.399
and I have nothing but
respect for what you guys do

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:39.212
day-in and day-out, and
I'm sorry this happened.

00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:41.288
He goes, "Alright, you go on."

00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:43.226
I'm like, what the fuck, okay.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.762
(audience laughing)

00:10:44.762 --> 00:10:47.342
Next morning I had to
fucking get up at six there,

00:10:47.342 --> 00:10:50.342
blah blah blah, everyone's like, oh!

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.499
You mother fuckers.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.087
So I tell one of these
people, like what the fuck

00:10:58.087 --> 00:10:59.964
did you guys do after I left because I got

00:10:59.964 --> 00:11:03.110
fuckin' hauled out of my
hotel room, taken down town,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.914
blah blah blah, and they're like, what?

00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:08.068
(audience laughing)

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:10.476
So now, this is the first
day of shooting, right?

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:11.752
So who the fuck am I?

00:11:11.752 --> 00:11:13.896
I'm the asshole that shits in cars.

00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:16.465
(audience laughing)

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:18.665
I know a lot of these people,
but most of them I don't

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:21.831
so I'm seeing this kind of stuff.

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:23.998
And so as filming goes on,

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:26.667
the principal actress in the movie

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:29.677
never quite warmed up to me.

00:11:29.677 --> 00:11:31.816
We had a couple scenes together

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:35.113
and I'm a nice guy, I don't
mind talking to people,

00:11:35.113 --> 00:11:37.631
but this girl would only
give yes and no answers

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:40.628
to my constant interrogation in an attempt

00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:43.055
to start a conversation.

00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:45.185
And I was like, oh well,
fuck it, I don't give a shit.

00:11:45.185 --> 00:11:47.730
I'll talk to anybody else, I'll
talk to myself if I have to.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.313
Hey, how you doin'?

00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.434
Anyway, I have to hire a
local lawyer, go down there.

00:11:53.434 --> 00:11:56.184
He was able to move the trial up.

00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:59.899
So I appear, I think the
whole thing cost me $500

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:04.178
between him and the rest
of the business, I go home.

00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:07.156
Six months later, I get
a call from an actor

00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:09.316
buddy of mine who is now working

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:12.351
with this principal
actress on another movie,

00:12:12.351 --> 00:12:14.184
and he says "Koechner,

00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:18.250
"what in the fuck did
you do in Louisiana?"

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.250
(audience laughing)

00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:25.736
I didn't do anything, what'd you hear?

00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:30.291
"Well, the way I heard
it, is you got a DWI

00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:34.503
"cops hauled you down to the station

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.214
"and you're in the back
and you shit your pants."

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:39.786
(audience laughing)

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:41.529
Alright folks, thank you very much!

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:45.696
(audience applauding)
(dub step music)

00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:49.407
- David Koechner everybody, David Koechner

00:12:49.407 --> 00:12:51.287
thank you very much for doing it, man.

00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:53.389
Don't forget to check
him out in Anchorman 2.

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:55.158
So, last week I asked
you guys to post stories

00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:57.394
of your father, something
in the comment section

00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:58.794
about something crazy your father did,

00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:00.953
and here's one of the really
good ones that we saw.

00:13:00.953 --> 00:13:03.925
Next week, in honor of
David Koechner's story,

00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:05.387

00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:06.699
some trouble you got into with the cops.

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:08.370
I know you have some good stories in this,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.380
I know I have degenerate fans,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.038
so post your best stories right down there

00:13:12.038 --> 00:13:13.091
in the comment section.

00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:14.848
Thank you guys for tuning
