of those things are if you put the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659
of those things are if you put the
 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.300
of those things are if you put the
student first what would the student

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
student first what would the student
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.520

that and they'd all want it for free the
truth is they wouldn't if they didn't

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550
truth is they wouldn't if they didn't
 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.280
truth is they wouldn't if they didn't
think they could get it for quality for

think they could get it for quality for
 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.190
think they could get it for quality for
free so for example there are free

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200
free so for example there are free
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.469
