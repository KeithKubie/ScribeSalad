00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
LES VOGEL: All right.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.740
So welcome to our Google
Developer Relations office

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.330
hours hang out.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.152
And what else can I say?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.630
I'm Les Vogel.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.145
This is Osama Alami and
Christian whose last name I

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:26.970
will not pronounce.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.352
CHRISTIAN KRUZKE: It's
simple, Kurzke.

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:31.320
LES VOGEL: Yes.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.370
You'd think I'd have
it by now.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.810
OK.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.730
And just got joined by Chris.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.615
CHRIS: Hello.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.465
LES VOGEL: Welcome.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:42.400
All right.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
So since Leon was here, and
he's got four questions.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.570
Ah, and Paul Saxman and Joel,
another name I'm not going to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.820
pronounce, has just arrived.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.740
Let's see, so Leon's first
question is about opening up a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.090
way to open source
the ILS app.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.970
Any update?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.120
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.020
We're talking about it.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.370
It's more likely at least in
the nearer term, that we'll

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.070
release parts of it.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.810
So I've been kind of
recommending if you have a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.870
specific question to kind of
post it on Stack Overflow.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.122
And then we can potentially
follow up with some code on

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.000
Stack Overflow.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.775
Longer term, we'd like
to open source it.

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:35.880
It's just a matter of kind of
cleaning up the code and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.190
making sure it's usable.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.070
So I think I was kind
of mistaken, there

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.980
was an issue I think.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.340
It was kind of old news with
iOS or Apple's restriction

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550
about open sourcing apps
in the market.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.380
But I don't think that's
an issue any longer.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.380
So I think they changed their
licence quite a while ago.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.240
So it's certainly doable.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.940
We're thinking about
working on it.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.360
And in the near term, post
in Stack Overflow.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.975
LEON: It's just that from an
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] point of a

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:13.350
view, it's kind of
complicated.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.730
It's going to take more than
just a snippet of code to get

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.300
things going.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.470
So if there is anything you
could release , it would have

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.260
to be something that is
functional in terms of sending

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.840
a code to the device.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.050
That would be the minimum.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.090
It doesn't need to have all the
UI and all the things the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.820
remote actually does.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.510
But yeah, there is so much
messaging and so much stuff

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.420
about protocol you need
to get up and running.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.340
It would be nice to get some
feedback on Stack Overflow,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.790
but practically I think
it's going to take

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.960
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.050
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.056
So I was kind of thinking that
the more complex part of it

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.050
was the parent protocol.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.150
Would you agree with that?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.780
If we were going
to prioritize--

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.120
LEON: Yes.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.170
I would say that's right.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.165
There's a lot of messaging.

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:02.375
There is a lot of
security stuff.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:02.940
Yes.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.370
That would make sense, yes.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.740
I was kind of surprised
the first time I

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.680
looked at the code.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.500
I was kind of expecting probably
more of that to be

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.250
inside of a library.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.220
But in the activities there's
a lot of work just to handle

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.470
all those messages.

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:24.430
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.890
And I think getting the SSL
encryption right is kind of

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.010
complex as well.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.826
So, yeah, I'll take it back
to kind of the product

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:36.465
development team and kind of
see if we can get a little

00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:39.925
more traction on getting
that out there.

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:40.420
LEON: OK.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.730
Great.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.527
Thanks.

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:45.038
PAUL SAXMAN: We'll definitely
post some updates.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:46.360
LES VOGEL: Let's see.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.066
Chris, you had a question?

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:49.490
CHRIS: No.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.070
I don't really have
a question.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.380
I've been building stuff with
the Samsung TV SDK, and I

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.300
would like to port that
application to the Google TV

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.140
device that I have. So I'm
just hanging out to

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.270
learn more about it.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.800
I don't have a specific
question.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.700
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.490
No problem.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.314
You're welcome to.

00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:14.280
If it gets up to 10 people, then
I might ask you to drop

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.720
off and join the
live broadcast.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.220
CHRIS: That's great.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.740
Yeah.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.290
I wasn't sure.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.760
I've not used hang
outs before.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.610
So if I need to do that,
it's no problem.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.430
LES VOGEL: But on the other
hand, no problem.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.280
OK.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.835
I'll move on.

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:27.660
LEON: Les, can I
jump in there?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.400
LES VOGEL: Sure.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.570
LEON: So my understanding that
Samsung apps are basically

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.110
HTML apps, right.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.790
So Les posted a nice article on
that on PhoneGap solution.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.790
So that looked like an option
for him to look at right?

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.200
LES VOGEL: Actually, PhoneGap
and also if you're doing

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:58.040
video, there is a video player
that ties in with our earlier

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.558
Google TV sample code.

00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:04.490
But PhoneGap for a non-video
app is very

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.630
cool and very simple.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:18.045
And we support many of
the iOS style meta

00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:21.810
tags and other tags.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.690
So, yeah.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.067
Take a look under
developers.googl

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:34.840
e.com/tv/android/articles,
I think.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.210
developers.google.com/tv, and
you'll find articles.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.470
CHRIS: OK.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.755
Great.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:43.370
Thank you.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.800
LES VOGEL: And we've also just
published my stream.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.530
So I haven't published an awful
lot in the last week.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.007
So if you just look at all
my postings, it's there.

00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:56.500
OK?

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.430
Brian.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.220
BRIAN: Hi guys.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.730
I've got two questions.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.310
I'm wondering if you can turn
the display off from an

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.560
application?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.380
So like I want to turn off my
TV and have it turn on at 6

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.030
o'clock every day
or something.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.380
LES VOGEL: Oh, OK.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.570
You want Alarm Clock.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.658
Yeah that depends on the OEM.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.660
And do we know--

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.620
OSAMA ALAMI: So right now the
problem is if it's running on

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.430
something like the Blu-ray
player or the Review, you

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.455
would basically need to be able
to send HTMI commands.

00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:41.660
There is like CFC
specification.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.610
Unfortunately, we don't have
exposed APIs for that.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.850
And even the internal support,
as Les said, some OEMs

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.730
implement it.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.581
So the Sony Blu-ray player, for
example, can turn on and

00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:56.780
off the Sony TV. But if you
connect a different TV to it

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.190
then it's already not
going to work.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.595
And there is no developer APIs
that are exposed for it.

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:06.020
BRIAN: OK.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.245
My second question, I guess, is
there any hope of getting

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:12.853
an SDK for the Logitech cameras
that you can hook up

00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:13.410
to the Reviews?

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.160
Or any camera API?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.990
LES VOGEL: That would be a
question for Logitech.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.050
PAUL SAXMAN: In terms of any
APIs, so I'm still toying

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.520
around with this.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.070
My original impression is
that we didn't really

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.330
support USB host mode.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.450
But doing more testing, it looks
like we do support it a

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.190
little more fully than
I had thought.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.610
So there is a possibility that
you could actually write

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.480
drivers using USB host mode to
write drivers for a video

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.125
camera in Java.

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:54.640
The issue is that it's rather
complex to do that.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.090
And you'd actually have to do
video processing in Java,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.245
which is also really slow,
or potentially

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.980
would be really slow.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.440
But we're kind of playing
around with it

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.280
a little more lately.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.820
So we potentially will have
some updates on that.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:15.150
This is also related to a
question that Leon had earlier

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.430
about the serial devices.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.990
And it looks like serial devices
might be supported

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.020
actually via USB host mode.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.530
So if you're following the
thread on the Android, the EDK

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:35.190
post that I put in, if the USB
device is actually recognized

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.546
by the USB host APIs, which all
devices should be, then

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:45.870
you can actually write your
own driver for it.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.370
LES VOGEL: The other thing you
might consider doing is moving

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:56.460
to a Wi-Fi or an ethernet
camera.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.983
It has its own compression.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.630
Because if it has its own
compression then you don't

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.220
have to do anything
on the box.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.770
Some of the newer boxes that
will ship this year have

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.400
enough horsepower to do
compression in the box.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:23.450
But the Review and the existing
Sonys don't really

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.700
have enough juice.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.150
BRIAN: Thanks.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.600
LEON: Can I jump in?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.360
Can I get back to Paul about
that [? serial ?] interface.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.400
I looked at the article
you posted on Google+.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.815
LES VOGEL: Let's see, if I could
ask Matthew to turn down

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:45.258
his speaker.

00:09:45.258 --> 00:09:47.450
Or turn his microphone--

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:47.760
cool.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.390
Thank you.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.890
LEON: So I looked at that
article that you posted on

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.500
Google+, Paul, and in my
understanding, it still

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.070
requires this library beyond
the Java code.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.470
And the library, as far as I
could see, is going to be

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.380
native code.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.470
Since we don't have a compiler
for that, I couldn't see a way

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.910
around that.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.125
At least the rest of the
code is Java, yes.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:14.420
But it was relying on this
intermediate thing to put the

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.000
USB in kind of a
[? serial-like ?] mode.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.030
That's how I read
that article.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.820
I mean there are actually two
of those articles in there.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.160
One of them was actually
doing that.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.200
It was compiling
the FTDI serial

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.360
drivers into the kernel.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.440
And then the other one made it
sounds like it was a little

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.000
bit different.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.920
Like you could actually set up
the protocol handling actually

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.780
in Java itself.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.840
I'm still toying
around with it.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.840
But if you grab that code
actually from the one in my

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.340
post, if I posted the correct
one, it should be a native

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.290
Java app, a native
Android Java app.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.250
LEON: Yeah.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.250
I saw that two ways.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.520
The two ways were basically
relying on a driver, which is

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.170
obviously not practical unless
you route the device.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.580
But the other one, I assumed
that there was a native

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.810
component so I didn't actually
go further than that.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.065
But I'll give the Java
code a try just

00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:15.550
to see if it's enough.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.400
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.920
I'm doing the same thing with
the [? Arduino ?] because I'm

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.115
trying to communicate.

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:21.560
It's the same FTDI--

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.960
I think it's FTDI--

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.150
serial chip on the device.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.960
So I think that you were talking
about potentially.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.070
So we'll see how it goes.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.090
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:11:42.275 --> 00:11:44.510
We'll go to Chris.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.796
If I can find my mouse without
killing my video.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.450
Or excuse me, to Will.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.180
You have a bunch.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:06.720
WILL: Yeah, one of my question
was about Google TV evolving

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.160
and Smart TV. Like will Google
TV eventually be able to tell

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.200
what shows I've watched?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.940
And make suggestions
based on the shows.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.550
So if I'm watching Fringe
then it can

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.040
recommend Alcatraz to me.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.920
Something like that.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.395
PAUL SAXMAN: There are some
suggestions built into the TV

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:29.520
and Movies application.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.729
But there isn't anything along
the lines of what you

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:36.380
described that's exposed
to developers.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.988
In terms of general product
plans, we typically don't make

00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:41.835
comments on what we
are planning.

00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.380
So I can't really add
anything more.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.780
WILL: Can you talk about the
future of Google TV being a

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.260
part of an actual cable box that
you get from a provider?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.520
I think this would be great.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.390
So basically, when you sign up
for cable, you have a Google

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.520
TV box right there.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.820
That would be perfect.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:08.250
And with Onlive as part of
Google TV, you have a console

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.880
basically there too.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.490
That's something I would
love to see happen.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.120
I'd like to hear what you
guys think about that.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.460
PAUL SAXMAN: Well,
it'd be great.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.525
But, again, we can't talk
about what any of

00:13:18.525 --> 00:13:20.690
the OEMs are up to.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.920
WILL: Gottcha.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.950
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:30.755
We've announced new devices at
CES from a of number of OEMs,

00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:33.010
but all the announcements were
around Buddy Boxes, Blue-ray

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.860
players, and TV.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.590
WILL: And the other one,
I don't know if this is

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.990
appropriate.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.790
But I have a Google TV app.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.110
I won't say the name of it.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.030
I have a request list that's
super long right now, and I

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.810
need some help.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.535
So if anybody is out there, and
they want to do some side

00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:53.770
work with Google TV, contact
me on Google+

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.122
because I need some help.

00:13:57.122 --> 00:13:59.174
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I think we're
reviewing your app this

00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.812
week in fact.

00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:03.540
WILL: Cool, I appreciate it.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.682
I would love to be in
the future area.

00:14:05.682 --> 00:14:07.180
LES VOGEL: Cool.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.710
All right.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.850
Let's see, I know Leon
has another one.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.750
And I'm not tracking everybody's
questions.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:24.080
So I'll go back to Leon and then
feel free to post to the

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.080
chat window if you've
got a question.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.078
OK.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.820
LEON: I guess this is still
related to some of these

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.030
accessory things.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.230
So I've ordered an ADK and I've
also ordered on Arduino

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.220
with ethernet.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.080
I'm just wondering for the short
term would it be better

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.575
for me to concentrate on kind of
networking type accessories

00:14:44.575 --> 00:14:48.600
until there's some good solution
for physically

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.590
attached accessories or
what do you think?

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.640
LES VOGEL: Are you meaning for
creating a product or for

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.040
playing or--

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.880
LEON: Well, basically for adding
accessories to Google

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.380
TV. Because I want to be able
to control devices.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.000
And since it's still up in the
air whether we can actually

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.820
control an Arduino or get all
the capabilities at least in

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.390
the short term.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.710
So I'm thinking maybe
concentrating on a networking

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.750
solution if there's another
Arduino or other type device

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.685
that you can talk to, it'd be
a better short term solution

00:15:25.685 --> 00:15:29.260
until there is kind of a real
solution for talking to real

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.120
accessories.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.590
PAUL SAXMAN: I'd say I think
network over TCP or own

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.100
network is actually probably
the easiest way.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.480
It's also the most expensive
way, unfortunately, just

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.080
because usually like the
ethernet shields are like $30,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.600
$40 or something like that.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.870
Or if you get the integrated
ethernet Arduino.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.410
So it's a little more
expensive obviously.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.690
So I think it should be pretty
straightforward.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.890
I've never really played with
the protocol like doing DCP

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.780
communication on Arduino,
but I'm sure there is

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.400
lots of code for it.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.560
So I'd say it's a good probably
near term solution.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.880
LES VOGEL: What might make a
good business or at least a

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:32.220
way to help you is to approach
the manufacturers of the

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.590
devices you are interested in.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:40.450
And say this is what you're
doing and get them to, at the

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:49.350
very least, contract or do a
trade for devices or a future

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.490
sale or something like that.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.260
LEON: Yeah, the two devices I
wanted to play with was, I

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.790
think I mentioned the one
before, the light bulb, the

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.840
Wi-Fi light bulb.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.130
Unfortunately, it's still
not available.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.750
And the second one is a z-wave

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.020
controller, but it's USB-based.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.849
And that's really the only
option unless you do some

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.680
terrible hacks with some of
their remote controls, which I

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.349
want to avoid.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.569
I want to make a plug and
play solution so any

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:18.730
consumer could use that.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:24.349
So on both levels, things aren't
quite ready I would say

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.030
from an accessory
point of view.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.280
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.100
Well, it was just a thought.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:41.400
Let's see, Will wanted to
ask Matthew a question.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:49.390
WILL: And he mentioned Simple TV
in his comments on Google+.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.320
And I don't know what that is.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.530
I was just wondering
what that is.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.190
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.500
I'll ask Matthew, you
want to answer?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.820
MATTHEW: Yes.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.600
Sure.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.170
I was just getting ready to type
that in the chat window.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.530
I'm sure these OEMs that are
working on future hardware

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.960
will likely build something
into one of these devices.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.475
But Simple TV is coming out with
something to stream off

00:18:19.475 --> 00:18:24.980
air content into MPEG-4.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.760
I'm wondering if you guys are
aware of any others that have

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.060
come up with similar kinds of
solutions that are out there

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.230
to be able to take advantage
of that content that's

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.630
available off air at
a very good price?

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.270
LES VOGEL: Everyone is
shaking their heads.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.730
So I think the answer
is haven't really

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.568
been looking at it.

00:18:59.568 --> 00:19:05.040
PAUL SAXMAN: I can't say that
I'm familiar with it.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.920
LES VOGEL: All right.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.170
Who's got another question?

00:19:09.992 --> 00:19:13.080
All right, it's going to
be a short day today.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.330
Oh, here er go.

00:19:16.751 --> 00:19:18.140
CHRIS: Good timing.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.532
LES VOGEL: Perfect
timing indeed.

00:19:20.532 --> 00:19:22.080
CHRIS: Do you want me
to just state it?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.475
LES VOGEL: Yes.

00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:23.470
Might as well.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.780
CHRIS: OK.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.110
So I built a Samsung TV
app, and I'd like to

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.680
port it, as I mentioned.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.920
Samsung has two types of apps.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.070
They have regular apps
and ticker apps.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.510
Ticker apps are essentially
apps that are overlaid on

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.820
regular TV content, whereas
normal apps are taking up the

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.530
entire screen.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.400
So what I'd like to know is
I was just reviewing the

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.430
PhoneGap document that
you pointed out,

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.470
and that looks great.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.520
I'm wondering if there's a way
that I can take a PhoneGap app

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.030
and overlay it on regular TV?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.500
If there's anything special I
need to do, or if I would need

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.470
to look at building that as a
regular Android application,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.690
as a Java based application
or where I should look?

00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.850
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:08.140
You definitely are going to
have to do an Android app.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:14.410
So we've been kind of
restricting talking about how

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.080
to overlay, but that's what
developers really want to do.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.110
So there are two ways
we talk about it.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:36.155
One is if you send an intent to
change the channel changing

00:20:36.155 --> 00:20:40.320
intent and using the
content provider.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.575
And then you can fire a second
intent about a half second to

00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:57.180
a second later to your app to
come forward and then the

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.790
activity that comes forward
should have apparent

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.080
background except where
you want content.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.250
That has the drawback that
the remote controls

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.010
don't work and such.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.100
We've recently found another
way that none of us have

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.380
tried, but Paul has an idea.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.760
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.390
So Android has a feature
called the

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.910
System Alert Windows.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.530
And the System Alert Windows
are a way to actually bring

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.630
Windows in front of other
applications.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.770
The issue with it is though
is that these tend to

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.440
be annoying to users.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.180
And they're there all
the time unless you

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.875
[? exit or erratically ?]

00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:45.125
close them.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.990
But if you want to look into it,
if you just Google search

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.200
System Alert Window with
underscores in between, then

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.330
you should be able to find
some documentation on

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.350
setting those up.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.600
They're not very well documented
even in Android I

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.480
think just because
they're not--

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:07.440
LES VOGEL: There is a Stack
Overflow article.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.790
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:12.380
I think you'll find something
in Stack Overflow as well.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.290
But yeah, System Alert Windows
are another way just to bring

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:21.740
a dialogue in front of
running applications.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.360
LES VOGEL: In addition,
you probably

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.610
won't have DPad support.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:33.840
So that's fine for a ticker,
but it's for apps that want

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:41.726
interactivity, it's going to
be a little difficult.

00:22:41.726 --> 00:22:42.140
CHRIS: OK.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.280
Not a problem for me.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.998
Thanks.

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:49.380
LEON: So Les, in terms of that
first option, could you post

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.330
some kind of code snippet
on that one?

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.310
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.104
Engineering probably won't
want us to do that.

00:22:58.104 --> 00:22:59.090
LEON: Oh, OK.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.410
LES VOGEL: That's why I've never
posted comments on this,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.110
though I do talk about
it in the hang outs.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.130
And I don't post in
the hang outs.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:17.060
But part of it is that we are
trying to let engineering

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:23.370
figure out a standard way that
makes sense for the user.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:32.480
Because if you have a lot of
apps that do this, it's going

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.920
to be a nightmare
for the user.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.490
In my sense, that's
the user's choice.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.950
In that the user is only
going to use what they

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.980
feel like they want.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.000
And valuable apps they'll
use and buy.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:00.790
And other apps, if it's
annoying, they'll turn it off

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.970
as long as there's
an easy off/on.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.610
Or they'll delete the app,
or they'll rate it down.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.140
So let's see, Will has asked a
couple questions about this.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.840
WILL: I think when I first asked
you on Stack Overflow

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.810
about this issue you basically
said no it wasn't possible.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.270
About the overlay, it's
about the overlay--

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:34.022
overlay, overlap TV. And I just
want to put my vote in to

00:24:34.022 --> 00:24:36.910
say that that is something that
is a great promise for

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.150
Google TV in that you can
enhance live TV. You could

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.920
make comments on what's
happening.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.870
That's something that I hope
that you guys really embrace.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.103
Because I think that a lot
of cool apps could

00:24:48.103 --> 00:24:48.890
be made with that.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.180
Although, what you say is true,
if you start throwing

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.230
things in front of live TV, it
can be a horrible experience

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.600
if you do it the wrong way.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.090
So I would just hope that
you guys are trying to

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.940
push that to happen.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.610
Because I think it opens
up a lot of doors.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.090
And obviously people
want to do it.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.420
So don't hold back.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.030
LES VOGEL: Yeah, no we
understand that.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:17.080
And that's the point is that
we want innovation.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.920
But it's figuring out the
right way to innovate.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.940
And we don't want to create
a situation where

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.910
it turns off users.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.320
We do understand.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.950
That's, as I said, why
I'm OK talking about

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:36.910
it in a hang out.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.610
But I don't want to publish
anything until

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.610
engineering is happy.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.430
CHRIS: And for the record,
Samsung TV supports it.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.940
And it was an awful experience
getting it working.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.840
So you can go two ways, right?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.290
You can release it in a bad
way, or you can release it

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.511
slowly in a good way.

00:25:55.511 --> 00:25:56.885
LES VOGEL: How was it awful?

00:25:56.885 --> 00:26:02.180
Was it just the programing or
the experience for users?

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.620
CHRIS: Their process is you have
to build something and

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.160
push it in to the emulator
and test it there.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.910
And then you can push it up to
the TV. The emulator only

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.050
works on Windows.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.250
And basically the app worked
on the emulator and did not

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.820
work on the TV. And I
could not figure out

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.700
why for days, weeks.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.510
So it just is a miserable
experience.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.980
There's just a lot of things
that are lacking in their

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.670
documentation.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.770
It looks like it was
written by an

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.260
outsourced development firm.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.670
So it just was a miserable
experience.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.050
LES VOGEL: Well, that's actually
a useful data point.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:35.960
Thanks.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.720
CHRIS: Sure.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.970
LES VOGEL: All right.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.000
Who's next?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.800
LEON: I've got another one.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.470
So it's kind of related to
something somebody talked

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.030
about earlier about being able
to control devices from within

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.400
Google TV. But my question
is broader than that.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.530
If you want to do anything that
you can currently do over

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.440
Anymote are there any plans on
kind of exposing that as an

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.010
API so that you could do
something similar in an

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.260
Android app?

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.370
LES VOGEL: So can you
ask one more time?

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.830
So what exactly are you
trying to accomplish?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.350
LEON: Like remotely, through
Anymote, you can control other

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.240
devices and do all kinds of
things even for Google itself

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.860
as a system.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.650
What if you wanted to do that
within your Android app

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.170
running on Google TV?

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.420
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh I see.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.220
Well, you could.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.680
You just have to actually
implement the client code in

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.316
your app, right?

00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:49.140
It would get really
messy though.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.980
I don't know how that would--

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.295
LEON: Well, for example by
controlling other devices,

00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:57.980
currently, I can only do that
from my mobile app.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.540
I have to send a signal, and it
gets translated somewhere

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.480
within Google TV. I
don't have that

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.360
capability as an app, right?

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:06.700
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.910
So you want to do TV as a
client or Google TV as a

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.175
client to another device.

00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:12.425
LEON: Exactly.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:21.115
PAUL SAXMAN: So you could pull
the Anymote libraries in into

00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:23.840
an application and
use it that way.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.480
That would probably
be rather complex.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.300
I think your best bet would be
to do what makes sense just

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.350
because I don't think we have
anything in the near term plan

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.610
for something like that.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:48.250
But we do have a protocol if
you have a dish device, we

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.920
have a parent protocol between
Google TV and dish devices

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.800
that kind of works, I think,
how you're saying.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.500
That's how the DVR commands
are actually sent between

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.250
Google TV and the dish device.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:07.240
That protocol is not
open sourced or not

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.160
published on the web.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.990
So we can look into seeing if
that is publishable as well.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.190
The only issue with that
though is that the API

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:21.193
developers, you'd want your app
to actually use the API on

00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:23.900
the device to communicate
with the device.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.890
So it's another layer
of complexity.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.000
We'll run it by our product
development team.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.910
LES VOGEL: His app goes remote
control [? change the ?]

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:38.240
device and then the device does
whatever he wants it to.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.290
PAUL SAXMAN: Right,
but let's say

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.680
controlling a DVR, for example.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.070
We can do that with dish
devices because we have

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.540
parring between Google TV
and the dish device.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.270
But parring between any app and
any device, I think it's

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.925
something that we don't
have standardized yet.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.108
I think it's kind of up to
developers right now to kind

00:30:02.108 --> 00:30:03.702
of implement something
to do that.

00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:07.830
But we can see about potentially
doing something

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:13.630
that would kind of make it
a little easier to use.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.945
LES VOGEL: Let's see.

00:30:15.945 --> 00:30:18.520
There are two things here.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:25.690
We have a question about the
market TV. When you're done

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.135
with [? twist ?] that's
Chris [? Hollis. ?]

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.990
I'll add him to our hang out.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.700
So that he can--

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.830
LEON: Regarding the market app,
last week you said there

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:43.632
is some work being done on it
because I would say at least

00:30:43.632 --> 00:30:45.400
the feedback I'm getting
from my users,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.510
that is a big problem.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.580
I mean all kinds of weird
things are going on.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.715
Apps are not getting
installed.

00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:54.780
Apps are not getting updated.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.700
And even with the reboot which
seemed to have worked before,

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.680
now doesn't seem to always
work anymore.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.550
You get it back to a
state where it can

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.210
do the proper thing.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.390
So is that part of this
new software update?

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.715
Or is this going to be some kind
of intermediate update

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:15.330
just to fix the market?

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.970
LES VOGEL: The software
update probably

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.200
has some market fixes.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.940
Osama looked like he
was going to --

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.385
OSAMA ALAMI: No.

00:31:25.385 --> 00:31:29.320
I just wasn't clear what the
issue is with market?

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.410
LES VOGEL: The issues with
market is, if I can paraphrase

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:38.120
you Leon, we know that when you
purchase an app or want to

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.860
download an app, it doesn't
always come down immediately.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:48.390
About 10% of the time, the
signal doesn't get back to the

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.640
box to download it.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.914
And I believe there are
fixes coming for that.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:03.190
But I don't know how specific
and whether it's 100% or not.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.560
OSAMA ALAMI: Yeah.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.156
It is an issue that we are aware
of or rather the market

00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:09.140
engineers have been aware of.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.930
And it is something they're
working on.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.220
I don't know if it's been
fixed and in an internal

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.310
[? build ?] or not.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.250
Or when it will be pushed out.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:24.148
But it is something they are
actively working on.

00:32:24.148 --> 00:32:27.335
LEON: Is this something that can
be done independently of a

00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:28.585
whole system update?

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.090
OSAMA ALAMI: An update
to market, it may be.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.966
I don't know.

00:32:35.966 --> 00:32:37.280
I don't know.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.570
LES VOGEL: I think the market
could be updated without a

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:48.980
system, but at least
it can on phones.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.425
But I don't know all the details
to make it happen.

00:32:55.425 --> 00:33:01.300
And I don't know all the rules
whether the OEMs have to be

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.530
involved or not.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.100
LEON: It seems to
come up daily.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.830
That people get stuck
in that mode.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.740
It's really tricky.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.952
And tricky trying to explain
that it's not really the app

00:33:10.952 --> 00:33:14.860
that it's the market somehow
that's not doing its thing.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.190
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.580
And I'm sure that that doesn't
help your ratings.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.210
LEON: Yeah, that's right.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.550
LES VOGEL: So we do understand
that it's an issue.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.900
And hopefully, one of us
will take it back.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.150
Yeah.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.310
All right.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.610
Let's see.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.680
I cannot find my cursor.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.120
Oh, here we are.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.745
That goes that way.

00:33:40.745 --> 00:33:42.980
That goes this way.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.310
As soon as I can figure
out how to start

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.760
switching people again.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.200
All right.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.270
Let's see, we just had
Brandon join us.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.520
Do you have a question?

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.500
BRANDON: There we go.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:06.130
Well, I was hoping that the user
experience guy was there.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.699
I'm not sure if he is.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:09.330
LES VOGEL: He was.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.389
We had two of them last week.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:12.750
BRANDON: Oh, you did?

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.090
I missed it.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:23.330
LES VOGEL: And we had almost
one UX question last week.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.620
So what was your question?

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.920
BRANDON: Well, basically a
couple weeks ago, I was

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:35.909
wondering if there was a best
practices or whatever for

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:44.659
interfacing key presses like
arrows on Google TV with the

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.935
render script?

00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:48.650
Because I have a carousel render
script, but it doesn't

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.040
receive any input from
the keyboard.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.310
LES VOGEL: I've asked
someone to do some

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.330
sample code for that.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.445
I haven't heard back if
they've started it.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.500
PAUL SAXMAN: So that's something
we're planning to

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.660
release some sample code
for this quarter.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.830
BRANDON: Oh, OK.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.170
LES VOGEL: So hopefully
this quarter.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.270
Yeah.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.520
We all want to see that.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.170
Yeah, definitely render
script with key

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.270
presses should be a win.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.760
BRANDON: Great, thanks.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.265
LES VOGEL: Anybody else,
another question?

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.700
Leon?

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.500
You usually have a bunch.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.750
No?

00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:44.180
LEON: Did you cover all the
questions in your post?

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.030
LES VOGEL: I'll go
through them.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:55.300
Let's see, Kevin has written in
asking about over the air

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.290
recording devices.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:00.010
The answer depends on your
idea of at a good price.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:05.740
There are devices on Amazon they
take OTA antenna in and

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.450
record to disk and
spit out HTMI.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:18.280
Cost seems to be about $200.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.530
Christian is explaining--

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.685
PAUL SAXMAN: We have one
question on MPEG-2 support.

00:36:28.685 --> 00:36:30.930
And I think the issue there
is that it's not

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.570
supported by all devices.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.565
It is supported by, I believe,
the TVs and Blu-ray disk

00:36:37.565 --> 00:36:41.840
players but not by Buddy
Boxes necessarily.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.290
It's up to the OEM to actually
license the decoder.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:53.455
So I believe it's required
support for Blu-ray players

00:36:53.455 --> 00:36:56.780
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.720
The quickest way I think to
know, as far as I remember, is

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.960
that if you go to the Android
documentations and look up

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.850
the, I think it's in the
supported media types

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.650
documentation, not for TV but
for Android, you can actually

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.760
look at camera profiles.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.570
And camera profiles will
tell actually what

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.660
encoders are available.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.410
And that's actually
a cue to how many

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.420
encoders are available.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.480
I don't know how reliable that
is on Google TV, I've

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.730
never tested it.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:32.260
But I think it's a general
strategy for checking for

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.410
encoders or decoders
on a device.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.920
I can look that up.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.610
And I'll follow up on the
thread discussion.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.040
LES VOGEL: Here's one for
either one of us.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.080
I don't know the
answer to this.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:54.390
Alexander asks about
USB mounted drives.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:38:01.930
Google TV mounts them as
he writes [? SMTH ?]

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:07.120
like usb.abcd-1234.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.370
How can I get the real name
of a flash drive?

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:15.020
Google TV definitely knows it
because notifications I can

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:22.430
see the synced USB storage
quote label.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:27.300
So one of us needs to look that
up in the source code.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.410
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I don't
know the answer to that.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.290
Probably best posted
on Stack Overflow.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.260
LES VOGEL: Yeah, if you post
it on Stack Overflow, we'll

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.540
look it up for you.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.045
Use #Google-TV. OK.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.950
And Chris, we answered
your question about--

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.200
we mentioned PhoneGap, but also
straight Android apps

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.450
work well too.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:07.580
OK.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.700
There are also besides this hang
out, there are Google TV

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.390
product managers who hang out.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:23.970
And so for Roy they are the
ones who you can ask about

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:28.110
Gmail, YouTube, movies,
Google Maps,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.310
Google Earth, and Google+.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.560
That's not our bailiwick.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:47.280
And UI changes as well
are in their area.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.270
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
not our what?

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.020
What was that word you used?

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.630
LES VOGEL: Bailiwick.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.845
PAUL SAXMAN: I have never
heard that before.

00:39:52.845 --> 00:39:53.290
LES VOGEL: Yes.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.125
OK.

00:39:55.125 --> 00:39:57.030
Google it.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.280
PAUL SAXMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.786
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:40:02.786 --> 00:40:04.244
PAUL SAXMAN: Military term.

00:40:04.244 --> 00:40:07.890
LES VOGEL: Oh, OK.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:08.740
Someone else?

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.870
WILL: Yeah, I have a question.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.930
This is my partner developer
asking it.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.610
We're working with the queriable
guide, the TV Guide,

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.680
and we're wondering if Google's
going to have their

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.720
own-- if it will be an app,
like a built in app in the

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.950
Google TV where it would be a
guide rather than something

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.386
that we would build to
query and display?

00:40:31.386 --> 00:40:33.366
I'm not sure if that's clear.

00:40:33.366 --> 00:40:35.110
I'm not sure if I can--

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.780
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:40.420
The guide and channel listing
is licensed material.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.070
So the TV and movies app
has some of that

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.320
information in it.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.540
With the next release, we're
going to be adding the TMSID

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.840
into the content listing
provider.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:05.700
So if you were to license data
from Tribune, you can take

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:12.710
that TMS ID and get a lot of
information about the title,

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:24.960
the pictures, descriptions, what
episode it is, and more.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.635
WILL: I wonder if that's how
Plex does all that information

00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:27.780
that it gathers.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.084
It sounds like it could be.

00:41:30.084 --> 00:41:30.506
I don't know.

00:41:30.506 --> 00:41:34.010
Plex does a really good job at
when you have a file that it

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.860
recognizes as some show, it
really does a really good job

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.190
at populating a description,
a picture of it.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:44.270
It's really cool.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.000
LES VOGEL: I can't tell
you about Plex.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.865
But I suspect Buddy TV,
that's how it works.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.430
LEON: So, Les, in terms of that
ID, are you saying that

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.960
it will just be an extra column
in the current content

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.840
provider listing?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.740
LES VOGEL: Yes.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.540
But I haven't actually looked
at the new data.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:10.110
And I wasn't planing to write
the documentation for it.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:14.180
I was hoping someone else
in the room might.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.124
They're not speaking up,
so I'm not going

00:42:17.124 --> 00:42:18.550
to call them out.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.290
LEON: So the ID, does it refer
to just the channel or are you

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.260
saying that it actually tells
you about the current show?

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:30.280
LES VOGEL: Well, you get the
row for each channel.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.820
And it will be, as I understand
it-- and again,

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.392
this is not the area
that I looked in.

00:42:37.392 --> 00:42:39.400
And as I said, no one
is speaking up.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:47.580
But it's supposed to have the
TMS ID of the current show.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:47.850
LEON: Oh, OK.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.230
Well, that's really good
news actually.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.180
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.780
And then with that, you can
licence the data with Tribune

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.080
and work it out.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.970
PAUL SAXMAN: We're not 100% sure
it's the current show.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.160
So we'll get back
to you on it.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.436
And then exactly
what's in it--

00:43:09.436 --> 00:43:10.940
LEON: Yeah, because that could
be very interesting.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.640
I've done stuff like that
before, but the ID

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.510
would be a nice hook.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.050
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.140
Yeah, we had other developers
and kind of partners ask about

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:25.230
actually just knowing who the
broadcast provider is.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.603
So knowing if you're on AT&amp;T
Universe or if you're on

00:43:28.603 --> 00:43:31.020
Comcast, San Francisco.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.700
So that TMS ID we can share.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:40.750
So other information about the
channel line up, the specific

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.690
channel lineup or, well,
actually that is the

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.120
channel line up.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.530
But the programing guide,
we don't have

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.000
information for it yet.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.890
So what's on or what's playing
in the future is something

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.745
that you'd have to derive
from the channel ID.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.600
LES VOGEL: Right, and that also
is not giving you what

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.406
they're currently watching.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.940
LEON: Yeah, no, I understand.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.710
LES VOGEL: Because we don't
necessarily know that because

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.280
it's [? decoupled ?] box.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.630
LEON: So you guys still are
working on a solution for that

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.880
for the future?

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.460
LES VOGEL: Which part of I can't
talk about unannounced

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.100
activities--

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.410
Sorry.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.333
WILL: It seems like if it was
your regular cable box, it'd

00:44:24.333 --> 00:44:25.170
be right there though.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.680
That'd be perfect.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.180
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.580
Right.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.830
We got that.

00:44:32.264 --> 00:44:35.530
That ain't my department,
however.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.250
OK.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.730
Let's see, reading
through these.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.330
We talked about MPEG-2
already.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.660
We talked about MPEG-2.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.960
Talked a lot about MPEG-2.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.320
OK.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.770
I think we've covered
all these questions.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:08.960
I see one more thing in
my feed from Paul,

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.210
two more from Paul.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.430
Yeah.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.970
We agree with that one.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:36.490
The problem with not joining in
and asking long questions

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:41.470
is, it's really hard for me to
read it, figure out what's

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:49.010
essential, and having all
of you sitting there.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:59.000
So basically, Paul is
asking or made a

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.150
comment about overlays.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:10.100
And talking about Comcast
Guide and TiVo guide.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.570
OK.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.270
I don't actually see
a question in here.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.660
But I invited Paul
to the hang out.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:28.920
So you're welcome to join
me on air and we

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.180
can tease that out.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.050
OK.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.630
Any other questions?

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.350
WILL: So just a general
question.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.630
What kind of questions are you
looking for in the hang out?

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.450
Because a lot of times I feel
like it's a technical hang out

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.490
and those kind of questions are
better asked on somewhere

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.040
like Stack Overflow.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.130
So I try to ask a different--

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.470
I asked a lot of marketing
questions last week.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.070
I guess my general question is
what kind of questions are you

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.085
looking for or--

00:47:03.425 --> 00:47:04.900
PAUL SAXMAN: I think we are
looking for technical

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:11.720
questions or discussion on any
problems you're having

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:17.770
developing for Google TV. What
our hang out is not looking

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:25.270
for is any product questions
about specific apps on the

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:31.210
platform or future plans for
what the next version of the

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.480
platform will look like.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.900
So we are a technical team,
and we're here to support

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.810
application developers.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.970
So anything that falls
under that category,

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.140
we're happy to answer.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.220
LES VOGEL: That also includes
helping market

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:52.653
your apps or monetize.

00:47:52.653 --> 00:47:59.090
So it crosses into the marketing
business aspects if

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.880
you want it to.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.890
WILL: I have a similar
question about that.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.710
Right now my app has
two versions.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.735
It has a free version
and a paid version.

00:48:07.735 --> 00:48:10.470
And I'm going to collapse them
down into one and do what you

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:15.090
said last week which was provide
an add-on feature

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.250
that's going to be the
paid part of it.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:21.060
It's going to be eventually
just one app.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.072
But my guys who have already
bought the paid one, I'm a

00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:27.410
little worried about them
because they're already on.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.640
I guess I still have
to maintain two.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:35.740
But that's kind of like
my dilemma right now.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.220
But my app is already out
in the world right now.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.140
So I guess I'm stuck with two.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.230
The next one will only be one.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.120
And your idea last week
about having an

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.910
add-on or in purchase--

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.770
offering it free and add-on.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.770
I really took that to heart.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.450
I think that's a smart
way of doing it.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.780
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.510
In app purchasing
is a real win.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.900
Let's see.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:13.140
What you might consider is you
can do the in app purchasing

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.640
through your server.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:25.360
So if you were to release one
like an app engine server with

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.380
the credentials--

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.170
of course you'd have to ask the
permission of your already

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.710
purchased apps.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:39.060
So basically, you do your own
license validation server.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:47.235
And then your in app purchasing
can track, rather

00:49:47.235 --> 00:49:53.160
than pass the in app token only
to the app, you pass in

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:59.460
app token all the way to your
server and authenticate.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.340
So basically, you release
a version that captures

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:09.680
credentials, of course with
permission and explaining what

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.500
you're doing.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:16.090
And then a week or two later
after you've had sufficient

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:21.030
everybody's upgraded, so it
might be a month or two, you

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:25.140
go to the in app purchasing
version.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.560
And you are validating
credentials

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.340
against their email.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.270
So you are kind of breaking
a little bit of the in app

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:46.610
purchasing, but you've got
a way to enable your app.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.220
Does that make sense?

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.170
WILL: Yeah, it does.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:55.840
LES VOGEL: And the Android folks
have content talking

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.750
about server enabled
in app purchasing.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.880
Because that's where I got it.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.340
WILL: Gottcha.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.360
I'll check it out.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.430
Thank you.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.930
LES VOGEL: Let's see, Chris is
asking is there a reason we

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:15.770
cannot use PiP, a technical
one or otherwise?

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:20.170
Yeah, fundamentally engineering
didn't provide a

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.870
public API for it.

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.340
CHRIS: So I guess my question
is more it might be on the

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.997
roadmap, it's not something like
OEMs are saying we never

00:51:28.997 --> 00:51:29.970
will allow that.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:32.000
It's more of a just hasn't
been attended to yet.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.250
LES VOGEL: Yeah.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.170
That might be a good way
to characterize it.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.725
I can't tell you.

00:51:39.725 --> 00:51:42.380
I'm not confirming that
it's on a road map.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:42.740
CHRIS: Sure.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.420
Yeah, that's fine.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.470
LES VOGEL: OK.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.120
CHRIS: I should have just not
even have asked the question,

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.170
but anyway thanks.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.800
LES VOGEL: No.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.985
It's good to pester us with
these kinds of things, I don't

00:51:55.985 --> 00:51:57.270
mean pester.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:01.180
But basically, if you remind us
over and over again, we can

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:05.740
go to engineering and say every
hang out we get told

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.450
this is an issue.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.710
PAUL SAXMAN: Sometimes
along those lines.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:13.880
It's is really helpful for us
if we hear kind of use cases

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.980
in addition to kind of what
your feature request is.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.030
PiP mode is kind of an
interesting one because a lot

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.865
of developers want PiP mode so
they can embed video or have

00:52:23.865 --> 00:52:28.140
the impression that video is
embedded in their application.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.700
But that might not be the
optimal solution.

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.150
There could be other ways
to actually get

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.330
video into your app.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.800
So if you can kind of share
with us what you'd like to

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.910
accomplish from an application
developer, from a user

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.740
experience standpoint, we can
kind of distill that down to

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:49.170
something that we can bring to
the product development team

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.860
and kind of drive requirements
for the product.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:58.410
CHRIS: So the app that I built
for the Samsung TV is

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:03.710
essentially an app that allows
you to get more collaborative

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.800
around live sporting events.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.760
And so the ticker application,
it essentially overlays a

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.740
scoreboard.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.160
People are essentially using
their phones to participate in

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.200
kind of voting on match ups.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.530
This specific sport is MMA or
UFC mixed martial arts.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.430
And so the app allows you go to
your phone and choose the

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.030
match ups that you like.

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.050
And then from there, there's a
scoreboard overlaid on the

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:32.580
live TV such that when the event
is occurring, you're

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.090
seeing the scoreboard updated
in real time.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:39.390
And so for that application,
the Samsung ticker works

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:41.780
really well because it allows
you to overlay on that.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.250
So I mean I like to look for
the simplest solution.

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.820
And so when I was looking at
the documentation a few

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.660
minutes ago, it looked like
PiP might be an option.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.310
But I'm not attached to it.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.940
It sounds like the other option
you suggested, Les, is

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.660
probably a better one--

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.420
using an intent to
launch the app.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:05.690
LES VOGEL: Well, the nice thing
about using an intent is

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:11.090
then you can focus on your sport
and you know what is up,

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.740
especially if you license TMS
data, you can get to the right

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:21.900
channel, you guide them, and
when they want out of your

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.220
app, they quit it.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.340
They have regular television
again.

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:33.970
And so it then becomes channel
or sport focused.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:42.730
Because if it is not live TV,
you might have other content

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:46.630
that you take them to, a
different kind of activity.

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:49.670
So on the historical
or future events.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:52.630
Right?

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.590
So you can do more by
making it an app.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.630
And that's my story, and
I'm sticking with it.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.930
OK.

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.710
So we're almost out of time.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.040
I posted a link.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.590
If any of you are in Canada,
Paul Carff and I are going to

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:26.490
be doing a developer lab in
Toronto on the 7th of March.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:30.840
So feel free to sign
up for that.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:36.140
And otherwise, Google runs on
the short meeting idea.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.970
So I'm going to end it here
unless anyone's got something

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:40.220
else to say.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:44.160
That's all.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:44.940
Thank you.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.190
Bye bye.
