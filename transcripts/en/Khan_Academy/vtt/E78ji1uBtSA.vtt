00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.010
If someone walks up to you
on the street and says,

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.260
all right, I have a
challenge for you.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.986
I want to construct a triangle
that has sides of length 2.

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:15.920
So sides of length-- let me
write this a little bit neater.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.050
Sides of length 2, 2, and 5.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.190
Can you do this?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.050
Well, let's try to do it.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.080
And we'll start with the longest
side, the side of length 5.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.200
So the side of length 5.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.250
That's that side
right over there.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.070
And now, let's try to draw
the sides of length 2.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.570
Every side on a
triangle, obviously,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.861
connects with every other side.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:42.260
So that's one side of length 2.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.940
And then this is another
side of lengths 2.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.125
Another side of length 2.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.500
And you might say, fine, these
aren't touching right now,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.430
these two points.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.555
In order to make a triangle,
we have to touch them.

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:53.280
So let me move them
closer to each other.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.320
But we have to remember, we
have to keep these side lengths

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.110
the same.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.570
And we have to keep touching
the side of length 5

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.720
at its endpoint.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.510
So we could try to move them in.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.769
We could try to move them in,
but what's going to happen?

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070
Well, you could rotate
them all the way down

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.980
and they're still not going
to touch because 2 plus 2

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.259
is still not equal to 5.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.800
They rotate all the
way down, they're

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.640
still going to be 1 apart.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.610
So you cannot construct
this triangle.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.440
You cannot construct
this triangle.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.950
And I think you're noticing
a property of triangles.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.760
The longest side cannot
be longer than the sum

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.590
of the other two sides.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.160
Here, the sum of the
other two sides is 4.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.280
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.030
And the other side is longer.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.740
And even if the other
side was exactly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.450
equal to the sum of
the other two sides,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.440
you're going to have
a degenerate triangle.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.500
Let me draw that.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.140
So this would be side,
say, 2, 2, and 4.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.610
So let's draw the
side of length 4.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.130
Side of length 4.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.710
Side of length 4.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.420
Let me draw it a
little bit shorter.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.960
So that's your side of length 4.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.185
And then, in order to make the
two sides of length 2 touch,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.230
in order to make them touch,
you have to rotate them

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.050
all the way inward You
have to rotate them

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.650
all the way inward so that
both this angle and this angle

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.010
essentially have to
become 0 degrees.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.260
And so your resulting triangle,
if you rotate this one

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.880
all the way in and you
rotate this all the way in,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.590
the points will actually touch.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.840
But this triangle will
have no area anymore.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.190
This will become a
degenerate triangle.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.787
And it really looks more
like a line segment.

00:02:28.787 --> 00:02:29.870
So let me write that down.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.420
This is a degenerate.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.440
In order for you to draw
a non-degenerate triangle,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.470
the sum of the
other two sides have

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.600
to be longer than
the longest side.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.160
So for example, you could
definitely draw a triangle

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.790
with sides of
length 3, 3, and 5.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.439
So if that's the side of
length 5, and then this--

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.980
if you were to rotate
all the way in,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.070
those two points would-- let me
draw this a little bit neater.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.794
So let's say that's
where they connect.

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:06.210
And we know that
we could do that,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.030
because if you think about it,
if you were to keep rotating

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.680
these, they're going to pass
each other at some point.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.439
They're going to
have to overlap.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.230
If you tried to make
a degenerate triangle,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.396
these points wouldn't touch.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.200
They'd actually overlap by
one unit right over here.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.690
So you could rotate them
out and actually form

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.730
a non-degenerate triangle.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.360
So this one, you
absolutely could.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.276
And then there's another
interesting question,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:28.440
is this the only triangle
that you could construct

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.560
that has sides of
length 3, 3, and 5?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.810
Well, you can't
change this length.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.210
So you can't change that
point and that point.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.266
And then, you can't
change these two lengths.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:39.640
So the only place
where they will

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.580
be able to touch each other is
going to be right over there.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.110
So this right over here
is the only triangle

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.517
that meets those constraints.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.100
You could rotate it
and whatever else.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.930
But if you rotate this, it's
still the same triangle.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.480
This is the only triangle
that has sides of length 3, 3,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.230
and 5.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.720
You can't change
any of the angles

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.177
somehow to get a
different triangle.
