00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.095
Let's add some more rational
expressions.

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:07.360
So let's say I have 1 over
x squared minus 9.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.390
And to that I'm going to
add 2 over x squared

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.860
plus 5x, plus 6.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.930
So just like we did when
we first learned to add

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.650
fractions, or to add rational
numbers, we always had to come

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.870
up with a common denominator.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.440
So once again, we're going to
have to come up with a common

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.280
denominator.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.520
And what we really want to do
is find the least common

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.780
multiple of these
two expressions.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.390
And when I say that, let
me just remind you.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.120
Let's say we wanted to
add 1/4 plus 1/6.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Well, we know that 1/4 is 1 over
2 times 2, and that 1/6

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.650
is 1 over 2 times 3.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.240
So to be able to add these two
things, we incrementally-- we

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.840
both have a common 2.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.980
We both have this common 2.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.590
But in order for this guy to
go into whatever our common

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.980
denominator is, we're
going to have to be

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.220
divisible by another 2.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.880
So let me do that.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.990
So our common denominator's
going to have to be-- we have

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330
this 2 in each of them.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.400
So that takes care
of that first 2.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.440
But then we need the second 2.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.800
We need the second 2 there.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.820
2 times a second 2.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.120
And then we need this 3 here.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.820
We need this 3 here.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270
We have to have all of the prime
factors of both of them.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.990
This has two 2's, so this
guy has to have two 2's.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.630
This guy has a 2 and a
3, so this guy has to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.170
have a 2 and a 3.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.070
And so our least common multiple
here is 2 times 2,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.750
times 3, which is 12.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.580
And then we can add
accordingly.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.350
That is our common
denominator.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.730
That's the least common
multiple.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.506
You could have just multiplied
these two out, but you would

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:48.360
have gotten 24, and that's
larger than necessary.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210
You could have still worked it
out, but you would have had

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.370
more simplifying left
for you to do.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.550
The same idea we can
do right here.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.090
The same idea we can do here.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.000
We can factor both of these
denominators, so x squared,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.560
that is x plus 3,
times x minus 3.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.610
It's just a difference
of squares.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.770
And x squared plus 5x, plus 6.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.510
That is what?

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.070
That is x plus 2,
times x plus 3.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.740
2 times 3 is 6.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.500
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.010
So our common denominator's
going to be what?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.960
What's going to be our
common denominator?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.080
Let me clear up this real
estate over here.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
What's our common denominator
going to be?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.780
Our common denominator-- so this
is going to be equal to--

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.520
our common denominator's going
to be-- our common

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.530
denominator's going to have
to have an x plus 3 in it.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.890
And that takes care of this
x plus 3 as well.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.800
It's going to have an
x minus 3 in it.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.190
It's going to have to have
an x minus 3 in it.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.180
So that's an x minus 3.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.040
And it's going to have
that x plus 2 in it.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.310
Another way you could have
thought about is, like, look,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.810
it's going to have to have all
of the factors of this guy,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.680
which are x plus 3, times
x minus 3. x plus 3

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.100
times x minus 3.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.900
And then once you write those
down, you say, well, it also

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.320
has to have all of the
factors for this guy.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.750
Well, we already have an x plus
3 there, so we just have

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.080
to only add on the x plus 2.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.330
And that saves us from
multiplying both of these

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.560
expressions together.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.180
This is the least common
denominator.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.430
Now, if this is the least common
denominator, what do we

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.820
have to change the 1 by?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.870
Well, let me actually rewrite
this a little bit.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.170
Well, I'll write it like this.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.810
So what do you have to do to
go from-- if I start with 1

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.050
over x squared-- let me write it
this way-- 1 over x plus 3,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.040
times x minus 3.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.370
This and this is the
exact same thing.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.820
If I want an x plus 2 in
the denominator, what

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.720
do I have to do?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.730
I have to multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.280
by x plus 2.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.400
So this expression right here,
which is this expression right

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.170
here, will become x plus 2 over
x plus 3, times x minus

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.300
3, times x plus 2.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.510
Those would cancel out and
you're just left with a 1.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.310
That's that right there.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.540
So this is the first term.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.720
That is this term.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.890
This term over here, the second
term over here, this is

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.150
2 over x plus 2,
times x plus 3.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.010
That's in its original form.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.740
Now, if we also want an
x minus 3 here in the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.010
denominator, we can multiply
it by x minus 3

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.840
over x minus 3.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.270
Or essentially, we
can multiply the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.010
numerator by x minus 3.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.900
So this is going to be equal
to 2 times x minus 3 is 2x

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.990
minus 6 over x plus 2, times
x plus 3, times x minus 3.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.080
So this expression right here
is the exact same thing as

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.390
this expression right
over here.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.730
So if we were to add these two
expressions, they have the

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.100
same denominator.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.410
I just switched the order
that I'm multiplying.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.160
But they're the exact same
denominator, which is exactly

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.700
the same thing as this.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.190
So this, this first expression,
we're going to get

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.160
our x plus 2 here.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.690
x plus 2 over all of this would
cancel, and you'd get 1

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.800
over x plus 3, times x minus
3, over 1 over x

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.230
squared minus 9.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:52.920
And then to that you're going
to add plus 2x minus 6.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.320
And why am I adding
2x minus 6?

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.590
Because the second term is 2x
minus 6 over all of this

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.080
business, because we were
just multiplying.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.420
This would also be written as 2
times x minus 3, over all of

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.070
this. x minus 3's would cancel
out and you'd get this again.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.380
So this is what we get when we
add the 2, and so this will be

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.420
equal to-- let me scroll down
a little bit-- this will be

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.760
equal to x plus 2x is 3x.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.000
2 minus 6 is negative 4.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.950
All of that over this thing.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.970
We can either keep it multiplied
out, or factor it

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.200
out, or we could multiply it
if you like, but it'll take

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.160
some time to multiply it.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.670
So I'll just say x plus
3, times x minus 3,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.880
times x plus 2.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.370
And we are done.
