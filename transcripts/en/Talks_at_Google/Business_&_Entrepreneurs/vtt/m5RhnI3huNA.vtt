[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:07.610
BRIAN KELLY: I've
always been a nerd when

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.777
it came to miles and points.

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:10.910
Like in the '90s, my
dad was a consultant,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.850
and I basically helped manage
his travel and his points.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.522
And I was 12 when
I first realized--

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:17.480
I said, we have all these
frequent flyer miles.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.290
And he's like, well, if you
can figure out how to use them,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.390
we'll go on vacation.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.330
And he's like, let's go to
Orlando or somewhere basic.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.993
And sassy old
12-year-old me was like--

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.160
I had just read the book
"The Firm" by John Grisham,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.330
and they went to
the Cayman Islands.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.620
And I would just remember--
this sounds amazing!

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.160
So I called up US Airways
and talked to Peggy

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.330
and became her best friend.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.900
And somehow our family of
six went on a free trip

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.980
to the Cayman Islands.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.310
And so that's when I really--
that was in the '90s.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.080
And then fast forward to '07.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.340
I get a job at Morgan Stanley.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.820
My job was actually to
recruit computer scientists

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.210
and engineers, and my main
job was to convince MIT grads

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.040
and Cornell grads to
not work at Google

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.620
and instead work in
finance, which, as you guys

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.540
can imagine-- are there
many technologists

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.810
here, like real nerds?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.780
OK, good.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.370
In any case, my job was to
convince computer scientists

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.910
to not work at Google.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.410
So they gave me
a corporate Amex.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.930
And I was spending like crazy,
putting all the career fairs,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.530
and then taking
people out to dinners.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.870
I was 27 years old but
spending over $1 million a year

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.440
on a corporate Amex that
Morgan Stanley paid directly.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.080
And as long as you paid
I think it was $49,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.340
you could get all the points.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.410
Most of my co-workers
didn't even know that.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.760
And then everyone hated the
expense system at that time.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.260
You actually had
to fax in receipts.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.050
And it was a whole process.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.550
So they didn't
understand that I was

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.140
like banking tons of points,
and I made it out to be like,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.900
guys, I'll take
one for the team.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.810
I'll do the expenses.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.110
And everyone was like,
thank you so much!

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.700
So I really got into points.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
And I was traveling
first class on weekends.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.380
And all my friends
would always-- like,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.540
my co-workers thought I
was a trust fund baby.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.860
And it was all the points.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.070
And so finally I shared
my tips, and I would

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.550
have a queue around my cubicle.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.050
And people would just-- even
my managing directors at Morgan

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.280
Stanley were like--

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.140
they would come up to me like,
I just spent a million points.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.130
I'm buying a grill.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.210
And I would like smack them.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.390
So I really enjoyed
whipping people into shape.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.620
I almost became a teacher
after college for Teach

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.060
for America, if anyone's
familiar with that.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.143
So I like teaching people.

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:23.250
I love travel, and I just
love beating the system.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.470
So that was my background.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.810
So as I look now-- so
I started the blog,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.770
just like never in
a million years.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.020
It was never about monetizing.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.648
I didn't even do Google AdSense.

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:34.940
People were like, just put
Google AdSense on your blog.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.590
You'll make $10 a month.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.890
It's better than nothing.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.210
And I remember being like, no.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.420
This is my passion and joy.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.990
And I'm not here to make
money off of content.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.575
And everyone's like, you moron.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:47.950
That's the point
of the internet.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.658
And I remember someone
saying, you really

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:51.950
think Google wants to serve
you search results just out

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.543
of niceness?

00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:53.960
Like, no, they're
making bank too.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.860
It's OK.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.770
You can help people
and make money.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.240
It's not like they're at odds.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.440
LESLIE TOBIN: Absolutely.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.482
BRIAN KELLY: In any case.

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:03.842
So I started blogging, and
I had no idea what SEO was.

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:05.550
But my friend gave me
really good advice.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.050
And he was like, just do good
content every day, if you can,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.420
and if people like it.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.030
So I enjoyed every friend I had.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.830
I posted myself to Facebook.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.240
I was on forums,
linking to my blog.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.700
And slowly but surely,
people started to like it.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.450
And every time I do
see a Google employee,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.470
I try to give them hugs.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.610
Because, I mean,
even to this day,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.660
last year we hit 4 and 1/2
million monthly uniques.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.270
In March we just hit 10 million.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.540
And like almost 50% of
that comes from Google.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.510
So thank you.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.140
Thank you, Google,
for making me rich.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:41.940
LESLIE TOBIN: You're welcome.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.760
BRIAN KELLY: So
anyway, I don't know.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.190
So I started as a blog, and
it really just took off.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.318
And I made the decision about
nine months in to quit my job.

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:51.860
But I really got lucky, because
the credit card companies had

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.943
approached me and were
like, you know our products

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:54.800
better than we do.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800
And it was at the same time,
coming out of the recession,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.290
and they wanted the millennial
audience that I naturally

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.603
had an ability to speak to.

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:03.770
And also I could market
their products in a way they

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.270
couldn't.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.735
Like, Chase can't take out a
full-page "New York Times" ad

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:09.110
and tell you that the best
way to use the British Airways

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.410
card is to fly American
Airlines or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.378
There's a lot of--

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.170
so I was a blogger, an
independent blogger,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.928
who could break it
down right away.

00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:17.845
It was very effective.

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.015
LESLIE TOBIN: Absolutely.

00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:22.560
BRIAN KELLY: Once I started
making money doing that,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.390
it just took off.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.730
And now we just launched
in the UK on Thursday.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.420
LESLIE TOBIN: Very exciting.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.322
BRIAN KELLY: We
can clap for that.

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:28.072
LESLIE TOBIN: Yay!

00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:31.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.480
So Nicky, you joined The Points
Guy team much more recently.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.230
NICKY KELVIN: Yes.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.063
LESLIE TOBIN: But I
understand that you have

00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:38.370
been a longtime points guru.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.410
Tell me a little bit
about your journey.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.253
NICKY KELVIN: So, like
Brian, my beginnings

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:44.670
was something completely-- our
professional beginnings was

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.962
something completely different.

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:48.750
So I started out on a
path being a lawyer,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.640
trained as a
solicitor in the city,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.950
in this big, corporate,
scary American law firm,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.950
then made a jump from
there into a record label.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.325
So for five years,
I was a lawyer

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:05.280
for a record label, Virgin
AMI, which was very different,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.590
but I was still a lawyer.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.050
Alongside all of this stuff,
I was also a photographer

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.980
and got very lucky to
shoot loads of big artists.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.500
And really what I loved taking
pictures of was airplanes

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.470
and me on airplanes,
and aviation

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.350
was my biggest passion, always,
since I was a little kid.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.268
And so I was very lucky to have
a sister who was cabin crew.

00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:28.560
She worked for British Airways.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.880
And so I spent my teenage years
and going to student years--

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.370
like the time when it was
perfect for me to do it--

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.280
flying around the world on
the cheap, 90% discount,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.445
staying in the best hotels,
flying with my sister

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:42.570
where I'd get on the plane
and she would just say--

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.000
you know, I'd have an
economy standby ticket.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.667
And she'd be like,
just sit there.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:48.750
And you know, I'd be in
business class every time.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.500
BRIAN KELLY: Nepotism.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.417
NICKY KELVIN: It was--

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.500
yeah, yeah.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.030
And then she ruined my life
by getting married and having

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.090
children.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.070
Actually, I was telling
this story at the weekend,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.460
and she said that
ruined her life too.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.798
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:12.090
BRIAN KELLY: Nothing against
having kids, we love kids.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.900
NICKY KELVIN: She
was in the room--

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.850
BRIAN KELLY: We have a
whole family section.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.800
NICKY KELVIN: So I had
to find another way

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.770
because her husband and kids
were then on her concessions.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.350
And I found miles
and points as the way

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.580
to be able to still travel
nicely and get deals.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.910
And I guess I always just
wanted to learn loopholes

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.470
or like just learn
these programs.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.220
It was kind of the geeky side
of me really appreciated that.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.550
And so that was maybe 10 years
ago that I got into this game

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.290
and realized there
was a real benefit

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.792
to be had even out of the UK and
started earning miles however

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:46.000
way I could and then started
to tell people about it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.850
So I was doing all this
stuff and people were like,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.725
how are you doing it?

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:51.640
And I'm naturally
like a sharer and want

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.880
to tell people about stuff.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.230
BRIAN KELLY: You follow him
on Instagram, an oversharer

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.132
sometimes.

00:06:57.132 --> 00:06:58.590
NICKY KELVIN: No--
OK, yeah, maybe.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.265
Like when the stories
are like dots at the top.

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:04.320
BRIAN KELLY: Time
to go to bed, Nicky.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.650
NICKY KELVIN: So I start
to tell people about it,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.820
started sort of writing a blog,
and just sharing information,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.070
and helping people I knew--
my friends, my family,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.470
to just to get into--

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.465
BRIAN KELLY: He literally
is copying my story.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:18.830
NICKY KELVIN: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.330
Yeah.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.970
And then Brian
and I, who'd known

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.580
each other for a number of
years from social media,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.465
when the UK thing for
TPG was happening,

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:30.840
Brian and I talked
about it maybe

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.173
three or four years-- three
years ago I was in New York.

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:35.070
And he said, I'd love
to come to London.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.680
The UK is the second biggest
readership of The Points Guy.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.288
So of the 10 million monthly
uniques, about 300,000

00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:41.580
per month were based in the UK.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.050
So we knew there
were people here,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.570
but we weren't serving
them any UK content.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.205
So my journey, then,
suddenly was faced--

00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:50.580
my professional
journey was faced

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.290
with this whole new opportunity.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.620
And being a
photographer and lawyer

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.680
was then very
quickly transformed

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.960
into joining The Points
Guy last November

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.720
to really follow my passion and
bring all my different skills

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.743
together in one new job.

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:06.660
LESLIE TOBIN: Amazing.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.780
Very cool.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.300
And so when was it
that you realized

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.890
that this was more
than just a hobby

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.870
and that you really wanted
to focus full time on this?

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.920
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah,
well, the first time

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.910
I realized this was--

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.910
the weirdest moment-- so
I started June of 2010.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.190
And I was at a cocktail party
in New York in November,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.690
and I had just
shared this deal that

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.840
went somewhat viral, this
crazy deal where you could

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.190
go to Las Vegas for like $12.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.640
And I basically-- it was from
the bowels of the internet.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.580
There were-- before Reddit--

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.973
all these weird subgroups.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.390
And basically I was able to
translate these complex deals,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.490
and it went viral.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.750
And I remember being
at a cocktail party,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.833
and someone's eyes lit up.

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.780
And they're like,
you're The Points Guy?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.180
Which never happened.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.810
I was still an HR associate
at Morgan Stanley.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.620
And I was blogging.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.037
And then I was like,
this is a freaking brand.

00:08:52.037 --> 00:08:53.370
I didn't realize it was a brand.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.593
And my mom, soon
thereafter, texted

00:08:55.593 --> 00:08:57.510
TPG, when are you coming
home for the weekend?

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.890
I'm like, what?

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.030
It's so weird.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.360
Like, my mom is calling me an
acronym of a blog I started it.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.767
I mean, I wish I could
say I was super brave

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:09.600
and just knew it was
going to be successful.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.590
But I got really lucky with--

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.370
April of 2011, the
power of press.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.370
So "The New York Times"
had actually emailed me.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.340
It went into my spam,
thepointsguy@gmail spam box

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.970
for two months.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.428
And for some reason, I was
bored and going through my spam,

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:24.600
and I realized, oh my god.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.910
"The New York Times," Seth
Kugel, had emailed me.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.743
And he's like, I hear
you're The Points Guy.

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:30.160
But for The Frugal
Traveler, which

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.285
was his column in "The New
York Times" at the time,

00:09:32.285 --> 00:09:34.520
he goes, frugal budget
travelers don't need points.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.960
Just get the
cheapest ticket ever.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.820
That's what I'm going
to buy, all of my--

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.888
I was like, are you kidding me?

00:09:39.888 --> 00:09:41.430
I was like, that's
the dumbest thing.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.330
Budget travelers of
course need points.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.830
And oh, by the way, you can buy
cheap flights and do points.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.565
You can walk and chew gum.

00:09:47.565 --> 00:09:48.440
But I was so annoyed.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.148
Because in the press,
it was always like,

00:09:50.148 --> 00:09:51.080
points are useless.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.850
You can never use them.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.370
And that's what all the
kind of old school travel--

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.360
So anyway.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.980
I was in "The New
York Times" on a day

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.313
that there was this British
Airways 100,000 point offer.

00:10:00.313 --> 00:10:01.550
It was April of 2011.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.250
At the time, I was making
a couple thousand a month.

00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:08.510
I mean, it's all
about luck and timing.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.135
But "The New York
Times" piece came out

00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:11.540
on the day this
British Airways--

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.200
and I was getting paid $150
per approval from Chase.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200
So on a normal day, I'd
have like maybe a couple

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.350
of people getting.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.950
But like 1,000 people signed
up for the card that day.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.210
So I made 150 grand in one day--

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.447
LESLIE TOBIN: Wow.

00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:27.530
BRIAN KELLY: --through the
power of viral content.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.925
I was doing Facebook
at the time,

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:30.050
but people started sharing.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.220
And I remember people were
emailing me, thank you.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.990
My family of 10
just got this card--

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.730
and you could use
it at the time for--

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.795
it was 20 round trip
flights to Miami,

00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:40.170
or you could go
to Easter Island.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.720
BA's old program was unreal.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.930
You could stop unlimited
amount of times.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.680
LESLIE TOBIN: Wow.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.140
BRIAN KELLY: And
I just remember.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.223
This is a business, because
people are thanking me

00:10:47.223 --> 00:10:48.470
for making me $1,000.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.680
That's pretty cool.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.180
So I was on paper making
a good amount of money

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.080
when I quit the job, although
it sort of was a gold rush were

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.050
all these bloggers-- it became
the wild wild west of blogging,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.658
where everyone could become
a credit card affiliate.

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:04.700
And coming from finance,
I knew that that was not

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.283
going to last.

00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:07.652
And you have to
invest in compliance

00:11:07.652 --> 00:11:09.110
and making sure
you're buttoned up.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.052
And you can tell people
to cancel on open cards

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:14.510
because that makes you money
right then and there, but then

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.927
of course lawyers at banks.

00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:17.510
So I think that's
why I've been able--

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.132
The Points Guy, there's 100
other points blogs in the US,

00:11:20.132 --> 00:11:21.590
but we've always
had a very-- like,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.673
we work with our partners.

00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:26.397
We see long term, like
the real gray area

00:11:26.397 --> 00:11:27.480
stuff we don't talk about.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.360
And that's good anyway, because
everyone in the industry

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.080
reads our site.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.450
So there are weird ways
to earn miles and points

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.617
that are borderline
unethical that you can do,

00:11:34.617 --> 00:11:36.200
but that's not what
The Points Guy is,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.010
and that's why we've
been able to grow it.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.960
LESLIE TOBIN: Absolutely.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.310
BRIAN KELLY: But yes, I got
lucky I was making money

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.850
when I quit.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.090
But my mom still was
like, how are you going

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.230
to pay for health benefits?

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.820
I'm rich.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.640
I'll be able to pay for them--

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.270
allegedly.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.290
They still had to loan
me $10,000 from when

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.210
I quit because I still
hadn't been paid.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.670
But luckily the check
came in the mail.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.610
LESLIE TOBIN: Yes.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.250
Amazing.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.320
So do you actually engage
with credit card companies

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.250
and advise them on
loyalty programs and point

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.458
schemes or other propositions
that they're launching?

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:07.208
BRIAN KELLY: Yeah.

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.350
I mean, in the US, we do.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.830
We're even doing
it here in the UK.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.480
The UK needs a
little bit of help.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.830
Our goal here is to build up and
get people engaged in points.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.255
In the US, we launch
every major credit card.

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:19.880
The Chase Sapphire Reserve was
a turning point in our business.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.400
I mean, we knew about that
product for four months

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.900
before we pitched
them the business.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.450
And Chase made a bet to launch
it with The Points Guys.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.530
So there were no
ads, no commercials.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.070
We were the exclusive
launch partner.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.870
And Chase announced
the Sapphire Reserve.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.160
I get chills thinking about it.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.840
It's true.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.420
It's coming, and the
Points Guy has the details.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.320
And it was our post.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.930
Because we respected the
embargo as it started to leak.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.270
So as a partner and
thinking long term,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.560
so they actually gave us--

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.060
think about it, the
best credit card

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.890
to ever hit the
market they announced

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.010
on social media with a
link to The Points Guy.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.760
LESLIE TOBIN: Wow.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.175
BRIAN KELLY: This multi-billion
dollar public company,

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:56.800
but they partnered
with us in that way,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.205
and then it went viral.

00:12:59.205 --> 00:13:00.830
LESLIE TOBIN: Can
you talk a little bit

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.130
about what the Chase
Sapphire Reserve card is?

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.410
BRIAN KELLY: Oh, yeah.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.640
I don't want to make
you guys jealous--

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.246
LESLIE TOBIN: --for those in
the UK who may not have access.

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.610
BRIAN KELLY: For
the Brits out there.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.690
NICKY KELVIN: Hearing
this stuff is depressing.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.360
LESLIE TOBIN: [LAUGHS]

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.280
BRIAN KELLY: So the
Sapphire Reserve

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.250
is probably the top all around
travel credit card in the US.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.540
You earn triple points on
all travel and all dining.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.110
So travel is every cruise,
hotel, Uber, public transit,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.340
parking, tolls.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.170
It's ultra-- 3x.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.150
And the points are worth
1 and 1/2 cents each

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.737
towards any travel you want.

00:13:28.737 --> 00:13:31.320
And then when you transfer them
to their partners like United,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.680
it just gets--

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.610
it's so unbelievably lucrative.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.790
And for the first
four months, it

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.650
was 100,000 points when
you got the card, plus you

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.810
get 300 a year.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.630
It's a $450 a year card, but
it was the biggest no brainer.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.190
I think like a million people
got it in the first year.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.690
We were their launch partner.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.700
It now is like 60,000
or 50,000 points.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.940
But when you think
about earning 3x.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.420
I mean, in the US, it's not
just huge sign-up bonuses.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.170
Because the interchange
rate, here there's

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.720
legislation that--
it's allegedly there

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.190
to help consumers
that, you know,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.190
0.3% is what any
credit card company can

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.510
charge to charge of merchant.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.410
In the US, it's like 3%.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.670
So why rewards are so rich
in the US is that merchants

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.950
are paying 3% on everything,
so the credit card company,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.050
they make the 3% plus
annual fees plus interest.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.550
For people who spend
a lot of money,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.880
they'll give you rewards,
usually like 1% or 2% back.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.060
So here Amex is the
only one that it's 0.3%.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.330
They have a little bit
higher interchange,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.580
but it's still not that great.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.780
I mean 20,000 points.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.250
Nicky will get into
the exact cards.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.720
So it's a bonanza in the US.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.460
So if you ever get a chance to
get a social security number

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.790
or work in the US for
like two months just

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.530
to get a social security
number, because the credit cards

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.980
are that good.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.700
LESLIE TOBIN: It's amazing.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.550
NICKY KELVIN: This could
be the only reason--

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.140
BRIAN KELLY: Is that
borderline unethical?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.010
NICKY KELVIN: It's like where
I reveal the only reason

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.140
I joined The Points Guy, like
I just want a social security

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.000
number, start taking
out US credit cards.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.900
BRIAN KELLY: And also
at The Points Guy,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.120
one of our unique perks, is
we pay for all the credit card

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.500
annual fees of our employees.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.150
I'm just very lucky that
none of my employers

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.025
have been able to get
the Centurion card yet.

00:15:07.025 --> 00:15:07.667
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:09.500
LESLIE TOBIN: So you've
established yourself

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.833
as an expert in the US already,
and now you're obviously

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:12.863
expanding into the UK.

00:15:12.863 --> 00:15:14.780
What have been some of
the biggest differences

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.420
between the US market and
the UK market in terms

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.565
of points in travel?

00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:19.940
BRIAN KELLY: I'll
let Nicky-- you

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.770
want to speak to it, because
you've spent time in the US

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.260
as well?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.110
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah, I mean, the
biggest thing is credit cards.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.818
LESLIE TOBIN: OK.

00:15:24.818 --> 00:15:28.680
NICKY KELVIN: So I think you
can have a strategy in the US

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.440
that is heavily
credit card based,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.940
and it's pretty
much all you need

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.950
to do very well out of
the miles and points game.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.470
I think you can earn
such huge amounts

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.470
and be able to have the
really great experiences

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.340
off the back of it.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.930
In the UK, you for sure
have to work harder.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.640
But that harder work is
sort of led to a feeling

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.453
amongst the people in the UK
that there isn't even anything

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:52.370
to be gained at all, and
that's the perception

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.450
that we want to change.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.003
So the main difference
is credit cards

00:15:56.003 --> 00:15:57.920
and that if you want to
earn miles and points,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.370
you need to also look elsewhere.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.850
So credit cards are a start
and putting spend through

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.700
on credit cards is
important in a solid way

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.670
to accumulate points.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.820
But you also need to dip
into loads of other places.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.680
In the US, if you get
deep into the game,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.540
you can earn crazy,
crazy, crazy amounts.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.610
But even one credit card
sign-up bonus in the US

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.410
is enough to really show
you something great.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.480
LESLIE TOBIN: OK, OK.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.300
Amazing.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.480
So I will admit, the first
few years of my career,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.880
I was traveling a ton for work.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.553
But I definitely did not take
advantage of points at all.

00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:29.720
I didn't have a credit card.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.750
I wasn't signed up for
any loyalty programs.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.130
BRIAN KELLY: [GASPS]

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.005
LESLIE TOBIN: I know.

00:16:33.005 --> 00:16:33.590
It's horrible.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.710
So what would you advise
to other points newbies

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.570
out there about kind
of getting started

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.728
with travel and with points?

00:16:41.728 --> 00:16:43.020
BRIAN KELLY: You can do the UK.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.910
How many people here are
UK residents or citizens?

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.175
Yeah, so it's a mostly UK.

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:49.550
NICKY KELVIN: Does
anyone in here

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.313
have or is able to take
out US credit cards?

00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:53.230
LESLIE TOBIN: [LAUGHS]

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.628
NICKY KELVIN: Ooh, that's--

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:55.670
BRIAN KELLY: Or married--

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.560
I actually met a reader
at one of our events

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.060
who said the happiest
day of my life

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.130
was when I got married because
I could start taking credit

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.260
cards out in my wife's name.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:02.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.740
True story, in
front of his wife.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.319
He's like, I fly first class.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.490
I have no complaints.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.833
NICKY KELVIN: So in
the UK, the strategy--

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:12.500
so we have a beginner's
guide, actually,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.530
on the site that gives
you these headline

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.533
tips that you can start--

00:17:17.533 --> 00:17:18.950
these are the
things that you need

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.130
to do to get going in the game.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.010
But the main things are
take out credit cards.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.020
There are various different
products in the UK--

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.843
granted, not as good as the US,
and they've got slightly worse

00:17:26.843 --> 00:17:28.010
in the last couple of weeks.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.990
But there is still plenty to be.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.150
We've got some tears already
rolling in the audience.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.840
But for example, the Amex
Preferred Rewards Gold Card

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.760
still offers 10,000
points as a sign-up

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.270
with no annual fee for a year.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.990
So that's kind of 10,000
membership reward points,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.018
which are very flexible.

00:17:43.018 --> 00:17:44.810
You can transfer them
to different airlines

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.710
to get you going.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.660
The British Airways
Premium Plus Card

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.500
still offers 25,000 Avios
and the companion voucher

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.488
which is a really
valuable benefit, which

00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:56.030
allows you to buy
one of yours ticket

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.420
and get another one for free.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.720
So credit cards,
getting a credit card,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.990
is sort of step one, and then
conditioning yourself to use

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.430
the credit card all the time.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.540
Just stop using cash.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.100
Stop using your debit card.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.880
We also say if you can't
pay off your bill in full

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.557
on time every
month, credit cards

00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:13.890
are maybe not the thing for you.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.617
But if you can do that, just
put everything on your card,

00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:18.950
and earn a reward for every
single pound that you spend.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:19.640
LESLIE TOBIN: Yep.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.470
NICKY KELVIN: The other one,
which is really great is Tesco.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.920
A lot of people don't
realize that Tesco Club Card

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.655
points convert into Avios
or Virgin Flying Club miles.

00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:29.030
So I worked out
that if you spend

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.420
200 quid a week at Tesco, which
your average family probably

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.980
does if you shop there across
shopping, petrol, online,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.040
after a year, you've enough
for 25,000 Avios, which

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.170
is another big chunk.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.952
Shopping portals,
that's the next one.

00:18:43.952 --> 00:18:45.410
The British Airways
shopping portal

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.340
at the moment-- they're
working really hard, actually,

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.580
to try and reach the public,
because people really

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.830
don't know about the
shopping portals.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.800
And they offer multiples of
Avios on all your purchasing.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.870
So Asos has an
offer at the moment.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.063
Eight Avios per pound when you
spend at Asos, which is a lot.

00:19:03.063 --> 00:19:04.730
Loads of people-- I
know loads of people

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.070
spending 100 quid, 200
quid almost every week.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.550
So that's thousands and
thousands more Avios.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.440
And almost every online
retailer has that as an option.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.432
There's way more, but
even those three things

00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:17.390
will have you earning--

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.740
BRIAN KELLY: Who here
shops online and earns

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.450
airline miles for the purchases?

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.890
NICKY KELVIN: So
that's pretty good.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.550
But of the rest of you who
didn't have your hand up,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.223
I imagine all of you are buying
stuff online almost every day.

00:19:28.223 --> 00:19:29.890
BRIAN KELLY: And by
clicking the portal,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.690
you literally are just
throwing miles in the trash.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.930
So always-- it's so simple.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.410
You just put your frequent
flyer number in on the portal.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.450
It puts a cookie
on your computer,

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.908
and then you earn
miles in addition

00:19:37.908 --> 00:19:39.700
to the miles from
the credit card.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.550
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.080
LESLIE TOBIN: OK.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.497
So what credit
cards would you say

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:45.190
are the absolute top
three UK credit cards

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.060
that you could get--

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.120
NICKY KELVIN: OK,
so I'd say that--

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.700
LESLIE TOBIN: --in
terms of point schemes?

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.533
NICKY KELVIN: So that
Amex Preferred Rewards

00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:54.040
Gold is a great starter
card because no annual fee,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.630
eases you into everything.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.500
10,000 points is not
to be sniffed at.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.520
It's pretty good.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.627
And as I said before,
membership reward's

00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:02.710
really flexible, because
you can transfer them out

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.620
to different places.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.420
That card also allows
you to double on travel

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.830
and international spend.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.750
Actually, the fees on
the international spend

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.640
may mean it doesn't
make sense to use it,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.710
but on travel, it's pretty good.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.740
The next main one is the
British Airways Premium Plus

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.790
Amex, 195 pound fee,
but in return, you

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.060
get a 25,000 Avios sign-up
bonus, 1 and 1/2 Avios

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.640
per pound on spending, which is
a really good ongoing earning

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.140
rate, and the companion voucher.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.880
Once you spent 10
grand in a year,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.120
you get this voucher to be able
to buy a whole second ticket.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.140
You buy one ticket,
you get one free.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.790
So if you've got a
big bank of Avios,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.890
you double the value
of that bank of Avios.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:40.850
That's really great.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.467
And then the third one I'd say
Virgin Money have two Virgin

00:20:44.467 --> 00:20:45.550
Atlantic credit cards now.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.140
They're quite new to the market.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.230
And the really nice thing about
those is they are a MasterCard.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.420
So you can use Amex
in most places,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.070
but another thing
people say to me

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.592
all the time is like, I
can never use an Amex.

00:20:56.592 --> 00:20:57.550
Like, it's so annoying.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.750
But actually, you can
use it everywhere online.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.930
But for the times when
you really can't use it,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.310
having a MasterCard.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.560
And the paid version, the
premium version of the card,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.050
earns 1 and 1/2 Virgin
miles per pound.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.980
So that's also a pretty good
sign-up, a pretty good earning

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.690
rate.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.560
You earn 15,000
points to sign up.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.250
And, if any of you are passing
through a Virgin lounge,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.120
this is my top secret tip,
they have these little cards

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.060
in Virgin lounges at the moment.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.930
And if you sign up via the
link they give you on the card,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.838
you earn 30,000 points
instead of 15,000.

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:31.630
So if you find yourself
in a Virgin lounge,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.520
make sure you ask.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.750
They normally have a
flying club representative.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.170
But that's kind of crazy.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.680
I couldn't believe that that
was a thing when I was there.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.020
LESLIE TOBIN: Yeah.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.760
That's a good tip.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.220
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.220
LESLIE TOBIN: All right.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.670
So another great way to earn
points is through airlines.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.967
What are your favorite
European airlines?

00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:46.300
BRIAN KELLY: I mean, I'll start.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.820
I love Lufhansa.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.280
Lufthansa first class
is my favorite way

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.420
to get across the pond,
and it's a great value.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.700
70,000 Amex points
to Aeroplan, and you

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.190
can fly Lufthansa
first class, which

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.160
is like amazing seats, caviar.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.362
Lufthansa is the
number one purchaser

00:22:05.362 --> 00:22:06.320
of caviar in the world.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.362
They serve it on every
single first class flight,

00:22:08.362 --> 00:22:11.341
and they give you like a
little tennis ball sized--

00:22:11.341 --> 00:22:14.230
oh, just thinking about it now.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.870
So I like Lufthansa long haul.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.360
I just saw the new
Virgin Atlantic A350-C,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.260
which is a huge improvement.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.097
Virgin NBA have had very
outdated products for years,

00:22:26.097 --> 00:22:28.180
so they're finally, over
the next couple of years,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.680
investing.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.842
But yeah, my vote's Lufthansa.

00:22:31.842 --> 00:22:34.300
NICKY KELVIN: I think this is
maybe a controversial answer,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.285
maybe obvious--

00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:36.160
BRIAN KELLY: Ryanair!

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:37.645 --> 00:22:41.540
NICKY KELVIN: --is Jet2 because
I'm from Leeds and so is Jet2.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.040
No.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.260
It's hard to knock
British Airways in the UK.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.640
The network is huge.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.880
You can get pretty
much anywhere.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.480
In terms of the air miles
scheme, Avios scheme,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.820
it's the easiest program to
earn with and to spend with.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.040
And just the
service they provide

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.530
in terms of where you can get
to is unrivaled out of the UK,

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.010
especially in Europe, where you
can pretty much fly anywhere

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.950
in slight more style
and comfort, especially

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.100
if you manage to earn status.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.520
And the airports are nice.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.228
I would always rather
fly out of Heathrow

00:23:20.228 --> 00:23:22.303
than I would out of Luton.

00:23:22.303 --> 00:23:23.720
BRIAN KELLY: And
just to be clear,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.210
we're not sponsored
by any airline.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.470
We pay for all of
our own flights.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.095
We always have.

00:23:27.095 --> 00:23:28.270
So all of our reviews--

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.220
we don't take freebies.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.800
I just felt like saying that.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.560
Because he sounded
like a fanboy.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.080
NICKY KELVIN: I get on
planes, and straightaway I'm

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.790
like taking pictures
of everything.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.460
And the crew are often
like, what are you doing?

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.635
I'm like, I just
love planes so much.

00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:48.010
And I think they got a lot
people like that, so kind of--

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.060
BRIAN KELLY: They take
you into the cockpit,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.940
give you a little pin.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.732
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah.

00:23:50.732 --> 00:23:51.658
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:51.658 --> 00:23:53.950
LESLIE TOBIN: So you kind of
made a joke about Ryanair,

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.010
but honestly, Ryanair,
EasyJet, a lot of these--

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.050
BRIAN KELLY: By the way, I flew
Ryanair Stansted to Edinburgh

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.050
like a couple weeks ago.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.880
We went to Gleneagles,
which was awesome.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.198
If you ever want a fun
Scottish getaway, I loved it.

00:24:07.198 --> 00:24:07.990
I didn't golf once.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.000
I played with their
shooting dogs.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.430
They have these 10
adorable Labradors.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.222
I'm a huge dog guy.

00:24:13.222 --> 00:24:15.763
And we're literally just in a
cuddle puddle out in the field,

00:24:15.763 --> 00:24:16.810
playing with these Labs.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.950
I went skeet shooting.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.680
Anyway, so I did a
video review of Ryanair,

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.203
and I did a taste testing
of other cuisine in-flight.

00:24:24.203 --> 00:24:25.120
LESLIE TOBIN: Cuisine.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.020
[LAUGHS]

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.020
BRIAN KELLY: Stay tuned.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.760
I loved it.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.320
I felt like a king because
I paid for the exit row.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.550
And most airlines
won't police boarding,

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.300
because everyone's a
lead or this or that.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.680
Like, Ryanair is like, with
like crazy enforcement,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.710
and I was the one sucker
who paid for the exit row,

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.445
but anyway.

00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:46.820
But back to the
point of Ryanair,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.620
if you can save
cold, hard cash, it

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.230
doesn't make sense to
pay triple the price

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.910
to fly BA on a short flight.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.450
Who cares?

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.110
BA economy is essentially
the same thing.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.290
It would never make sense to pay
$200 more to earn 1,000 Avios.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.060
The whole points game
is it's currency.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.640
And you've got to figure out
when you can win and when you

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.270
don't.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.040
And certainly,
flying short haul,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.310
saving your miles for the
really expensive ones,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.560
it's all an arbitrage game.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.423
Another advanced
tactic, especially

00:25:13.423 --> 00:25:16.640
if you fly to see family in the
US or Asia, is buying miles.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.450
So Alaska Airlines sells miles
for less than $0.02 apiece.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.440
I fly first class back and
forth from here in New York.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.270
But we buy Alaska miles, so
it's 70,000 for BA first.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.800
So I'm buying one
way for $1,400 US.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.320
I mean, granted their taxes and
fees bring it's like $1,800.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.010
But I'm buying BA first for
$3,600 round trip, pretty much

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.180
any day of the year,
when it sells for 12,000

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.550
or even buying
business class is 6,000

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.810
and upgrading so
that's an option.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.820
I know a lot of premium
travelers in the UK

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.150
will buy currencies like
LifeMiles, Alaska miles,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.920
and then use them
to book flights,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.320
because you can't earn
them as quickly, so just

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.360
another thing to think about.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.145
LESLIE TOBIN: OK.

00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:00.770
What about you?

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.630
Ryanair, EasyJet, what's your--

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.045
NICKY KELVIN: So I actually
really do love Jet2.

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:09.170
That was only sort
of a joke, because I

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.300
have fond memories of
going to Leeds Bradford

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.300
and watching the planes.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.940
But I prefer--

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.620
EasyJet, I actually
think it's great.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.640
Ryanair, for some
reason, I just find

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.230
the yellow in front of
your face so offensive.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.800
I don't know if anybody
else struggles with that.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.520
There's no seat pocket.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.610
But EasyJet is great.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.980
On the site, actually, we've
just launched an ultimate guide

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.050
to low cost airlines, so EasyJet
versus [INAUDIBLE] versus Jet2

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.270
versus Ryanair and all
the fees and the costs,

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.770
and the pitfalls, and how to
maximize on all those airlines.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.310
So on the site we look
after that stuff as well.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.560
And like Brian says,
sometimes it just

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.640
makes sense in cold hard cash
to be flying one way or another.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.152
On a 90-minute flight--

00:26:50.152 --> 00:26:51.110
BRIAN KELLY: Who cares?

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.567
But I will add, I
love Norwegian Air.

00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:54.650
When it's good, it's good.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.348
It's 787s, free Wi-Fi, and their
premium, which is a premium

00:26:58.348 --> 00:27:00.890
economy-- but it's like first
class, what you find in the US,

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:01.910
with the recliner seat.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.528
It reclines pretty far.

00:27:04.528 --> 00:27:07.070
I mean, I flew it three weeks
ago from New York to Amsterdam,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.852
and it was like totally fine.

00:27:09.852 --> 00:27:11.060
If you don't have the miles--

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.750
for what airlines charge
last minute walk-up,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.060
American Airlines will
charge $2,500 coach,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.420
because one way is
priced so weirdly.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.980
Norwegian sells-- I
bought that ticket.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.210
My flight had been canceled.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.258
I ran to JFK, and was $700 US
last minute for this premium--

00:27:27.258 --> 00:27:28.800
but it's better than
premium economy.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.860
I mean, it's a pretty
stretched out seat.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.740
So I highly recommend
Norwegian Air, not sponsored.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.027
Just pure advice.

00:27:37.027 --> 00:27:38.360
LESLIE TOBIN: What about hotels?

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.770
Any particular hotel chains
that you are loyal to?

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.978
Or do you prefer
aggregators like Hotels.com.

00:27:45.978 --> 00:27:47.270
BRIAN KELLY: I love Hotels.com.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.510
So in the US, there's
the Venture card,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.630
and it gives 10 points
per dollar on Hotels.com.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.250
And each point is
worth $0.01 minimum,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.230
so that's 10% back for
every dollar spent.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.960
Plus Hotels.com has a
program where you earn one

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.113
free night for every 10.

00:28:01.113 --> 00:28:02.780
That you don't need
the credit card for.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.170
So anyone here can be getting
that one night for every 10.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.470
So instead of booking
hotels on Booking.com,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.110
use Hotels.com because
they give you 10% back.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.460
So in the US, I get 20%
back for every hotel

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.560
by using Hotels.com.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.990
Marriott, I was a
lifetime SPG platform.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.000
The Marriott program, a lot
of people are unhappy with it.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.360
It's been a really bad
integration tech-wise.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.400
It's still a pretty
good program, especially

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.350
for super premium properties.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.648
So when I can I do
Marriott, but I like

00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:32.940
saying at really unique hotels.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.330
I don't like being
boxed in with one brand.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.970
So Hotels.com is basically
every hotel in the world.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.790
So I think that's
a great program.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.180
Unless you're doing a
ton of business travel,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.010
there's not that many
Marriott properties in the UK.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.010
I feel like the hotel
game isn't as strong here,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.140
but I think Marriott
is a decent--

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.672
Hyatt's OK.

00:28:52.672 --> 00:28:54.880
I get a little less excited
about the hotel programs.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.505
What about you?

00:28:55.505 --> 00:28:58.110
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah, I mean,
hotel points are actually

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.250
much harder to earn
here, because there's

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.260
no lucrative credit
cards where you can

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.430
be earning masses of points.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.680
And I think it's something
that's just a bit less sexy

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.827
spoken about less.

00:29:08.827 --> 00:29:10.910
But actually, one thing
I'll add onto because I've

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.200
used it a couple of times.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.620
With the Amex Platinum, you
get access to Amex fine hotels

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.287
and resorts.

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.620
And actually, they have some
incredible properties there

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.000
with some amazing benefits.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.430
And just a couple of days
ago, I'm going to Indonesia.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.770
And I was looking
up Jakarta, and they

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.860
have two hotels on
offer in Jakarta,

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.450
a Mandarin Oriental and
I forget the other one.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.510
But the prices, it
wasn't that expensive.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:36.530
They were, for what
they were, maybe $260

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:41.510
a night at these two hotels,
which were super luxury.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.040
The price on Booking.com,
Hotels.com, was about the same.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.290
It was maybe $10 less.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.250
But actually, you got $100 spa
or food and beverage credit

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.900
for the stay, so
for a two-night stay

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.760
that was a crazy
benefit, plus upgrade,

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.993
plus 12:00 PM check-in,
plus 4:00 PM check out.

00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:57.160
All these different things--

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.993
BRIAN KELLY: The
Gleneagles is a fine hotel,

00:29:58.993 --> 00:30:01.280
and they give two free
rounds of golf and free--

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.690
it was like 400 pounds for
booking through Amex was

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.420
the perk, which--

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.860
LESLIE TOBIN:
That's a great deal.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.720
BRIAN KELLY: --of
course I didn't use.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.400
But--

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.817
NICKY KELVIN: Yeah,
so that said--

00:30:09.817 --> 00:30:11.160
BRIAN KELLY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.870
NICKY KELVIN:
--there are all sorts

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.120
of ways you can extract
a little bit more value.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.080
I tend to use Hotels.com.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.030
Actually, on the
BA shopping portal,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.918
they have Avios earning
through those hotel programs.

00:30:22.918 --> 00:30:24.960
And actually, one other
thing that I really like,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.335
which people don't
talk about, is

00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:30.230
BA Holidays, where you can book
a flight and a hotel together.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.290
And they give you a discount
across the whole product.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.230
It also allows you to
just pay a deposit,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.740
and you pay 150 pounds.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.020
You pay close to the time.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.820
You get bonus Avios.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.388
And you see prices sometimes
really, really crazy prices,

00:30:44.388 --> 00:30:45.680
especially for European breaks.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.640
I often look at--

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.390
you tick just five star,
in May, on a weekend,

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.090
and it filters it all down,
European destinations.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.930
And you see things like
Budapest with flights

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:02.882
on BA with two nights in a five
star hotel 139 pounds a person

00:31:02.882 --> 00:31:03.840
or something like that.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.600
So there's some really
amazing things on there.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.975
BRIAN KELLY: Which,
of course, we

00:31:06.975 --> 00:31:09.215
will write about and publish
at thepointsguy.co.uk.

00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:10.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.730
By the way, we were
originally going to do

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.950
the pointsguy.com/uk so we
could have all of our good SEO.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.510
For these darn
privacy laws, we had

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.040
to start from
scratch on Thursday.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.530
So whoever here works in the
Google authority department

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.238
in like the dark room
with the algorithm,

00:31:26.238 --> 00:31:29.180
if you could just pop us up
a couple notches, thank you.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.460
I hate to ask for favors, but--

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.300
LESLIE TOBIN: I don't
think it works that way.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300
BRIAN KELLY: No, I know.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.680
That was the joke.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.650
But if not, if it does--

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.275
you never know.

00:31:38.275 --> 00:31:40.233
LESLIE TOBIN: We're going
to take some audience

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:42.790
questions, so if anybody wants
to line up at the microphone.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.250
And before we do that,
we'll talk a little bit

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.330
about travel life.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.080
So you seem like you
are always on the road.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.000
You're hopping from one
plane ride to the next.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.670
How do you maintain
balance in your life?

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.228
BRIAN KELLY: Well,
that's a great question.

00:31:57.228 --> 00:31:59.020
I think the biggest
thing like with jet lag

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.322
is choosing the right flights.

00:32:00.322 --> 00:32:01.780
And you can choose
horrible flight.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.490
So when coming from
the US to London,

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.783
I never, never, never
take the 4:00 or 5:00 PM.

00:32:06.783 --> 00:32:08.950
Who can sleep from 4:00 in
the afternoon to midnight

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.325
and then be on a
normal schedule?

00:32:10.325 --> 00:32:14.128
So I like traveling
at 10:00 PM flight.

00:32:14.128 --> 00:32:15.670
It really makes a
difference in terms

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.840
of just getting used to it.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.730
Also choosing the right plane--

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.510
if you have a choice of a
clunky 30-year-old triple 7

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.290
or the new BA or Virgin 787,
the 787 even in economy,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.620
it's better on your skin.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.912
It's a quieter plane.

00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:31.120
It's just a nicer experience.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.440
And those small things--

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.950
I actually have been
using Dream Water, which

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.100
is a melatonin little bottle.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.747
It's awesome.

00:32:39.747 --> 00:32:41.080
I try not to use too many like--

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.940
I don't use like
Ambiens on planes.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.550
That's when you hear
the news article

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.800
of people peeing in the
aisles, shouting obscenities.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.568
Usually that's people taking
hardcore sleeping pills

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.610
that they're not used to.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.100
If you're going to, always
try them on the ground first.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.230
Don't mix them with alcohol.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.260
But then getting to a gym and
really just pushing yourself.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.170
Like in London, I actually
stay near Barry's.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.920
Because I know the
closer I am to the gym,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.970
the higher the odds are.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.660
So it's tough, but get lag
can truly ruin your life.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.350
So especially the New
York, London's really--

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.240
I would much prefer to
be on a 12-hour flight

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.488
than a six-hour flight.

00:33:14.488 --> 00:33:15.280
LESLIE TOBIN: Yeah.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.770
It's not quite long enough
to get a good night's sleep.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.320
What about for you?

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.570
NICKY KELVIN: Actually, the
working out thing is really

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.960
a big part of my strategy.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.740
I've kind of stopped drinking--

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.120
not that I ever really
drank much, but just

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.110
drinking plenty of--

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.900
BRIAN KELLY: No,
let's be honest.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.880
It's really easy,
especially, when

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.297
you redeem for
business and first,

00:33:32.297 --> 00:33:34.120
when it's like the
drinks are flowing.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.703
I mean, there's something about
having a wine buzz in the sky.

00:33:36.703 --> 00:33:39.340
But there's a very fine line
of like it's dehydrated.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.173
I mean, there's nothing
worse than waking up

00:33:41.173 --> 00:33:44.890
with like there's no ounce of
like hydration in your body,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.260
so yeah, trying to limit it.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.860
NICKY KELVIN: So
yeah, lots of water,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.960
and then working out when I
land, that always sorts me out,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.510
big sweat, blast
off the cobwebs,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.080
and sticking to local
time when I get home.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.060
Just forcing yourself
to stay awake

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.270
and going to bed
at a normal time

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.900
is just like the
most important thing.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.480
Because that dangerous
2:00 PM sleep

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.790
when you wake up at
midnight and then can never

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.097
sleep ever again, that's death.

00:34:12.097 --> 00:34:13.389
LESLIE TOBIN: Horrible feeling.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.250
BRIAN KELLY: And I
actually did cryotherapy

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.250
my first time in London.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.792
So I have a new
YouTube series that's

00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:20.760
launching a week from
tomorrow, Being The Points Guy.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.510
It's like all my travels
around the world,

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.093
and cool destinations,
and jumping out

00:34:24.093 --> 00:34:26.080
of helicopters, but
also the tactical stuff,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.570
like how I pack, how
to combat jet lag.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.100
And cryotherapy was amazing.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.937
And I also the other
day did an IV drip.

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.270
It's really expensive in London.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.228
It was like 200 pounds.

00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.449
But an anesthesiologist
came to my hotel room,

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.320
and they put in all
this amazing stuff.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.989
And it hydrates you.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.239
Like, they can do a
lot of witchcraft.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.873
And it was expensive, but if
you ever really need a reset--

00:34:49.873 --> 00:34:51.040
and I wasn't even hung over.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.300
Everyone's like, yeah right.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.060
NICKY KELVIN: Brian came in like
skipping into the pop-up shop.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.230
BRIAN KELLY: Like more
so than I am today,

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.587
so if you can imagine that.

00:34:57.587 --> 00:34:58.483
Yeah.

00:34:58.483 --> 00:34:59.400
LESLIE TOBIN: Amazing.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.500
So I think we have
an audience question.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.430
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:04.150
I'm Sara.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.500
And my question to
you would be, which

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.310
area do you think will be
prone to getting points

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.060
in the future?

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.890
I'm not sure if you've seen
"Black Mirror" where there's

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.840
this episode where
people can get points

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.440
through human interactions can
get either negative or positive

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.280
points.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.822
So I was wondering,
what do you think

00:35:19.822 --> 00:35:23.380
would be the future
point rewarding systems?

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.472
Any crazy ideas?

00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:25.930
BRIAN KELLY: The
future of loyalty?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.660
I mean, in the
US, loyalty points

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.510
you can get for almost anything.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:39.410
But in terms of higher
points, I don't know.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.050
Do you have an answer to that?

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.800
NICKY KELVIN: If I'm
talking about the UK,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.233
I'm hoping that the
UK public becomes

00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:47.150
more aware of miles and
points, and retailers,

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.720
and other merchants start
to grow and expand programs.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.300
That would be great here, in
a way that they are already

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.370
in the US.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.660
Just put more on offer.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.493
Actually, and there's
things that I find out

00:35:58.493 --> 00:36:01.070
about that I didn't know
that I hope roll out more.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:06.890
So for example, Waitrose, you
can put in your Amex card--

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.890
any of your credit cards--
into the Flying Club shopping

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.340
portal, and when you spend
in-store at Waitrose,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.923
they just pay you Virgin miles.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:17.090
I don't really understand
how that inspires loyalty.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.900
I guess it would make me spend
at Waitrose more in-store

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.320
and pick that over
anywhere else.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.530
But if they rolled out
more of that kind of stuff,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.080
so hopefully that stuff works,
UK retailers and merchants

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.400
become aware of this stuff and
realize it can drive loyalty.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.602
So more-- more of the same and
bigger of the same would be--

00:36:34.602 --> 00:36:36.560
I'm not saying that's
where I think it will go,

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.070
but I hope it will.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.800
BRIAN KELLY: Using miles, it's
just a coupons, essentially--

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.900
retailers, merchants, to
get people in a store.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.840
So people in the UK don't really
care that much about points,

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.590
but we're already
talking to people.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.160
Like, once we get the
audience built up,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.290
we think we'll be able
to encourage more people

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.510
to take a little
slice of your profit

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.453
to give to people to get them
engaged and get new consumers.

00:36:56.453 --> 00:36:57.370
LESLIE TOBIN: Amazing.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.953
NICKY KELVIN: And actually just
on that point, the BA shopping

00:36:59.953 --> 00:37:01.880
portal, I was having
a conversation

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.240
with the guy who's the product
manager for that whole system.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.070
And he said, we're in the
middle of launching new stuff

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.950
to try really hard to get into
the minds of British people

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.600
to shop through the portal more.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.480
So the people on the loyalty
side in the companies

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.070
are aware, and they
are now starting

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.282
to work harder to try and
do more and be attractive.

00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:23.115
LESLIE TOBIN: Great.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.160
I have a much more specific
question than that.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.390
You sort of touched upon
it very briefly earlier.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.710
When traveling
with credit cards,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.410
there's typically-- so
for the Amex Gold Card,

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.862
there's a 3% transaction fee.

00:37:41.862 --> 00:37:44.320
I was wondering what you guys
recommended in terms of like,

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.240
should you take out
a second credit card

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.210
for using abroad that has
no foreign transaction?

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.120
And if so, which ones
would you recommend?

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.770
NICKY KELVIN: I'll
tell you what I do,

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.660
because I think this
is working really

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.550
well for me at the moment.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.200
I have a Curve card.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.930
And Curve, I don't know how
many of you are aware of it,

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.530
but you can have all of your
credit cards and debit cards

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.570
sitting behind it.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.430
And you can sort of
select which one.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.830
It's actually quite cool.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:09.790
You pick the card.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.582
When you pay with your
curve, it charges it

00:38:11.582 --> 00:38:13.240
to one of your credit cards.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.610
And you have 14 days
to change which one.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:17.740
So it's called the Go
Back in Time function.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.300
And seven days later, you
can be like, actually,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.967
I'm not going to
charge it to that card.

00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:22.340
I'm going to charge this card.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.420
Now, they just launched Amex
functionality again on that,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.350
and it's such a shame.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.350
Because they give you a
MasterCard, and it means

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.560
you can spend your Amex anywhere
and spend abroad with no fees

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.520
because it charges
as a purchase.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.410
You can even take out
of a cash machine,

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.830
and you don't pay
interest on it.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:41.622
There are some limits
on the amount of cash

00:38:41.622 --> 00:38:43.822
you can take out abroad
from an ATM and some limits

00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:46.280
on foreign transaction, but
they have different pay levels.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.970
But what I have is the Curve
card with the Virgin Atlantic

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.780
MasterCard sitting behind it.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.720
So at the moment when
I'm shopping abroad,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.332
I'm paying zero FX, and I'm
earning 1 and 1/2 Virgin miles

00:38:56.332 --> 00:38:58.540
on everything because
ultimately Curve is charging it

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.100
to my Virgin card.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.360
Hopefully they bring back
the Amex functionality

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.340
so I'll be able to
do the same thing

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.570
but charge it to
my Amex card too.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.400
BRIAN KELLY: But it's still
1 and 1/2 Virgin, no fees.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.030
It's pretty good.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.840
NICKY KELVIN: It's really good.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.400
But I agree--

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.830
AUDIENCE: You're [INAUDIBLE]
passing the fee, basically.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.090
NICKY KELVIN: But
would I go and use

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.940
my BA Amex card or an Amex card
earning one Avios per pound

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.440
abroad?

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.880
It doesn't really make sense.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.540
3% doesn't cancel
out the one Avios.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.290
BRIAN KELLY: But the
Amex is 2x on travel,

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.330
or no it's 2x abroad?

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.050
NICKY KELVIN: The Amex
Gold is 2x abroad.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.467
BRIAN KELLY: So
if you get-- like,

00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:30.850
we value Amex points in
the US at like $0.02.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.880
If you're close to getting, and
you want to top up your Amex,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.670
when you think about it, if
you value them at $0.02 each,

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.920
you'd be getting 4% in
value back and you pay 3%.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.660
It sucks, but you
could still win.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.320
But you have to value
Amex at that level.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.635
I mean, I can spend Amex
points to get $0.05 per point

00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:47.470
in value.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.865
I really want you
to give the tip on--

00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:52.240
there's this little known
feature of the BA Avios program

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.720
that can get insane value.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.070
He got $0.20 per point in value
from this secret redemption.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.570
Not secret, it's
just unknown about.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.195
So I just want you
to share it quickly,

00:40:00.195 --> 00:40:02.050
what it is because I love it.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:05.000
NICKY KELVIN: It's called
a multi-carrier award,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.700
and it allows you to
book a ticket with Avios

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.710
on two or more
Oneworld airlines.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.890
So my ticket included
British Airways, Qantas,

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.350
and Cathay Pacific, but
it can be any two or more

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.730
of any of the Oneworld airlines.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.647
And it prices on a
completely different chart.

00:40:20.647 --> 00:40:22.300
So instead of
paying per segment,

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.120
you pay an overall cost of
whatever the mileage is,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.330
and it's in mileage bands.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.840
So there's a cost
for 0 to 5,000 miles,

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.390
and then 5,000 to 10,000
miles is another cost.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.000
It's amazing because they
work on a different multi,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.300
across classes.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.020
So now if any of
you are into Avios,

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.000
you'll know you pay double
for premium economy,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.250
triple for business,
quadruple for first.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.320
But most carrier
would still work

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.830
on the old method of 1 and
1/2 for premium, times two

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.670
for business, times
three for first.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.585
So business redemptions
can be really valuable.

00:40:52.585 --> 00:40:53.710
So you should check it out.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.960
I'm going to have a post
going live on it pretty soon.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.480
AUDIENCE: How did you
do that because ba.com

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.855
is awful with different
segments and differnet

00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:02.063
classes and things like that.

00:41:02.063 --> 00:41:04.647
NICKY KELVIN: You need to block
out about a week of your life.

00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:05.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.690
Get a friendly
agent on the phone.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.900
No, actually, granted,
those kind of tickets

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.730
take a bit of planning.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.260
I use ba.com to find
the availability.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.870
BRIAN KELLY: Segment by segment.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.495
NICKY KELVIN: So I
knew this was there,

00:41:18.495 --> 00:41:20.290
and I'd write down,
OK, it's on this flight

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.920
number, this date, this class.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.100
I actually used
the Qantas system

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.740
to find the Qantas
domestic flights because BA

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.640
doesn't find those very well.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.720
And then I had all this
big list called up.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.270
I said, I'm booking a
multi-carrier award.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.650
The agent knew
what it was often.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.363
If they didn't, I would just put
the phone down, started again.

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:40.780
And we went through the whole
thing, priced everything up.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.450
I had to do it twice because
I booked for me and my friend

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.150
on separate accounts.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.923
And it took a whole
hour on the phone.

00:41:47.923 --> 00:41:49.840
So you have to be willing
to put that time in.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.680
BRIAN KELLY: $20,000
in value for one hour.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.550
Hmm.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.467
NICKY KELVIN: So yeah.

00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:55.592
BRIAN KELLY: And just to
tease it, later this year,

00:41:55.592 --> 00:41:57.070
we're coming out
with our new TPG

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.653
app that's going to
track your points,

00:41:58.653 --> 00:41:59.748
track your credit cards.

00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:01.540
We just bought a company
called ExpertFlyer

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.370
that actually pings the airlines
for availability, upgrades, et

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:05.870
cetera.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.020
So the grand future of
The Points Guy-- today

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.790
we're a content shop.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.410
Our app is going
to change the game.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.255
We're working with the
airlines directly to add value.

00:42:14.255 --> 00:42:16.380
Because right now, the
booking process is horrible.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.838
I mean, how many
different websites

00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:20.560
do you have to-- and kind of
figure out what's a good hotel?

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.370
Or how should I
buy this airfare?

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.520
So The Points Guy in
the next couple of years

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.310
is going to really elevate you a
whole logged-in experience that

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.070
will give you your net
worth in points, and tips,

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:32.980
and curated content,
and all of that.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.330
LESLIE TOBIN: Amazing.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.955
BRIAN KELLY: I'm very
excited for that,

00:42:35.955 --> 00:42:38.980
and I think it's going
to dramatically help

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.509
our readers get that value so
you don't have to just sift

00:42:41.509 --> 00:42:44.176
through a million old blog posts
and kind of cobble it together.

00:42:44.176 --> 00:42:45.093
LESLIE TOBIN: Awesome.

00:42:45.093 --> 00:42:45.920
Britney?

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I was curious if you

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.620
are able to get this Chase
Sapphire Reserve card,

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.140
but it's going to involve
your making money in pounds,

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.190
and then you have to transfer
it back over to dollars

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.740
and spend in dollars.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.710
It says no foreign
transaction fees,

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.580
but actually, is there
a little bit of a cut

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.080
that the bank is
taking or whatever?

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.413
BRIAN KELLY: You'd be surprised.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.580
We're doing tests on that
on foreign transaction fees.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.180
We bought the same item
in multiple countries

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:16.990
at the same time.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.540
And the actual conversion
rate with banks-- now,

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.580
when you're actually
transferring funds,

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.720
I know that there can be.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.160
So I think you have to
look into it by your bank.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.097
Yeah, if there's like a 3%
spread, then yeah that's--

00:43:30.097 --> 00:43:31.930
actually, I mean, it
could still be worth it

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.260
if you're really
earning tons more.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.790
But I know most of
my expat friends

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.237
still use your US cards here.

00:43:38.237 --> 00:43:39.820
They have no foreign
transaction fees.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.445
And they're roughly--
they're not going

00:43:41.445 --> 00:43:44.503
to charge you 3% to pay that.

00:43:44.503 --> 00:43:46.420
Although, I don't know
when you transfer funds

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.338
from pounds to US.

00:43:48.338 --> 00:43:48.880
I don't know.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.380
Has anyone here had any
experience with that?

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.588
LESLIE TOBIN: I've done that.

00:43:51.588 --> 00:43:53.560
I have that exact
situation, actually.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.360
And I transfer
with TransferWise,

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.280
and it's an amazing service.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.910
It--

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.130
BRIAN KELLY: So you
still use your US cards?

00:43:59.130 --> 00:43:59.770
LESLIE TOBIN: I use my
Chase Sapphire Reserve--

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.170
BRIAN KELLY: Earn the triple.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:02.930
LESLIE TOBIN: --and
work here in the UK.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:03.430
Yeah.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.940
So I recommend.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.360
BRIAN KELLY: You heard it here.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:04.810
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.170
Helpful.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:05.916
Thank you, guys.

00:44:05.916 --> 00:44:07.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:08.770
LESLIE TOBIN: OK,
one more audience

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.880
question, and then
we'll start to wrap up.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.187
Thanks for coming.

00:44:14.187 --> 00:44:16.270
Mine's kind of specifically
about spending points.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.560
I know you mentioned
you hear it a lot,

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.560
people are like, I don't
know how to spend them.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.610
So I've got the BA
Premium Black-- you know,

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.042
the black one.

00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:24.975
And I've got so many
points from work travel,

00:44:24.975 --> 00:44:27.310
and I've had the companion
voucher for like a year,

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.380
but I keep looking
for ways to spend it,

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.240
and it keeps saying
like, there's never

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.507
availability and
same with Avios,

00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:35.090
like even using them
to get money off.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.190
So I wondering if
you had any tips

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.920
on like finding the right ways
to spend points, specifically

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.180
airline points?

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.960
NICKY KELVIN: Where
do you want to go?

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.060
Like, what's your kind of dream?

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.810
AUDIENCE: I want to
spend it on long haul,

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:49.270
like I guess Asia, for
the companion voucher.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:58.735
NICKY KELVIN: OK, so if you've
got a year left on your voucher

00:44:58.735 --> 00:45:00.360
before it expires,
then you've probably

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.150
got a chance to get this right.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.350
But BA releases flights--

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.810
they release two business class
seats and four economy seats

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:12.300
on all long haul flights for
use with Avios for redemption.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.950
So they release
them 355 days out.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.820
So if you pick the flights
that you want to take,

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.400
there will always be at least
two business class seats

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.780
on every flight.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.000
You have to be there on
the phone at midnight

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.702
to book those tickets, but
they are available to you

00:45:26.702 --> 00:45:28.165
to anywhere.

00:45:28.165 --> 00:45:29.790
That's most applicable
if you're trying

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.780
to go a busy time of year
to a popular destination

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.820
and to often destinations
where they don't have

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.440
high frequency of flights--

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.970
the classic ones like Cape
Town or Australia, especially

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.270
in our winter, people
trying to go away

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.090
around Christmas holidays.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.590
If you really just
want to use them,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:48.790
and you want to go somewhere,
and you're not that bothered,

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.090
or you really just want
to fly first class,

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.670
places like New York
are very easy to redeem

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.550
to because there's so
many flights a day.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.498
And I often see on
any day of the year,

00:45:59.498 --> 00:46:02.040
you can pretty much get business
and first class availability

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.640
to somewhere like New York.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.370
Other places are
just way harder.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.900
Because there's 10 flights
a day to that versus two

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.460
to Cape Town.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.137
I also think Asia is a
little bit more difficult.

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:15.720
But I would say open yourself
up to flying to different places

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.845
in Asia and use your Avios.

00:46:16.845 --> 00:46:18.540
So if you want to
get to Bangkok,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.665
don't just look at Bangkok.

00:46:19.665 --> 00:46:21.240
Look at Singapore, Kuala Lumpur.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.008
Look at Hong Kong.

00:46:23.008 --> 00:46:25.050
And then from there, you
can even use your Avios.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.675
For example, from
Hong Kong, fly Cathay

00:46:26.675 --> 00:46:28.668
to literally anywhere in Asia.

00:46:28.668 --> 00:46:31.210
BRIAN KELLY: So we actually also
have a website, I mentioned,

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:32.820
we bought called ExpertFlyer.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.550
ExpertFlyers scrapes and
has direct connections

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.580
to a ton of airlines,
including BA.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.120
It's $10 a month, and you
get to up to 100 alerts

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.030
for award tickets.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.800
And what that means is you
can set two tickets available

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.770
for companion on all
these different routes,

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.690
and then every day,
multiple times a day,

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.520
we scrape to see if
anything's available.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.090
And then when they are, you
get an ExpertFlyer notification

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:57.928
that emails you.

00:46:57.928 --> 00:47:00.220
Because things are opening
up and closing all the time.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.137
The airlines have very
dynamic pricing models.

00:47:02.137 --> 00:47:04.477
They may drop six
business class seats

00:47:04.477 --> 00:47:06.060
because their pricing
model tells them

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.330
Singapore is open next week.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.797
It's a dead week or whatever.

00:47:08.797 --> 00:47:11.130
You would never know unless
you were checking every day.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.090
So ExpertFlyer does
that work for you.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.940
And that's what we'll have in
the TPG app later this year.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.630
But we have blog
posts on ExpertFlyer.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.690
For $10 a month to help
you get two business class

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:26.997
seats that are worth thousands,
that's more of an expert tool.

00:47:26.997 --> 00:47:28.080
It's not that hard to use.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.122
You work at Google, I'm
sure you're pretty smart.

00:47:30.122 --> 00:47:31.978
But it is sort of
for experts, but it's

00:47:31.978 --> 00:47:34.020
those are my favorite
emails in the world to get.

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:38.420
Because I'll set tons of alerts,
and it's like that Qantas

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.920
first class, there's only going
to be one or two seats ever,

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.260
but I snatched them before
anyone else can book them

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.357
online.

00:47:44.357 --> 00:47:45.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.598
LESLIE TOBIN: Thank you.

00:47:46.598 --> 00:47:48.390
All right, we only have
a few minutes left,

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.580
so I'm going to end
with one final question.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.280
Can you tell us what is the
best deal that you've ever

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.895
gotten booking with points
or your favorite experience

00:47:56.895 --> 00:47:58.965
booking with points?

00:47:58.965 --> 00:48:00.090
BRIAN KELLY: Well, I'll go.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.650
So my favorite way of
using points these days,

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:09.390
the most meaningful to me,
is through our partnership

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.840
with Rainbow Railroad.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.740
So it's an amazing organization.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.390
Basically LGBT people are
persecuted around the world.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.840
We know it's still illegal
in over 50 countries,

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.553
some countries
worse than others.

00:48:20.553 --> 00:48:21.720
If you've heard of reports--

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.260
I remember 2 and 1/2 years
ago listening about Chechnya.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.900
LGBT people are
being rounded up.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.530
There are actually
concentration camps.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.610
And I remember reading
"The New York Times"

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.990
article being like--

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.100
like, you know, you deny.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.640
This can't be happening.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.530
It's true.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.720
Jamaica, trans people
are killed every week.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.010
It's horrible for them there.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:41.790
So through Rainbow Railroad, you
can donate your airline miles,

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.460
and they actually fly people
out and get them asylum.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.880
So I've been working with
them for the last three years.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.505
We're actually about
to do a $1 million

00:48:49.505 --> 00:48:51.650
donation campaign
around Pride this year.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.150
If any of you are going to be
in New York, it's World Pride.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.420
It's going to be the biggest
pride ever on multiple levels.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.350
But 50,000 miles can
help save someone's life.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.375
And you may think, oh,
a lot of huge charities

00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:05.500
will take your miles, and
they just liquidate them.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.070
But what happens with
Rainbow Railroad,

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.870
they're in a huge pool,
and we book people.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.910
So I had the ability,
going to Toronto where

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.810
a lot of our refugees live--

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.410
or asylees-- and I
was out to dinner

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.040
with like 20 of
these Chechnyan guys,

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.780
slashes across their
face, everything.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.263
And they told me the minute the
plane took off from Moscow--

00:49:25.263 --> 00:49:26.430
because we have safe houses.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.667
We get them places.

00:49:27.667 --> 00:49:30.000
And to know that my frequent
flyer miles-- they actually

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.083
connected me with the guy.

00:49:31.083 --> 00:49:33.392
And you know, the minute
the plane took off,

00:49:33.392 --> 00:49:34.350
I just started bawling.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.080
And to think my frequent
flyer miles-- like,

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.510
yes, I love going to Tahiti.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.488
Help save someone's
life, there's

00:49:42.488 --> 00:49:43.780
no better feeling in the world.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.520
So there's a ton of charities
you can donate your points to,

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.470
finding one that you
really connect with

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.430
and getting involved.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.343
So yeah, points can
save people's lives.

00:49:54.343 --> 00:49:56.676
NICKY KELVIN: I mean, I should
have gone first, I think.

00:49:56.676 --> 00:49:58.956
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:59.698 --> 00:50:00.990
LESLIE TOBIN: We can close now.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.698
NICKY KELVIN: Here's
selfish Nicky with--

00:50:02.698 --> 00:50:03.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.420
--a holiday that
he enjoyed himself.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.520
I'll give you one
that I really loved,

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.330
which was such a neat redemption
was they had an American

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.550
Airlines card in the UK,
unfortunately, not available

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:14.060
anymore.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.173
And the sign-up
bonus for the card

00:50:16.173 --> 00:50:18.590
plus the amount you had to
spend to get the sign-up bonus,

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.320
you were left with 40,000
advantage points, which

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.230
then was the right
amount to book London

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.320
to Abu Dhabi on the
Etihad Apartments.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.670
And that was just the
most insane experience,

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.760
especially because I
paid these 40,000 miles

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.960
that I just received.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.430
It was 186 pounds tax.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.100
And I got picked
up by a luxury car

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.195
at my house, driven
to the airport.

00:50:39.195 --> 00:50:40.952
I was in an apartment
on the plane,

00:50:40.952 --> 00:50:42.410
and showered on
the plane, and then

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.515
was taken to wherever I
wanted to go in the Emirates

00:50:45.515 --> 00:50:46.640
when I landed in Abu Dhabi.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.168
So that was a special
and neat redemption.

00:50:49.168 --> 00:50:49.960
LESLIE TOBIN: Yeah.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.330
NICKY KELVIN: I
didn't save any lives.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.495
Actually, on that trip--

00:50:53.495 --> 00:50:54.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:54.710
--I--

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:56.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.130
BRIAN KELLY: Where are
you going with this?

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.620
NICKY KELVIN: On that trip, I
ended up driving up to Oman,

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.820
and I did try to
resuscitate a man who

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.112
had a heart attack on the boat.

00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:07.195
But he unfortunately died.

00:51:07.195 --> 00:51:07.730
But I did--

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:09.882
BRIAN KELLY: You
tried to save a life.

00:51:09.882 --> 00:51:11.090
NICKY KELVIN: I was part of--

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.310
BRIAN KELLY: A for effort.

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:13.310
LESLIE TOBIN: All right.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.852
Thank you guys so
much for attending.

00:51:14.852 --> 00:51:16.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:17.210
BRIAN KELLY: And with that--

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.127
NICKY KELVIN: I love
that I just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:19.127 --> 00:51:22.660
[APPLAUSE]
