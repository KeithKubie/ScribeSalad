00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
Rising 85 feet above the surface of one ocean,
and then descending again to be gently floated

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.842
on another one, ships that traverse the Panama
Canal shave nearly 8,000 miles off of their

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:47.870
voyage to the other side by investing a long
workday climbing up, and then going back down,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.530
the Isthmus of Panama.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.320
Made possible by a handful of locks, despite
the extreme expense for commercial vessels

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.559
to traverse it, about 5% of all the trade
in the entire world passes through this early

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.079
20th century engineering marvel.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.600
Where the Canal sits, the Isthmus of Panama
is a mere 51 miles across.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.190
Compared with the Suez Canal, which was twice
that length when first constructed in the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.770
modern era in 1869, the shorter Panama Canal
was expected to be relatively easy to build

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.780
when first envisioned in 1879.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.990
And, since those visionaries had successfully
completed the sea-level Suez Canal, they planned

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.220
on making the man-made waterway that would
join the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.159
same manner (i.e., at sea-level).

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.619
Sea-level canals are precisely what the name
implies – the channels are dug sufficiently

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.140
deep that their water surfaces are the same
level as that of the bodies of water that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.260
they join– and to accomplish this, a great
deal of earth is removed.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.229
In the construction of the sea-level Suez
canal, approximately 600 million cubic feet

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.469
of stuff was removed from the land, and more
dredged from the adjoining bodies of water.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.680
With that French-dug channel that joins the
Mediterranean and Red Seas taking only 10

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.110
years to complete in middle of 19th century,
many thought a similar channel across the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.270
far-smaller Central American peninsula would
be a snap.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.410
In one of the western world’s greatest examples
of hubris, they could not have been more wrong.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.900
Diplomat and engineer Vicomte Ferdinand Marie
de Lesseps was instrumental in building the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.780
Suez canal, and he led the initial work on
the Panama Canal as well.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.300
Disease and construction delays hampered the
project, and after nearly seven years, only

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.060
a few of the hundreds of feet of excavation
necessary had been accomplished – and this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.290
just from one part of the channel.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.320
Yet even with these dramatic failures, it
still took de Lesseps another two years before

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.940
he agreed to consider the construction of
locks to help solve the increased elevation

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.919
in the middle, thus reducing the amount of
excavation needed between the two sea-level

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.919
sides.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.330
But even then, the locks were intended to
be a mere temporary solution while the digging

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.370
for the sea-level passage continued.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.660
Interestingly, the person chosen to construct
the locks was none other than Gustav Eiffel

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.690
(who built a tower in Paris the next year
for the 1889 World’s Fair), but it was already

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.359
too late for the Central American project.

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.090
Compagnie Nouvelle, the company funding the
work, went bankrupt in 1888, and de Lesseps’

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.430
died in disgrace shortly after.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.650
Understanding the immense value such a canal
would have to the United States, President

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.890
Theodore Roosevelt committed to the construction
of the Canal, and in 1903, negotiated the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.870
Hay-Herrán Treaty with Colombia (which owned
the canal zone at the time).

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.709
Wisely, the Columbian Senate feared the United
States would use the opportunity to seize

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.730
even greater political power in the country
and refused to ratify it.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.989
Undeterred, the U.S. then aided a Panamanian
nationalists’ rebellion (including stopping

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.850
American-owned railroads from transporting
Colombian troops and sending the Nashville,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.520
a U.S. warship, to protect the rebels).

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.930
On November 6, 1903, the United States recognized
the Republic of Panama.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.449
Twelve days later, a new treaty, the Hay-Bunau-Varilla,
was signed, and it granted the U.S. permanent

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.930
and exclusive possession of the zone (in exchange
for a $10 million signing bonus, or about

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.830
$255 million today, and $250,000 annually
beginning 9 years later).

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.269
Work was slow-going over the next few years
with efforts focused on revamping the 60-year-old

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.019
railroad and improving working and living
conditions.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.190
The locks were begun in August 1909 with the
construction of the Gatun locks (on the Atlantic

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.190
side).

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.160
Consisting of over 2 million cubic yards of
concrete, at Gatun there are three sets of

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.840
paired locks (the Canal is actually two parallel
channels that, in principle, would allow two

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.040
ships to pass in opposing directions at the
same time).

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.540
Each lock is 1,050 feet long and 110 feet
wide, and together they are placed consecutively,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.020
like watery stair steps, to ultimately raise
(or lower) ships the 85 feet between the highest

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.520
point on land and the oceans’ surface.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.860
As a ship enters a lock, over 25 million of
gallons of water is added to raise the boat

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.840
to a level sufficient to allow it to enter
the next lock; walls that are anywhere from

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.509
45 to 55 feet thick at the base and tapering
to just 8 feet at the top hold all of this

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.570
water in.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.300
This process repeats twice on either side
until the ship reaches the plateau where it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.540
sails across the isthmus toward the other
set of locks to repeat the process, but in

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.319
reverse, where water is drained to lower the
ship at each step.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.210
On the Pacific side, there is a single lock
near the apex at Gatun Lake called the Pedro

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.080
Miguel, then two others down to the ocean
at Miraflores.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.439
Ships enter via two-pair of large, yet relatively
lightweight and buoyant, 7-feet-thick gates

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.930
that vary in size depending on conditions.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.990
The heaviest and tallest gates (662 tons and
82 feet high) are at Miraflores where the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.169
tidal range varies greatly; in fact, at Miraflores,
the difference between extreme high and low

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.900
tides is so great, depending on conditions,
a boat may need to be lifted (or lowered)

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.270
as much as 64.5 feet or as little as 43 feet;
the remaining Pacific lift, at the Pedro Miguel

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.680
lock, is a consistent 31 feet.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.659
Likewise, on the Atlantic side, the lift of
the three Gatun locks remains relatively stable

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.219
at 85 feet in total.

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:13.039
Remarkably, ships require only 2 feet of clearance
on each side of the Canal, such that, in the

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.939
110-foot wide area, a boat 106 feet across
may traverse – although not necessarily

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.450
without a bit of anxiety.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.860
The maximum length of a ship allowed in the
Canal is 965 feet, and the maximum draft is

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.380
39.5 feet.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.919
Together, these maximum specs are known as
the Panamax.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.949
This is small by today’s standards of commercial
ships, and although some massive ocean vessels

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.370
routinely carry 18,000 containers, the largest
that can pass through the Canal will hold

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.370
less than 5,000.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.370
To continue to remain relevant, the Panama
Canal is expanding.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.971
To be completed in 2016, the new canal will
have a new set of locks that will be 180 feet

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:52.129
wide and 1,400 feet long, with the new post-Panamax
capable of ships as big as the largest that

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.439
traverse the Suez Canal today (which can handle
ships large enough to hold about 13,000 containers).

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:06.039
Interestingly, due to currents and other such
factors, the Pacific around Panama is on average

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:31.979
about eight inches (20 centimeters) higher
than the Atlantic, meaning that if a sea-level

00:07:31.979 --> 00:08:01.139
system was dug, there would be 
a significant current flowing from the Pacific

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:12.840
side to the Atlantic side.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:32.440
Tidal currents would also present something
of a problem for 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.250
ships in this case.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:09:07.730
If you’re wondering how much it 

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:19.770
costs 

00:09:19.770 --> 00:12:48.440
to go through the Panama Canal, this varies
greatly depending on what you’re hauling

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.430
and the size and type of ship.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.410
But, for ballpark reference, if you’re a
commercial ship carrying around the maximum

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.850
5,000 containers, you can expect to pay a
bit under half a million dollars when all

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.170
the fees are added up, give or take depending
on several different factors.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.550
On the other hand, if you’re on a cruise
ship holding, say, 1,000 passengers, the cruise

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.250
company is going to be paying close to $150,000
for the short cut.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.400
That said, if you’re just out on your own
little private boat, depending on size you

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:31.460
can expect to pay around $1,000-$3,000 or
so 

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:49.510
to go from one side to 
the other.
