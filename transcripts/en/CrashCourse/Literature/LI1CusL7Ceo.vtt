Hi there, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature and today we're going to continue

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.710
our discussion of this guy, J.D. Salinger's
The Catcher in the Rye.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.530
So Holden Caulfield is often dismissed by
teenagers for being a whiny little Nathaniel

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.879
Hawthorne, who hates his life but never does
anything to change it.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.610
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! All the kids in school
say he resembles me

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.030
Ughhh, and he does me from the past. And frankly
the idea that your third rate, first world

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.810
problems can be the subject of great literature
is a bit difficult to swallow. Also how many

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.190
times do I have say it, no hats in class!
Especially people hunting hats!

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.160
This is where, if you're the kind of person
who thinks that books should be read with

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.559
their authors in mind, it becomes relevant
that J.D. Salinger saw more combat in World

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.329
War Two than almost any other American. The
great American war novels of that generation;

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.269
Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5, The Naked and
the Dead, were all written by men who saw

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.659
far less of war's horror, than J.D. Salinger
did. He was on Utah Beach on D-Day. At the

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.749
Battle of the Bulge and he was one of the
first Americans to enter a liberated concentration

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.739
camp. And yet Salinger returned home and wrote
not about war, but about Holden Caulfield

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.170
bumming around New York City. So you see you
can say that the stakes aren't high in this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.810
novel, but as Salinger well knew the cruel
and phony world of adults doesn't just treat

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.850
people like Holden Caulfield poorly, it kills
them.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:19.870
[Theme Music]

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.680
So it's easy enough, and extremely common,
to conflate Holden Caulfield the character

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.960
with J.D. Salinger the man. The only time
Salinger seriously considered an adaptation

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.570
of the novel, for instance, it was as a play
in which he would play Holden Caulfield even

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.439
though by then Salinger was in his thirties.
Holden Caulfield is obsessed with young women

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.520
and has a deeply conflicted relationship with
their sexuality; J.D. Salinger dated and married

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.359
many women who were decades younger than him.
But ultimately I don't think it's that interesting

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.950
to use a novel to analyze its author; however,
imagine that you've just come home from a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.170
horribly destructive war. You've seen combat
and you've seen concentration camps and you've

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.890
lost innocence in a way that most of us thankfully
never will. As we discussed last week, the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.600
traditional line on 'Catcher' is that it's
a book about clinging to innocence; you know,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.030
Peter Pan refusing to grow up, Kris Jenner
thinking she can be one of her daughters,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.060
Donald Trump investing his fortune in the
least believable wig ever. And that trying

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.530
to keep everything the same and everyone innocent
is a fool's errand and only leads to madness.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.140
And there's a lot in the text to support that
- how much he loves nothing ever changing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.690
at the Natural History Museum, how he prefers
imagining Jane Gallagher as a terrible Checkers

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.980
player than as a sexual being or how he wants
to be a catcher in the rye. And while Holden

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.980
is driven mad by this desire to preserve innocence,
there's also something kind of heroic about

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.959
it. I mean, the catcher in the rye might be
on a hopeless mission, but at least it's arguably

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.879
a noble one, like Gatsby's, or Romeo's. I
mean, children do deserve our protection,

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.330
and in war and elsewhere Salinger often saw
and sometimes was a victim of that phony adult

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.799
world that preys on the weak and the frightened.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.739
And in this reading, the final scene of the
book is particularly interesting. Let's go

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.200
to the Thought Bubble:
So Holden's little sister Phoebe is riding

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.610
the carousel - an innocent kid activity if
ever there was one - she says she's too big,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.670
but Holden convinces her otherwise. He's definitely
too big though, so he just watches. And as

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.409
the carousel spins, Phoebe, like all the other kids,
keeps reaching for this gold ring; and Holden says:

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.549
"I was sort of afraid she'd fall off the goddamn
horse, but I didn't say anything or do anything.

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.460
The thing with kids is, if they want to grab
the gold ring, you have to let them do it,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.320
and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall
off, but it's bad if you say anything to them."

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.439
The ride finishes, Phoebe tries to get Holden
to ride it, but he declines, and then it starts

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.780
raining, and she puts Holden's red hunting
cap (an enchanted object if ever there was

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.010
one) on his head. This scene is usually read
as being about innocence and change, which

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.560
is how we read it last week, but that red
hunting cap is vital. He tells us that he

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.250
got the hat soon after leaving the fencing
equipment on the subway - an intensely vulnerable

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.739
moment - and it obviously gives him confidence.
He wears it, for instance, when writing the

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.980
essay about Allie's glove, but he's also self-conscious
about it, taking off so as not to look suspicious,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.680
and only putting it on when, quote: "I knew
I wouldn't meet anyone that knew me." And

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.010
there at the end, Phoebe puts the hunting
cap on him, as if to say: "this thing gives

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.599
you the confidence you need to keep the rain
out of your eyes and go on living with some

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.989
semblance of integrity in the adult world?
So wear it."

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.709
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So in short, in a
very quiet and subtle way, Phoebe empathizes

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.910
with Holden, which is striking mostly because
no one has empathized with him in the entire

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.810
novel. Holden can be tremendously empathetic:
remember that he writes to his teacher telling

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.820
him not to feel bad about failing him? But
from his friends to his teachers to nuns to

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.800
prostitutes to cabbies, Holden never feels
like he's being heard. J.D. Salinger is, of

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.650
course, most famous for not wanting to be
famous: he stopped publishing in the early

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.229
1960s and lived an intensely private life. In a
famous passage from 'Catcher', Holden says:

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.699
"What really knocks me out is a book that,
when you're all done reading it, you wish

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.160
the author that wrote it was a terrific friend
of yours and you could call him up on the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.039
phone whenever you felt like it."

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.630
An author, in short, that empathizes with
you. Just as an aside, it's never a good idea

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.610
to try to track down an author; even if he
tweets a lot, still, don't come to his house.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.720
Salinger was that kind of author for millions
of people, including me. We read 'The Catcher

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.009
in the Rye' and feel like the book understands
us in deep and improbable ways, but what Holden

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.759
Caulfield didn't understand and Salinger did
is that a book is not its author. You may

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.650
wish that you could call up the author whenever
you felt like it, and again - don't, but the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.199
real comfort is found not in the author, but
in the text. And this is where it becomes

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.970
relevant that there are in fact two Holdens
in this story: there's the 16-year old Holden

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.290
the story is happening to, and the 17-year
old Holden who is telling us about it.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.319
The Holden the story is happening to sucks
at getting people to listen to him; in fact,

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.240
everyone in the book, including Holden, is
way too self-involved to listen to anybody.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.080
Although the be fair, they're self-involved
because -- oh, it's time for the open letter?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.940
An open letter to the phrase "self-involved." But
first let's see what's in the secret compartment today.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.780
Oh, it's a carousel! Just keeps going around and
around...you are extremely symbolically resonant,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.420
but I've got an open letter to deliver. And this
show ain't about carousels, it's about me.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.819
Dear self-involved,
Whose 'self' would I otherwise be involved

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.080
with? Let's imagine that instead of thinking
about myself I spent all my time thinking

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.310
about some other person and what they're doing
and how they feel right now, you know what

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.289
that's called? - CREEPERING! Unless the person
is Benedict Cumberbatch, then that's called

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.639
Tumblr.
Here's the thing, self-involved - 155,000

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.310
people are going to die today. If I felt the
loss of all 155,000 of those people as intensely

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.190
as I would feel the loss of, say, Benedict
Cumberbatch, then I would be Herman Melville

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.199
crazy. People are self-involved because if
we empathized with all human beings equally

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.669
we would never be able to get anything done.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.620
The challenge is in understanding that while
you'll always be the central character in

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.640
your own narrative, other people matter too
and empathizing with them is hugely important.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.580
In short, self-involved, I don't have a problem with you
exactly, but you don't have to go all fountain-head-y about it.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.180
Best wishes,
John Green

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.979
So the Holden the story is happening to can't
get anyone to listen to him other than his

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.879
sister and a probable creeper. But a year
later, he's found a way to write about his

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:05.970
story and make us care. Through things like
the red hunting cap, we understand him and

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.330
we can listen to him. An even though his battles
aren't fought on Utah Beach or in the Hürtgen

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.050
Forest, we care about them. That's the miracle
of language, especially effective, figurative

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.790
language. The hunting cap, the passive voice,
the Natural History Museum, the carousel:

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.760
all these things are ways into Holden's experience.
That's how he gets into our brains and lets

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.729
us see the world through his eyes.
After describing Phoebe going around and around

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.240
on that carousel, Holden writes, "God, I wish
you could have been there." But we are there!

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.760
When students complain about reading critically,
about having to do all this "English-class-stuff",

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.620
that's what they're forgetting. All that English
class stuff is a way into empathy; for Holden

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:48.460
and for all of us, it's a way to hear and be heard.
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.020
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, the script supervisor is Meredith

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.759
Danko, our associate producer is Danica Johnson,
the show is written by me and our graphics

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.110
team is Thought Bubble.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.979
Every week instead of cursing, I use the name
of writers I like - or, Nathaniel Hawthorne

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.990
- you can suggest other writers in comments
where you can also ask questions about today's

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.430
video that will be answered by our team of
literature experts.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.320
I'm just kidding, Nathaniel Hawthorne, I love
you. Thanks for watching Crash Course, and

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.980
as we say in my home town: don't forget to
be awesome.
