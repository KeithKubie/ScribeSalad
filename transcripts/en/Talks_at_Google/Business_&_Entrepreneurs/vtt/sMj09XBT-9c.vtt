[GOOGLE INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:10.940
LIDIA YAN: Thank you.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.760
So before I start
my spiel I would

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.970
love to ask a few questions
just to break the ice.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.190
So when was the last time you
got up at 2:00 to go to work.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.800
All right.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.940
None of you.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.710
When was the last
time you got scolded

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.100
because you're late for work?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.610
I don't think it exists
in Google, right?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.830
Then when was the
last time you worked

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.360
through Christmas Eve, Christmas
day, New Year's Eve, New Year's

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.670
Day?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.460
None of you.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.130
And when was the last time
you drove over 8 hours?

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.930
How did that feel?

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.410
It sucks.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.060
Right.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.170
And have you tried parking
at an emergency zone before?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.280
All right.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.310
We have all the
law-abiding citizens here.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.030
And when was the last time you
drove through snow and wind?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.800
I did it once.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.513
When was that?

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:14.623
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:15.290
LIDIA YAN: Yeah.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.930
I remember when I went to
Vegas I drove through the rain.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.370
And I thought I would die.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.700
And I would never
want to do it again.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.500
But unfortunately,
all of the above,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.650
which we don't have experience
with most of the time,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.420
is our truck drivers' life.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.578
My name's Lydia Yan, CEO and
co-founder of NEXT Trucking.

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.870
We call ourselves the first
trucker central marketplace

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.745
where we connect shippers
with small trucking

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:43.100
companies, owner/operator,
or small fleets.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.190
We are actually a
platform that connect

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.340
the carriers with
their preferred loads

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.500
according to their
own availabilities

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.040
so big drivers can drive
their preferred loads.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850
And we started the
company in October 2015.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.900
Three years old.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.460
Grew the revenue
100% year over year.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.220
And this year we're
looking at 3x our revenue.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.160
We are a venture-backed
company by venture firms,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.240
including Sequoia
Capital, Brookfield,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.290
and it will raise the total
of $125 million as of today.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.050
So a lot of people thought
trucking is just moving goods.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.190
But actually trucking
is a huge industry.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.500
And 70% of freight in the US is
actually moved on the trucks.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.460
And the trucking industry
has five large segments--

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.080
full truck load, less
than a truck load,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.960
drayage is moving the
container from the port

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.480
to a local warehouse,
and intermodal

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.470
is putting the container on
the rail in a small parcel.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.640
So we focus on two segments.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.700
One is pulling the
container from the port

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.920
to local warehouse,
and the second

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.290
is moving the goods
from the local warehouse

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.370
to distribution centers like
Amazon, Walmart, Target, et

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.210
cetera.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.530
The industry is huge,
but extremely fragmented.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.500
90% of the trucking
companies-- small ones--

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.050
most of them have
less than 6 trucks.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.810
Top 50 trucking
companies only accounts

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.870
for 16% of the market share.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.710
The largest trucking company
only owns 12,000 trucks

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.400
and is a $9 billion
dollar public company.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.220
We have two huge
problems in the industry.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.460
One is lack of transparency
and no technology.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.810
It's an antiquated industry.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.440
Drivers rely on brokers
to find them loads.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
We have phone calls,
text messages, emails,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.000
sometimes even fax.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.930
It's ridiculous.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.370
I know that.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.430
And a lot of back and
forth negotiations.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.340
Drivers want certain loads
because they're human beings.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.550
And shipper wants certain
lanes to be covered.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.430
And they wanted to
come to an agreement.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.190
It's a lot-- involves
a lot of phone calls.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.890
So second is our industry's
number one problem.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.560
It's trucker shortage.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.130
Our industry's lack of at
least 100,000 truck drivers.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.140
Turnover rate 97%, which means
every single trucking company

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.370
needs to change their
whole fleet once a year.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.970
Nobody wants to
be a truck driver.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.160
It's a tough lifestyle.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.959
Imagine all the bullet
points before that.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.490
You don't want that.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.850
And the turnover-- that
creates a turnover rate.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.150
And also, drivers don't
get paid that well.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.720
Average truck driver make
about $45,000 a year.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.150
Super tough lifestyle.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.777
And another thing that
really caused a turn

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.235
in the truck drivers
is really what

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:42.280
we call forced dispatching.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.720
I live in LA.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.460
I took a load to Arizona.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.360
I wanted to go home.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.710
I call all my brokers
looking for a backhaul.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.370
People give me either loads
to New York or somewhere else.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.570
Nobody can bring me home.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.640
So as a truck driver I
only have two options.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.940
One, I bobtail home.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.280
Basically I haul
an empty trailer.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.600
I'll lose money.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.190
Or I go to another state.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.640
I might need to celebrate
my daughter's birthday.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640
But too bad.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.270
I cannot find a backhaul.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.790
So that's how we
created NEXT trucking,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.610
the first trucker-centric
marketplace where

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.610
we design a solution
really for truck drivers.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.690
And we allow them to
connect with shippers.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.680
For the shipper site,
we allow shippers

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.270
to access to a large massive
database of virtual fleet

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.330
in Southern California.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.990
We're actually different
from a lot of tech startups

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.880
that are trying to
spread the word.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.260
What we're trying
to do is really

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.240
we call building the lanes.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240
It's a marketplace.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.900
You wanted to make sure
your supply meets demand.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.250
And it's a very
fragmented market.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.510
So what we did is we started
with Southern California.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.610
We viewed a lot of
local capacities.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.430
And we built lanes, which
means we bring trucks

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.920
from Southern California
to northern California

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.970
to Arizona, Texas, and Nevada.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.360
So those are the
callings we viewed.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.450
And also we allow shippers to
track and trace the drivers

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.810
real time.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.770
Google Map is so
advanced, but too bad.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.170
Shippers never know
where the driver is.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.500
Even till today,
shippers call broker.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.780
Broker call trucker and ask
for the trucker's location,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.880
then communicate
back to the shipper.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.980
Tons of back and
forth negotiations

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.930
and the communication.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.520
Sometimes drivers may lie.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.540
Brokers may lie.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.040
Right?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.450
So there's really no
transparency in it.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.080
And also we provide our shippers
real time proof of delivery.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.730
It's a little piece of paper
with driver's signature

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.040
and receiver's
signature on it proving

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.020
that the load is delivered.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.850
But in the past, or even today,
brokers need to call driver,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.040
driver bring that piece of paper
back to the broker's office,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.600
getting the payment.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.350
And the broker scan that piece
of paper and send to shipper.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.440
Then they collect the money.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.090
Shipper will collect
money from the buyers.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.790
But the whole process
takes two to four weeks,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.840
which means as a shipper, my
merchandise got delivered.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.200
I cannot even bill my
buyer after four weeks.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.260
Huge cash flow issues
for a lot of shippers.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.500
So with our solution
everything is online.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.510
Everything is digitalized.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.150
So shippers can bill
the buyers the moment

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.250
the loads get delivered.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.670
And of course, we provide
EDI and API solution.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.540
Of course, a lot--

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.760
I remember when I was
pitching Sequoia Capital.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.860
I say, we're EDI and API ready.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.960
They were like, what is EDI?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.830
I remember one of
the "senior" partners

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.440
said, oh, that was
technology from 20 years ago.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.800
We actually invested in
one of those companies.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.640
But too bad.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.110
We still use this in
trucking industry today.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.140
So from the carriers side
we provide predictive load

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.130
offering capability.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.210
So basically we study
drivers' behavior,

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.080
their own preferences,
their availabilities,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.210
so we can predict
the kind of loads

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.520
that we want to give
to the shippers.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.870
So they don't need to call.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.190
They don't need to negotiate.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.950
Whatever we give to
them, they'll accept.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.260
So actually we reduce
the time that they

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.920
spend on negotiating
with traditional brokers.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.640
On top of that, we provide
field events, QuickPay,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.270
and offer a very lightweight
web-based fleet management

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.465
software.

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:19.840
And of course, on
top of that, we

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.350
have walkie talkies on the app.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.180
They can communicate
with other drivers,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.890
really trying to
create a community

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.570
feeling for our drivers.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.520
And a difference from other
tech startups, as I mentioned,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.810
we are port-focused.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.650
We're original focus.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.650
LA is the largest part
of the whole country.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.190
40% of all merchandises in
this country are imported.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.000
And 30% of them come into
LA and Long Beach port.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.650
LA represent 15--

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.010
I'm sorry, this year 17 TEUs.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.580
So TEU is 20 equivalent unit.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.990
So it's really a measure.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.670
So we measure how many
containers are coming in.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.940
So average container
is about 40-footer.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.840
So 20 is like half a container.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.880
So we're looking at about
8.5 million containers

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.680
coming into this port.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.000
And in LA alone it's $14
billion shipping business.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.580
So we don't need to even go out
to be a multi-billion dollar

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.240
company here.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.010
We create this really
program last year.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.120
We call it a different
kind of drayage.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.520
So I'm not going to go
into the details of this.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.890
But with this
solution it's actually

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.510
a combination of our virtual
fleet, asset, and marketplace,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.090
and allow us to inject
additional capacity

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.030
to drayage and increase
the turns of trucks

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.290
in the terminals.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.980
So for our drayage relay
drivers, they on average

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.685
make 20% more money.

00:09:43.685 --> 00:09:45.493
Not necessarily
we pay them more.

00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:47.410
But they are more
efficient, because right now

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.670
40% of capacity is wasted.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.070
And our goal and
ambition is really

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.340
to go to every
single port in the US

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.340
and really give the best
solution to the port

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.680
to reduce the congestion
at the terminals,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.620
to bring in freight
a lot faster,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.200
and make sure the
merchandise moves a lot

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.280
faster, shippers will
increase the cash flow.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.970
And why we do this
And do what we do?

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.620
So a lot of people want
to start up a company

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.515
because they see the problems.

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:23.890
But a lot of them
start a company

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:29.300
because they saw the buzz
word, like blockchain, like AI.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.350
People just want to apply
technology in something.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.610
But we are doing this
is really for a cause.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.710
So this is a real story.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.370
Kevin Luke is one of
our owner-operators.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.110
I wanted to give you a little
bit of background of him.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.120
He had a little small
business a couple years ago.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.330
It's a tax business.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.970
And he failed miserably.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.460
And he actually
filed bankruptcy.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.770
He and his wife
live on the street.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.320
So he worked for a trucking
company going to the terminal

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.080
every single day.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.160
He really worked
hard to save up.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.400
So the moment he saved
up a little money

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.370
to be able to pay for the
down payment for a truck,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.380
he bought his first truck.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.850
He wanted to be an entrepreneur.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.910
So he became owner-operator.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.950
He went to the terminal
every single day.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.720
He worked so many hours a day.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.630
But still he could
barely survive.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.800
He found us last year.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.220
And the reason why we
found out about this story

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.320
is he came to our office for
the Mobile 2.0 focus group.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.570
And he shared his
personal story.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.120
And he broke down
during the focus group.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.508
I wanted to share
this video with you.

00:11:40.508 --> 00:11:41.175
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:43.330
- I got into trucking.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.370
My grandfather was
dying from cancer.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.830
And he kind of passed
the torch to me.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.388
When I was homeless it
was the toughest thing

00:11:50.388 --> 00:11:51.680
I ever could have been through.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.995
I was actually sleeping in a
guy's truck I was driving--

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:56.620
me and my wife.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.540
So she used to have
to wait till I got off

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.300
18 hours to get in bed.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.868
But you push through something
like that, what can stop you?

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.750
Working for NEXT changed
my life dramatically as far

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.940
as giving me a lot of time back
to spend time with the family,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.000
doubled my income,
allowing me to grow

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.495
my business to another level
faster than what I expected.

00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:40.384
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.100
LIDIA YAN: So I
always told my team,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.470
because of stories like
this, it's emotional.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.860
It's beautiful.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.830
And we're not just
building a mobile app.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.600
We're changing people's life.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.240
It's bigger than what
we thought it is.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.370
And also this kept us going.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.820
And it kept us moving forward
because we're literally

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.140
changing truck drivers' life.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.230
And a lot of people
asked me Lidia, why now?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.830
Why didn't you come up with
this solution 10 years ago?

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.020
Trucking never change
in past centuries.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.990
True.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.830
Trucking never changed.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.090
It was like that in
the past 24 years.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.400
But logistics was not that
important 10 years ago.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.590
I remember 10 years ago
because my husband has

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.400
been logistics for a long time.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.515
And I was actually
talking to some investors

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.610
who wanted to raise some
money for his small logistics

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.550
company.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.060
Nobody wanted to talk
to us 10 years ago,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.610
because logistics
was not sexy enough.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.990
It's not tech enough.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.360
It's not cool enough.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.580
But 10 years ago international
trading companies

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.890
had thick margins.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.810
So logistic cost is really
a fraction of their margin.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.000
But it was the
growth of e-commerce

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.680
and the transparency
of the world.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.730
Now it becomes very,
very transparent.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.780
So vendors-- the margin
actually decreased dramatically

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.110
while logistics costs
increased dramatically.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.340
Right now logistic
costs account for 10%

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.220
of an average vendor's margin.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.135
So it become very,
very important.

00:14:18.135 --> 00:14:19.510
So now all of a
sudden everyone's

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.220
looking into
logistics to see how

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.200
we can be more efficient,
how we can save money there.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.520
That's why in the past three
years, millions of dollars

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.770
got poured into logistics space.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.020
And according to some
news, it estimates

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.500
that US companies is going to
spend more than $2.5 billion

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.260
in disruptive
logistics and supply

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.250
chain technology by 2022.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.140
And overall, supply chain
logistics tech spending

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.410
will rise to $87 billion.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.590
So everyone's trying
to create a solution

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.500
to make the freight
shipping painless.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.480
And also there's a
fundamental issue

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480
with the industry is this
imbalance between supply

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.410
and demand.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.410
We have a lot of
freight to move.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:07.440
I know how many of you purchase
on Amazon every single month?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.410
Right?

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.340
But nowadays but we don't
have enough truck drivers.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.960
Our truck drivers are
not efficient enough.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.570
But they are the
foundation of our economy.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.900
So the goal is really to attract
capacity back to the industry.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.510
Our average truck
drivers age is over 50.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.510
So after 10 years,
what do we do?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.310
Do we have enough trucks?

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.000
How can we move the goods?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.030
So that's the problem
that companies

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.390
like us move freight convoy.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:42.050
Everyone's trying to resolve the
problem from different angles.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.080
So people talk about future.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.080
What are we seeing
in the future?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.060
We believe companies
like us will

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.150
replace the traditional
brokerage technology

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.390
platform to really connect
the shippers with carriers

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.160
more efficiently.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.150
And other than that, we're
looking at two players,

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.930
really, in the trucking space.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.190
One is clean trucks,
because carbon emission

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.030
is a really big problems in
the especially for the drayage

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.160
companies.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.830
And all the ports really
require clean trucks.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.480
So clean trucking companies
like Tesla, Thor, BYD in China,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.330
and also hydrogen
companies like Nikola,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.170
they will be playing major
roles in local drayage.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.510
Autonomous is
really getting big.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.854
And who have a Tesla here?

00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:33.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.560
LIDIA YAN: All right.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.290
Who knows Waymo?

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.070
Yes.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.320
So this is really the future.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.070
And startups like
TuSimple, Starsky, Embark,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.950
and Google's Waymo,
Baidu, Paccar.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.400
Everyone's really looking
to autonomous trucks,

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.030
because driving is really a
painful experience for truck

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.460
drivers, especially
for long haul drivers.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.160
Traditional truck manufacturers
like Volvo, Toyota, BMW,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.910
Volkswagen, I know Mercedes have
the most expensive autonomous

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.670
trucks.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.329
Ford, everyone is
looking into the space.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:13.579
So this is what we think that
will happen in five years.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.440
Not 10 years.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.000
Five years.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.819
So for local trucks we will see
a lot of electronic or hydrogen

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:27.369
trucks to really create
low emission transportation

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.430
methods.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.440
So it's really from the
local warehouse to a yard,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.820
then from a yard then to
out-of-state warehouse it will

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.390
go on an autonomous truck,
because it can really

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.350
eliminate the burden for the
driver's driving long hours.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.520
And it allow drivers to
really only manage exceptions.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.060
Then when the loads arrive
at the local city, which

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.120
is the destination, we will
have another local truck

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.640
that pick up the
loads from the yard,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.120
then move to local warehouse.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.600
I predict it will
happen in five years.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.110
And it might be
shorter than we expect.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.790
All right.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.230
So my name's Lidia.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.050
And I was born in
Shanghai, China.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.570
So I'm a pure immigrant.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.830
I was the only child, same
as the most people that

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.490
were born after 1978.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.715
So I do have some
single child symptoms.

00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:29.130
I'm very selfish.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.290
But the best thing
is I was really

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.180
the center of the
universe in my family

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.150
and got the best education,
because education is very

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.135
important to Chinese families.

00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:40.260
I went to a school called
Shanghai Foreign Language

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.340
School where I met my first
American teacher, who actually

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.590
inspired me to come
to this country

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.810
to pursue my master's degree.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.840
Because I love the freedom
that she brought to us,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.280
she brought the best to classes.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.150
So after graduating
from college in China

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.900
I applied for a master's
degree in the US.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.670
I applied for
several universities

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.310
and got accepted
by most of them.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.190
I chose to go to UVA
because of the ranking.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.570
I really have no idea
what the map looks like.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.710
And also, UVA actually gave me a
teaching assistant scholarship.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.020
Back then it was very
hard for a Chinese citizen

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.480
to come to this country
to study, especially

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.640
when you don't have scholarship.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.410
So I had to get scholarship.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.650
So I applied for
Italian literature.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.900
I did study Italian.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.010
And I got Italian literature
teaching assistant scholarship,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.250
which means I had to teach
80 students Italian, which

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.960
is pretty weird for a Chinese
to teaching Americans Italian.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.970
But it happened to me.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.390
But I really appreciated
my two semesters at UVA

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.952
because I actually left
after two semesters

00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:52.410
because I know that
I wouldn't want

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.870
to be a professor as a career.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:59.520
But I really got
experience as coaching.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.650
I really got my
coaching skills there.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.620
And I was not afraid of
standing on the stage

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.830
and speak to the people because
I got 80 students down there,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.020
and asked me questions
all the time.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.510
And I was less nervous,
a lot more brave,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.790
and I dared to raise my
hand and ask questions.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.200
I really appreciate that.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.560
That's what I learned from UVA.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.780
And after then I
transferred to USC,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.280
pursued my master's degree
in communications management.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.500
Because I wanted
to be a journalist.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.910
But obviously it was very hard.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.790
And my English wasn't even
good enough back then.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.660
Even nowadays it's
not the best English.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.180
Then after graduation,
obviously, I

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.320
couldn't find a job
as a journalist.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.860
So I found a job at an ad
agency as an account executive.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.850
So my job was really
talk to a lot of clients

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.400
and negotiate contract.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.920
I actually practiced
my negotiation skills

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.170
for my first job back then.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:04.980
And who's not good
at negotiations here?

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.650
All right.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.140
If you're not very good
at it, I recommend a book.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.370
It's called "Never Split the
Difference" by Chris Voss.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:20.490
He was actually a former
FBI negotiator for hostage.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.040
And this book was actually
introduced by my Sequoia

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.540
partner, Omar Hamoui.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.790
He was the founder of AdMob.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.550
He gave me the book,
then I read it.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.750
I was inspired.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.210
And he regretted it, because
I negotiated with him.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:36.948
But yeah.

00:21:36.948 --> 00:21:38.740
If you have an interest,
you can read this.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.090
It's actually a very
interesting book.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.500
And that's available at
Amazon and Audio as well.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.610
And after that, I
started-- because I always

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.080
wanted to be an entrepreneur.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.060
I started a few small companies.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.090
I failed at all of them,
and failed miserably.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.700
The one memorable
one was the one

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.740
I started in China called 9luxe.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.390
It's a flash sale website.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.520
Very similar to Gilt,
because I was really

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.910
inspired by the Gilt. Gilt
was really big back then.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:11.440
So I went there really
bravely and abroad,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.210
borrowed the money
from my family,

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.350
started this little
company with five people.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.430
And then my margin was 75%.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.200
I was selling US merchandise.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.950
I was the first one who brought
Juicy Couture back to China.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.980
And the company was
profitable after six months.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.840
I was so happy.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.220
But I forgot one thing.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.470
China is competitive.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.740
After a few months, hundreds
of flash sale websites came up.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.660
Everybody raised tons of money.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.500
Nobody wanted to make any money.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.780
I got squeezed out.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.630
Just six months later
I got flushed out.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.840
So lesson learned
there is two things--

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.720
speed is the only
competitive advantage.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.180
No matter how good
your technology is,

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.560
you need to move fast.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.830
No matter how good your team
is, you need to move fast.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.360
Second, you need to learn
if you wanted to be in tech,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.410
you need to make sure
your company has money.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.630
Fundraising is probably
a virtue for a founder.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.870
So learning how to raise
money is important.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.260
So here comes the
origin and inspirations

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.400
from NEXT Trucking.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.370
It's really from
two stories I had.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.640
Because of my background I
wanted to be a journalist,

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.140
right?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.170
I never was interested
in logistics.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.550
So unsexy.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.790
It's like old men and big
guys and like, 180 pounds

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.230
or 200 pounds.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.820
So it's very boring to me.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.150
But my husband has been
in logistics for 15 years.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.610
So the other day I
went to his office.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.003
He actually complained
every single day.

00:23:39.003 --> 00:23:40.170
He's like, I hate logistics.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.420
Like, why are you still in it?

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.460
But I hate it.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.960
So I went to his office.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.970
It was chaotic.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.220
Everyone's fighting.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.820
The drivers were fighting.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.470
The dispatchers were fighting.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.680
I remember sitting
next to a dispatcher.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.970
He spent two hours
trying to cover one load.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.590
He pick up the phone,
call five drivers trying

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.850
to find the cheapest one.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.230
He found the cheapest one.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.140
He gave the load to him.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.930
He thought, I probably can
find another cheaper one.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.190
So he called two more.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.530
Unfortunately, he couldn't
find a cheaper one.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.740
Went back to the other one, and
the driver dropped the load.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.540
So he had to do all
over again the spiel

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.210
and trying to lock
another driver.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.460
Two hours for one load.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.900
Extremely inefficient.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.300
I found it pretty amazing.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.820
And the second story
is, we were actually

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.760
driving on the freeway
the other night

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.580
after a party, me
and my husband.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.870
So that was at midnight.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:39.500
So we saw a big rig parking
in the emergency zone.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.360
So I was like, I asked my
husband, is he broken down?

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.500
Why is he parking there?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.580
He's going to get a ticket.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.340
So my husband was
like, he probably

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.020
doesn't want to pay $25
truck stop parking fee.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.850
I was shocked.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.140
Those guys work day and night.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.900
They make so little.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.020
And they have to risk their
life by parking in an emergency

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.500
zone trying to save 25 bucks.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.100
So that really inspired me.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.100
I wanted to do
something for them,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.440
because I see those guys
almost every single day.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.600
They work hard.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.070
They are humble people.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.660
They're probably not the
most sophisticated people,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.320
but they deserve more.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.470
So that's where we come up with
inspirations just to help them.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.290
Then we started to
understand market

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.700
and trying to identify
where the root causes.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.140
So here come the ideation.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.860
That's how my process was,
just for you in reference.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.290
I interviewed 100 truck
drivers before I came up

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.180
with this idea.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.660
And I understood
their pain point.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.790
They shared their ideas with me.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.810
I built my first
MVP in three months.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.740
And it didn't work.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.100
When we launched the
app in October 2015,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.860
I remember we had 30 users.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.480
And our idea was
like, OK why don't we

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.170
ask drivers to
dictate what they want

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.390
so they can post their truck.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.600
So we actually create this post
a truck function on the app.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.830
But too bad.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.120
Nobody posted the truck.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.940
Everyone download the
app asking for loads,

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.610
because their behavior
is, what do you have?

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.450
Let me choose.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.960
So we immediately
changed the idea.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.580
We switched the
gear and say, OK.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.990
Why don't we do this?

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.750
Let's post the loads
and let them pick.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.570
And also we need to be
really original focus.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.070
Why?

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.060
Because it's such a huge market.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.220
If I onboard
drivers in New York,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.020
I don't have any loads for
them, they're going to churn.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.740
And if I onboard
shippers, to on to ship

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.190
on the lanes I don't have
drivers, my shipper will churn.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:49.300
So then we actually scale
down to really building lanes.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.100
Southern California only.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.290
Let's onboard Southern
California home-based drivers.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.540
Their behavior is very simple.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.850
Either I'm local, I
go out, I come back.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.730
So when we pitch shippers
we do the exact same thing.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.270
We're very good
with those lanes.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.100
We have a lot of drivers.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.450
Give those to us.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.180
That's how we really
create the matching

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.970
and really kept the
marketplace going.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.560
So that's how we evolved--

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.590
tested idea, learn
from our customers.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.220
So a lot of people ask me, it's
like, Lidia, your background

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.370
is pretty weak.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.380
Of course, look at this.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.830
It's the worst the package
for a startup founder, right?

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.670
I'm an immigrant.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.180
I'm a woman in trucking.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.220
And I didn't
graduate from Google.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.980
I didn't go to Stanford.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.740
So pretty-- it's like
I call this beautifully

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.550
irrelevant to Silicon Valley.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.160
So it actually took me four
months to raise my serious egg,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.520
because nobody believed in me.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.950
Like a lot of VCs asked me,
Lidia, do you drive a truck?

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.110
I was like, too bad.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.510
I'm too short for that.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.890
But that's how I started.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.840
And I think there's something
in me that kept me going.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.030
And I wanted to share
it with you if you

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.010
decide to be a founder one day.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.780
It's some strengths I have.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.420
If you're an average
founder like me-- of course,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.000
you're all graduate--
you are all from Google.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.370
So you do have the one
element that Silicon Valley

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:10.970
is looking for.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.385
So one trait I think
I'm really good at

00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:16.850
is I do have self-awareness.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.370
I know my weaknesses.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.740
I know what I'm not good at.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.320
So that's why I wanted
to surround myself

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.260
with the people who have
the qualities I don't have.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.570
So I know I'm not a coder.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.690
And I'm not a good
people manager.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.770
And I'm probably not good
at communicating ideas.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.560
So I actually really
surrounded myself

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.830
and brought in the team who
were good in those areas, who

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.410
can deliver the message
better for me, who can really

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.940
build an awesome product.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.970
And of course, I
sell all the time.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.780
Not only to my customers, I
sell to the employees as well.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.940
And I'm very scrappy.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.640
At the very beginning we
worked on folding tables.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.660
I don't know.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.045
People always talk of a garage.

00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:03.963
We're even worse.

00:29:03.963 --> 00:29:05.130
We don't even have a garage.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.390
We have folding tables.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.010
I remember one
employee, actually,

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.810
one of my early
employee come in.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.600
He actually worked on the
folding table the first day.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.550
And the second we
actually took it away

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.290
because we have one more person.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.470
So he actually, he
worked on his lap.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.600
So we were very scrappy.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.210
But we shared one vision.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.500
And we really wanted to
change the truck drivers'

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.980
life fundamentally.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.090
So it's important to bring
the people that share

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.360
the vision, who share
the mentality, who

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.410
are equally scrappy as
you at the very beginning.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.340
And be patient.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.200
I was very patient.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.930
We made a lot of mistakes,
but I never gave up.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.750
Even when at the very
difficult time in I

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:49.060
think it's the end of 2016
when I was raising series A.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.330
We did $11 million first year.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.500
For tech startup
it's huge already.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.090
I think we did a great job.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.520
I was very confident
when I walked out

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.310
and I went to Silicon
Valley investors.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.130
I got turned down
by over 50 investors

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.260
in literally a few weeks.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.020
It was very disappointing to me.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.090
And I think after 50
pitches you actually polish

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.670
the pitch a little bit better.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.490
And your skin grew a
little bit thicker.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.820
So I didn't give up,
because at the end of day

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.100
you probably only need one yes.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.520
So at the end of 2016
we closed our series A

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.035
with a Chinese investor
called China Equity Group.

00:30:27.035 --> 00:30:27.910
We raised $5 million.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.130
Very small money.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.080
And then we kept growing.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.880
Everybody wore multiple hats.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:39.260
We worked tirelessly,
extremely hard.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.440
I remember during the peak
seasons everyone works

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.570
over 12 hours a day.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.310
And then we got really a lot of
tractions from Silicon Valley.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.660
We picked Sequoia as
our series B investor.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.480
Of course, the best
investor we can ask for.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.630
And for series C
it took us 30 days

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.480
to close at almost
$100 million round.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.460
We only wanted to
raise $50 million.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.850
But we ended up actually
raising $97 million.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.830
And we got Brookfield
on our book.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.890
And they're a fantastic
strategic investor.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.160
So I think another trait
that I have is hustling

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.900
and ask for help.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.230
When I just started the
company I didn't know any VCs.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.150
I literally added
every single person

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.360
that I can possibly
find on LinkedIn.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.280
And I asked for
introductions from the people

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.510
that I don't even know.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.970
That's how I got
my first investor.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.680
And then I also got all
the LA founders' contacts.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.910
I basically messaged
them and say, hey,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.910
I wanted to get a
coffee with you.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.880
And I wanted to know how you
really bring up your company.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.180
What challenges you have?

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.070
Can you share some
experience with me?

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.530
So I made a very-- a
group of good friends,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.960
and who can share
experiences with you.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.990
And of course, sell, sell, sell.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.550
Sell to the investors.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.660
Sell to the market.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.300
And sell to your employees.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.220
And one last thing
I wanted to mention

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.450
is company culture
is very important.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.570
I know Google has
fantastic company cultures.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.350
But for first-time founders
it's hard to define your company

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.370
cultures.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.470
I didn't even know what it is.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.470
I remember I went to
a Sequoia base camp.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.780
And I was on a car
with Scott Cook,

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.307
who is the founder of Intuit.

00:32:19.307 --> 00:32:20.640
So I asked him, I was like, hey.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.290
What is your company culture?

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.120
How did you define it?

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.080
He gave me one word.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.140
He said, you are
your company culture.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.330
I was like, what does that mean?

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.780
He's like, you know, you and
your leadership team really

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.360
define what a company is.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.170
So after that we actually spend
a lot of time internally trying

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.980
to form a culture committee,
try to really come up

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.710
with our mission,
vision, and value.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.200
And this is our first draft.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.090
And we know it's
going to evolve.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.040
So our mission is
empower drivers

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.950
to work the way they
want when they want.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.440
And our vision is
painless freight.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.930
We wanted to acknowledge
that freight shipping is

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:02.070
really painful.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.230
And we're really not resolving
a rocket science issues.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.100
We're really trying to make
their life a little bit

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.720
better one step at a time.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.260
So five values we have
is put the drivers first.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.800
It's very simple to a
lot of tech companies

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.770
basically put your users first.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.660
And demonstrate
hustle, passion to win.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.370
I think I'm a very
aggressive person,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.050
even though I'm pretty small.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.460
But I think it carries
towards the whole company.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.490
Everyone's very aggressive.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.370
And we wanted to solve
a problem, not symptoms.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.440
This is actually
something that most of you

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.190
will see if you have a company,
because at the very beginning

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.440
everybody was trying
to put out fires.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.930
And we actually last
year spent a ton of time

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.720
trying to putting out fires.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.030
And we didn't really
look into root cause.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.710
So this is something that
we know we made a mistake,

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.340
and we wanted to change that.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.140
Set and follow true north,
because especially when

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.720
you have a business, there
are a lot of distractions

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.040
just for us.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.600
We wanted to do drayage.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.660
But we got business for
logistics other segments--

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.679
warehousing, transloading.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.989
Those are true revenues.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.610
This is a real dollars.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.320
Do we want to do this business?

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.330
Do we want to sacrifice it?

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.550
If you set a true
north, you know

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.139
this is direction
you wanted to go,

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.370
and you do not want
to be distracted.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.600
So it's important
you follow that.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.000
And trust that
it's in good hands.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.980
We default to trust that we
bring the best to people,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.690
and the people will
take the ownership.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.409
So my final words.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.370
Recommendations for
first-time founder,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.400
if you ever plan to be one.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.920
Just to really summarize
what I just said myself.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.340
First is understand market,
and the size, the dynamic.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.989
Identify the problems.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.749
Don't start a company
because you think it's fancy

00:34:56.749 --> 00:34:59.510
or it's sexy and there's
a buzzword out there

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.070
and blockchain.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.180
It probably doesn't work
right now for trucking.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.510
And test the ideas.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.260
Be brave.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.210
To share the idea it's OK.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.740
Nobody can steal it if
you can execute very well.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.880
Learn from your customers.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.530
We put ourselves in Lynwood.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.000
It's not like the
beautiful Venice Beach.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.180
It's Santa Monica.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.730
We're in the ghetto.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.390
And I remember some
investor talk to me.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.130
And they said, oh,
where's your office?

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.390
Because they are
coming to visit us.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.500
I would say, oh,
we're in the ghetto.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.320
Just be aware.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.980
OK?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.010
And they [INAUDIBLE]
say, Lidia, no joke.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.600
You're straight out of Compton.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.570
So we're literally
like north of Compton.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.340
But we're close to our users.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.270
We're literally next
to our truck drivers.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.930
So we can talk to
them on a daily basis.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.660
And be scrappy.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.080
At the very beginning, unless
you're multimillionaires,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.990
you cannot afford to build
a large team, the best team.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.710
You probably need to be scrappy.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.920
You probably wanted to
do everything yourself.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.190
And be patient
and never give up.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.690
And it's easy to give up.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.830
But you know you will have the
light at the end of the tunnel.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.800
It will keep you moving.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.660
And work extremely hard.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.020
This is no-brainer.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.930
You just have to when
you're a founder.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.320
Hustle and ask for help.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.480
Don't be shy.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.810
It's OK to ask for help.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.870
There are a lot of
founders like us.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.030
And when we started, we
didn't know what to do.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:23.570
And we always were willing
to share experience,

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.980
because we walked the road.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.320
We know how difficult it is.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.300
And define company
culture early.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.000
That's the mistake that
most companies make.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.020
I did too.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.740
I didn't really know
my company cultures.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.670
We just pushed forward,
drive the revenues,

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:41.600
make the app work, and view
the internal efficiencies.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.070
But we didn't know
what our company

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.020
culture was til this year.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.880
Last, as a founder, always
be your best salesman.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.190
Salesman for your team, salesman
for your culture, and salesman

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.890
for your company vision.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.820
Well, thank you so
much for your time.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.370
Any questions?
