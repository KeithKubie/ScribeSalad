00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.070
In the video on solubility, I
draw little pictures of sodium

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.910
and chloride ions when sodium
chloride dissolves or

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.500
disassociates into water.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.860
This is sodium and
this is chloride.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.950
And my simple brain, when I
looked at it, I said, OK, how

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.110
should I draw these things?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.270
I said, well, they're in the
same period, and sodium is a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.190
Group 1 element.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.890
It's an alkali metal, while
chlorine is a halogen, so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.690
chlorine's going to have a
smaller atomic radius.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.220
And the logic there, just to
review from the atomic table

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.070
trends, is that both of their
valence electrons are in the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.050
third shell.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.140
Sodium only has 11 protons
pulling in the center.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280
It has 11 in the center, and it
has only one electron out

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.955
there in its valence shell.

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:47.590
So the attraction isn't as
strong as the case of

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.060
chlorine, which has 17 protons
in the center.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.090
Although it has more valence
electrons-- it has 7 of them--

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.660
these protons are going
to have a stronger

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.640
attraction on them.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700
So if you just look at the trend
in the periodic table,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.920
you'd expect the sodium neutral
atom to be bigger than

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.240
the chlorine neutral atom.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.010
Because this guy has more
protons pulling everything in.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.490
And that's how I drew the
ions in that video.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.420
I said, oh, when I disassociate
in water, I'll

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.770
have a big sodium ion and
a smaller chlorine

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.080
ion, which is incorrect.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.460
Because think about-- and this
was pointed out to me by one

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.660
of the viewers, and they're
correct, and I should have

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.630
realized it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.450
What happens when you
ionize these things?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.800
This guy will lose an
electron, right?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.620
He gives the electron
to this guy.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.530
So his electron configuration
is actually going to look a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.400
lot more like neon.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600
He now will have no electrons
in that third shell, in the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.160
third energy state.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.810
So now he's going to have an
atomic radius that's actually

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.990
much more similar to
neon here, right?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560
Because he's going to have
filled up the second shelf.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.200
So actually, the sodium ion,
this is completely incorrect.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.330
The sodium ion is going to have
an atomic radius not that

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.440
different than neon.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.080
Actually, it will be even a
little smaller than neon

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.789
because it has the same electron
configuration, but it

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.360
has one more proton.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740
So the sodium ion is actually
going to be smaller.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.930
Because it gets rid of the
electron in that third shell,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.600
and the chlorine cation, gained
an electron, so it has

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.490
completely completed
its third shell.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.010
So here you have where
the chlorine ion

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.710
is going to be bigger.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.220
So in that solubility video, I
should've actually switched

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.830
the places between the
sodium and the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.600
chlorine, at least in size-wise.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.880
And, of course, I showed how
they disassociate in water,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.340
and this would be attracted to
the oxygen end of the water,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.580
and you have the hydrogen
end and all that.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.970
But you can watch the solubility
video for that.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.260
It doesn't change the real
takeaway from the video.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.970
But I think this is a really
interesting point that it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.380
brings up, that when you ionize
these neutral atoms, it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.340
can significantly change,
especially significantly

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.440
change their relative
atomic sizes.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.930
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that interesting.
