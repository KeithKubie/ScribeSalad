00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.290
So we have this line
segment JL here,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.150
and we have point K that
also sits on that segment.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.790
And they tell us that JK
is equal to 7x plus 9.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.900
So this distance right over
here is equal to 7x plus 9.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.750
Then they tell us that
JL is equal to 114.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.090
So JL is the entire
length of the segment.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.750
So this entire thing
is equal to 114.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.770
Then they tells us that
KL is equal to 9x plus 9.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.090
So this right over here
is equal to 9x plus 9.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.030
And they say find KL.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.220
So they essentially want us to
figure out what does 9x plus 9

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.060
equal?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.080
And to figure that out, we have
to figure out what x equals.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.490
And lucky for us, they've given
us all the information we need.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.825
They tell us that the
entire segment is 114 long.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:54.200
And they don't
give us any units.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.190
It's just 114.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.600
It has a length of 114.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.079
And we know that this segment,
JK plus KL, added together,

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.370
is going to be equal to the
length of the entire thing.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.999
So we could say that
7x plus 9-- actually

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.040
let me write it this way.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.410
We could write that JK, so
the length of segment JK

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:28.870
plus the length of segment KL
is going to be equal to 114.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.500
And we know that the length
of segment JFK is 7x plus 9.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.075
We know that the length of
segment KL is 9x plus 9.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.056
And this is going
to be equal to 114.

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:46.430
And now we just
have to break out

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.527
a little bit of our
algebraic skills.

00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:50.110
So the first thing
we might want to do

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.530
is, let's see, we have two
terms that have x's in them.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.260
If I have 7 x's, and I were to
add that to another 9 x's, that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.190
means I'm going to have 16 x's.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.169
And then if I have-- so
this is just plain old 9,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.970
and I add it to another 9.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.030
That's going to give me 18.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.480
And that's going
to be equal to 114.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.660
Now I just subtract
18 from both sides.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.580
Let me do that explicitly.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.420
So I subtract 18
from both sides.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.260
On the left-hand side I have 16
x, and on the right-hand side,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.481
I'm going to have 114 minus 18.

00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.855
Well, if I were to subtract
14, that would get me to 100.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.700
And I'm going to subtract
4 more than that,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.630
so that's going to get me to 96.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.890
And now we just divide
both sides by 16.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.396
And let's see, this looks
like 96 divided by 16--

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:52.770
we could do it
explicitly, but it

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.530
looks like it's going to be 6.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.022
6 times 10 is 60.

00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:57.970
6 times 6 is 36.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.620
60 plus 36 is 96.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.340
So we get x is equal to 6.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.900
Now we're not done yet.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.260
We're not looking just for x.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.140
We're looking for
the length of KL.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.230
KL is 9x plus 9.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.980
Let me write that down.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.500
So KL is equal to 9x plus 9.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.920
They told us that right over
there, is equal to 9x plus 9.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.930
We just figured out
that x is equal to 6.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.200
So this is equal to
9 times 6 plus 9.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.180
And this is equal to-- 9 times
6 is 54, plus 9, is equal to 63.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.330
So KL is equal to 63.
