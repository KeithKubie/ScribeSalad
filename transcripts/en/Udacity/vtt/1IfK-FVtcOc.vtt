00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.710
The change in amino acid seven from a

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.510
glutamate to a valine has the effect of altering

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.430
the way hemoglobin proteins interact with other hemoglobin

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.740
proteins. And as a result, the hemoglobin molecules begin

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.550
to stack together in a really long and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.620
abnormal fashion. And this elongated stacking causes the red

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.710
blood cell to sort of stretch out into

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.050
this sickle-like shape. These abnormally shaped red blood cells,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.870
can't fit in the smallest vessels of your body so they get stuck, and they

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.180
block blood flow, limiting oxygen exchange, and causing

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.460
the event that's referred to as a crisis.
