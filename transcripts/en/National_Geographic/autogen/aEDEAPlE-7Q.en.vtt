fish called menhaden and these fish are
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.150
fish called menhaden and these fish are
really important food for a lot of other

our protection we need to keep these

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790
our protection we need to keep these
 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.729
our protection we need to keep these
guys around yeah I think everything

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
guys around yeah I think everything
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.060
guys around yeah I think everything
needs our protection and we do have to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
needs our protection and we do have to
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500
needs our protection and we do have to
keep these guys around because if you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
keep these guys around because if you
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090
keep these guys around because if you
pull these out a lot of other things

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
pull these out a lot of other things
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340
pull these out a lot of other things
would collapse let's go see some of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
would collapse let's go see some of
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:07.680

these fish in action

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690
 
 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.960
 
by number a lot of efficient than that

fish what about the industrial methods

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910
fish what about the industrial methods
 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.300
fish what about the industrial methods
the commercial methods that target men

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310
the commercial methods that target men
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.610
the commercial methods that target men
haters are much much larger scale they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620
haters are much much larger scale they
 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.860
haters are much much larger scale they
use they use airplanes to spot the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870
use they use airplanes to spot the
 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.140

schools which frequently travel near the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150
schools which frequently travel near the
 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.180
schools which frequently travel near the
surface often in very big schools and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190
surface often in very big schools and
 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.650
surface often in very big schools and
then they circle them with a big net

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660
then they circle them with a big net
 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.390
then they circle them with a big net
called a person and they can catch

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400
called a person and they can catch
 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.830
called a person and they can catch
entire schools I mean they catch many

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840
entire schools I mean they catch many
 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.050
entire schools I mean they catch many
many tons and then to get them out of

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060
many tons and then to get them out of
 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.790
many tons and then to get them out of
the net they have these gigantic suction

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800
the net they have these gigantic suction
 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.350
the net they have these gigantic suction
hoses that actually suck them right onto

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360
hoses that actually suck them right onto
 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240

the boat so the whole the whole scale is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250
the boat so the whole the whole scale is
 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.220
the boat so the whole the whole scale is
very very different I mean if this is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230
very very different I mean if this is
 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.100
very very different I mean if this is
like working in a shop that's like

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429
 
so how can we keep the menhaden

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
so how can we keep the menhaden
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929
so how can we keep the menhaden
protective how can we keep this whole

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
protective how can we keep this whole
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.420

limits and you know you don't take them

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
limits and you know you don't take them
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.580
limits and you know you don't take them
out faster than they can reproduce and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
out faster than they can reproduce and
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680
out faster than they can reproduce and
try to find out how many the bay could

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
try to find out how many the bay could
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.500
try to find out how many the bay could
hold ideally you'd want to keep the

interest and a lot of fisheries are
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.729
interest and a lot of fisheries are
depleted because people just continue to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
depleted because people just continue to
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.650

catch them even as they were declining

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
catch them even as they were declining
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.289
catch them even as they were declining
until there are very few left so when we

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
until there are very few left so when we
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.180
until there are very few left so when we
decide how many fish to take from the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
decide how many fish to take from the
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.670
decide how many fish to take from the
oceans we also need to decide not only

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
oceans we also need to decide not only
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500
oceans we also need to decide not only
just what humans need but really what

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
just what humans need but really what
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.539
just what humans need but really what
the ecosystem needs as well well fishery

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549

of figuring out how many you can take

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269
of figuring out how many you can take
 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.910
of figuring out how many you can take
out and really what you need to figure

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
out and really what you need to figure
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.229
out and really what you need to figure
out is how many you have to leave in

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
out is how many you have to leave in
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:53.890
out is how many you have to leave in
that's the next generation Wow
