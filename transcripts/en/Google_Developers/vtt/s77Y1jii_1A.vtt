&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Good morning everybody. Thank
you for attending this session. I know you

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.760
guys have a lot of choices and sessions and
we really appreciate you coming by to hear

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.530
our session this morning. So my name is Scott
McMullan. I'm the Google Apps partner lead

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.810
with the Google Enterprise Group, work with
the Marketplace team as well. And today, we're

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.890
going to be talking about the Google Apps
Marketplace. And this is going to be a fairly

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.140
high level session. We're not going to go
into a lot of technical depth. This is designed

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.870
to give you an overview of how the Marketplace
works, some of the motivations of how we built

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.030
it, and most importantly, hear from a few
folks on the Marketplace who are launch partners,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.270
who--and hear how they're doing. Get some
tips from them and really get the kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.440
the word in the street. So I've got Amit Kulkarni,
CEO of ManyMoon with me, Chuck Dietrich, CEO

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.030
of SlideRocket, and Jay Simons, VP of Marketing
at Atlassian. So now we've got our WiFi setup

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.130
and we can actually run all the steps from
the Cloud. Quick housekeeping bit.ly/SellWithMarketplace,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.270
this is our Google Wave for this session.
This is where we ask you to ask questions

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.350
and we'll take these at the very end. Okay.
So, the Google Apps Marketplace--before we

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.530
get into that, let's do a quick level set
on Google Apps. This is definitely a source

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.820
of confusion for a lot of folks. Google Apps
is our hosted messaging and collaborations

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.770
suite designed for businesses and organizations
of all sizes. So it includes a suite of applications,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.200
most of which, hopefully, you’ve heard of,
so Gmail, Calendar, Talk, Google Sites, Google

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.499
Groups, Google Docs which includes spreadsheets
and documents, all these things in a suite

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.509
designed for organizations of all sizes. We
work with small, medium, and large businesses

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.880
as well as non-profits and EDUs. So the two
ways to get this if you are an EDU, or if

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.000
you're a smaller company under 50 users, you
can use our free edition, our [INDISTINCT]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.770
edition. Or if you're a business or fall outside
of that organization class, you can use our

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.819
premier edition. It's $50 a user a year product.
And we're super gratified to see in the last

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.780
three years what customers and what the, you
know, users out there have done with this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.511
product. We've got over 25 million active
users to date. That’s across 2 million businesses.

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:31.880
And we got more than 3,000 businesses signing
up each day for these products. So we're very

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.680
gratified. We think this is just the beginning
of what we can do here. Quick note, the logos

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.870
on the slide are bare companies, Motorola,
Voleo, Konica Minolta. But for the purposes

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.530
of today and the discussion about the Marketplace,
you should be thinking more in terms of the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.210
SMBs, the SMB segment of our customer base.
So, why did we build the Marketplace? It's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.930
pretty simple. Customers want more apps. We've
got our seven or eight. They want to run more

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.909
of their business in the Cloud and there's
tons of great stuff out there. We want to

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.590
make it really easy to work with the best
Web apps out in the ecosystem and make it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.380
very simple to bring those Web applications
into our customer base and give those easy

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.400
access to our users. So simply put, the goal
in Marketplace is to make it easy for customers

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.090
to add more great apps to their Google Apps
suite. This is across all kind of segments,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.079
all kinds of verticals, all kinds of used
cases. It can be accounting, sales and marketing

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.640
productivity, workflow. It can be big suites,
it can be small applications to do a very

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.360
specific purpose. The goal here is to make
it easy for you all to get access and to serve

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.810
these customers as they grow. And we are really
lucky that Marketplace launched about months

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.310
ago at the Campfire One in Mountain View.
We're really lucky to work with 50 great launch

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.489
partners. You'd probably recognized some of
the logos and the people that we launched

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.710
with. The key point here and I think I want
you take away is that we've got everything

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.090
from start ups to public companies. Everything
from, you know, again, full suites whether

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.370
you're a developer suite or a suite for a
business or an ERP or CRM, all the way down

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.950
to smaller point products that accomplish
a very specific task. So this is the type

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.590
of opportunity, the type of company we're
attracting to work with to bring--to serve

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.710
the Google Apps customer base. Okay. So, that’s
very high level of a little bit of why we

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.570
built it and some of the people who we launched
with. Let me switch to a quick demo to show

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.531
you the user experience what it's like when
we say and make it easy for users and for

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:49.910
customers to get more apps for Google Apps.
So here's the Marketplace, we've got categories

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.290
in the left including product and professional
services in the Marketplace can be found.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.810
We've got featured Apps that rotate through
in the center. A set of top apps of the right

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.970
based on usage and ratings. And let's say
today that I'm looking for a project management

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.060
app for my organization. So we search on project
management, get a list of users--Amit, congratulations.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.910
You're the top search result here. Let's take
a look at ManyMoon. Let's just dive into the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.040
listing. I can look at all the listings here.
Let's pick ManyMoon to get quick look. Again,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.600
I can read about the application. I can get
links to videos. I can read about ratings

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.520
or reviews about what the community thinks.
And let's say, based on this, I'm interested

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.870
in acquiring this application and trying it
up for my business. So here's where it all

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.770
starts. It's basically the Add It Now button.
To click Add It Now and I'm entering my Google

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.560
Apps domain. In this case, it’s my kind
of friends and family ehic.com domain. Now

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.630
this is a standard edition domain of, again,
the Marketplace is for all of our users, not

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.590
just to our premier edition users. So the
first thing it's going to ask me to do is

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.820
to sign in. Only admins can install applications
to the Marketplace today. So I'm going to

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:12.560
login it as an admin. Okay, I'm now in the
control panel of my Google Apps for ehic.com.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.970
The first thing I get is the terms of service.
These are ManyMoon's terms of service. So

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.820
review these. Send this off to all my lawyers.
Everything is cool. I'm going to hit agree.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.071
I agree and continue. Step two, grant access.
So I'm installing this application and ManyMoon

00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:37.880
is a web application who wants to integrate
in with Google Apps. They want to do a lot

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.250
of--provide a lot of valuable features to
let me use my Calendars, my Document, et cetera

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.680
in the context of project management. So they
are requesting here different APIs that they

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:56.070
want to have access to. I can review them.
And you can see that they’ve got quite a

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.464
few there. They're a pretty deeply integrated
product. Once I agree and think I trust these

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:03.090
guys which I do, I'm going to grant my data
access and then, enable the application. So

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.680
I'm now just taking ManyMoon product and add
it to the Google App suite. I click over here

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.250
on the dashboard, you see that in addition
to the setting, the applications from Google,

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.850
I now have ManyMoon--the ManyMoon icon here
and I can do some basic administration here,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:26.920
as well as a link off to their site. So that’s
the admin experience. That’s browsing--essentially

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.300
buying. In this case, it's a premium product
s o they'll charge me later in installing

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:37.640
the application. Let's take a look at what
the user would see. So--Amit will go into

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.610
more detail here, but this is the canonical
use of integration that all Marketplace Apps

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.450
have which is the single sign on from our
universal navigation. So up here in the very

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:55.840
left, I'm in my Gmail account for my ehic.com
domain and I can easily go to my Google Calendar

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.680
and it will open up a new tab. In this case,
I want to go to ManyMoon. So I go to the More

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:06.660
Menu. I see that ManyMoon is now available
to my end-users. I click on that and I'm in.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.600
No passwords, nothing to set up, no account--essentially,
the suite hasn’t been expanded to include

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:18.610
ManyMoon and now I can just start using this
application as an end-user. So that is the

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.860
quick high level tool. How does this work?
As a developer, how do you go about getting

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.990
your application to Marketplace? How much
effort is required, et cetera? So, the first

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.860
thing is you got to build your application.
You'll notice that 50 launch partners; I think

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.690
the majority of those were existing applications.
So you can take an existing App. You can build

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.219
a new App. There are no platform requirements
or hosting requirements. This is not about

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:43.829
AppEngine or anything else. Even though we
love AppEngine, this is about Web applications.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:50.829
So you take your Web application. You bring
it to us and you start to integrate it. Very

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:54.949
quickly, there are a number of talks later
on today and tomorrow about deep integration

00:08:54.949 --> 00:09:02.379
that go into the mechanics of how this works.
But at a high level, the first thing to do,

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:05.779
again, is use OpenID to enable a single sign-in
experience. That’s where all applications

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:10.180
must do to get the Marketplace, beyond that,
we have over a dozen integration points and

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:16.160
APIs, again, things like Calendar and Contacts
and Docs. Just yesterday, we released Gmail

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.209
contextual gadgets which allow you to bring
your application right into the viewing--the

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:27.040
viewer of Gmail. So a bunch of ways you can
integrate, that’s all optional. And then

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.220
the last thing and the most important part--this
is a Marketplace, so selling. Again, over

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.829
2 million businesses, over 25 million users
and the growing group of resellers with over

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:41.740
1,000 resellers worldwide and growing and
they're increasingly interested in working

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.790
with Marketplace Apps and ISVs to build and
pull together brighter solutions for customers.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:52.380
So that’s a second part of the opportunity
here. And for this, what do we ask? We ask

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:59.089
for two things, a one-time fee of $100 that
allows you to list one or more applications

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:02.959
to Marketplace; and then if you sell your
App--it's not a free app, if you sell your

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.970
app, we ask for a 20% share of revenue on
new customers that you acquire through Marketplace.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.939
So you can bring your old customers and they
can all get these integrations but for new

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:18.060
customers who come in and discover and purchase
through the Marketplace, we ask for 20% reg

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.620
share recurring. Quick note, that’s not--we're
not doing reg share right now. We'll be rolling

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:30.180
this out later on the second half of this
year when we introduce our Google check out

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:37.199
Marketplace billing APIs which will be required
to continue in the Marketplace. Okay. So,

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:42.060
moving quickly here. How does this work? Build,
integrate, list and sell--these are the three

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:49.839
steps. So we know the build step. You guys
do integrate. Two applications in the Web,

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:55.930
they want to work together, they want to form
a virtual suite. You know that that Google

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.440
certainly launched these applications one
by one. You know, Gmail was the first, Docs

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.740
came later. These are Web applications that
are working together as one. So the integration

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.850
step is very important. And what we do here
is have a simple XML file that you use to

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.139
describe all the different integration points
that your application have, both at the business

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:19.779
level like what your terms of service, what
are your policies, what are your privacy policies,

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:24.930
those links in here; as well as the APIs you
need access to. So if you need to have access

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:31.290
to a user's Calendar, you can request that
in these manifest file. You package all this

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.040
stuff up and just describe the entire integration.
So how do you actually get in the Marketplace

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.970
to start working? Two forms to fill out essentially--the
first is to become a vendor. I think it's

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.870
eight fields, you know, what logo, cost of
company name, address, your vendor account.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.821
That’s obviously free and then you click
a button to create a listing. This listing

00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.930
is--the majority of listing is the marketing,
right? We're basically merchandising your

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:04.050
applications, so benefits and name and category
and things like that. But in order to get

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.180
the magic to work around adding it now and
the provisioning of this so you can facilitate

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.100
buying, in the lower left here is this manifest
field. This is where you'd paste this XML

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.800
file that describes the integration. And what
that allows us to do is then render your page,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:27.611
not only about your marketing copy but the
Add It Now flow. It will all just kind of

00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:30.329
work as I show with installing ManyMoon. Okay,
so you’ve got your listing. You're in. You've

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:34.839
tested it and now, of course, let's launch.
Let's get out there in front of customers.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:39.811
This is where the real fun begins. One thing
I just wanted to highlight here is to not

00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:45.620
skip your launch marketing. If you do choose
to work with us, it really get out there two

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.490
months. We don’t have a lot of history here
but we definitely have noticed some folks

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.129
have skipped this step and I think it's a
missed opportunity. So, you know, high quality

00:12:55.129 --> 00:13:00.800
listing pages; high quality landing pages
on your site, again, what you're essentially

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.360
selling into an audience that is a Google
Apps user base with 25 million users. They

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.920
have a certain mental model about what to
expect and so you're communicating to them

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.639
in that language is important to getting their
attention. And certainly, blogging and tweeting

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:20.319
and doing PR in press.reach are all things
that you should be considering on the launch.

00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:24.259
So post-launch, you know, you're out there
and you start to see some its interest and

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:31.779
pageviews, some orders come in, what does
that customer acquisition lifecycle look like?

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:36.240
So it's a funnel, just like what you're doing
today, and no surprise, you know, we're driving

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.379
traffic to the Marketplace. If you’ve got
listing pageviews, you're hopefully driving

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:46.259
traffic there as well. We have an "Add it
now" call to action to get people to adopt.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:50.290
Now they may be in trial mode, they maybe
in buy mode, you know, it depends on what

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.399
your application is, but the goal here, of
course, is to drive App usage within the domain

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:57.290
because, again, you're not just selling to
the administrator, you're selling to, potentially,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.740
10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, however big the company
is, you have a bunch of users potentially

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.410
have your product. So there are a bunch of
tricks and--not tricks, but there are a bunch

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.009
of basic techniques for making sure that the
admin can communicate out the message. That’s

00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:18.050
important things to think about as you drive
users to use your product and try to convert

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:24.740
them to paid usage. And so, along that line,
we really--we get a lot of--the point of first

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.550
question now is get after I'd described how
this all works is--hey that’s great, Google.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.870
You can put us up there, but how do you drive
awareness just on the Marketplace? How are

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.249
your customers going to know about what you're
doing and what we're doing and they end up

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:40.040
with you. So I'm going to give you a very
quick tour, the last couple of minutes of

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.369
my talk here about some of the tactics that
we used to drive users in awareness of the

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:52.069
Marketplace and the vendors in the Marketplace.
So, first, inside our products--so, for example,

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:58.350
in the upper left in that universal navigation,
you'll see "find more services" if you're

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.110
an admin. That will take you to Marketplace.
If you go in as an admin and you look in your

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.380
control panel and see add more services, you'll
see a link to the Marketplace there. So we're

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.529
trying to drive awareness on the admin. Of
course, admins aren’t always the people

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:15.450
who are shopping for applications but it’s
important to get on their radar. On our product

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:22.470
site, so this is our google.com/app site and
this where we drive--we sign up the majority

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.749
of those 3,000 businesses of the day--are
actually coming through this site, learning

00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:30.709
about the products, and making a decision
to work with us. So we're going to talk about

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:35.209
our application clearly, and then, we're now
going to be able to talk about your applications

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:40.970
in the Marketplace because we've got this
larger suite we can offer our customers. A

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:46.579
customer emails and webinars--clearly, we
do these things. You know, these are humans.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:52.760
They have to man--you know, man sessions and
man conference calls. We focus these especially

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.160
the webinars around customer success stories.
So telling the story of what you’ve done

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.589
with the customer with us is really the key
for us to be able to get out there and tell

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:08.149
specific stories about specific Apps. We also
use AdWords. We are big believers in search

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:12.220
engine marketing. So, for example, in this
case, we run a campaign against the keywords

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:22.180
Google Apps and CRM, we're going to run an
ad that drives traffic to a category in the

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.180
Marketplace. In this case, it's a customer
management category. So I need vendors who

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.670
are out there in that category or in that
search term can get benefit from their advertising

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:34.269
we're going to do around the Marketplace.
We do blog posts and tweets, all that good

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:40.389
stuff, we've got great--a very nice YouTube
channel. We'd love to have your high quality

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:47.149
video to share. On the home page of the Marketplace
itself, we provide a list--that the latest

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:52.209
two customers' success stories on the homepage
itself. So again, we're really trying to make

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:56.870
it easier for you to, you know, take the investment
to create a customer success story and make

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.975
it easy to distribute that to the users that
you want to reach. And one of the ways we

00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:06.730
do that is show the latest two stories on
the homepage. And last but not least, the

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:12.040
press. So clearly, the press--we talked to
the press, clearly, they're interested in

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.089
the things we're doing, they're interested
in the things you're doing, they're interested

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.580
in the things we’re doing together. So,
you know, working together in the Marketplace

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:25.500
from launch on is a great opportunity to engage
the press and tell stories about how we're

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:33.960
helping customers improve their business.
Okay. So enough for me. I'd like to now invite

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:41.030
up Amit, CEO of ManyMoon to tell you a bit
about what they’ve been doing.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.760
&gt;&gt; KULKARNI: Thanks, Scott.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Thanks, Amit.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:54.830
&gt;&gt; KULKARNI: Hello. My name is Amit Kulkarni
and I am the co-founder and CEO of ManyMoon.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.480
And today, I'd like to tell you a little bit
about how we became one of the top installed

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:06.420
applications in the Google Apps Marketplace.
So very quickly, what is ManyMoon? ManyMoon

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.840
is a social productivity tool that helps people
get work done online with their connections.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.390
Whereas with a lot of other social sites,
you're sharing things like photos and parties

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:20.780
with your friends. With ManyMoon, you're sharing
things like tasks, so managing tasks, completing

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.270
projects, sharing Google Docs, whatever you
need to work on. It also has the social capabilities

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:30.361
that people are used to nowadays like profile,
status update, and feeds. But what ManyMoon

00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:37.690
has really built into it is the security and
the utility that businesses and professionals

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:43.530
require. So why did we decide to launch on
the Google Apps Marketplace? Well, first and

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.560
foremost, as Scott mentioned, it's a huge
market, 25 million users and 2 million businesses.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.430
But what's really exciting is that it's a
fast growing market, over 3,000 businesses

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:57.040
a day. So as a startup, we were really excited
about attaching ourselves to a growing market.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.830
But most importantly, it’s a qualified audience.
So these are businesses and professionals

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.110
who we know are willing to pay for SaaS application
and it's a direct pay relationship. So they

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:12.740
will pay you on a monthly or annual basis
for a subscription. The other reason we decided

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.300
to launch in the Google Apps Marketplace was,
as a startup, we're always looking to keep

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.460
our development cost low and do more with
less. So as I go to the demo, you'll see a

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.930
lot of features in ManyMoon that typically
would have taken us months to develop. We

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:29.360
were able to get them done in just days or
weeks by using various Google APIs. And what

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.260
that really enables us to do by saving on
development time is very--quicken up our release

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.350
cycles which means that we can get more releases
out to customers and get more feedback and

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:45.210
really iterate based on customer feedback.
And as a startup, that’s really our competitive

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:53.330
advantage. So let me go into a demo and show
you how ManyMoon works. So this is a typical

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:59.380
Google Apps user. Her name is Kate and she
works in a company and her manager is saying

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.090
that we have to move to a new office at the
end of the month. And she'll turn to ManyMoon

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:07.080
to make this happen. With the contextual gadget
that we just released yesterday, she can,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.440
of course, create a project right here within
her Gmail, a ManyMoon project. But for the

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.301
purpose of this demo, what I'll do is actually
go to ManyMoon.com and show you what the product

00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:20.140
can do with Google Apps. So first thing, within
the Google universal navigation with one click,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.261
she'll be brought right into the application.
So one of the things we really tried to do

00:20:24.261 --> 00:20:29.500
and we developed for Google Apps is reduce
as much of the friction as possible between

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.060
the user and them experiencing your application.
So this helped tremendously with conversions.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.030
So now that she's in the application, she's
got a variety of features available to her.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.820
She'll go into a workspace she's already created
called New Office Move and she is going to

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:49.580
assign a task to someone that says select
which office to move to. And again, to reduce

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:55.500
friction, all she has to do is enter in someone's
name. In using the Google context API, we

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.760
automatically find people from her address
book and she can assign the task to the person.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.820
Luckily, Kate's also been keeping track of
a list of offices she's been viewing in a

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.920
Google spreadsheet that she would like to
attach here, so she'll go to List Google Docs.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:16.480
ManyMoon will bring up a list of Google Docs
here. So again, as the end-user benefit, all

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.090
of the documents and data that she already
has in her Google Apps account, she can reuse

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.280
within a third party application and all the
data is still stored and managed by Google.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:31.130
So she's attached the Google spreadsheet.
She'll say we want to get this task done tomorrow,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.650
and that’s it. By using the Google Doc List
API, ManyMoon automatically shared that Google

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.510
spreadsheet with everyone in that work space.
And when people get kicked out of that work

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:45.380
space, ManyMoon resends the data access as
well. So after we released this feature, our

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.211
baseline of daily visits increased by 300%
which is tremendous as a startup. Another

00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:55.730
feature we had customer shortly after that
asking for was a graphical calendar style

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.910
view of everything in their project and workspaces.
So things like open tasks, milestones, meetings,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.820
and what not. Again, this might have taken
us months to build. We were able to do it

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.100
in just a couple of weeks by using the Google
Calendar APIs. So I'll go down to project

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.380
calendar which is an actuality, just a Google
Calendar that we've automatically shared with

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.760
our workspace members and embedded right within
ManyMoon so that task that I automatically

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:25.740
created is already here. The target date for
the project is here as well. So that’s just

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.800
a little bit about--I've shown you just a
little bit of what Manymoon can do with Google

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:36.240
apps, and customers really love these integrations.
Since the marketplace launch about two months

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.980
ago, we've been signing up on average over
a thousand new businesses every week, just

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.750
through the marketplace which is great. But
even better, a large number of these are actually

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.970
converting to our premium editions of Manymoon,
so that's Manymoon pro and Manymoon team.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:54.381
And there are businesses of all sizes that
are upgrading, they're small businesses, large

00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:59.130
enterprises, universities, non profits, you
name it. And what the dramatic increase in

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.020
revenue really allows us is the ability to
hire more engineers which we're looking to

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.780
do, and really execute on our vision which
is really to become the most popular get-work-done

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:14.420
application online. So, a couple of tips that
we learned along the way that I'd like to

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.660
share with you on having a successful listing
in the Google apps marketplace, first, it

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.880
really starts with your listing page so this
is what people, or domain administrators foresee

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.500
when they want to install your app. So, Google
gives you one screenshot to include in your

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.150
listing page, we originally included a screenshot
of our user homepage. The issue is that, the

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.970
same screenshot is used as thumbnails throughout
the marketplace. So, we found to be much more

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.680
effective is to use our logo with stylized
imagery about what our application can do,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.760
so that when people seem to see that thumbnail,
they can immediately understand what your

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.240
app can do. Secondly is really organize your
listing page; so, Google gives you free reign

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.840
over that. What we did is actually break it
up into a few parts; the first is benefits,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.960
so we very clearly define what are the end-user
benefits to the application. So we talk–-we

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.040
don’t talk about features or any technical
aspects, so we talk about ROI, dollar saved,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.750
hour saved, whatever. The second part is features,
and this is a little bit more technical, we

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.960
really try to fill this up with our Google
apps specific integration. So how we integrate

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.690
with Goggle calendar, how we integrate with
Google docs in different features. And finally,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:24.400
customer examples; generally, the people who
are coming to your listing page and interested

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.260
in your app are domain administrators, and
they really want to know that other customers

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:33.840
have used and validated their application.
So that leads me to the second tip; because

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.430
of the nature of the marketplace and who's
actually installing the app, generally is

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.240
domain administrators or these business owners,
they really want to know that other customers

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.390
are using their app and have other customers
validate your app for you, and the best way

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.400
to do that we found is with case studies.
And so, we spend a lot of time talking to

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.010
our customers, and talking about what are
the benefits of them Manymoon and Google apps.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.860
So one of the things is really getting a wide
variety of case studies across all sorts of

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.710
different industries and businesses. So, we've
got case studies for consultants, property

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.100
managers, non profits, event planners, and
that's important because when someone comes

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.940
to a listing page, it’s much more effective
if they find out that a similar type of business

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:17.320
is already using your application, they immediately
relate to it. Secondly is account for a lead

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.730
time. When we first started case studies,
we thought it might take one or two days and

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.760
one phone call, but generally, with these
case studies, it might take a couple of weeks

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.650
or even up to a month just to go to the customer
approval cycle. So really, it’s important

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.170
to have a good pipeline of customers who are
willing to help you out with case studies.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.340
Secondly, use Google's format and the URL
below, Google's got a very nice format for

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.700
case studies that you can use, and that includes
one paragraph about the customer, one paragraph

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.040
about your business, a problem statement,
a solution statement, and then one or two

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.590
paragraphs about the results and benefits
of using Manymoon plus Google apps. And so,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:56.290
we use it as sort of our standard case study
template now. Most importantly we think is

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.190
selecting one key metric for your application
and your customer's business, to use in all

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:05.220
of your case studies. So for us as a social
productivity tool, we really try to focus

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:11.290
on how many emails we're saving either per
user, per month, per project, per week, per

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.620
whatever. And we try to include that metric
in every case study and also include it in

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:21.510
every customer quote where possible in every
case study. And then finally, publish in Market

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.450
year case studies; so of course in the URL
below, Google's got a very easy to use web

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.290
form where you could submit the case studies,
we also post them on our own website, we blog

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.540
about them, and we tweet about them. And really-–and
also you can even get out to different industry

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.640
webpages and have customers talk about them.
So those are just a couple of tips, I hope

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:54.660
that helps, and I’ll turn it over to Chuck
of SlideRocket.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.480
&gt;&gt; I am Chuck with SlideRocket and I'm going
to tell you about why we joined the market

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.750
place and some of the benefits; and in doing
so, also get to show you our application.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:10.340
So, what we're focused on is reinventing presentations;
and as you guys know, there's a lot of presentations

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.680
made, there's over 500 million copies of PowerPoint
out in the market, there's over 40 million

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.960
presentation delivered a day, who knows how
many are delivered here at IO today, and unfortunately,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.480
a lot of them are pretty bad. And they're
bad for two reasons; one, sometimes they're

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.280
just bullet points, and they're really boring,
and you got to suffer through them; but the

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.690
other side to them is putting them together
is laborious. You probably re-create the same

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.060
slide someone else has already created, you
can't find slides you've already created,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.490
once you need to distribute them, they're
tough to distribute, it's tough to get people

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.360
collaborate on them, and you have no idea
what people are doing with them; are they

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.100
opening them, are they viewing them, and if
you ever want to update them, it’s very

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.580
difficult to pull them back from websites,
or from emails that you've distributed. So

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.270
what we focused on is reinventing that whole
process and we look at presentations as kind

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:05.860
of a life cycle, where creation is just one
step of it. The other step is collaborating;

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.120
so inviting people from other organizations
to build slides that might automatically flow

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.590
into your presentation, having only to manage
those dynamically. So, the content is actually

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.900
updated dynamically from other data sources,
and this is one of the most interesting things

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.941
that we're doing with the marketplace. Abilities
to share them publicly, securely embed them

00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:30.620
on pages, and then get detailed analytics
in what people are doing with those; are your

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:35.230
prospects opening them? Are they forwarding
them around to other decision makers? And

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.900
this is a perfect chance to jump out of our
application and just kind of show you how

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.570
this works really quick. So, I'm now in kind
of the SlideRocket editor and if I wanted

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.560
to create a presentation for Google IO, what
I do is just go into the SlideRockets slide

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:57.060
library, I do a search for slides that were
tagged Google, and I would drag in and drop

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.220
the symbol of presentation that might be relevant
for this audience, for the message we're trying

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.580
to convey, and it's very likely that other
people in my organization like my marketing

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.290
manager is keeping up these up to date so,
they're always live and dynamically updated,

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:21.380
and always represent kind of our best message.
So, I'll close the library here, and jump

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:28.370
back into play. So, why we partnered with
Google was, their customers are our customers.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:34.570
I mean, it’s rare you're going to find someone
who's got 25 million users and 3,000 new businesses

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.120
a day. And these customers buy Google for
the same reason, they buy SlideRocket, they

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.150
believe online and in the cloud is faster,
cheaper, quicker, and what we look at our

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:50.540
self is, is an extension of the Google apps.
So we focus, you know, very deeply on the

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:57.640
presentation area to provide an experience
that is better than something they can get

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:04.630
with packaged software. And then our initial
integration, we focused on four areas; and

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.280
Google opens up a lot of API's so you can
do a lot of connections, but we focus on these

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.200
four integrations for our first launch into
the marketplace. First is of course the single

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.190
sign on, and I'll talk about that in the next
slide, I think that's the most powerful thing

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.060
for the marketplace, or one of the most powerful
things. Single sign on; it seems very simple,

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.240
but it has a lot of ramifications n terms
of user provisioning. Second is the ability

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.570
to take content from Google like Google presentations
and import it into SlideRocket, third is dynamically

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:41.700
updating content in SlideRocket, slides, tables,
graphs from data that resides in Google apps,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.150
and then of course, using the Google contact
as a management for how you distribute to

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:54.340
people in your organization, people in your
university sales prospects etcetera. So, let's

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.950
talk about what the marketplace is meant for
us; this graph on your left here shows a huge

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:05.520
spike in traffic we had as a result of the
launch on the 9th. The graph on the right

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.490
here isn’t populated yet, but what I wanted
to show you is a quick demo of how we connect

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:16.720
to Google data to populate, dynamically populate
tables and charts. So if I click on this table

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.680
and chart, now thanks to our marketplace integration,
I can link to Google spreadsheets here. In

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.210
linking to Google spreadsheets, it’s recognizing
who I am, and it’s pulling up a list of

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.980
all the Google spreadsheets I have access
to. What I want to talk to you about here

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.950
is how we've seen an increase in the user
growth as a result of our marketplace. I'm

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.660
going to check this box which is going to
keep my graph dynamically updated, so every

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.400
time the spreadsheet changes, the graph's
going to change, and the information that

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.600
I'm conveying is going to always be up to
date, and then I'll shift in the play mode

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.750
here again, and what you see here is something
really phenomenal after our marketplace launch

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:58.680
and again thanks to the single sign on provisioning,
it used to be that, when someone would come

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.390
to our website, it'd be one user at a company
and that sign up for trial, and they'd kick

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:06.780
the tires on SlideRocket, if they'd like it,
they tell some other people in the organization.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.710
But with that add-it button which Scott showed
you, they can add it for every single user

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:17.631
in their organization. So we saw the number
of people in our trials go up 500% and that

00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:21.000
gives us an in chance not just to engage with
one person in the organization who wants to

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.350
try out SlideRocket, but it gives us a vehicle
to speak to all of the users in that organization

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:32.140
and greatly increases the likelihood of a
conversion, in an adopted customer, so that

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:37.730
was a huge benefit to the market place for
us. A second big benefit and Scott spoke about

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:45.370
this briefly, is Google has a lot of marketing
might and what we see is they’re putting

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:50.750
a lot of energy and a lot of people and resources
behind our enterprise division and behind

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:55.320
the marketplace. And that by partnering with
them, there's a lot of different marketing

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.410
opportunities that you can take advantage
of to increase the size and the awareness

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.870
of your company. And this is just a quick
summary of the five things we thought were

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:09.770
most importantly. One is your marketplace
listing, folks spoke about that already, two,

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:15.610
is there's a YouTube channel for--focused
a lot on the marketplace and enterprise used

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:20.411
cases. So, you can create case studies, you
can create how-to videos on how your product

00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:25.670
works with Google apps, and you can syndicate
that out on Google's YouTube Channel, and

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:30.221
that's going to bring a lot of viewership
and awareness to your application. Two is

00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:35.630
the social of course; there's people, you
know, could be tweeting here right now associating

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.430
SlideRocket with Google, and that brings a
lot of followers back to our site; so again,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:47.000
a very powerful. PR, Google sneezes, you know,
tech crunch has taken over about Google sneeze.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.060
So, Google has an unbelievable amount of awareness
in the press, and as an example here, we put

00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:00.590
together a press release on our Google announcement.
So, we’re looking into SlideRocket again

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:07.350
here and we sent this press release which
is a presentation out to 200 reporters, you

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.740
know, we don’t typically get this sort of
following with our press releases, but these

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.839
200 reporters forwarded it to 1200 other folks,
and we can see where they're opening and where

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:20.269
they're spending their time. So, it just goes
to show that when you associate your company

00:34:20.269 --> 00:34:26.159
with Google, you get a lot more awareness
that you might on your own. And then of course,

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:31.929
customer case studies; so, building these
case studies, Google is looking for enterprise

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:36.379
customer case studies to promote, you can
find customers that use your product in conjunction

00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:40.899
with Google, and feed those up to Google,
and they can put them on their blogs and start

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:50.139
syndicating that and again, build an awareness
for you. So quick summary; four points here.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:56.099
One is build it quickly. Google invited us
to be a launch partner; it took two of our

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:00.730
developers one weekend to build what you saw
here. So if you're thinking about joining

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.819
the market place, I'll encourage you to just
stop thinking about it and just--just get

00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:10.580
in there and try it. Two is it extends the
functionality of your application. So we didn't

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:15.240
want to build a spreadsheet tool, to populate
tables and charts. We don't want to build

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.220
a contact management. We don't want to build
calendar things. So you can actually increase

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:25.309
the scope and the function--features and functionality
of your product by taking advantage of this

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:31.290
market place API integrations. Three is the
marketing cache that Google offers which we

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:36.440
spoke about already. And then fourth is you
guys might know Google has a lighter weight

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.059
presentation on-line authoring tool. Google's
been extremely supportive of our kind of more

00:35:41.059 --> 00:35:45.400
robust system which looks beyond authoring
around the whole life cycle so, if you have

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.140
a little bit of overlap with any Google functionality,
I would not let that discourage you from building.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:55.350
They've been a great partner and we look forward
to continued success with the marketplace.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:13.990
So with that I'll hand it over to Jay.
&gt;&gt; SIMONS: Thanks Chuck. I feel like a sprinter

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.440
at the end of a relay. They probably put me
last because I'm the fastest talker. My name

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.809
is Jay, I'm from--I'm from Atlassian. Atlassian
is a maker of software development and collaboration

00:36:20.809 --> 00:36:28.069
tools. We're an Australian company with people
scattered around Sydney, San Francisco and

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:31.920
Amsterdam in Europe. We have a portfolio of
eight products, our flagship products include

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.079
hopefully a couple that you've heard of JIRA
which is a popular issue in bug tracker and

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:42.289
conference which is a popular Wiki. We also
have a collection of developer tools. They're

00:36:42.289 --> 00:36:46.660
really focused on code collaboration around
source-code reviews, continuous integration,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:53.859
code coverage and quality, with about 17,000
customers worldwide. Our fastest growing product

00:36:53.859 --> 00:37:00.500
is a product called JIRA Studio, which combines
our entire portfolio into a hosted development

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:07.640
suite for not just developers but the people
that are part of a technical team, building

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:13.569
software together. And we saw the Google apps
marketplace is a great opportunity to provide

00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:15.829
a compliment to Google's messaging and collaboration
tools to developers of Google apps customers.

00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:25.249
And--and certainly there are a lot of those.
So in the middle, we describe the capabilities

00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:31.930
that JIRA Studio offers. Hosted subversion
for source control, bug tracking, code browsing,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:36.900
a wiki agile planning, continuous integration,
and code reviews. We saw that as a great compliment

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.800
to the messaging and collaboration tools in
Google apps. So let me click over and give

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.930
you a quick demonstration of some of the integration
that we've built. We're going to actually

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.730
start our demo in Gmail, because a lot of
us, whether we like it or not, spend a lot

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.749
of time cleaning out our inboxes. I'm logged--I'm
logged in here as a tech lead and a tech lead

00:37:56.749 --> 00:38:01.210
might spend a little bit less time than most
of us in email. But still he or she might

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:08.940
start their day cleaning up the inbox. To
the left of the Gmail inbox is a gadget that's

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:15.220
actually showing issues from JIRA Studio that
are assigned to me as a tech lead. So I see

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.039
at the bottom here, one of the issues is a
truly incredible feature that the development

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:23.829
team is going to work on together. And at
the heart of JIRA Studios sits JIRA, because

00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:28.910
a lot of development tasks are built around
issues or bugs that we're trying to fix. Rather

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:34.579
than click on an issue which I could do, from
Google's universal navigation, I want to select

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:41.799
JIRA Studio and actually take you to the front
page of--of JIRA Studio just to give you a

00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:46.999
quick snapshot of--of what's in the box. Across
the top, you sort of see the key components

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:53.460
of JIRA Studio. This is the front of JIRA
Studio, which is a dashboard. Technology behind

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:59.099
the dashboard is gadgets and it's the same
gadget technology that Google gadgets is using.

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:05.480
So as you saw in the previous screen, gadgets
from JIRA Studio can be added to Google applications,

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:13.099
like Gmail or GCaP or Google sites. Conversely,
Google gadgets can be added to my studio dashboard,

00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:19.470
like the gadget here, Google Translate. Dashboard
sort of gives me a snapshot of information

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:24.740
across my project from other developers or
members of the technical team. So I have an

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.769
activity stream, this is the gadget that we
saw in the previous screen with issues that

00:39:28.769 --> 00:39:35.499
are assigned to me. I can see statistics around
source-code activity in the source-code repository.

00:39:35.499 --> 00:39:42.950
Changed sets, open pew reviews, et cetera.
Again because most of the development happens

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.240
around issues, actually I want to click on
the issue that I mentioned earlier, this truly

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.840
incredible feature and I see that developments
actually waiting for the design specification.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.559
So one of the integration points that JIRA
Studio has with Google apps, we've integrated

00:39:56.559 --> 00:40:02.460
with Google docs API, similar to Manymoon.
In this case, the design specification has

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.299
been collaborated on with the technical team
or product management and it's a Google doc.

00:40:08.299 --> 00:40:14.290
Really quickly I can assemble a list of docs.
I selected the one that I want to attach to

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:19.400
the issue and then development can begin.
Down at the bottom, we see what we refer to

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.670
as the JIRA Studio activity bar. And it's
another key integration point between JIRA

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:30.890
Studio and Google apps. They really sort of
fuses the two systems together. So on the

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:37.220
left, we have provide to users of JIRA Studio,
kind of fingertip access to information across

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.859
all the tools that are comprised between JIRA
Studio and Google apps. So I can see is an

00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:48.869
example, open cover views that are assigned
to this user, the tech lead. I get a snapshot

00:40:48.869 --> 00:40:53.020
of email and from Gmail, I can see if there's
any important messages that I want to click

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.910
into directly as opposed to having to switch
contacts entirely to go to Gmail. You can

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:04.890
also see access to my calendar in Google sites.
Another feature that we felt we wanted to

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:09.690
take advantage of was integrating Google talk.
And Google talk really gave us the ability

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:16.089
to add instant messaging almost as a native
feature of Google suit or JIRA Studio itself.

00:41:16.089 --> 00:41:21.180
So chat and instant messaging is a core way
for developers interacts with another. Now

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:27.190
it's pervasive across the entire hosted development
suite. So here quickly in this issue page,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.160
I can send a message to another developer
and say design spec is attached and even include

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:39.109
a hyper link to the page, so they can quickly
see that it's there. I can then, if I wanted

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:50.279
to go to Google calendar and maybe add a 3PM
design spec review meeting with Dan, again

00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:55.369
without ever leaving JIRA Studio. So that's
kind of a quick glimpse of very small number

00:41:55.369 --> 00:42:00.830
of features that we integrated with Google
apps. How has it gone for us? Really, really

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:11.140
well. Since launch, we've seen a 30 % at increase
in sales of JIRA Studio. Wrong screen--and

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:18.079
we've also doubled the amount of traffic that
we're driving to JIRA Studios home page on

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:25.309
our website, and so--so far, so good. Here
is a couple of tips that I'll end with. Similar

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:30.400
to what Amit said from Manymoon in addition
to really focusing on the listing page which

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.599
you need to really represent your product
in the marketplace, you have to think very

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:40.250
carefully about the landing page on your website.
We're driving a lot of interest in the integration

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.759
between JIRA Studio and Google apps from within
our network. And we also have to think carefully

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:49.430
about the handoff between the listing page,
which has kind of a snapshot of information

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:55.349
and the broader webpage that might describe
the feature set in your products. In our landing

00:42:55.349 --> 00:43:01.059
page, we've also added the add-the-Google-domain
button. So it feels like there's an opportunity

00:43:01.059 --> 00:43:06.630
to quickly trial the product from wherever
you land. The final tip from me is also just

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:12.999
about thinking carefully how to engage the
broader set of users, reviews are an important

00:43:12.999 --> 00:43:18.160
part of helping other evaluators in the market
place, understand whether your product is

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.150
successful or popular or liked by users. And
rather than just engage the administrator

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.180
of the evaluator, we also wanted to think
about how to engage potentially the dozens

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.680
of developers that are using our products.
We want to think very carefully about this

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.099
but basically after 10 hours of usage, we
have a subtle little dialog box that'll pop

00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:42.780
up and say, you seem to be liking JIRA studio.
If you do like it, we'd love for you to pay

00:43:42.780 --> 00:44:03.489
it forward or share the joy on the Google
market place. And anytime you can dismiss

00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:30.579
this forever, it's just a one time sort of
subtle request for support. With that, that’s

00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:37.609
us from Atlassian and I'll hand it back over
to Scott, I think, for Q&amp;A.

00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:42.140
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Thanks guys. Awesome. And your
paying cash should be a little bit bigger

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.400
now, so thank you for those endorsements.
Just kidding. Okay, so, we'll see if we can

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.450
get some love from the moderator here inside
of Wave. Let's see here, these are notes,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.119
each time we have about 15 minutes. So, I
admit to being a little of a newbie with Moderator

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:51.780
and Wave. So, why don’t we, unless someone
has [INDISTINCT]

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:57.109
&gt;&gt; KULKARNI: Little bit right now.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Loading. So, while we're loading,

00:44:57.109 --> 00:45:06.039
anyone wants to shout out a question, comment,
why don’t we just go live, old style. Anyone

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:12.230
have any questions for the folks up here or
my self on what you’ve heard. Go ahead.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:16.359
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I have one. Thank you very much
for your presentation. My first question actually

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:24.690
is regarding the security. So, right now,
Google, when you buy, Google apps commit that

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:31.440
they secure datas, what about you guys? Do
you secure our datas the same way that Google

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.869
does?
&gt;&gt; KULKARNI: Yeah. So, we have a page where

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:42.240
we talk about our security practices but what's
really important is the way we integrate with

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.319
Google apps is all that your Google data is
still stored and managed by Google, so that

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:48.990
security is still maintained with them. So,
the credentials that you use to log in to

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.829
Manymoon are actually stored and managed by
Google. We don’t have access to them, same

00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:56.239
with your Google docs, same with your Google
calendar. So, that’s one of the benefits

00:45:56.239 --> 00:46:02.309
of being on the Marketplace as you take advantage
of Google security practices.

00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:03.309
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: I would just follow up that,

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:05.489
you know, any cloud provider, any application
provider out there certainly has this question

00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:10.660
from customers and challenges. So, it’s,
you know, it's part of the DNA of a software

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:19.400
and service company to treat the data right,
keep it secure.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:26.170
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Yup?

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.600
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: So, in general, you, as a vendor,

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.489
get to choose whatever business model, trial
model, et cetera you want. We, as Google,

00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:41.890
only show revenue when you have a customer
who converts to a paying account. So, if there

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:49.829
are free--premium product and they get take
a year to convert then there's nothing between

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:57.280
us until they actually start paying.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT].

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:03.450
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: So, two parts the answer. Today,
it's actually; you have full control of it

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:09.440
as if you were selling directly. When we introduce
our payment options and our payment APIs and

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.470
flow, then you will have a choice to figure
out yes if you want to take payment upfront,

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:20.260
again, if you want to do it--engage in a trial,
you'll get to essentially create those payment

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:28.309
events and you use the billing API to basically
power to check out and pay the process when

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:31.799
that event occurs.
&gt;&gt; So sorry. Last one. So, today, once I pay,

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:32.799
do they give the credit card to me or to you?
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Today because we're kind of in

00:47:32.799 --> 00:47:37.259
a post-launch state, we don’t have the full
payment infrastructure set in live, they actually

00:47:37.259 --> 00:48:06.289
pay you.
&gt;&gt; And then you trust me to give you the 20%?

00:48:06.289 --> 00:48:26.499
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Now, we're in
a red share free mode right now. So basically,

00:48:26.499 --> 00:48:36.930
everything that you sell between now and when
we re-launch our payment system, is yours

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:46.700
to keep. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hi there. One of the questions I had was,

00:48:46.700 --> 00:49:23.470
I've seen the Google mail contextual gadgets
but I'm interested in sort of

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:34.256
the interest there is on the part of the Google
apps team to open up the interface of the

00:49:34.256 --> 00:49:35.256
app themselves for tighter integration. So,
for example, you know, adding menus and things

00:49:35.256 --> 00:49:36.256
like that inside of Google docs or [INDISTINCT]
or whatever else. Is that--is that in the

00:49:36.256 --> 00:49:37.256
plans? Are you guys thinking about it? Is
that something…

00:49:37.256 --> 00:49:38.256
&gt;&gt; We--it’s a great idea. We want to hear
those kind of requests. We definitely get,

00:49:38.256 --> 00:49:39.256
for example, I think Chuck, your team asked
us, hey, we'd love the get a menu in your

00:49:39.256 --> 00:49:40.256
Google docs, can we make that happen. So,
we're definitely, you know, customer driven.

00:49:40.256 --> 00:49:41.256
So the more you request that and where you
help us figure out what the value is for you,

00:49:41.256 --> 00:49:42.256
the better it is for us to figure out in terms
of roadmap.

00:49:42.256 --> 00:49:43.256
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Soon, have you got some of the

00:49:43.256 --> 00:49:44.256
docs, pms in the audience so.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:49:44.256 --> 00:49:45.256
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: You can do it today with appscript
and spreadsheets. So, awesome. Go ahead.

00:49:45.256 --> 00:49:46.256
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Sure.

00:49:46.256 --> 00:49:47.256
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: The question is how do we vets

00:49:47.256 --> 00:49:48.256
(ph) the listings in the new app that come
in especially around security. So, we have

00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:49.256
a light weight screening process to actually
list the Marketplace. It's not--it's not based

00:49:49.256 --> 00:49:50.256
on a security review, it’s based on you
following the fairly transparent and simple

00:49:50.256 --> 00:49:51.256
steps of meeting requirements. And it’s
definitely up to you to, you know, again to

00:49:51.256 --> 00:49:52.256
protect your users' data just as you do normally.
We do really try to make it transparent to

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:54.280
the buyer both before they're buying and the
listing we list all the different APIs you're

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.140
going to want access to and of course, during
that check out process where the admin go

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.640
to make that grant, you know, they’ll be--you
can't add--you can't get access to things

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:16.450
that you haven’t asked for and explicitly
told the user about.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:21.359
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: That’s a great questions. The

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:25.640
question is if you're not--not an admin and
you're in the Marketplace and you find something

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.999
you like, how do you let your administrator
know? That’s on our--on our list of things.

00:50:27.999 --> 00:50:42.069
We definitely want to make that easier. Any
more questions for these guys? Go ahead at

00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:49.579
the mic.
&gt;&gt; I was wondering whether you support user's

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:53.910
based payments. Not every business model works
on a flat fee per month. So, do you have any

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.869
plans to introduce that in the future with
your payment system?

00:50:56.869 --> 00:50:58.849
&gt;&gt; User based pricing?
&gt;&gt; Yes, well actually, I was thinking…

00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:02.420
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: A usage?
&gt;&gt; Usage base. See, take a phone service.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.670
You may wrack up a different phone bill every
month. Do you have a solution to that?

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.819
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: So, we definitely plan to accommodate
that. We've looked--we've spent a lot of time,

00:51:09.819 --> 00:51:13.349
you know, looking at the diverse models, that
our 50 launch partners plus other folks who

00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:14.349
have come since then, you know, how are they
charging their customer's user usage, time,

00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:15.349
et cetera. It's challenge to accommodate all
those, but our goal is definitely to accommodate

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:16.349
all the different pricing models that you
want to use as a vendor. And so, details--you

00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:20.900
know, TBD in terms of how the APIs going to
make that happen but the answer is yes. We’re

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.900
looking at that.
&gt;&gt; I have a question for the providers. So,

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.030
do you see your value as providing more of
the work flow through? For a specific customer

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:36.490
set, that kind of water bugs on top of the
data API? Or is it more about specializing

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:57.259
in the actual data? Because you're not really
holding the data, you're pocketing it in the

00:51:57.259 --> 00:51:59.170
Google infrastructure.
&gt;&gt; DIETRICH: It might vary for the different

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:06.170
applications. For us at SlideRocket, it's
twofold. Its one, people live in Gmail. Google

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:12.739
Apps users live in Gmail. If we can make our
app discoverable with a single click from

00:52:12.739 --> 00:52:20.270
Gmail, it increases the adoption, so one is
adoption. Two is as I mentioned is we look

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:26.180
at Google as having a great suite of functionally
that we didn’t want to have build ourselves.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.039
So through the Marketplace, we were able to
integrate and extend the functionality of

00:52:30.039 --> 00:52:35.489
our applications such as the spreads--spreadsheets,
I mentioned, how we could link it dynamically

00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:38.180
to grasp the table and we look forward to
doing to that with things with like Google

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.010
Buzz, buzz feeds into presentation so, two
main reasons for us, I'm sure if you guys

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:47.349
have…
&gt;&gt; SIMONS: Well, I mean we offer tools that

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:52.830
Google doesn’t offer and as I mentioned--I
mean, their developers, inside of companies

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:56.451
is using Google Apps. And we think that the
experience of having their development tools

00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:59.979
connected to the messaging collaboration tools
that they're using for Google is a better

00:52:59.979 --> 00:53:04.089
one for them and its going to save them time.
&gt;&gt; So are they comfortable then with like

00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:07.700
coming back and modifying spreadsheets that
your application may have created or set permissions

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:16.650
on? Than to, kind of, go out and see those
kind of behind the scenes and the spreadsheet,

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:17.650
and then see the implementation as it's viewed
through your app?

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:19.029
&gt;&gt; DIETRICH: Yes, that’s correct. So, it's
people with the right permissions as it is

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:22.869
designated by Google Spreadsheets. Modify
those spreadsheets or those spreadsheets are

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:25.809
modified from data feeds that that user might
have connected to Google Spreadsheets that

00:53:25.809 --> 00:53:31.430
automatically feeds the visual representation
of that spreadsheet in SlideRocket.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:40.450
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Hi. I guess this is a question to Scott.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:45.950
You--I think you mention that a Google checkout
would become required, once you're out of

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.440
the revenue free phase. How does that work
then with our payment [INDISTINCT] ways that

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:53.640
we have set-up currently, will we have to
keep those for our other customers and go

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.680
with Google Checkout only for Google Marketplace
users?

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.070
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: So--Yes, the payment flow that
you've got today and maybe from a repayment

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:08.170
processor, you'll need to hook-in essentially
your pricing engine and the kind of the checkout

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:13.109
step with our APIs.
&gt;&gt; For all users, even those that come through

00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:17.369
the open Marketplace, not yours?
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: You can definitely have both

00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:22.029
flows but for our users who come in and they--for
example they have a checkout account, they

00:54:22.029 --> 00:54:26.769
may purchase other apps, Marketplace apps,
they've got kind of a nice single invoice--you

00:54:26.769 --> 00:54:31.140
know, bill every month or every year. You
know, they're going to want to use those credentials

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:40.570
to purchase your app. And you can definitely,
obviously, maintain your other flows as well.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.239
Great.
&gt;&gt; Hi. Are you considering in the payment

00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:48.630
when you sell not one time, but as a service
perhaps a monthly service. Are you considering

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:54.619
it in the payment in the Marketplace?
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Yes, absolutely. We assume that

00:54:54.619 --> 00:55:01.729
almost everyone is using some sort of recurring
billing whether it's monthly or, you know,

00:55:01.729 --> 00:55:03.670
based on what usage they have to fill back
up. So it's definitely the--in the DNA of

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:11.420
most of the company like us. It's an annual
subscription for our products. The question

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.460
are we considering it for--do we, do we share
revenue during that?

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.940
&gt;&gt; Yes and how [INDISTINCT] in the future…
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Yes, it’s a recurring. It's

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.940
for the lifetime of the customer.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.170
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Yes. It's not a--it's not a onetime
fee.

00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:26.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. I guess this is, this is for

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.960
Manymoon.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: I think, last question here.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.879
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Can I ask it?

00:55:31.879 --> 00:55:37.759
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: Absolutely. Please. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; For Manymoon, I think like the projects

00:55:37.759 --> 00:55:39.390
that, you know--a custom (ph) that this 25
million users can start Manymoon--the collaborators

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:41.359
are those only inside the 25 million or--because
projects often access across enterprise boundaries.

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:47.690
&gt;&gt; KULKARNI: Yes, so you know. One of the
benefits of being a SaaS Application is it

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:59.729
can work outside of the firewall as well.
So Manymoon as an application, it was built

00:55:59.729 --> 00:56:11.910
from the ground up to support the Internet,
so email addresses. So you can invite into

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:16.619
any project or workspace as long as you have
their email address, but we integrate with

00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:21.539
iGoogle Contacts API, it's all those contacts
you have already whether they're inside of

00:56:21.539 --> 00:56:23.880
your domain or outside. You can start collaborating
with them.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.310
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.
&gt;&gt; MCMULLAN: All right. Well, I want to thank

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:32.230
Jay and Chuck, and Amit for joining me today.
And thank you all for being--attending the

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.970
session. Thanks.
