Hi I'm Craig and this is Crash Course: Government
&amp; Politics and today we're going to do something

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.560
we try to do a lot at Crash Course, punch
eagles. Also help you understand the news better.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.340
Now we're not going to explain it
like Ezra Klein, well we sort of will, or

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.210
break it down into graphs and charts like
Nate Silver, or slow jam it like Jimmy Fallon.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.490
We're not going to slow jam it, Stan? Instead
Bureaucrat Jimmy and I are going to give you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.650
some tools you need to better understand news
stories and opinions about government and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.820
politics by describing the various types
of bureaucracies that affect our lives.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.480
Ain't that right, BJ? Yeah.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.340
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.660
There are a number of ways we can try to make
sense of the vast federal bureaucracy, and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.470
one of the most straightforward is to categorize
the different agencies by type. Now labeling

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.530
'em this way doesn't actually tell us what
they do but you'll see them labeled this way

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.830
in books and articles so you should be familiar
with the terms that political writers use.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.090
The first type of bureaucracy is the cabinet-level
agency, also called the executive department.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.730
Each of the fifteen departments is usually
headed by a secretary, except the Justice

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.120
Department, which is run by the Attorney General.
You can find a list of the executive departments

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.459
in any good textbook and I bet there might
be a list on the internet somewhere too. Maybe.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.259
But the ones you hear the most about are the
State Department, the Department of Defense,

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.550
and the Treasury Department. Others, like
the Department of the Interior or Housing

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.210
and Urban Development you usually only hear
about when there's a new secretary, or a scandal.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.319
Executive departments mostly provide services
through sub-agencies. For example the FBI

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.080
is technically part of the Department of Justice
and the FDA is part of the Department of Health

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.700
and Human Services. There are also independent
agencies that are very similar to executive

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.090
departments because their heads require Senate
confirmation. Well their whole body requires

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.590
-- their -- I'm talking about the head like
they're the boss -- the head of the agency.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.320
The best example here is the CIA: Central Intelligence
Agency, but NASA is another independent agency.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.819
Next we have the independent regulatory commissions
which are supposed to be further removed from

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.729
presidential oversight, which makes them independent.
You can recognize them because they're usually

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.529
called commissions, like the Federal Communications
Commission, the Federal Trade Commission,

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.839
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
They all have rule-making authority and the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.900
power to punish violations of the rules, often
through fines. If you pay attention to stories

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.310
about banking, especially banking malfeasance,
you'll find plenty of stories about SEC fines.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.820
Last, and pretty much least, frankly, are
the government corporations that are supposed

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.720
to make profits but in fact tend to rely on
government subsidies to stay afloat. The U.S.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.420
Postal Service and Amtrak are the best known,
and for most Americans these are the agencies

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.940
with which we have the most contact, especially
the post office.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.900
A more useful way to think about bureaucracies
is in terms of what they actually do, their

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.860
functions. Although the problem here is that
many bureaucracies have more than one function.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.300
Maybe the Thought Bubble can help us out.
Thought Bubble! Let's do this!

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.720
Some bureaucracies primarily serve clients.
Many of the sub-agencies of the cabinet departments

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.350
fit this bill, with the most obvious being
the Food and Drug Administration, which serves

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.790
the public by testing and approving new drugs;
the Centers for Disease Control, which tries

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.290
to do exactly what the name expects; and the
National Institutes of Health, which, among

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.080
other things, sponsors research that improves
citizens health. All of these agencies are

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.540
under the auspices of the Department of Health
and Human Services. Another good example of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.820
a client-serving agency is the Department of Agriculture,
which in addition to rating meat administers the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.140
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
which is the snappy new name for food stamps.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.880
A second function that many agencies perform
is to maintain the Union. One way agencies

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.860
maintain the Union is by collection revenue,
because without money the county doesn't function.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.700
The main agency in charge of collecting revenue
is the IRS. A second form of maintaining the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.610
union is providing security for its citizens.
The Department of Justice, which prosecutes

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.160
federal crimes and protects civil rights,
and the Department of Homeland Security, which,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.530
among other things, is in charge of airport
security, are the main agencies that ensure

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.300
internal security. Bureaucracies also keep
Americans safe from external threats. This

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.860
is the job of various intelligence services like the CIA
and NSA, and especially the Department of Defense.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.370
A third function of bureaucracies is to regulate
economic activity, primarily by creating and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.230
enforcing rules and regulations. Some of the
agencies primarily charged with enforcing

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.350
regulations are housed within executive departments,
like OSHA, within the Department of Labor.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.530
Others like the FCC and SEC are independent.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.060
The fourth major function of bureaucracies
is closely related to regulating economic

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.260
activity. Some bureaucracies have the primary
function of redistributing economic resources.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.200
Agencies concerned with fiscal and monetary
policy handle the inflow and outflow of money

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.740
in the economy through taxes, spending and
interest rates. Providing direct aid to the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.370
poor or welfare is another function of bureaucracies
that is even more complex and controversial.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.030
Most of these agencies, like the Social Security
Administration provide direct services so

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.370
we can see the overlap between the function
of agencies.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.340
Thanks Thought Bubble. I've been suggesting
that even though they aren't mentioned in

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.580
the Constitution, bureaucracies are pretty
powerful, so I should probably explain where

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.240
that power comes from. Basically, Thor's hammer.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.020
Actually no, it doesn't come from that at
all. It comes from Congress, which, as we've

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.820
seen, delegates power to executive agencies
in varying degrees. But once the agencies

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.820
exist they create powers for themselves by
maximizing their budgets. Bureaucracies lobby for

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.500
their own interests and the bigger and more important
they are the more money they get from Congress.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.520
We tend to think that the nation defense is
important, so the Department of Defense is

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.660
able to convince Congress to give it lots of money.
Although mo' money can lead to mo' problems

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.440
as Biggie helpfully reminded us. Money is also
probably the most important lever of power in the U.S.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.560
In addition to getting money for themselves,
another source of bureaucratic power is the expertise
of bureaucrats themselves.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280
The President, and especially Congress,
will often rely on bureaucratic experts to tell them

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.140
how a policy will be implemented. The source of their
power is the expert's command of useful information.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.540
You shouldn't underestimate this, as any
number of technology companies will tell you.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.670
So those are two ways of thinking about bureaucracies.
I hope that they're helpful and at least when

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.870
you hear about the FCC issuing a fine for
Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction" or

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.260
something, you'll understand who's doing the
punishing. And when you read about Congress

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.280
cutting SNAP funding you'll be like "Oh
snap! That's tied up with the farm bill!"

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.260
