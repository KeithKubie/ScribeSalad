00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:20.769
about how old it really is you know that
 

00:39:20.769 --> 00:39:22.680
about how old it really is you know that
we have the latest technological devices

we have the latest technological devices
 

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.279
we have the latest technological devices
to uncover the past there are all these

00:39:26.279 --> 00:39:26.289
to uncover the past there are all these
 

00:39:26.289 --> 00:39:28.739
to uncover the past there are all these
new theories speculative theories but

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:28.749
new theories speculative theories but
 

00:39:28.749 --> 00:39:30.180

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.710
questions comments yeah
what I was that wonderful isn't the

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720
what I was that wonderful isn't the
 

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.380
what I was that wonderful isn't the

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:56.390
don'ts wonderful yeah so a number of
 

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.480
don'ts wonderful yeah so a number of
years ago I was teaching at Princeton

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:58.490
years ago I was teaching at Princeton
 

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.819
years ago I was teaching at Princeton
and I was teaching a seminar on America

00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:00.829
and I was teaching a seminar on America
 

00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:02.710
and I was teaching a seminar on America
and the Ten Commandments and I was

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720
and the Ten Commandments and I was
 

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.170
and the Ten Commandments and I was
encouraging my students to think

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:05.180
encouraging my students to think
 

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.990
encouraging my students to think
visually about the Ten Commandments and

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000
visually about the Ten Commandments and
 

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.270
visually about the Ten Commandments and
then one of my wonderful students went

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280
then one of my wonderful students went
 

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.990
then one of my wonderful students went
home to California for break and she

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000
home to California for break and she
 

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.839
home to California for break and she
returned with this thing this drawing

00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:16.849
returned with this thing this drawing
 

00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:20.650
returned with this thing this drawing
which was a family members rendition of

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:20.660
which was a family members rendition of
 

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.740
which was a family members rendition of
the Ten Commandments and I'm not sure

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:23.750
the Ten Commandments and I'm not sure
 

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.990
the Ten Commandments and I'm not sure
he's probably a lot older Eli the author

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000
he's probably a lot older Eli the author
 

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.450
he's probably a lot older Eli the author
the illustrator is probably a lot older

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:28.460
the illustrator is probably a lot older
 

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.990
the illustrator is probably a lot older
and I'm pretty sure would be apt to

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000
and I'm pretty sure would be apt to
 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.510
and I'm pretty sure would be apt to
disavow his collection of doubts but I

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520
disavow his collection of doubts but I
 

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.390
disavow his collection of doubts but I
just I was so marvelous the idea of the

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400
just I was so marvelous the idea of the
 

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.190
just I was so marvelous the idea of the
Ten Commandments an opportunity for

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200
Ten Commandments an opportunity for
 

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.099
Ten Commandments an opportunity for
storytelling especially on the part of a

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:42.109
storytelling especially on the part of a
 

00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:46.890
storytelling especially on the part of a
of a kid I just that was great yeah

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:46.900
of a kid I just that was great yeah
 

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.910
of a kid I just that was great yeah
thank you here talk so the first example

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920
thank you here talk so the first example
 

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.800
thank you here talk so the first example
not only occurs right before the Civil

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:53.810
not only occurs right before the Civil
 

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.660
not only occurs right before the Civil
War but I think at the peak of the

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:55.670
War but I think at the peak of the
 

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.720
War but I think at the peak of the
Second Great Awakening and the second

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:58.730
Second Great Awakening and the second
 

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.990
Second Great Awakening and the second
one of course in the face of God most

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000
one of course in the face of God most
 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.260
one of course in the face of God most
communism so I'm wondering if you can

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.270
communism so I'm wondering if you can
 

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.329
communism so I'm wondering if you can
talk about what these examples tell us

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:07.339
talk about what these examples tell us
 

00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:10.180
talk about what these examples tell us
about the state of religion in America

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:10.190
about the state of religion in America
 

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.460
about the state of religion in America
at that particular time yeah so I think

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:12.470
at that particular time yeah so I think
 

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.620
at that particular time yeah so I think
the the Ten Commandments does a lot of

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:14.630
the the Ten Commandments does a lot of
 

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.750
the the Ten Commandments does a lot of
work you know what we call cultural work

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760
work you know what we call cultural work
 

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.250
work you know what we call cultural work
and it at times of really profound

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:20.260
and it at times of really profound
 

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.160
and it at times of really profound
instability offers an opportunity to

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.170
instability offers an opportunity to
 

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.000
instability offers an opportunity to
think about the possibility of stability

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.010
think about the possibility of stability
 

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.950
think about the possibility of stability
so I think that it's no coincidence that

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960
so I think that it's no coincidence that
 

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.240
so I think that it's no coincidence that
this is found I would even say that the

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:33.250
this is found I would even say that the
 

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.859
this is found I would even say that the
signal historical event is more the

00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:35.869
signal historical event is more the
 

00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:38.829
signal historical event is more the
breakup of the Union than it is any

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839
breakup of the Union than it is any
 

00:41:38.839 --> 00:41:41.349
breakup of the Union than it is any
internal religious upheaval so clearly

00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359
internal religious upheaval so clearly
 

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:44.470
internal religious upheaval so clearly
that was a time of great rupture and

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480
that was a time of great rupture and
 

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.390
that was a time of great rupture and
again post-war is also a time of great

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400
again post-war is also a time of great
 

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.829
again post-war is also a time of great
dislocation and so I think the 10

00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839
dislocation and so I think the 10
 

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:52.690
dislocation and so I think the 10
commandments are very handy they come

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:52.700
commandments are very handy they come
 

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:58.359
commandments are very handy they come
into being as a weight a really

00:41:58.359 --> 00:41:58.369
into being as a weight a really
 

00:41:58.369 --> 00:42:00.520
into being as a weight a really
wonderful way a counter-narrative to all

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:00.530
wonderful way a counter-narrative to all
 

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.470
wonderful way a counter-narrative to all
that instability

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480
that instability
 

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.750
that instability
so I think that's part of their their

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760
so I think that's part of their their
 

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.850
so I think that's part of their their
promise I don't know if that makes sense

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:06.860
promise I don't know if that makes sense
 

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.740
promise I don't know if that makes sense
I think also when you think about the

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:08.750
I think also when you think about the
 

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.380
I think also when you think about the
wyrick stones they really come on the

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:11.390
wyrick stones they really come on the
 

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.450
wyrick stones they really come on the
heels of the discovery of the Mormon

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:13.460
heels of the discovery of the Mormon
 

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.270
heels of the discovery of the Mormon
treasures and so there's some very

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280
treasures and so there's some very
 

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.060
treasures and so there's some very
pronounced belief in that as one of my

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.070
pronounced belief in that as one of my
 

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.300
pronounced belief in that as one of my
sources put it in the fertility of the

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:21.310
sources put it in the fertility of the
 

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:25.240
sources put it in the fertility of the
Midwestern mind in its belief that the

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:25.250
Midwestern mind in its belief that the
 

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.860
Midwestern mind in its belief that the
soil is so rich with all of these

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:26.870
soil is so rich with all of these
 

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.020
soil is so rich with all of these
indigenous forms of religious behavior

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.030
indigenous forms of religious behavior
 

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.240
indigenous forms of religious behavior
of religious belief so I think that also

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:31.250
of religious belief so I think that also
 

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.620
of religious belief so I think that also
plays a part I don't know if that's

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:32.630
plays a part I don't know if that's
 

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.500
plays a part I don't know if that's
what's getting at it but I think that

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:35.510
what's getting at it but I think that
 

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.920
what's getting at it but I think that
there's something that's very pleasing

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:38.930
there's something that's very pleasing
 

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.300
there's something that's very pleasing
about the ten commands you also have to

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.310
about the ten commands you also have to
 

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.010
about the ten commands you also have to
think about it as something that's

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:42.020
think about it as something that's
 

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.350
think about it as something that's
increasingly an American rather than a

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:44.360
increasingly an American rather than a
 

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.050
increasingly an American rather than a
denominational what formulation it's up

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:50.060
denominational what formulation it's up
 

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.880
denominational what formulation it's up
until recently it was very widespread

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:51.890
until recently it was very widespread
 

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.530
until recently it was very widespread
and its appeal and all sorts of

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:55.540
and its appeal and all sorts of
 

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.000
and its appeal and all sorts of
different faith communities claimed it

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.010
different faith communities claimed it
 

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.340
different faith communities claimed it
as their own so I think it's probably

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:00.350
as their own so I think it's probably
 

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.470
as their own so I think it's probably
and you'll tell me if I'm wrong it's

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480
and you'll tell me if I'm wrong it's
 

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.150
and you'll tell me if I'm wrong it's
probably one of the few things that Jews

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160
probably one of the few things that Jews
 

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.620
probably one of the few things that Jews
and Christians historically have in

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:05.630
and Christians historically have in
 

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.380
and Christians historically have in
common and so it just lends itself to

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.390
common and so it just lends itself to
 

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.470
common and so it just lends itself to
this articulation of sheridan asst I

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.480
this articulation of sheridan asst I
 

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.480
this articulation of sheridan asst I
think that good question yeah I I have a

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:16.490
think that good question yeah I I have a
 

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:22.990
think that good question yeah I I have a
question about what kind of the last

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000
question about what kind of the last
 

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.240
question about what kind of the last
thing you mentioned about Cecil DeMille

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:25.250
thing you mentioned about Cecil DeMille
 

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.790
thing you mentioned about Cecil DeMille
and Midrash I don't know if there's any

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800
and Midrash I don't know if there's any
 

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.920
and Midrash I don't know if there's any
evidence that he actually read this work

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:29.930
evidence that he actually read this work
 

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.680
evidence that he actually read this work
but wouldn't Louis Ginsburg's the

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:32.690
but wouldn't Louis Ginsburg's the
 

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.450
but wouldn't Louis Ginsburg's the
