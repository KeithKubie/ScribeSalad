00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
[music playing]

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.000
NARRATOR: The sun is hanging
heavy over the great Alaska

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.130
Range, where it's taken
Morgan and Margaret

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.570
an entire day to perform the
simple task of gathering water.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.970
Yeah, ideally, this would be
nice gravel that you could just

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.130
nestle these into,
but might have

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.570
to reach in there, actually,
to move a couple of rocks

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.670
so it sits down evenly.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.000
NARRATOR: And now with
a spring box in place,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.670
there's one final obstacle in
the way of finishing the job.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.730
MORGAN: Let's pull them all out.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.200
MARGARET: Here, grab that one.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.670
MORGAN: It's a little
trickier than I

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.270
expected, getting this thing
put together in the hole.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.670
MARGARET: Oh, don't fall.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.000
MORGAN: That one is big.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.830
It's just so hard to--

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.170
there we go.
OK.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.530
There's what I was looking for.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.770
And once the sides freeze, once
the wood freezes to the ice,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.030
it's going to be
there and solid.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.930
OK.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.370
That's cold.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.500
It's pretty much dark.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200
My hands are freezing
from handling

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.630
all those little screws and
the hinges and the cold.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm ready to get inside.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.870
Try not to drop this
hinge in the dark here.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.970
Ta-da!

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.870
MARGARET: Yay!

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.900
MORGAN: Let's dip some
buckets, and cover

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.030
this thing up and get inside.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.870
MARGARET: One.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.600
MORGAN: It is a long
reach down into this hole,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.500
but I feel like
because of that, it's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.130
more resistant to
overflow, and it's going

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.030
to be even better insulated.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.030
It's more likely to
stay clear of ice.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030
Snow seals better than anything.
MARGARET: Cool.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.000
You good?
I'll leave the shovel.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.430
MORGAN: Yeah, leave
the shovel here.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.500
MARGARET: Right there.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.300
Shovel marks the spot.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.200
MORGAN: I'm glad we got
this figured out today.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.900
It's going to do a better
job of keeping the hole open,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.430
and it hopefully provides us
with some trouble-free water

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.600
for the rest of the winter.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.230
Want some water?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.700
MARGARET: Despite all
the time and effort

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.330
that went into it today, you
know it's just part of the day.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.800
Tomorrow we'll go
get water again,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.630
and it'll be a much more
efficient fluid system.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.930
MORGAN: All right,
horses are all watered.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.630
Here.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.370
You need some water.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.470
In your cup.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.330
MARGARET: In the fancy cup.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.030
Hit me again.
