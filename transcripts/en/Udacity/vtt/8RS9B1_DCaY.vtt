00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Which of these differential equations should we be using to model heat loss.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're introducing two constants here, the ambient temperature of 300 K

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and time constant for the heat loss of say 2 minutes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Should the rate of change of our temperature be that temperature minus the ambient temperature

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
divided by the time constant or just our temperature divided by the time constant,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or the difference the other way around divided by the time constant,

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or just the ambient temperature divided by the time constant.
