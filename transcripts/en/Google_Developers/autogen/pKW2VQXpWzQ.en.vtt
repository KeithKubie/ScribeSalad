Emma yeah I guess thank you for for

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
Emma yeah I guess thank you for for
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469
Emma yeah I guess thank you for for
joining us so I guess the first thing I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
joining us so I guess the first thing I
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719
joining us so I guess the first thing I
wanted to ask is for anybody who's not

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
wanted to ask is for anybody who's not
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969
wanted to ask is for anybody who's not
actually been to the site or seen it yet

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
actually been to the site or seen it yet
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.650
actually been to the site or seen it yet
what kind of things should they actually

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660
what kind of things should they actually
 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.690
what kind of things should they actually
expect like what guys what have you guys

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
expect like what guys what have you guys
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.260
expect like what guys what have you guys
put into that experience well we wanted

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
put into that experience well we wanted
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.950
put into that experience well we wanted
to create the very visual multimedial

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960
to create the very visual multimedial
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.240
to create the very visual multimedial
exploration of the characters location

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250
exploration of the characters location
 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.969
exploration of the characters location
and everything from from the first two

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
and everything from from the first two
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.330
and everything from from the first two
Hobbit movies and we're doing some small

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
Hobbit movies and we're doing some small
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.809
Hobbit movies and we're doing some small
games using WebGL and CSS and some

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819
games using WebGL and CSS and some
 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.830
games using WebGL and CSS and some
dramatizations of different scenes the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
dramatizations of different scenes the
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960
dramatizations of different scenes the
locations that sounds awesome

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
locations that sounds awesome
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720
locations that sounds awesome
so what what kind of technologies or

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
so what what kind of technologies or
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.140
so what what kind of technologies or
libraries or frameworks can did you have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
libraries or frameworks can did you have
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.010
libraries or frameworks can did you have
to use to bring this whole thing

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020
to use to bring this whole thing
 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.790
to use to bring this whole thing
together yeah for the experiences we

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
together yeah for the experiences we
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.540
together yeah for the experiences we
have we have both WebGL based ones that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550
have we have both WebGL based ones that
 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.790
have we have both WebGL based ones that
using three yes and we have a couple of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
using three yes and we have a couple of
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.030
using three yes and we have a couple of
locations as well that using CSS only so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
locations as well that using CSS only so
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.670
locations as well that using CSS only so
it can be experienced on other browsers

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
it can be experienced on other browsers
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.720
it can be experienced on other browsers
and Chrome and Firefox on mobile so we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
and Chrome and Firefox on mobile so we
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.300
and Chrome and Firefox on mobile so we
could reach more people with the actual

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
could reach more people with the actual
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.830
could reach more people with the actual
experiences as well so is is a is a lot

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
experiences as well so is is a is a lot
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.720
experiences as well so is is a is a lot
of the code specific to your own engine

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
of the code specific to your own engine
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.270
of the code specific to your own engine
I mean you mentioned three J's there did

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
I mean you mentioned three J's there did
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.770
I mean you mentioned three J's there did
you did you have to craft a lot of the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
you did you have to craft a lot of the
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.100
you did you have to craft a lot of the
engine for yourselves and now actually

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
engine for yourselves and now actually
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.120
engine for yourselves and now actually
we use

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130
we use
 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.210
we use
much 3gs after this which is pretty

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
much 3gs after this which is pretty
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.900
much 3gs after this which is pretty
awesome already and I'm way for the for

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910
awesome already and I'm way for the for
 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.760
awesome already and I'm way for the for
example in lake time we had physics and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770
example in lake time we had physics and
 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.160
example in lake time we had physics and
then we used the few years library and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
then we used the few years library and
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.460
then we used the few years library and
the branch with a camel

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
the branch with a camel
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.320
the branch with a camel
then we went from that one okay awesome

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330
then we went from that one okay awesome
 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.320
then we went from that one okay awesome
okay cool um so obviously with something

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330
okay cool um so obviously with something
 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.030
okay cool um so obviously with something
like this you've got a lot of moving

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
like this you've got a lot of moving
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.150
like this you've got a lot of moving
parts like you said there's CSS 3d

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160
parts like you said there's CSS 3d
 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.950
parts like you said there's CSS 3d
transforms there's WebGL there's audio

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960
transforms there's WebGL there's audio
 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.850
transforms there's WebGL there's audio
there's imagery just a name like a few

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860
there's imagery just a name like a few
 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.360
there's imagery just a name like a few
of these things what was the actual

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370
of these things what was the actual
 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.860
of these things what was the actual
workflow for building the whole

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870
workflow for building the whole
 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.720
workflow for building the whole
experience because as I say it's real

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730
experience because as I say it's real
 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.810
experience because as I say it's real
it's a complex beast and it has to run

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820
it's a complex beast and it has to run
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.340
it's a complex beast and it has to run
well so how did you actually kind of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350
well so how did you actually kind of
 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.500
well so how did you actually kind of
build up to what we had what we actually

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
build up to what we had what we actually
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.930
build up to what we had what we actually
get to see well I think it it all it's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940
get to see well I think it it all it's
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.670
get to see well I think it it all it's
made up of different parts as you say

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680
made up of different parts as you say
 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.580
made up of different parts as you say
and coming from from really a more

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590
and coming from from really a more
 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.450
and coming from from really a more
creative side of it we usually do a lot

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460
creative side of it we usually do a lot
 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.150
creative side of it we usually do a lot
of animatics in after-effects

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
of animatics in after-effects
 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.660
of animatics in after-effects
pre-rendering 3d work 3d flows into each

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670
pre-rendering 3d work 3d flows into each
 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.530
pre-rendering 3d work 3d flows into each
section how we wanted to feel and look

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540
section how we wanted to feel and look
 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.380
section how we wanted to feel and look
then from that I think it's very much

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390
then from that I think it's very much
 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.690
then from that I think it's very much
going into early prototyping because

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700
going into early prototyping because
 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.980
going into early prototyping because
when you sit there in the room and

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
when you sit there in the room and
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.670
when you sit there in the room and
trying to discuss a game or project is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680
trying to discuss a game or project is
 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.320
trying to discuss a game or project is
without having an actual prototype to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
without having an actual prototype to
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.090
without having an actual prototype to
play around with it's very hard for lots

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100
play around with it's very hard for lots
 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.690
play around with it's very hard for lots
of people to get a common understanding

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700
of people to get a common understanding
 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.830
of people to get a common understanding
what you're talking about

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840
what you're talking about
 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.070
what you're talking about
yeah but that's and so did you find that

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
yeah but that's and so did you find that
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.780
yeah but that's and so did you find that
you were you were making a lot of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790
you were you were making a lot of
 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.760
you were you were making a lot of
prototypes and iterating a lot or did

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770
prototypes and iterating a lot or did
 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.800
prototypes and iterating a lot or did
you find that you you just made one or

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
you find that you you just made one or
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.420
you find that you you just made one or
two prototypes and and that was good

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
two prototypes and and that was good
 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.880
two prototypes and and that was good
enough I mean how how difficult was it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890
enough I mean how how difficult was it
 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.010
enough I mean how how difficult was it
to arrive at something that you felt was

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
to arrive at something that you felt was
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.650
to arrive at something that you felt was
creatively solid I think for some of the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660
creatively solid I think for some of the
 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.420
creatively solid I think for some of the
locations we have done way too many

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430
locations we have done way too many
 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.280
locations we have done way too many
prototypes and but it but of course it's

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290
prototypes and but it but of course it's
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.830
prototypes and but it but of course it's
it's a very difficult experience to to

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
it's a very difficult experience to to
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.380
it's a very difficult experience to to
create stories around and to to get

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390
create stories around and to to get
 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.770
create stories around and to to get
something creatively that works

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780
something creatively that works
 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.580
something creatively that works
to make something as a tech demo of I

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590
to make something as a tech demo of I
 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.580
to make something as a tech demo of I
mean it's easy to make something that's

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
mean it's easy to make something that's
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.620
mean it's easy to make something that's
a good story but maybe it doesn't suit

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630
a good story but maybe it doesn't suit
 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.650
a good story but maybe it doesn't suit
it for a good tech demo and only had at

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660
it for a good tech demo and only had at
 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.260
it for a good tech demo and only had at
hand we're making yeah you know it's

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270
hand we're making yeah you know it's
 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.380
hand we're making yeah you know it's
been a challenge to create stories that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390
been a challenge to create stories that
 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.160
been a challenge to create stories that

who's not seen it I mean it is a
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.760
who's not seen it I mean it is a
phenomenal piece of technology that

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770
phenomenal piece of technology that
 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.320
phenomenal piece of technology that
you've actually manage their craft

you know the WebGL stuff the CSS 3d

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240
you know the WebGL stuff the CSS 3d
 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.210
you know the WebGL stuff the CSS 3d
stuff and so on but actually it's

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220
stuff and so on but actually it's
 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.640
stuff and so on but actually it's
actually a very interesting and fun sort

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650
actually a very interesting and fun sort
 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.620

actually go through these parts of the
 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.680
actually go through these parts of the

but debugging WebGL particularly is

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190
but debugging WebGL particularly is
 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.620
but debugging WebGL particularly is
notoriously horrible and difficult

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630
notoriously horrible and difficult
 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.420
notoriously horrible and difficult

because sometimes all you get is this
 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.880
because sometimes all you get is this

what did debugging look like for you in
 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.140
what did debugging look like for you in

right direction set up all the lights
and and all the basic stuff it's pretty

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240
and and all the basic stuff it's pretty
 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.030

straightforward
 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.930
straightforward
but then when moving into you like

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940
but then when moving into you like
 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.770

debugging I mostly use

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780
debugging I mostly use
 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.560
debugging I mostly use
the vaginal inspector and a Chrome

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:32.570
the vaginal inspector and a Chrome
 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.490
the vaginal inspector and a Chrome

what what's getting inside the textures
 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.010
what what's getting inside the textures
and especially if this dynamic textures

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020
and especially if this dynamic textures

and post effects and stuff like that you
 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.490
and post effects and stuff like that you
need to look at but otherwise the

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500
need to look at but otherwise the
 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.140

also pretty straightforward to see if

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410
also pretty straightforward to see if
 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.380
also pretty straightforward to see if
there's a shader issues and that's yeah

00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.390
there's a shader issues and that's yeah
 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.090
there's a shader issues and that's yeah
you've mentioned WebGL inspector if

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.100
you've mentioned WebGL inspector if
 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.090
you've mentioned WebGL inspector if
anybody's not actually used that it's a

it's a Chrome extension by one of the
 

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.710
it's a Chrome extension by one of the
chrome engineers sorry not chrome

Vanek and it basically wraps around all

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:14.510
Vanek and it basically wraps around all
 

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.840
Vanek and it basically wraps around all
the WebGL context and gives you a lot of

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:16.850
the WebGL context and gives you a lot of
 

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.700
the WebGL context and gives you a lot of
insight into what's actually going on

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:18.710
insight into what's actually going on
 

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.190
insight into what's actually going on
there so definitely worth checking out

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.200
there so definitely worth checking out
 

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.360
there so definitely worth checking out
if you're actually trying to do any work

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.370
if you're actually trying to do any work
 

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.010
if you're actually trying to do any work
with with WebGL so I can open a journey

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.020
with with WebGL so I can open a journey
 

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.870
with with WebGL so I can open a journey
through middle-earth on desktop but I

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:28.880
through middle-earth on desktop but I
 

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.230
through middle-earth on desktop but I
can also do it on phones and tablets

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240
can also do it on phones and tablets
 

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.450
can also do it on phones and tablets
which is frankly awesome and this is one

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:34.460
which is frankly awesome and this is one
 

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.670
which is frankly awesome and this is one
of the first times I think I've seen an

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680
of the first times I think I've seen an
 

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.969
of the first times I think I've seen an
experience of this quality available

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:38.979
experience of this quality available
 

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.029
experience of this quality available
across platforms so suppose the the

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039
across platforms so suppose the the
 

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.430
across platforms so suppose the the
obvious question for me initially is how

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440
obvious question for me initially is how
 

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.610
obvious question for me initially is how
did you find the process of building a

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.620
did you find the process of building a
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.840
did you find the process of building a
genuinely multi device experience yeah

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:54.850
genuinely multi device experience yeah
 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.079
genuinely multi device experience yeah
it was a journey it's been a learning

00:08:59.079 --> 00:08:59.089
it was a journey it's been a learning
 

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.050
it was a journey it's been a learning
process for us as well as the company

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.060
process for us as well as the company
 

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.110
process for us as well as the company
because we haven't been too much into

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120
because we haven't been too much into
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:13.420
because we haven't been too much into
that before but I mean from beginning it

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.430
that before but I mean from beginning it
 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.820
that before but I mean from beginning it
was a big hurdle to decide what to do

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:15.830
was a big hurdle to decide what to do
 

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.340
was a big hurdle to decide what to do
with platforms that didn't support WebGL

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.350
with platforms that didn't support WebGL
 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.860
with platforms that didn't support WebGL
for example how to handle that how to

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:22.870
for example how to handle that how to
 

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.579
for example how to handle that how to
communicate with all different kinds of

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:26.589
communicate with all different kinds of
 

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:30.280
communicate with all different kinds of
mobile devices but couldn't support the

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.290
mobile devices but couldn't support the
 

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:36.100
mobile devices but couldn't support the
experience from that point I think we

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.110
experience from that point I think we
 

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.699
experience from that point I think we
found it pretty similar to normal web

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:39.709
found it pretty similar to normal web
 

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:42.730
found it pretty similar to normal web
development in terms of actually

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:42.740
development in terms of actually
 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.110
development in terms of actually
building

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120
building
 

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.040
building
the website and of course there are like

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.050
the website and of course there are like
 

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.590
the website and of course there are like
limitations to it that you have to abide

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600
limitations to it that you have to abide
 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.360
limitations to it that you have to abide
to well that was actually gonna be my

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:55.370
to well that was actually gonna be my
 

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.580
to well that was actually gonna be my
next question so kind of there are

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.590
next question so kind of there are
 

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.990
next question so kind of there are
obvious constraints you know you've got

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000
obvious constraints you know you've got
 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.100
obvious constraints you know you've got
on the one hand you've got these

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.110
on the one hand you've got these
 

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.040
on the one hand you've got these
desktops with these meaty GPUs on the

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.050
desktops with these meaty GPUs on the
 

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.360
desktops with these meaty GPUs on the
other end you've got little handheld

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
other end you've got little handheld
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.820
other end you've got little handheld
smartphones which you're gonna punish

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:06.830
smartphones which you're gonna punish
 

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.760
smartphones which you're gonna punish
you if you do the slightest thing wrong

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:08.770
you if you do the slightest thing wrong
 

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.580
you if you do the slightest thing wrong
so yeah what what what how did you

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:12.590
so yeah what what what how did you
 

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.930
so yeah what what what how did you
actually deal with those constraints you

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:13.940
actually deal with those constraints you
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.700
actually deal with those constraints you
sort of mentioned that you had to decide

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:15.710
sort of mentioned that you had to decide
 

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.640
sort of mentioned that you had to decide
what would go in what would go out you

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:18.650
what would go in what would go out you
 

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.900
what would go in what would go out you
know just key talk a bit about a bit

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:19.910
know just key talk a bit about a bit
 

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.640
know just key talk a bit about a bit
more about that process and how you

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:21.650
more about that process and how you
 

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.550
more about that process and how you
decided what to include where and and so

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560
decided what to include where and and so
 

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.850
decided what to include where and and so
on yeah I guess the biggest hurdle was

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:27.860
on yeah I guess the biggest hurdle was
 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.210
on yeah I guess the biggest hurdle was
the memory consumption and because you

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.220
the memory consumption and because you
 

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.950
the memory consumption and because you
you can pretty much hit the roof and

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:35.960
you can pretty much hit the roof and
 

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.640
you can pretty much hit the roof and
crash the device if you not really

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:39.650
crash the device if you not really
 

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.860
crash the device if you not really
careful with that so loading different

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:41.870
careful with that so loading different
 

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.860
careful with that so loading different
assets for one thing and I'm not only

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:44.870
assets for one thing and I'm not only
 

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.860
assets for one thing and I'm not only
for for memories for performance as well

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:47.870
for for memories for performance as well
 

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.490
for for memories for performance as well
because if you smaller a certain scale

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:51.500
because if you smaller a certain scale
 

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.640
because if you smaller a certain scale
it up it's taken less video memory as

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:54.650
it up it's taken less video memory as
 

00:10:54.650 --> 00:11:00.760
it up it's taken less video memory as
well when you surround and so that I

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:00.770
well when you surround and so that I
 

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:06.580
well when you surround and so that I
have the GPU as well they've you've sort

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.590
have the GPU as well they've you've sort
 

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.160
have the GPU as well they've you've sort
of taken a bit of a wander into my next

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.170
of taken a bit of a wander into my next
 

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.450
of taken a bit of a wander into my next
question I see something I wanted to

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:10.460
question I see something I wanted to
 

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.770
question I see something I wanted to
talk to you about is the fact that this

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:11.780
talk to you about is the fact that this
 

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.930
talk to you about is the fact that this
thing's running fantastically well

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:15.940
thing's running fantastically well
 

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.690
thing's running fantastically well
astonishing actually just how well this

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:19.700
astonishing actually just how well this
 

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.700
astonishing actually just how well this
thing runs on on mobile devices in

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:21.710
thing runs on on mobile devices in
 

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.470
thing runs on on mobile devices in
particular where you'd you'd be big

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480
particular where you'd you'd be big
 

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.640
particular where you'd you'd be big
concern I'd definitely be a bit

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:24.650
concern I'd definitely be a bit
 

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.200
concern I'd definitely be a bit
concerned when you'd sort of talking

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.210
concerned when you'd sort of talking
 

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.590
concerned when you'd sort of talking
WebGL and and and and 3d transforms just

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600
WebGL and and and and 3d transforms just
 

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600
WebGL and and and and 3d transforms just
generally that you want to keep this

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:31.610
generally that you want to keep this
 

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.920
generally that you want to keep this
stuff running fast because otherwise

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:32.930
stuff running fast because otherwise
 

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.630
stuff running fast because otherwise
there's no point thing in including it

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640
there's no point thing in including it
 

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.170
there's no point thing in including it
it's just going to frustrate the user so

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.180
it's just going to frustrate the user so
 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.250
it's just going to frustrate the user so
you know what were your performance

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:39.260
you know what were your performance
 

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.660
you know what were your performance
considerations and how did you actually

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:40.670
considerations and how did you actually
 

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.610
considerations and how did you actually
make sure that you're gonna stay at 60

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:42.620
make sure that you're gonna stay at 60
 

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.470
make sure that you're gonna stay at 60
frames a second or as close as you

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480
frames a second or as close as you
 

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.760
frames a second or as close as you
possibly could to that yeah we we

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:48.770
possibly could to that yeah we we
 

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.430
possibly could to that yeah we we
thought that we didn't really aim at

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440
thought that we didn't really aim at
 

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.200
thought that we didn't really aim at
reaching the 60 frames per second on

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.210
reaching the 60 frames per second on
 

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.470
reaching the 60 frames per second on
mobile

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480
mobile
 

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.110
mobile
without is much more important that we

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120
without is much more important that we
 

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.350
without is much more important that we
keep a stable framerate at a lower frame

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360
keep a stable framerate at a lower frame
 

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.970
keep a stable framerate at a lower frame
rate than then pushing it up to 60 so if

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980
rate than then pushing it up to 60 so if
 

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.350
rate than then pushing it up to 60 so if
it could be like wrong sorry and that's

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360
it could be like wrong sorry and that's
 

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.930
it could be like wrong sorry and that's
enough if you don't have this yank or

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940
enough if you don't have this yank or
 

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.400
enough if you don't have this yank or
the frames keeping going on so I guess

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.410
the frames keeping going on so I guess
 

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.940
the frames keeping going on so I guess
there is much more forgiving if it's not

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:22.950
there is much more forgiving if it's not
 

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.210
there is much more forgiving if it's not
glitches in there and with that took a

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220
glitches in there and with that took a
 

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.030
glitches in there and with that took a
lot of testing yeah we have iterations

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040
lot of testing yeah we have iterations
 

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.410
lot of testing yeah we have iterations
to make things move lots of devices

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:32.420
to make things move lots of devices
 

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.079
to make things move lots of devices
running from quite low end devices yeah

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.089
running from quite low end devices yeah
 

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.920
running from quite low end devices yeah
to the newest most performance devices

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:39.930
to the newest most performance devices
 

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.759
to the newest most performance devices
but then of course we disable stuff on

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:43.769
but then of course we disable stuff on
 

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:49.670
but then of course we disable stuff on
low-end devices post-effects we reduce

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680
low-end devices post-effects we reduce
 

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.680
low-end devices post-effects we reduce
the size of the canvas that is blown -

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:53.690
the size of the canvas that is blown -
 

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.090
the size of the canvas that is blown -
yeah all the tricks that's needed so

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.100
yeah all the tricks that's needed so
 

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.829
yeah all the tricks that's needed so
sorry I was gonna say do you then have

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839
sorry I was gonna say do you then have
 

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:02.389
sorry I was gonna say do you then have
to keep a bunch of these devices around

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399
to keep a bunch of these devices around
 

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.699
to keep a bunch of these devices around
in your studio to just kind of step

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:04.709
in your studio to just kind of step
 

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:05.960
in your studio to just kind of step
through and go okay now how's this

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:05.970
through and go okay now how's this
 

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.569
through and go okay now how's this
running on on this device and and now

00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579
running on on this device and and now
 

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:09.920
running on on this device and and now
how's this running on this device I mean

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:09.930
how's this running on this device I mean
 

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.079
how's this running on this device I mean
that seems like you know a big process

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:12.089
that seems like you know a big process
 

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:13.360
that seems like you know a big process
to go through

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.370
to go through
 

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.130
to go through
we were you able to automate or was this

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.140
we were you able to automate or was this
 

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.300
we were you able to automate or was this
just something that you actually had to

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:17.310
just something that you actually had to
 

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.829
just something that you actually had to
step through and do yourselves every

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839
step through and do yourselves every
 

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:22.819
step through and do yourselves every
time you made a release well for once we

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:22.829
time you made a release well for once we
 

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:26.329
time you made a release well for once we
had we had a dedicated tester that

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339
had we had a dedicated tester that
 

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:29.990
had we had a dedicated tester that
actually was responsible for constantly

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000
actually was responsible for constantly
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.090
actually was responsible for constantly
testing out new versions that we

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100
testing out new versions that we
 

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.880
testing out new versions that we
released but then in development um you

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:34.890
released but then in development um you
 

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.699
released but then in development um you
can ask yeah we of course we used

00:13:39.699 --> 00:13:39.709
can ask yeah we of course we used
 

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:42.110
can ask yeah we of course we used
multiple devices during the well

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120
multiple devices during the well
 

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.590
multiple devices during the well
development and and there is so so big

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600
development and and there is so so big
 

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.900
development and and there is so so big
difference between them and for example

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:47.910
difference between them and for example
 

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.590
difference between them and for example
the lg Metro super tiny screen up to the

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600
the lg Metro super tiny screen up to the
 

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.639
the lg Metro super tiny screen up to the
Nexus 10 and also with different GPUs

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:58.649
Nexus 10 and also with different GPUs
 

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:02.030
Nexus 10 and also with different GPUs
and screen sizes and I mean the pixel

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040
and screen sizes and I mean the pixel
 

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.780
and screen sizes and I mean the pixel
density and stuff so of course we had

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:05.790
density and stuff so of course we had
 

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.269
density and stuff so of course we had
many iterations of testing on the

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279
many iterations of testing on the
 

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.639
many iterations of testing on the
different devices I guess one of the

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:10.649
different devices I guess one of the
 

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:11.250
different devices I guess one of the
biggest are

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:11.260
biggest are
 

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.210
biggest are
is the ratio between amount of pixels

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.220
is the ratio between amount of pixels
 

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.190
is the ratio between amount of pixels
like density and screen size on the CPU

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.200
like density and screen size on the CPU
 

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.810
like density and screen size on the CPU
and GPU because some devices have way

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:24.820
and GPU because some devices have way
 

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.470
and GPU because some devices have way
too many pixels for their own good they

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480
too many pixels for their own good they
 

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.360
too many pixels for their own good they
look amazing but they don't they don't

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.370
look amazing but they don't they don't
 

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.850
look amazing but they don't they don't
they're not as forgiving I guess when it

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:32.860
they're not as forgiving I guess when it
 

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.600
they're not as forgiving I guess when it
comes to performance yeah okay so what

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.610
comes to performance yeah okay so what
 

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.850
comes to performance yeah okay so what
are you looking back over this project

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:38.860
are you looking back over this project

from a creative point of view but also a
 

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.610
from a creative point of view but also a
technical point of view you can yeah go

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:50.620
technical point of view you can yeah go
 

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.270
technical point of view you can yeah go
go crazy whatever you like

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:53.280

that we managed to make the experience

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880
that we managed to make the experience
 

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.020

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.410
feel very tight like you're an app that
isn't glitchy that is you really went

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:10.420
isn't glitchy that is you really went
 

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.190
isn't glitchy that is you really went
that extra mile to try to even though we

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:14.200
that extra mile to try to even though we
 

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.040
that extra mile to try to even though we
have to unload each section for bit

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.050
have to unload each section for bit
 

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.190

so on to keep memory consumption low I
 

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.770
so on to keep memory consumption low I
think we managed that by really putting

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:28.780
think we managed that by really putting
 

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.100

you then during the project you just

thought Matt we were so wrong with that

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839

that were basically blown to you know

and the creative work that you did I
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.040
and the creative work that you did I
guess one thing is we didn't really

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.050
guess one thing is we didn't really
 

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.280

early in the project we had a lot of

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:44.920
early in the project we had a lot of
 

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.430
early in the project we had a lot of
discussions but we actually could do and

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440
discussions but we actually could do and
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.800
discussions but we actually could do and
I mean we need to have super simple

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:49.810
I mean we need to have super simple
 

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.040
I mean we need to have super simple
version for mobile devices but then

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.050
version for mobile devices but then
 

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.320
version for mobile devices but then
gradually we could add more and more and

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.330
gradually we could add more and more and
 

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.790
gradually we could add more and more and
more and I'm personally pretty amazed

00:17:59.790 --> 00:17:59.800
more and I'm personally pretty amazed
 

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760

right now it takes really long time to

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:04.810
right now it takes really long time to
 

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.420
right now it takes really long time to
to make it site like this but I think

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.430
to make it site like this but I think
 

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.780
to make it site like this but I think
that in in a very short future we will

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:12.790
that in in a very short future we will
 

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.150
that in in a very short future we will
take this for granted that we used

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:15.160
take this for granted that we used
 

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.360
take this for granted that we used
mobile in this way and when making sites

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:18.370
mobile in this way and when making sites
 

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.210
mobile in this way and when making sites
like this I think one thing for example

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.220
like this I think one thing for example
 

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.570
like this I think one thing for example
is the 3d models were used in WebGL

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:24.580
is the 3d models were used in WebGL
 

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.810
is the 3d models were used in WebGL
experiments from the beginning we really

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820
experiments from the beginning we really
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.410
experiments from the beginning we really
set the aim on on using much lower all

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:31.420
set the aim on on using much lower all
 

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.600
set the aim on on using much lower all
accounts less complex models but that is

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:36.610
accounts less complex models but that is
 

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.990
accounts less complex models but that is
something that we check tracing

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000
something that we check tracing
 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.900
something that we check tracing
for some arts that's a trick that's

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:42.910
for some arts that's a trick that's
 

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.000
for some arts that's a trick that's
worked that is awesome I asked the

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.010
worked that is awesome I asked the
 

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.950
worked that is awesome I asked the
question having no idea what you'd

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960

there is so many techniques that you can
 

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.770
there is so many techniques that you can
use and it's scattered all over the

developers to get all those techniques

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.020
developers to get all those techniques
 

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.020
developers to get all those techniques
under the same roof and yeah use them

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.030
under the same roof and yeah use them
 

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:20.520
under the same roof and yeah use them
easily okay so something like this is an
