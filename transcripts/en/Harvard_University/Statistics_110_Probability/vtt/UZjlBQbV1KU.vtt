00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.970
Okay, so let's get started.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.800
Happy Halloween.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.451
Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:11.410
Symbolic of 110 in various ways.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.610
In particular, I think we learn
a lot of tricks in this class.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.862
You get a lot of treats too.

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:21.180
So there's the perfect Stat 110 holiday.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.870
Speaking of tricks,
a student from last year emailed me and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.710
told me that there's an open request
at the Bureau of Study Council for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.890
someone to quote,
teach me all of Blitzstein's tricks.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.330
So that's probably gonna
be a difficult to fulfill,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.790
so that's an open request with the BSC,
but

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.438
anyway, a lot of tricks and
a lot of treats.

00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:55.760
So today's gonna be a very,
very scary lecture as befits the holiday.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.810
In particular, the first half,
we're gonna do the beta distribution.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.930
And to give you some indication of how
scary, terrifying the beta distribution is

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.150
I'll tell you a true story which is
the first time I taught Stat 110,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.430
students were so just clearly just
terrified of the beta distribution.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.176
I didn't really know why,
actually it should not be scary, okay?

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:25.370
So I'll try to who you how it's not
that scary, but for some reason,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.140
they were extremely scared
of the beta distribution.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.379
Then on the final, I decided to be nice.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:33.542
I didn't put anything involving
the beta distribution, cuz they were so

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:34.161
scared of it.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:38.096
But then that really backfired on me,
because I think it was the students

00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:40.820
were seeing the beta
distributions like a ghost.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.851
And they were just seeing
betas lurking everywhere.

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:44.880
And when I was grading them with the TAs,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.470
there were just beta distributions
popping up everywhere on the exam.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.260
Even the questions that had nothing to
do with the beta, they were so scared.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.284
Is there a beta lurking
here behind the corner?

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:57.450
And it was just beta everywhere.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.600
So I think it would have been nicer
if I'd just put one easy beta

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.710
question at the beginning, then you kind
of get that fear out of your system.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.390
So anyway, let me tell you
what the beta distribution.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
It's not scary but for some reason,
it has been in the past but

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.280
it shouldn't be, okay?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.380
Well, what is it?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.510
It's a generalization of
the uniform distribution.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.350
So far, the only distribution
we know by name that is both

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.290
continuous and
bounded is the uniform, right?

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.710
The uniform,
let's say uniform from zero to one.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.919
Well, by definition it
goes from zero to one.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.520
And the PDF is just completely flat, okay?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.290
What if you want to generalize that and
other continuous distributions like

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.430
the normal goes from minus
infinity to infinity?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.680
Exponential goes from zero to infinity.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.800
What if we want something that's still
bounded between zero and one, but

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.540
is not just flat?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.209
Well, by far, the most widely used
distribution that meets those criteria is

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.130
called the beta distribution.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.560
And it's not one distribution
because it has parameters.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.621
So, it's a whole family of distributions,
which we call beta a, b.

00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:10.265
So it has two parameters,
a and b, where a and

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:16.795
b are any positive real numbers, Okay?

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:22.322
And, It takes values between 0 and

00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:25.077
1, as I said, and
let's write down the PDF.

00:03:25.077 --> 00:03:31.241
The PDF, Is

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:36.116
proportional to x to the a- 1,

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.726
1- x to the b- 1, for

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:45.582
x between 0 and 1, 0, otherwise.

00:03:45.582 --> 00:03:52.000
C is a constant, so
this is the normalizing constant, okay?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.480
So one question we'll have to deal with
is, can we actually integrate this thing,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.680
dx from 0 to 1, so we can figure out what
c has to be to make it integrate to 1?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.430
And that's a famous integral in math.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.830
That's called, if you integrate this,
that's called the beta function.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.310
And it has a long history in math

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.820
aside from its application in
probability in statistics.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.720
So we will talk about that integral at
some point, but there's actually a lot

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.860
that we can get from studying this without
even know what the constant is yet.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.068
So, now here are just some facts and
properties.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.500
We've been emphasizing stories, right?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.320
Why write this down unless
we have a story for it?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.850
The beta distribution actually has many
stories to it, and we're not gonna try to

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.130
do all of them today, but we'll see
more and more stories for the beta.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.775
But the most basic reason why betas are
interesting is just that it's a flexible

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:55.791
family of distributions,
Of continuous distributions on 0, 1.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.988
And by flexible,
I mean that as you vary a and b,

00:05:02.988 --> 00:05:08.231
you can make this take different shapes,
right?

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.821
So just for a couple quick examples,
if we let a = b = 1,

00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:15.515
then this whole thing goes away.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.260
We just have a constant, so
that's just the uniform distribution.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.050
So it is a generalization of the uniform.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.590
So the PDF would just look like that.

00:05:25.015 --> 00:05:30.022
But we could let a = 2 and
b = 1, for example,

00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:34.290
they don't have to be integers either.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.680
It can be any positive real numbers, okay?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.252
We could go, a = 2,
b = 1, this term is gone.

00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:45.408
Then we just have x, so we will just have
something that increases linearly up to 1.

00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:46.927
This is 1 here, right?

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.760
It would just increase linearly.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.420
And it's whatever makes the area of
this area of the triangle has to be 1,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.930
so figure out the slope.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.145
More interesting ones,
if a = one-half and b = on-half,

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:10.440
you get something that looks like
a U shape, kind of like this.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.055
Here's 1.

00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:17.990
And notice that if it's one-half,
that's x to the negative one-half.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.130
So as x approaches 0, it's gonna blow up.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.390
So this is going up to infinity over here.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.240
And as x goes to 1,
this term is gonna blow up.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.500
So it's asymptotic like that, so
you can get something like that.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.369
And if you let a = b = 2,

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:38.880
then you'll get something that is just
a nice looking upside down U shape.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.330
For example,
these are just a few examples.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.299
You can plug in other, but
that's why I say that it's flexible.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:47.350
That there isn't one shape that it takes,
and that makes it a useful modeling tool.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:56.490
So the main use of it is that it is often
used as a probability for probabilities.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.916
That is it's often used as a prior,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.483
For a parameter,
that takes values between 0 and 1.

00:07:08.483 --> 00:07:10.930
So this is going back to you
had some homework stuff.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.860
And we talked a little bit in class
about the Blitzstein approach

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.580
where we treat the parameters
as random variables.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.910
So if we have a parameter
that's a probability,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.400
we know it's between 0 and 1, and
we wanna to give it a prior distribution.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.820
The beta distribution is, by far,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.408
the most widely used choice in practice,
because it has a lot of nice properties.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:38.890
In particular, it's what's called
the conjugate prior to the binomial.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.326
If you take step 1, 11, you'll be
seeing a lot of conjugate priors.

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:50.410
Obviously, I'm not assuming you
know the term conjugate prior yet.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.644
I'll explain what this means.

00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:56.016
So this is foreshadowing 1,
11 in a sense, but it's also just a 1,

00:07:56.016 --> 00:08:00.990
10 calculation that you should be able
to do Once you know what conjugate prior

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.450
means, which I'll explain in a bit.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.400
Okay, and

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.190
then it also has various connections with
other distributions that we'll see later.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.030
So it's a very well
connected distribution.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.936
It has lots of nice properties and
relationships with other distributions and

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:19.244
it makes it a useful tool.

00:08:22.934 --> 00:08:27.175
Okay, so,
let me explain what this conjugate

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:30.890
prior thing means cuz I just wrote that.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.770
But, obviously you don't
know what that is and

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.820
almost you happen to
have seen that before.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.560
What we're gonna do is generalize
Laplace's rule of succession.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.858
So remember that was the problem with,

00:08:39.858 --> 00:08:43.330
what's the probability that the sun rises,
kind of thing.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.040
Where we assume complete ignorance on
the probability of the sun rising.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.252
Well that's what Laplace did, obviously it
doesn't have to be about the sun rising,

00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:52.420
we're actually not that ignorant.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.590
You have some problem where
we're completely ignorant and

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.480
we modeled that probability
using a uniformed prior, okay.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.020
So right now we want to
generalize that and say

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.140
what happens if instead of a uniform
prior, we have a beta, A-B prior?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.130
And we don't even know what
the normalizing constant is yet.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.830
But we don't actually need that for
this calculation, as you'll see.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.180
Okay, so here's the conjugate prior thing.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:24.930
And I'll explain the word conjugate
as this develops, for the binomial.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.530
So here's the basic problem
which will look familiar, but

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.590
we're generalizing, okay.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.090
So the problem is we
observe a binomial given p.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.657
X given p is binomial

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:50.270
Okay, that's our old friend the binomial.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.980
If we're treating p as this notation
means if we pretend that p is known,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.310
it's just our friend the binomial.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.010
But p itself Is unknown and

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.840
we're giving it a distribution
to reflect the uncertainty of p.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.770
So in practice, the most widely used
choice is some beta distribution.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.677
So we're gonna let p be Beta (ab).

00:10:13.723 --> 00:10:15.500
Okay, so that's called the prior.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.900
That is our reflection of
our uncertainty about p.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.920
That is we don't know
the true probability, so

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.010
we're just treating it
as a random variable.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.330
X is the data,
X is what we get to observe.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:36.160
Before we observe X, we have a prior on p,
that's our prior uncertainty.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.520
So this is not based on the data, okay.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.670
Then after we observe x then we
wanna update our probabilities,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.500
right, using Bayes' rule.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.240
So that's why this is
called Bayesian statistics,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.810
cuz we're updating our believes
based on getting the evidence.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.212
So we want to find
the posterior distribution.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.140
That is the distribution p given X.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.880
Now we get to know X,
and what's our update?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.520
Originally we have a Beta (a,b), and then
what happens after we're allowed to use X?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.210
So, how do we do this?

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:26.240
Well Bayes' rule, so this is one of these
hybrid forms of Bayes' rule, right.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.620
So ust to make the notation clearer,
I'm going to write this as F(p|X=k).

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.420
You can also write this with
a capital just the capital X

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.240
under the interpretation that it's just
short hand for something like this.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.880
That is, we get to treat X as known.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.540
Okay, so this means you know,
this is a posterior PDF.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.650
Right, p is continuous, so it has a PDF.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.410
So this is what the PDF
of p given that we got

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.520
to know now that X is in fact equal to k.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.690
Alright, so that is what that means.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:12:00.604
So by Bayes' rule,
that's the p(X=k|p) times f(p),

00:12:00.604 --> 00:12:06.440
that's the prior,
divided by the probability P(x=k).

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.540
Where in the denominator,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.728
you know, key distinction between
the numerator and denominator.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:18.140
Obviously you can't cancel these out,
this one is a function of P.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.130
This one is treating P as unknown.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.530
This one is saying, integrate over all P.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.950
So this one does not depend on P because

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.850
this is just going to be
a constant with respect to P.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.440
It will depend on k but it won't depend
on P because we've integrated out the P.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.391
So this one does not depend on P.

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:40.420
All right,
now let's just see what we have here.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.950
Probability of x equals k given P.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:50.740
That's easy, that's just n choose k,
p to the k, 1- p to the n- k.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.660
Now f of p, that's just the beta density.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.410
So that's a constant whatever
that constant c is over there.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.411
We don't know what c is,
but it wont matter.

00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:06.245
And p to the a- 1(1- p) b-1

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:11.956
divided by the probability that X = k.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.590
Now, seemingly to do and

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.130
probably X = k we would have to
use the law of total probability.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.900
That was, we integrate and condition on P.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.100
And we can do that, but
there's a much faster way to do this,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.040
which is just to look at the structure
of what we have, up to proportionality.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.780
Okay, so I'm just gonna write
the proportionality symbol,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.690
that is I'm gonna ignore constant.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.260
And by constant I mean something
that does not depend on p, okay.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.400
So let's ignore constant.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.750
So actually we can ignore the n choose k,
cuz there's no p there, we can ignore c,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.800
cuz there's no p there, and we can ignore
this thing, because there's no p there.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.850
So, all that's left is this p to
the power, 1 minus p to a power.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.489
So, we have p to the a + k- 1 (1- p),

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:07.376
just adding the exponents.

00:14:07.376 --> 00:14:11.860
(1-p)b p + n- k- 1, and

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.561
that immediately tells us the answer.

00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:20.370
So we didn't have to do any
complicated calculations at all

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.490
just group the ps together,
1-ps together ignore the constants.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.160
And then that immediately
tells us that p given x,

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.790
that's a beta distribution, right.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.160
It looks like a beta, there's some
constant in front but the constant is just

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.850
whatever constant is needed to
make this integrate to one, right.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.940
So its still of the form
of a beta distribution.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.930
So this is going to be
a beta with parameters.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.133
K got added, but if I write it this way,
I'm just going to write Beta

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:59.670
(a + X, b + n- X).

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.000
This is what the notion of
congregant prior means.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.420
The definition of congregant,
it's not just one prior,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.860
it's a family of priors, and
that family of priors is called conjugate.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.860
If we start with a member of the family,
so

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.740
we're looking at not just one beta
distribution, it's the family of all

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.770
beta distributions where you can
change the parameters around.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.810
We start with a beta distribution,
compute for the prior,

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:28.240
compute the posterior, it's still beta
where these are updated parameters.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.950
That's called the conjugate property,
so this is the conjugate prior for

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.530
the binomial.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.900
And this has a pretty intuitive
interpretation, that if we think

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.071
of X as the number of successes
and- X as the number of failures.

00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:48.200
The way you can remember this result and
understand it intuitively,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.930
is pretend that we had some prior data
that we might have done earlier experiment

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.554
were we had a successes and b failures and
then we're adding on now we have X.

00:15:58.554 --> 00:16:04.040
New successes, and
n- x new failures, okay?

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.870
So it stays in the family.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.630
That's computationally very, very, nice.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.379
But that doesn't mean it's true in any
sense and there are philosophical debates

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:15.460
about should you use conjugate priors and
things like that.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.690
Is that the correct way to correct
your uncertainty, things like that.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.650
But there's no denying that it's
convenient cuz you start with a beta you

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.430
still have a beta.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.100
You don't need to work out a whole
new theory of some new distribution.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.489
So it's very convenient in this sense,
very, very flexible.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.380
So this is a generalization of
the Laplace rule of succession.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.730
That was the case where we let this be
beta 1 1, which would be uniform, okay,

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.830
but the same thing works.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.350
So next time we'll derive the mean and
the variance of the beta,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.970
but you can already see that that's
going to be kind of nice too.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.960
Because, just stare at this density,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.410
I won't write it out now,
we'll do this next time.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.800
But just to have some intuition for what's
going to happen, look at this density.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.920
Suppose we wanted to compute
the expected value of x.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.260
Then we're just going to integrate
this thing with an x in front, right?

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.030
Just definition of expected value.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.740
So we could combine this x,
this x a- 1, we'd have x to the a.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.800
It looks like a beta again.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.800
So once we know the normalizing constant,
we can immediately write down the answer.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.440
What if you wanted the second moment,
which you would use to get the variance?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.350
Then by LOTUS you would be putting an x
squared in front to get the second moment.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.110
X squared x to the a -1 is x to the a + 1.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.500
It still looks like a beta.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.710
So once we know the normalizing constant,
we can immediately write down the answer.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.590
So it has very,
very nice properties in that sense.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.710
All right, so let's not, we're not gonna
do the full normalizing constant today.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.320
But I wanted to do one important special
case which is the case of how do you get

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.640
the normalizing constant
in the integer case, okay?

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.260
So a and
b don't have to be real numbers, but

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.610
let's assume that we
have integers up there.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.458
So another way to phrase that question is,
here's what we have to do,

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:13.710
we have to integrate.

00:18:16.183 --> 00:18:21.092
From 0 to 1, Of, let's say,

00:18:21.092 --> 00:18:26.127
I'll write it in a way that
looks a little more reminiscent

00:18:26.127 --> 00:18:30.264
of a binomial, but
it's the same basic thing.

00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:37.050
Xx to the n- k dx.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.720
I wanna do that integral.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.420
Now we have integers,
nonnegative integers up here, and

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.180
k is an integer between 0 and n.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.340
We wanna do this.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.340
Well, okay, so if I first gave
you this integral you might say,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.970
well use the binomial theorem,
expand this out.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.550
Multiply this whole thing out, integrate
every term, and then try to simplify and

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.040
it will be very tedious, okay?

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.950
So let me phrase this
question a different way.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.536
Find the integral of x to the k, (1-
x) to the n- k, without using calculus.

00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:21.096
So my favorite calculus problems are the
ones where you don't have to use calculus.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:30.900
And so, that sounds impossible.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.082
That's actually one of
Bayes' most brilliant ideas.

00:19:35.082 --> 00:19:38.030
Bayes' rule, itself, as we saw, you just
write down a definition of conditional

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.580
probability it's just like
one line you got Bayes' Rule.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:47.320
But Bayes also had an argument
around 1760 something,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.150
he did this integral
without using calculus.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.220
So I wanted to show you his argument
cuz it's very beautiful but

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.890
it also gives us the normalizing
constant for these integer cases, okay?

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:04.500
So what does it mean to do
it without using calculus?

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.611
Well, we're going to use a story.

00:20:08.699 --> 00:20:12.066
And that story is call Bayes Billiards.

00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:25.190
Okay so this becomes a little bit
nicer if I put an n to k here.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.690
I'm just multiplying by a constant.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.490
So we could always adjust for that later,
but this looks a little bit nicer.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.220
All right, so here is what Bayes did.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.417
He said, consider that we
have n + 1 billiard balls,

00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:43.441
that's like if you're playing pool.

00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:50.050
This is exactly Bayes' argument in 1760s.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:56.950
He said take n + 1 billiard balls and
then you can do one of two things.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.275
Originally they're all white and

00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:06.044
they all look the same and then we paint

00:21:06.044 --> 00:21:10.880
one of them Pink.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.530
So now at this point we have n white
balls and one pink ball, okay?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.765
That's something we could do,
and then throw down the balls,

00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:28.190
throw them on (0,1) independently.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:35.430
That is, we're just positioning them,
we have the number line from 0 to 1.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.660
Here's 0, here's 1.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.400
And just throwing all the balls down,
you get some arrangement here,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.580
some white balls here.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.950
And maybe the pink ball
has to land somewhere,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.340
maybe it's there this is just an example.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.095
So we have iid uniforms.

00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:58.019
Okay so that's the first story,
Here's an alternative.

00:22:00.863 --> 00:22:03.310
So here we painted the ball first.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.670
We painted one ball pink,
threw them all down.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.400
But another thing we could do is throw all
the balls down at the number line, and

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.000
then paint a random one pink.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.821
So first throw them paint.

00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:20.306
Then paint one pink.

00:22:23.803 --> 00:22:26.366
Okay now if I just
showed you this picture.

00:22:29.043 --> 00:22:33.895
And didn't tell you where that picture
came from you would have no idea whether

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:36.800
it came from this story or
this story, right?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.350
It's completely equivalent procedures, why
should it matter whether you painted it at

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.520
the beginning or the end,
it doesn't matter.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.640
The final configuration is gonna have
the same distribution, all right.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.810
So the key to the argument
is that these two

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.640
ways of generating a picture that looks
like this are completely equivalent.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:03.090
That's tells us the value if that
integral because now let's just

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:08.174
let x equal the number of balls
to the left of the pink one.

00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:17.990
Which I denote like that, okay, that's x.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.770
So in this picture, x equals three, for

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.370
example, just count how
many are to the left.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:29.169
That's going to be some integer
between zero and n, all right?

00:23:29.169 --> 00:23:32.790
Now, according to this first story it

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.690
doesn't matter what order
we throw the balls in.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.810
So we may as well throw the pink one
first, then condition on where that is.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.187
And so we want an expression for
the probability that x = k.

00:23:44.187 --> 00:23:49.300
That is, there are exactly k white
balls to the left of the pink ball.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.980
So by the law of total probability,
we should just integrate.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.835
Probability that x equals k, given p f
of p dp where this is just representing

00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:05.350
where p for pink and p for
probability, where is the pink ball?

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:10.570
And so that's something we
can write down easily because

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.760
f of p is just 1, because we're
assuming it's uniform between 0 and 1.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.490
Probably x equals k given p.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.090
That's just a binomial because we define
success for the light balls; success

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.430
is defined as being to the left of the
pink ball, failure is being to the right.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.350
So we just want to count
the number of successes.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.787
That's simply a binomial and

00:24:32.787 --> 00:24:37.882
choose P to the k 1minus
p to the n minus k dp.

00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:40.484
Notice that's the exact
same integral we had.

00:24:40.484 --> 00:24:44.665
We changed the dummy variable, x to p.

00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:47.140
On the other hand,
we're running out of space here.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.560
But, on the other hand we can
just write down the answer,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.190
because from this second story,
this is story one, this is story two.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:01.560
Story two I first threw the balls down,
paint a random one pink equally likely.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.890
So it's equally likely that there's any
valid number of white balls still left

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.300
the pink one anywhere.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.510
So all numbers from zero to n
integers are equally likely, so

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.000
it must be one over n plus one.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.030
So that integral is just
one over N plus one.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.230
And you can write that down just by
looking at the picture without actually

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.210
doing integration by parts.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.960
Or expanding things out term
by term all that stuff.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:34.450
So that argument gives us the normalizing
constant for some cases of the beta.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.370
Next time we'll do the general normalizing
constants see some of the connections to

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.110
other distributions.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.970
We have one other very scary thing for
today which is finance.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:53.123
We have a special guest today Steven
[INAUDIBLE] who teaches STAT 123,

00:25:53.123 --> 00:25:55.765
just to briefly introduce him.

00:25:55.765 --> 00:26:00.738
123 has gotten better reviews from people
who've talked to me about than almost any

00:26:00.738 --> 00:26:02.381
other course I can think of.

00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:06.911
A lot of students who told me that when
they went and did finance internships,

00:26:06.911 --> 00:26:11.859
they felt way better prepared than their
fellow interns because of having had 110

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:12.640
and 123.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.390
As kind of a unique,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.610
just to tell you very briefly a little
bit about Steven's background.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.710
He got his PhD from
the stat department here,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:28.060
so that's a proud claim to fame for
our department.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.570
He then taught at Imperial College,
London.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.670
He has many years of experience
working on Wall Street.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.870
And now he's Managing Director at
the Harvard Management Company,

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.360
which is responsible for managing a large
portion of the Harvard Endowment.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.200
I think it's definitely
true that at Harvard,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.520
you will not find anyone else with
the same combinations both of

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.120
practical experiences as
well as academic training.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.020
Just combining actually
been on Wall Street for

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.230
years as well as having
a PhD in statistics.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.290
You won't find that in
any other Harvard course.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.030
I don't actually think you'll find that in
any other course in the entire country.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.810
So we're lucky to have that course,
STAT 123.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.390
Which is not offered this spring,
but it will be offered next year.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:18.590
And so, Steven didn't wanna miss out
on your group, so, take it away.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.045
Let's all welcome him, and
let me give you the microphone.

00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:26.352
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:27:30.694 --> 00:27:34.350
&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you to Joe.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.550
And thank you all for giving me 20,
25 minutes of your time.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.270
It's always a pleasure
to talk to Stat 110.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.620
I'm here for
a couple of reasons really, firstly

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.950
STAT 123 that Joe mentioned is
a reasonably new course here at Harvard.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.880
I'll giving it for
the third time in 2012, 13.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.330
So wanted to give you a little
bit of flavor of what it's about.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:06.940
But secondly, STAT 123 has one
prerequisite, which is STAT 110.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.090
So you all here are my eligible
receivers so to speak, or

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:17.020
eligible to take the course, and I wanted
to give you a little bit of its flavor.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.550
I apologize for the seniors in the class,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.280
if there are any that won't be
able to take the course, but

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.250
I hope the next 20 minutes might even for
them be intellectually appealing.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.860
There are gonna be a couple of brain
teasers that might make you think a little

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.938
bit about probability and
its relationship with the financial world.

00:28:34.938 --> 00:28:40.780
Probability is, to borrow a phrase,
the soul of finance.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:47.561
It's the theory that underpins
most of quantitative finance and

00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:52.991
hopefully I will show a little
bit about that today.

00:28:52.991 --> 00:28:57.485
So for those of you who enjoy this
course and want to see what I think

00:28:57.485 --> 00:29:01.180
is an intellectually
appealing use of probability.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.890
Which is also very real world oriented.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.460
That is what STAT123 is about.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.410
Just one further word on prerequisites.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.020
STAT 110 is the only prerequisite.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.340
You don't need to know anything
about finance to take STAT 123.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.390
The whole of [INAUDIBLE]
finance was essentially built

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.090
by people who knew nothing about finance,
and still don't really.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.330
It was built by a pro-bliss mathematicians
and statisticians and physicists.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.520
A lot of physicists who moved to finance
when the original super collider got

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.770
cancelled in 1993 and
they all went to Wall Street and

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.120
built quantitative finance.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.750
So you don't really need to
know anything about finance.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:43.810
Obviously if you're interested in a
financial career it may be appealing, but

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.010
many students flourish in STAT 123 without
any interest in a financial career.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.230
So I've had people who wanted to go to
Julliard or play professional soccer,

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.260
but are just interested in some
ways a new way of thinking,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.250
a new way of reasoning about uncertainty
which uses probability to a great degree.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.210
If finance, you have a visceral dislike
to finance, that's totally fine.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.120
But probably is not worth taking
STAT 123 if that's the case.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.290
I do get a couple of comments about STAT
123, finance is all about making money.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.880
I don't want that to be, of course.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.541
That's what finance is about
[LAUGH] it's about making money and

00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:19.390
the financial world.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.316
So if that's got a visceral
dislike I wish I,

00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:25.323
totally empathize with, perhaps not taken.

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:30.045
So let me tell you a little
bit about the course.

00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:34.590
Let's write this down.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:42.645
Applied Quantitative Finance
on Wall Street.

00:30:42.645 --> 00:30:48.490
I'm thinking about dropping
Wall Street for 2012, 2013.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:54.880
A natural subtitle
actually to this course.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.100
So there are many pejorative
words in this title, but

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:06.954
a natural subtitle is applied
Financial Derivatives.

00:31:06.954 --> 00:31:12.340
This course is very
much about derivatives.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.650
So two natural questions might
what is a financial derivative and

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.120
why is this a probability course.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.000
Why is this a stat course?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.810
So those are two natural questions
Hopefully you can answer them together.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.350
So a financial derivative has
nothing to do with calculus.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.490
Or at least its definition has
nothing to do with calculus.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:34.100
There's some calculus involved in
thinking about and valuing derivatives.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.770
A financial derivative,
the term derivative means derives from.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.740
So a financial derivative is a contract so
it's a bet, an agreement,

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:49.820
between two people whose payout at
some maturity date is a function of,

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.980
or derives from,
the value of some other Random variable.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.580
So for instance,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.560
if I enter into a contract with Professor
Blitzstein where he pays me $1 if

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.130
the total snowfall in Boston is
above 80 inches this winter, okay?

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.060
That is a weather derivative, right?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.400
The $1 is a function of
some other random variable,

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.860
in this case the number of
inches of snow in Boston.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.352
That's simply what a derivative is.

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.070
In financial, usually means
the underlying random variable

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.790
that the payoff is a function of,
is a financial asset.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.246
It's the price of a financial asset.

00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:31.550
And typically written s.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.455
So in finance,
random variables are s rather than x.

00:32:34.455 --> 00:32:36.080
Okay, cuz s for stock.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.700
So if you think s sub t is just the price
of, say, Google stock in one year,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.400
that is a random variable, okay?

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.290
We don't know what it is, it'll take
potential values in a year's time, okay?

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.840
And a financial derivative is
simply something that pays off

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.694
a function of that.

00:32:53.397 --> 00:32:54.383
Okay?

00:32:54.383 --> 00:33:00.140
For instance, g of s might be
the indicator function above 500.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.433
So Google is above $500 in a year's time,
you pay $1, or

00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:07.189
you get $1 from your contract, okay?

00:33:07.189 --> 00:33:11.130
You might, well,
who cares about contracts like this?

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.910
And we'll see particular forms of g,
so a little later.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.730
Well, g of s, right?

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.300
A function of a random variable
is another random variable, okay?

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:24.000
So we're gonna get caught up in,
or use random variables,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.650
and it turns out, and
this is one of the key results in finance,

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:32.310
it's called the fundamental theorem of
finance, because it's so fundamental,

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.230
is the price that you would pay for
a derivative contract.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.170
So even just think about
this whether contract.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.071
How much would you pay for that?

00:33:41.071 --> 00:33:46.723
Well, it'd be related to the probability
of getting more than 80 inches of snow,

00:33:46.723 --> 00:33:47.290
right?

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.500
Can be related to the distribution
as a random variable.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.390
And it turns out, what you'd actually
pay for the contract is very,

00:33:53.390 --> 00:34:00.028
very closely related to
the expected value of g of s, okay?

00:34:00.028 --> 00:34:03.800
All right, in fact,
there's a very powerful

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.850
result that says if I choose
the random variable correctly and

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.880
choose the distribution correctly,
it is exactly an expected value.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.690
So expectation is gonna be
run throughout Stat 123, but

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.746
you know how to do this
if you know the PDF of S,

00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:24.740
this is just what I like to call POTUS,
I mean LOTUS, right?

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.908
I always get those confused, but

00:34:27.908 --> 00:34:32.443
it's just the integral of g of s f of SDS,
okay?

00:34:32.443 --> 00:34:40.542
All right, so LOTUS is gonna play a major
part in quantitative finance, okay?

00:34:43.717 --> 00:34:49.420
Okay, That's not all there is to finance,
but that's pretty much.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.850
When I arrived on Wall Street after, I
actually TF'd STAT110 here many years ago.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.040
I loved it.
It was about 25 people in the class then,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.260
so it was easier to TF.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:00.930
Was a great class.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.900
I arrived on Wall Street.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.280
And the first day I was on Wall Street,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.350
I was asked to calculate
the expected value of a function.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.460
It was a bivariant normal.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.950
It was a function of bivariant normal, and

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.520
they thought it was
an incredibly hard problem.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.990
It's not trivial, but I thought,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.490
I can do that, because I knew how
to calculate expected values.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.630
I did that my first morning.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.170
And they thought, wow, this guy's really
good, he knows all about finance.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.564
But all I knew about it
was bivariant LOTUS.

00:35:26.564 --> 00:35:31.268
And that, that stood me in good stead for
the rest of my career.

00:35:31.268 --> 00:35:37.480
So, all right, here are a couple of,
I won't call these brain teasers,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:42.280
cuz these actually, these examples
are also interwoven with Stat 123.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.430
So I hope if you take them,
this lecture will echo back and

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.090
you'll think, yeah,
I remember that teaser.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.890
If you have any questions about
the course, before I get on to these,

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:58.210
please feel free to e-mail me and
belie that stat.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.580
And two of your TFs in this class, Bo and

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.040
Jessie, have either taken the class or
TF-ed it or both.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.120
So feel free to ask them about it.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.130
Obviously, I've chosen them
cuz they enjoyed it a lot.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.400
Okay, so here is a couple of,
here are a couple of brain teasers.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.100
First one comes from foreign exchange.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.470
So foreign exchange is a fairly
straightforward concept.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.500
So how much is a Euro worth in dollars,
right?

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.700
So one Euro trades in Europe
is worth about $1.40 now.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.390
That moves up up and
down its sort of a spastic process.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:35.310
And one pound which is close to my
heart that's worth about $1.60.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.170
These are things that people care about.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.950
Obviously, if you're doing traveling or
if you're doing trade.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.320
And one thing you might care about
is where are these things gonna

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.080
be in a year's time, all right?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.060
How can I predict where, what the value
of, say, a Euro would be in a year's time?

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.350
Okay, it's obviously of
interest in the economy.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.088
You might think if you could
actually do that prediction,

00:36:56.088 --> 00:37:01.790
if that prediction was actually possible,
then the person who could do that would be

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:06.100
phenomenally rich and would be infinitely
wealthy and would have retired, right?

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.953
So you might want to think it is
probably impossible to predict?

00:37:09.953 --> 00:37:11.510
But anyway, so people try to, right?

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.870
And you can do it in
lots of different ways.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.630
Build time series models,
you can think about economies.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.930
But one thing you can do is just build
a little probabilistic model, and

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.530
that's what we're gonna do here.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.000
Very straightforward one,
which takes two states of the world.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.090
It's called a binomial model,
with two states of the world.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:32.019
And so let's start off with,
so this is Foreign Exchange,

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:35.874
known as FX in the business
foreign exchange.

00:37:35.874 --> 00:37:39.030
We're gonna take a very simple world.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:45.286
We're gonna say where, we're gonna
think about the value of 1 Euro, okay?

00:37:45.286 --> 00:37:49.871
Okay, let's assume that
right now it's worth $1, so

00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:54.840
the price of 1 Euro is $1,
just to make the math easy.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.686
So currently, there's $1.

00:37:56.686 --> 00:37:58.572
Let's write that down here.

00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:01.068
Per euro.

00:38:02.255 --> 00:38:04.990
Okay, the actual number is about 140 for
those here.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.600
And I'm gonna say where do
you think we think that is?

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.420
Where do we expect this
to be in a year's time?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.050
Okay, and we're gonna build a very
simple probabilistic model.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.460
We're gonna say there
are two possible outcomes.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.890
The sample space in a year's
time has two states.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.558
One where the euro becomes worth more.

00:38:30.498 --> 00:38:34.490
Okay, so let's just say it's gone, it's
not worth $1.25, so Euro's worth more.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:35.684
And one where it's worth less.

00:38:38.363 --> 00:38:41.627
Let's say $0.80.

00:38:41.627 --> 00:38:45.386
Okay, that's my, that's a random variable.

00:38:45.386 --> 00:38:46.470
It's got two states of the world.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:48.010
I'm actually gonna assign
probabilities to it.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.711
Let's make it easy,
just say half and half.

00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:55.547
All right, okay, there's a pretty
straightforward model, don't you think?

00:38:55.547 --> 00:38:57.718
Might go up, might go down.

00:38:57.718 --> 00:38:58.560
Okay, all right,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.230
now we've gotta ask the question where
do we expect it to be in a years time?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.730
Well, we can do expected value,
expectation very easily.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.380
So the expected value of
a Euro in a year's time,

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.577
which I'll just write
expected value of Euro.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.583
Right, so half times $1.25 plus
a half times $0.80 cents, okay?

00:39:18.583 --> 00:39:20.343
So that's easy.

00:39:20.343 --> 00:39:25.620
That's $1.025.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.370
So this is where I expect
the Euro to be in a year's time.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:33.880
It will have appreciated on
average to a $1.025, all right?

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.450
Okay, so
that's pretty straightforward expectation.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.476
Okay, so that's what we expect for
the Euro, okay?

00:39:41.476 --> 00:39:45.552
So, well,
know what $1.00 must be worth, right?

00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:49.620
So $1.00 must be worth 1 over that, right?

00:39:51.812 --> 00:39:55.660
Which if you do, that is 0.9756.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.410
Right?

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.934
Okay, so
that's straightforward also, right?

00:39:59.934 --> 00:40:06.913
If a pound is worth $2, $1 is worth 50p,
pence, okay, that's true.

00:40:06.913 --> 00:40:11.610
Right, so if a euro is worth a $1.025,

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.578
$1 is worth 0.975 euro cents.

00:40:15.578 --> 00:40:17.230
They're called euro cents also.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.960
All right, so
that's a foreign exchange prediction,

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.638
that seems pretty straightforward,
so we're done.

00:40:22.638 --> 00:40:29.630
But before we move on,
let me just restate this model, all right?

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.950
Well, pink chalk would be
good at this stage, I think.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.500
I haven't had pink chalk before,
let's see if we can use this pink chalk.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.030
Let's just restate the model.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:44.180
Well, $1 per euro,
that's the same as one euro per dollar.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.050
So let's just restate this model in terms
of the value of a dollar at each state.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:54.510
So this is 1 euro per dollar, okay?

00:40:54.510 --> 00:41:01.290
Up here, well it's $1.25 per euro,
well that's 80 euro cents per dollar.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.820
Okay, and then this one is 1 euro and
25 euro cents per dollar.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.880
Okay, same model, right?

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.230
Haven't done anything tricky.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.480
All right, now what do we expect?

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.710
Let's just calculate the expected
value of a dollar onto this model.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.648
Well, the states are still a half, so

00:41:22.648 --> 00:41:27.211
just calculate that, that's easy, and.

00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:34.976
Hang on a sec, I've predicted
the dollar to be worth more now.

00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:38.802
$1 is now expected to be 1 euro 2 and
a half.

00:41:38.802 --> 00:41:43.863
And so, you're just walking into your
boss's office and say, I've got this

00:41:43.863 --> 00:41:48.862
good model that predicts that the euro
is gonna depreciate to $1.025.

00:41:48.862 --> 00:41:52.359
And, but, hang on a sec,
the model also says,

00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:56.300
the dollar will appreciate to 1 euro,
2 and a half.

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.450
So if you did that, of course,
the dollar will appreciate and

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.550
the euro will appreciate.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.591
You'd guess the response is you're fired.

00:42:04.591 --> 00:42:10.873
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now, how do we solve this?

00:42:13.156 --> 00:42:14.909
All right, that's the first one.

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:23.223
Simplest probabilistic model you could
ever have, right, a binomial state.

00:42:23.223 --> 00:42:27.986
And we've already come across
our first brain teaser.

00:42:27.986 --> 00:42:32.733
And what's actually probably more
intellectually, troubling exactly, I found

00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:37.680
intellectually compelling than that, it's
very simple, is that the solving this,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.311
actually understanding what's going on
here is actually quite non-trivial.

00:42:42.311 --> 00:42:45.810
And there we attack it two or
three ways in STAT123.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.920
So, that's the first one.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.460
Okay, so second one is TARP.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.680
So this is, well,
I said this course is applicable.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.110
Hopefully, this just gives some flavor of
how this course is applicable about what

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.340
really goes on in the financial world and
whether you're interested in it or

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.880
not, it certainly is an important
part of the US and the world.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:16.560
So TARP, back in 2008, for the seniors of
you who arrived here in September 2008,

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.637
October 2008,
you know that was not a happy time for

00:43:20.637 --> 00:43:26.134
the financial system or banks, or
the Harvard endowment for that matter.

00:43:26.134 --> 00:43:30.457
So obviously,
a lot of things were going on in 2008.

00:43:30.457 --> 00:43:34.434
And there's a great Econ course
called The Financial Crisis,

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:38.100
which I recommend to those
of you interested in that.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.060
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna focus in on one

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.035
particular part of the financial crisis
that was going on in October 2008.

00:43:46.035 --> 00:43:46.890
Now this was called TARP.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.360
TARP initially stood for
Troubled Asset Release Program.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.565
In this midst of all
this financial crisis,

00:43:52.565 --> 00:43:56.202
there was a transaction where
the US government, i.e., taxpayers,

00:43:56.202 --> 00:43:59.200
receive from these private
institution warrants, okay?

00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:08.276
Okay, now warrants has nothing to do
with being arrested or the legal system.

00:44:08.276 --> 00:44:13.680
A warrant is a type of financial
derivative, okay, called a call option.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.384
So this is their equivalent to
what's called a call option, which.

00:44:19.945 --> 00:44:24.930
Okay, and what a call option was or
is, is the following.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:29.840
So let me just write down what
the government actually had.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.329
So the US government.

00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:34.751
Paid.

00:44:36.518 --> 00:44:40.485
I've rounded the numbers,
but $450 million.

00:44:43.292 --> 00:44:45.960
To Goldman Sachs, GS.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:51.227
And in return, okay,
US government had the right,

00:44:51.227 --> 00:44:56.508
the right is not the obligation,
it's the choice.

00:44:56.508 --> 00:45:02.681
It's the option,
to buy Goldman Sachs shares.

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:07.008
$425.

00:45:08.644 --> 00:45:10.098
In 10 years time.

00:45:14.618 --> 00:45:17.397
Okay, simple as that.

00:45:17.397 --> 00:45:23.418
Okay, they paid and they had
the right to buy, it was 10 million.

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:32.949
So they had the right to buy it for
$125 each, okay?

00:45:32.949 --> 00:45:36.836
At the time, so this was in October 2008.

00:45:38.658 --> 00:45:41.019
Goldman Sachs' shares were trading.

00:45:44.015 --> 00:45:46.948
Were $95.

00:45:48.427 --> 00:45:54.168
Okay, all right, so you might ask,
well, what was the government

00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:59.106
doing paying all that money to
buy Goldman Sachs shares for

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:05.887
$125 when they could have just gone
out and bought them for $95, right?

00:46:05.887 --> 00:46:12.873
Okay, well, let's just think what
the government has in 10 years time, so.

00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:23.410
Okay, if Goldman Sachs' shares,
in ten years time, are at $150.

00:46:25.978 --> 00:46:33.064
What's the value of one of these warrants,
one of these options to the US?

00:46:33.064 --> 00:46:35.071
$25, right?

00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:40.480
Okay, cuz I can buy something that's
worth $150 by paying $125 for it, so.

00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:48.442
Okay, if Goldman Sachs is trading at $100.

00:46:51.106 --> 00:46:52.963
What's the option worth?

00:46:52.963 --> 00:46:54.264
0, right?

00:46:56.201 --> 00:47:00.530
Okay, so
we can begin to see this function,

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:05.210
this g function taking shape for
this warrant,

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:10.251
which is same as a call option,
just terminology.

00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:15.114
All right, this g function.

00:47:16.873 --> 00:47:23.011
Is max of the share price at maturity T.

00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:25.574
Here, T is ten years.

00:47:25.574 --> 00:47:31.913
And what we'll call K,
K is, in this case, $125.

00:47:31.913 --> 00:47:35.344
And K is called the strike price, okay?

00:47:35.344 --> 00:47:37.939
And 0, all right?

00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:44.459
So here is a particular form of g, okay?

00:47:44.459 --> 00:47:47.257
The payout looks like this.

00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:53.357
So this is g(s).

00:47:55.857 --> 00:48:02.309
Okay, so if I know the distribution,
the PDF of S in 10 years time,

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:06.595
I know the price of this warrant,
all right?

00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:11.210
So the warrant, the price,
my board management not very good, is.

00:48:24.353 --> 00:48:26.734
Just a LOTUS, okay?

00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:33.217
So two things to point out,
one is the government

00:48:33.217 --> 00:48:37.624
decided that the cost of
one of these options,

00:48:37.624 --> 00:48:41.600
if you work it out, is $45 per option.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.640
Where did that come from?

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.700
Is the US government in
the business of calculating

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.390
probability distribution,
probability density functions?

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.830
Right, so that's one question
which we'll talk about in 123.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.647
The other thing just to note
is the solution to this.

00:48:59.647 --> 00:49:01.776
It's just a LOTUS, right?

00:49:01.776 --> 00:49:06.727
If you think about it, it's actually not
that tricky cuz you can just replace the.

00:49:10.546 --> 00:49:13.610
Limits of integration,
get rid of your max, right?

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.760
Okay, such a fairly
straightforward integral.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.958
The solution of that integral under
particular form for the probability

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:27.853
density function is a very famous formula,
the Black-Scholes formula, okay?

00:49:27.853 --> 00:49:32.341
So I like to think that you
can get a Nobel Prize in

00:49:32.341 --> 00:49:35.718
economics just for knowing LOTUS.

00:49:35.718 --> 00:49:38.510
Because that's what
the Black-Scholes formula is, okay?

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.762
So thank you for your time,
appreciate you coming here.

00:49:41.762 --> 00:49:46.050
[APPLAUSE] And I hope to see you,
I hope to see some of you next year.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.000
Thank you.
