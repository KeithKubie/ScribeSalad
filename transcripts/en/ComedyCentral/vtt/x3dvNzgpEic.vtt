00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.768
We've got new details out

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.437
about the recent G7 meeting
in Canada,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.306
when our so-called "allies"
tried to bully Trump

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.509
into signing
the summit communiquÃ©,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.379
which is French
for "dumb letter."

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:14.580
Check it.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.050
Trump was sitting there
with his arms crossed.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.718
He said, okay, he'll sign it.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.453
And at that point, he stood up,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.321
uh, he put his hand
in his pocket--

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.523
his suit jacket pocket--

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.792
and he took
two Starburst candies out,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.393
threw them on the table,

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.929
and said to Merkel,
uh, "Here, Angela,

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.131
don't say
I never give you anything."

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.000
(chuckles):
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.469
You just got candy burnt,
Merkel.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.404
This is why Trump's
a strong leader.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.540
He's got brains, balls,

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.209
and a jacket full of candy.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.545
Nothing weird about an old man
walking around,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.547
handing out candy.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.484
I imagine how happy the PR team
over at Starburst is right now,

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.821
frantically calling
the Tic Tac people on the phone

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:58.424
and screaming, "What the (bleep)
do we do now?!"

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.426
Which reminds me, libs,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.762
you say
Trump doesn't respect women.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.765
What do you call giving the most
powerful woman in the world

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:08.634
two warm pocket Starbursts?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.169
That's respect.

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.305
And, sure,
it was the yellow ones,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.974
but the flavors
of Starburst Superfruit

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.643
pack a super intense,
bodacious punch.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.312
(chuckles)

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.514
(bell ringing)

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.449
Tim Baltz, I turn to you!

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.118
(cheering and applause)

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.719
How boss

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.789
was Trump's
Starburst power play?

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.725
Jordan, I know this seems like
the funniest thing to happen

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.728
at a G7 meeting
since Silvio Berlusconi

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.331
Smirnoff Iced Tony Blair.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.932 line:0%
But I am not laughing.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.601 line:0%
Because this proves once again

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.936 line:0%
that America
is the world's candy man.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.605 line:0%
Everybody's just dying to get

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.107 line:0%
on America's sweet,
sweet candy teat.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.377
Well, here you go,
you globalist parasites.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.380
Take our candy,
'cause we're the candy man!

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.983
All they do is take, take, take!

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.252
First, you're giving Starbursts
to the Germans.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.821
Then, the next thing you know,
you're throwing Necco Wafers

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.422
at all the Canadians!

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.224
Almond Joy at the Frenchies!

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:07.894
And pretty soon,
you're delicately placing

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.631
soggy Junior Mints into
the mouth of every Irishman,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.301
your fingers touching
their thin, wet lips

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.638
and thick, dry tongues.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.440
-So much grosser
than I thought it'd be. -Yeah.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:22.909
Exactly, Jordan.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.777
My fingers are wet
from your mouth.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.847
But that's life when you're
the world's candy man.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.515
People always ringing
my doorbell,

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:30.917
thrusting a bag in my face,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.185
demanding a treat.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.720
Children, even.
I'd say mostly children.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.256
And they're always dressed up
as my favorite movie characters,

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.592
like Batman or Moana. Why?

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.795
Because they're too afraid
to confront the candy man.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:45.798
Well, here's your candy,
you grubby little Spider-Men!

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.134
T-Tim, I think
you're talking about Halloween.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.804
Well, every day's Halloween
when you're the candy man!

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.806
People just want
to suck you dry!

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.642
Oh, oh, Daddy Landlord
wants his rent check.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:59.045
Sorry! I only pay in candy!

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.514
Great, the IRS wants back taxes.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:05.117
Fine! Fund your abortions
with my candy!

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.653
Meanwhile, the scrooges down
at the candy store are all,

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.655
"You can't pay for candy
with more candy."

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.991
Oh, yeah?! Watch me, candy man!

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:15.061
'Cause you're dealing
with the candy man!

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.663
Where did you get
all that candy?!

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.466
A candy truck tipped over
in front of my house.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.135
Christmas for the candy man!

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:25.338
Which, uh, by the way,
Jordan, reminds me...

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.673
(chuckles)
don't say I, uh,

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.875
never gave you anything.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:32.045
Tim Baltz, the candy man.
