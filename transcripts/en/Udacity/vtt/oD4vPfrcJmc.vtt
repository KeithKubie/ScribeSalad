00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So with a small modification of the people at the party,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
our median shifted from 4 to 32.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's kind of odd.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The mode is the age that's most frequently represented at the party.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We already encountered modes when we looked at bar charts

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and talked about this a little bit to find the most frequent bar.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here, because our ages are discrete,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you can give me the most frequent age at this party.
