00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.940
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez:
Hello everyone.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.720
Can you hear me?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.790
So, we're going to start
the last session a few

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.910
minutes early.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.570
Maybe we'll get out of
here a few minutes early.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.630
We'll see.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.550
So, welcome to the
concluding session called

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.440
"Where do We Go from Here?"

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.710
I'm Katie Alvarez.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.810
I'm an attorney with the
Copyright Office, and --

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.930
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: I'm
Matthew Barblan, the Director

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.210
for the Center for
the Protection

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.740
of Intellectual Property
at Mason Law.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.020
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez: And
so, as you can see,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.630
this panel is a little
different.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.370
We're the two moderators and
you guys are all the panelists.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.790
So, Register Pallante
had mentioned earlier

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.080
that moral rights aren't
really talked about that much

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.310
in the United States and
that today's symposium is the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.810
starting point of
that conversation.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.640
So, now that you've
had a whole eight hours

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.630
to digest everything, we
want to turn it over to you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.980
and hear what you think.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.010
So, what's next for
moral rights?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.620
Kind of some questions that
I had come up with: So,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.420
is the status quo good enough?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.240
Do we need some changes?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.040
Is that change legislative?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.990
Is there room for any voluntary
or non-legislative initiatives?

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.630
Also, are there any
issues that came up today

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.770
that are especially important
to you or issues that came

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.860
up that sort of raised
more questions

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.160
since we covered a lot?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.960
So, then to start off this
conversation, Matt is going

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.660
to go through a few highlights
from today's symposium.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Yeah.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.630
So, before we open up
the open mic session,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.400
I think it's helpful just to go
over a couple of the highlights,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.210
some of the things
that stuck with me

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
from today's session just
to jog people's memories

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.720
and to give you some
ideas for comments

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.330
and for your thoughts
on these issues.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.750
So before I start that, I just
want to say that, you know,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.600
the things that I mention
are neither exhaustive nor

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.750
particularly well curated.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.610
They just happen to be the
things that stuck out to me,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.560
and I hope that talking
through some of the comments

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.580
that were made and the ideas
that were raised will help all

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.220
of you think of your comments

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.560
for what we should do
going forward or, you know,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.470
any thoughts or complaints about
things that were said today and,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.530
of course, your helpful advice

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.350
about what the Copyright
Office should do

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.820
in the moral rights space.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.250
So, we heard from a wide
variety of viewpoints today.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.920
We kicked it off early on.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.340
We heard that moral rights
are like the Zika virus.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.840
Ideally we would eradicate them
completely but, at a minimum,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.470
we should keep them
outside the U.S. [laughter].

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.950
We also heard about some of
the philosophical difficulties

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.730
of wedging moral rights into
the United States' dynamic view

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.600
of property that has
historically favored

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.080
unencumbered and freely
alienable economic rights

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.380
but about how despite
that difficulty,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.120
there still is a space for
moral rights in American law.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.760
We heard from artists
about the difficulty

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.440
in separating the
economic from the moral.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.290
Attribution can be key to the
development of an artist's brand

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.830
and it's something that can help
artists put food on the table,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.600
and a great example
to take away there is

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.600
that if you write a song
about getting stoned,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.630
you don't want people to think

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.670
that it was a Tom Petty
song about getting stoned.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.050
We heard about how we
might convince France

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.880
to bring a WTO action against
the U.S. for failure to comply

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.340
with Berne's Article
10, permission to quote.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.730
We learned about the maximal
monkey agency approach

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.700
to authorship and how if we
are going to have a right

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.570
of attribution, the importance
of having a solid understanding

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.000
of who the author really is and
who we're going to attribute to.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.140
We talked about how the Dastar
case took away an already barely

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.200
plausible argument we had
that we were in compliance

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.180
with Berne's moral
rights requirements,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.070
and we discussed whether
acknowledging moral rights would

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.820
break the internet, and kind

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.530
of the take-away there
was David Lowery's quote:

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.480
"If the internet is the
most amazing thing ever,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.840
it should be able to withstand
artists asserting their

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.680
moral rights."

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.950
We talked about the
connection between moral rights

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.040
and the incentive not just
to create copyrighted works,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.670
but also the incentive
to publish

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.840
and disseminate those works

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.190
so that other people
can have access to them,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.490
whether for free or by paying.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.550
We talked about, you
know, things that can step

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.320
in to fulfill the role of
moral rights in the absence

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.510
of an actual moral
rights regime --

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.240
things like collective
bargaining and contract law.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.980
And then the last thing I'll
leave you with before we open

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.040
up the floor to comments
and thoughts is we learned

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.750
about why the most common artist

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.380
on Sirius radio is
various artists

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.100
and how a robust moral rights
regime could change that.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.510
So, with those thoughts
in your mind,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.990
we'd love to just get ideas from
people in the audience about,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.230
you know, steps that
can be taken,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.590
avenues that could
be researched,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.610
or things that the Copyright
Office could do to, you know,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.110
delve deeper into the
moral rights space.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.170
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez: And also
I know we didn't have a lot

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.020
of room for questions

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.560
and answers during
the other sessions.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.040
So, if someone has something
that they wanted to bring

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.370
up earlier and didn't get a
chance, now is your chance.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.080
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: And
if nobody has thoughts,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.350
I'm happy to call on
people [laughter].

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.580
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female
Speaker: Hi.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.990
So, I kind of come from the
perspective of the artist

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.850
and talking to artists

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.580
about what they know
about their rights.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.500
And what's interesting to me
and kind of stuck out to me was

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.900
when Professor Ginsburg
said that most people think

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.440
that they have the
right of attribution

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.450
when they really don't.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.010
I would say that most artists --
they get told, "Oh I don't have

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.900
to respect your copyrights
because I gave you attribution."

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.560
And so artists are
extremely confused.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.040
They think, "Oh, do they just
need to give me attribution

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.070
or do I still have a
right if they use my image

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.630
in a way I didn't
want to use it" --

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.360
which says to me that there
is a big need for education

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.070
in this field as well.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.920
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Yeah,
I think that's right.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.430
I think education is
key, and the confusion

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.810
that can easily develop
among the people that stand

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.250
to benefit both from copyright

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.090
and from moral rights is
something that persists;

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.080
and at a minimum, even if we're
not going to make any changes

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.320
to the law, it's helpful

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.340
if people understand what
their actual rights are.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.840
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Alright.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.250
Sandra?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.370
&gt;&gt; Sandra Aistars: So, I thought
I'd maybe make a quick comment

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.770
about one theme that
has kept coming up

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.600
and that is what's the public's
benefit from moral rights?

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.160
And as I listened to
people answer the question

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
over the course of the day, a
couple of thoughts came to mind.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.030
First, I think if you think

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.870
about what the public's
benefit might be, an easy answer

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.620
to that is the truth, right?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.940
We get to know whose work it
actually is and how to access

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.460
that person if we want to
interact with him or her either

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.660
in the capacity of a fan --

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.130
you know, buying tickets to
David Lowery's show rather

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.900
than Tom Petty's show -- or,
you know, in the capacity

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.490
of a potential licensor
of the work.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.860
But one thing that I
kept having in the back

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.320
of my mind is a conversation
that my clinic students

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.700
and I had with photojournalist
Yunghi Kim.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.810
She's a Pulitzer Prize
finalist and war zone,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.760
conflict zone journalist.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.340
And this was in the context
of comments we were submitting

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.640
to the Section 512 study, but
what she told us was that one

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.470
of the things that is
most troubling to her

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.090
when infringements
of her works occur is

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.690
that the work is
often misrepresented

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.610
for something that it is not.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.370
So, for instance, she has a
very famous image of a young boy

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.490
in Kosovo and that image has
been taken by various, you know,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.170
either revolutionary
groups or other groups

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.470
and represented as
something else.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.270
One instance it was represented

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.040
to be a Palestinian boy
rather than, you know,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.570
accurately reflecting, you
know, the truth of the matter.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.310
You hear about these stories
also in other contexts.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:02.760
I mean when Boko Haram
kidnapped the girls in Nigeria,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.540
the first thing that popped
up on Facebook was an image

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.050
of a completely different group
of girls that was, you know,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.450
used to represent these, you
know, Nigerian kidnapees.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.010
I think the public loses
something if you can't rely

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.570
on a photojournalist's image
actually being what it purports

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.230
to be.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.130
And to me, I wonder, you know,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.570
which of these rights
really addresses this.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.780
To some degree I think it's an
integrity issue; but, you know,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.210
the image isn't necessarily
altered.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.030
I guess it's, you know,
put in a different context.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.950
You know, I'm not sure that the
attribution issue helps us any

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.720
because just the fact that,
you know, it's attributed

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.450
to Yunghi Kim doesn't resolve
the fact that the work is,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.610
you know, being represented

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.750
in a way that's inaccurate
to her subjects.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.690
So, I'm curious whether
others have, you know,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.690
thoughts on how this
might be addressed

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.960
and whether that's
something that is already kind

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.620
of within the sphere
of what we're talking

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.640
about in terms of moral rights.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.180
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: And
I'd add that that ties back

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.220
into the point that Professor
Ginsburg was making in response

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.190
to one of her questions that,
you know, when you're trying

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.820
to justify potential
legislative or other action

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.200
in the moral rights space, you
know, it's not just the fact

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.660
that we arguably
aren't in compliance

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.130
with the Berne Convention,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.970
but also that there is a
legitimate public interest,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.980
at least there are many
arguments you can make

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.890
for public interest.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.870
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female
Speaker 1: I'll speak to that

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.020
in the context of
writers and in terms

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.210
of the rights of attribution.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.290
This is something that I have
been aware of during the course

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.830
of time that I have
been a writer,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.340
and it addresses the notion
of ghostwriting and people

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.450
who write with other people.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.980
And I remember 25 or 30 years
ago you would see a celebrity

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.140
biography and it would
say, "as told to".

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.430
It was Rin Tin Tin "as
told to David Johnson".

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.870
So, you knew it was not
told by Rin Tin Tin;

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.220
it was actually written
by David Johnson.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.430
Then that became blurred, and
now the celebrity biographies

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.670
or memoirs or autobiographies
all say "by Elizabeth Taylor".

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.800
And, again, if we're talking

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.810
about giving the public
the truth, everyone knows

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.410
that this celebrity
didn't write the book.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.980
That's public knowledge.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.160
And yet the book is published
under that person's name.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.800
So, the ghostwriter has lost all
professional sense, no ownership

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.490
of the work, no moral
right to attribution.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.780
And I know of one person who
wrote a celebrity biography

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.100
and he told me -- Every time
I would see him I would say,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.800
"How's it going?"

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.590
And he'd say, "It's great."

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.980
And I said, "Where's
your name going to be?"

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.320
And he'd say, "On the
front of the book.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.370
It's going to be a
joint biography."

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.750
It came out without
his name anywhere

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.950
and it just gradually --
sort of the tide receded,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.170
and he just didn't get it.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.280
And I know of another one

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.490
in which the writer died
just before the publication,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.590
and with only the
widow to protest,

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.030
they just took his
name off it altogether.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.660
So, the public loses there
in terms of this sense

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.200
of truthfulness and
authenticity,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.200
and why should we
be party to a system

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.970
that just withdraws the sense
of truth from the public?

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.610
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female Speaker
2: And just to add something

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.960
to the public benefit of
the right of attribution,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.910
it has been the common practice
in the publishing industry

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.870
to provide attribution except
for these ghostwritten books,

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:05.880
which is slowly changing, but
most authors write in part

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.590
for the right of attribution.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.710
I think if we were to survey
our members they would say

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.360
that they probably wouldn't
have gone into writing

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.180
if they hadn't thought

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.380
that their work could
be attributed to them.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.610
Now mid-list writers
are having a harder

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.210
and harder time economically,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.970
and there are just fewer
books being published

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.200
on serious subjects
for mid-list authors.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.840
So, many of our members,
particularly members

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.560
that have written many books
in their 50's and 60's,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.960
are starting to write books

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.150
without their name
being put on the book.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.190
You know, often they're
rich people

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.440
who just want a book
written by somebody

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.020
and they want their name on the
book, not the actual author's.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.440
And, yes, you will find
authors willing to do this

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.180
because they need
to pay the mortgage;

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.200
or in many cases I have friends
who say they're doing this

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.470
because they, you know, well
their kids are in college

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.360
and "then I'm going back
to writing my own stuff."

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.960
So, I think an important thing

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.150
to remember is it's
also an incentive.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.860
That's my point.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.920
It's as much of an incentive
as the copyright right.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.330
&gt;&gt; Eugene Mopsik:
I think frequently,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.990
at least for many commercial
artists, we lose sight

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.710
of what the end game is in
all of these discussions;

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:33.700
and for me as a commercial
artist, copyright

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:41.530
and moral rights ultimately
are I guess a means to allow me

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:47.840
to continue to profit and to
profit from my creative works.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.690
And so they're a means to an
end and they're not the end,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:15:00.670
and I think in that direction
we need to support efforts to --

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.450
as Nancy spoke about
persistent identifiers,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.920
and it gets even
more cumbersome.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.180
It's more like machine-readable
persistent identifiers.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.680
So, there are identifiers that
are persistent and can work

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.340
in the background and don't
require human intervention

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:30.500
to enforce rights and
ultimately are able to manage,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.280
or at least visual artists
would be able to manage a lot

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.900
of these downstream uses that
we were talking about today --

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.750
the secondary uses of images,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.980
where right now it's
the total Wild West

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.950
and photographs are just
being used willy-nilly.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.240
So --

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.050
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male
Speaker: Looking at it

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.840
from a slightly different
point of view, I'm a litigator

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.600
and I do this from a more
practical point of view

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.150
than the esoteric; and
when you have people having

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:11.120
misattribution or
nonattribution, Dastar killed us

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.100
on one whole good
creative set of arguments.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.040
But one of the other problems
you have is the preemption.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.950
Like when I try to file,
or if I'm the defendant --

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.120
I'm like 12(b)(6) -- when people
try to use unfair competition

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.800
or other kinds of things, I
say, "Hey, it's preempted" or,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.770
you know, it's a problem I
have if I want to plead it

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.430
because this is all subject
of the Copyright Act,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.990
and it is not included.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.010
So, the various different
kind of creative elements

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.420
or arguments that one might
make I'm not real sure that,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.930
because of the preemption,
that they would get very far.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.540
So, just a practical
thing there.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.710
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan:
Someone in the back.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:03.940
&gt;&gt; Mira Sundara Rajan: Hi.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.260
My name is Mira Sundara Rajan.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.250
I'm a professor of
Intellectual Property Law

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.850
at the CREATe Copyright
Center in the U.K.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.370
and I've written a not
insubstantial book entitled

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.110
Moral Rights: Principles,
Practice and New Technology --

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.480
for that reason I have
a number of thoughts

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.520
but at least a couple of
which I'd like to share

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.890
in the limited time
that we have available.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.020
One of them is that I've been
listening with a lot of interest

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.820
to these comments about
what is the public interest

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.710
in moral rights, an issue I talk
quite a bit about in my book,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.010
and I think it's a key question

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.640
that we need to be
able to answer.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.110
You know, we heard
from the authors.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.450
We know how they feel about it.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.990
We know to some extent how
our middle men feel about it.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.010
How does the public
feel about it?

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.360
And for me the important point
that we need to remember is

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.160
that all works eventually
end up being owned

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.650
in a sense by the public.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.020
They go into the public
domain, all copyright works,

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.740
and that idea was
expressed by Victor Hugo,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.230
who said that the true heir

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.430
of any writer is ultimately
going to be the public.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.030
And I think when we think about
the issue of moral rights,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.850
it's helpful to keep
that in mind,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.850
that preserving the
attribution of works,

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.630
preserving historical truth,
preserving the integrity

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.650
of works that are in the
cultural domain is something

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.380
that ultimately is a
matter of importance

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.630
for every citizen of a country.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.880
Another issue here that
may be apt as well is

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.640
that American artists
are in a curious position

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.240
because when you go out of
the country with your work --

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.660
Let's say you go to France --

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.520
your moral rights
are recognized.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.930
And yet here in the
United States at home,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.070
you don't have the same rights

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.980
that you enjoy in
foreign countries.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.460
And I'm Canadian; we
have moral rights.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.910
If I were an American creator,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.350
I think I'd be quite upset
about that situation.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.450
So, I do think that there
is some national pride,

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.310
cultural pride involved.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.670
And maybe that goes to a
final interesting point,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.770
which is what we're talking

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.770
about here is cultural
diversity.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.950
Well, let's not forget that
cultural diversity also exists

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.820
in the law and that has been
maybe an interesting backhanded

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.230
development as far as
the relative exclusion

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.030
of moral rights from
TRIPS' concern

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.210
because countries have
adopted moral rights in keeping

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.730
with Berne and TRIPS, but
there is tremendous diversity

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.690
in how different countries
have implemented moral rights.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.290
I mean literally it would be
difficult to find two countries

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.940
that have done it the same
way, and you have everything

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.800
from the U.K. situation, where
you have to assert your right

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.270
of attribution before you can
expect to have it recognized,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.270
to the situation in
India, where rights

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.620
of integrity are
protected forever.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.260
Why are they protected forever?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.560
Well, the Indian
copyright registrar told me

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.820
that amendment was brought
in for a specific reason --

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.750
because the interest of the
public in the preservation

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.640
of the cultural domain was
considered to be so important

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.810
that integrity had to be
legislated for time immemorial.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.450
So, you have so many
different approaches,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.750
and I think that at least
should be very encouraging here

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.880
in the United States because
there's so much that can be done

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.310
to recognize moral rights
and yet to give them a shape

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.550
that makes sense in the
cultural, technological, social,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.270
economic context
here in the states.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.990
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Thank you.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.010
And can you remind us of
the title of your book?

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.510
&gt;&gt; An easy question to answer.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.360
It's called Moral
Rights [laughter],

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.590
the key words being new
technology, and it's published

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.810
by Oxford University
Press, just about to come

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.910
out in a second edition.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.250
So, please don't try to buy it

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.600
until a few more
months go by [laughter].

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Any more
comments or suggestions?

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.040
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez: We have one
hiding behind the pillar here.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.010
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan:
Oh, excellent.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.700
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female Speaker
3: I just wanted to speak

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.430
to a form of expression
that I hope becomes part

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.920
of the conversation moving
forward and that's dance.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.380
I think the absence of that

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.740
in the conversation
today is probably --

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.850
it's illustrative of the sort of
lesser degree of pervasiveness

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.340
in culture than something
like music or books,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.780
but that was I think largely an
accessibility issue in the past.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.140
And with, you know, an increased
focus on digitized entertainment

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.460
and technology and with
content hosting sites,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.600
I think dance finally has the
means and window of opportunity

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.580
to be able to reach
a broader audience

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.360
and disseminate their
work on a greater scale.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.630
In terms of protecting the
rights of sound recordings

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.280
and musicians and performers,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.080
I'm hoping that dance
will be a consideration

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.010
so that they can take advantage
of this opportunity and finally,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.880
you know, have their moment
and push their way into society

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.370
and culture and become
more pervasive.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.630
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: And
Brad, we have a question

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.880
over here on the left.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.320
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male
Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.290
Just one or two quick thoughts.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.690
One is that the discussion
has talked

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.940
about incentives a good bit and
interests of various groups,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.900
public or other maybe.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:10.220
But the term itself,
moral rights, you know,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.150
both of those words are very
interesting and useful, too;

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.060
and I think, you know,

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:19.560
going forward fuller use
could be given to both

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.630
of those terms and, you know,
I think of the, you know,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.230
sort of historic American
principle in American law

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:34.420
that rights are not
only something

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:40.650
that government would give or
take away on a whim or based

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:46.870
on a particular interest, but
that there are certain rights

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:52.570
that -- and here I think there
was the quote earlier on about,

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.790
you know, a person
being entitled

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.840
to the fruits of their labor.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.320
So, I don't recall
exactly the quote.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:13.630
But the other point that
I was going to raise was

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.960
that law can have a teaching
function also so that even

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.880
if there's not a very elaborate
complicated system that is put

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.760
in place right away,
giving some protection

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.300
to moral rights can
help to remind people

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.050
that this is something that
is something to be valued,

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:44.430
you know, because
I think so often

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.530
if the law doesn't require
something, they'll you know,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.300
give a copyright
notice or something

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.360
but they won't give
recognition to the authors

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.680
because there's no feeling
that they should do so.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.980
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Thank you.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.710
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez: Anyone else?

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.820
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Ah,
you got one in the back.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.460
&gt;&gt; Katie Alvarez:
One in the back.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.250
&gt;&gt; Melvin Gibbs: It's more
of a comment than a question.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.900
I was just thinking about the
two panels ago contrasting the

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:32.870
public art, the mural, and
the relationship of public art

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.130
to moral rights as opposed

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.750
to the relationship
to the digital arts.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.040
I was thinking that in
terms of my own comments

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.390
about how moral rights relate
to communities and I thought

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.440
that was a very interesting
illustration of the difference

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.190
between when you have something
that's based in the community

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.400
and how people relate
to the rights as opposed

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.660
to when it's just
floating around digitally.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.640
And it's interesting that dance
was brought up because dance is

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.920
in a sort of middle
position right now --

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.510
well, talking about
street dance in particular,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.150
which is one area
I'm interested in.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.820
It's still a community
but it's kind

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.860
of like a worldwide
community and attribution --

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.820
everybody kind of knows
who's making up the steps

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.050
because they're getting
uploaded so quickly

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.950
but they're also getting
disseminated very quickly

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.780
at the same time.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.630
So, I'm wondering -- it seems

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.380
like maybe that's an actual
beginnings of solution

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.180
of crossing those things --
looking at dance might be a way

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.850
to kind of think through
an actual solution there.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.370
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.080
Any last minute thoughts,
comments, questions?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: We have
two more -- Alan and Mary.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Rasenberger: I have
a question for everybody here

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.400
and that is after seeing
Scott Martin's presentation

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.650
on the different laws
around the world --

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.950
At lunch we were
talking about, you know,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.950
need for unification of IT laws.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.720
Is there any interest

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.500
in an international
treaty on moral rights?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.600
[inaudible]

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:12.690
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:19.230
Other than the one we already
actually have [laughter].

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:35.180
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:35.610
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: Allan?

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.590
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: This is a
question I probably should have

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.090
asked to session five when they
were up there, but it occurred

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.210
to me one of the
major developments,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.520
at least for my industry, since
moral rights was the source

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.640
of major discussion here in
the United States is the fact

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.700
that the internet has given rise

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.100
to a new generation
of self-publication.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.840
And I'm just wondering
in that environment

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.060
where the author essentially
also becomes the publisher

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.450
and the person chiefly
responsible for distribution

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.340
of their own work, if that makes
a difference in the calculations

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.750
that people would make about --
Well, certainly I think it would

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.620
with respect to integrity
issues but I'm wondering

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.570
if it would also make a
difference with respect

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.840
to attribution issues as well.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.690
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:
And the last comment?

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.630
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female
Speaker 4: Good afternoon.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.140
It's not comments,
just an inquiry.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.720
I'm not a lawyer.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.320
I came to attend this
symposium; it's a course for me.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.820
So, I was reading each
speech for moral view.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.300
So, I have a question.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.790
I was trained as a biologist.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.920
So, in the international
collaborations I see some lack

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.430
or gap between the
piracy and the law.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.070
So, here we talk all day
about law, copyrights law,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.110
moral rights law, attribution.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.340
But how about piracy?

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.550
Here I would like to
present to you a scenario

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:15.210
from the U.S. Office
of Research Integrity.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.960
I would learn a few months ago
in this office there's a policy

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.520
of plagiarism, if put in this
room would be plagiarism,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.650
but there they didn't
see it as plagiarism,

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.970
but authorship dispute.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:34.190
They say that the ORI, the
Office of Research Integrity,

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.980
considers many disputes
between the collaborators

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.810
on the same research project
as an authorship dispute

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.120
or credit disputes
rather than plagiarism.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.920
So, I would ask your insights.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:54.340
How could make the interaction
between policy and the law?

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.270
Thank you.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.780
&gt;&gt; Karyn Temple Claggett:
I don't think we're going

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.650
to answer that question today.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.280
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barblan: But thanks
for raising it [laughter].

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:01.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.800
I want to thank the panelists

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.360
from the last panel
and the audience.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.800
I also want to thank all

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.210
of the panelists who've
been here throughout the day

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.320
as well as the audience.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.960
I think, as I said, when I first
started the overview session I

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.520
didn't know whether we would
actually have enough to discuss

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.020
for a full day of moral
rights in the United States,

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.780
but it not only showed that we
actually have a lot to discuss

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.680
but a lot of important
information

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.350
and it really showed how
strongly people believe

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.920
that especially the moral rights
of attribution and integrity are

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.070
to individual authors.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.660
So, you've given us
a lot to think about.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.460
As I think Register Pallante
mentioned at the beginning

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.540
of the day, this is only the
beginning of our conversation.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.180
We'll now take some
of the things

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.450
that you guys have
said today and use

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.660
that to actually ask more
specific questions in terms

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.940
of what should we do next
as we analyze moral rights

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.730
in the United States

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.450
and we consider how best do we
actually protect both individual

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.980
authors as well as the public
in terms of wanting to know

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.750
who creates the work and
how the work is being used.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.630
So, thank you again
for participating

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.010
and thank you all for coming.
