00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:01.839
- [Voiceover] We've
seen in previous videos

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.300
that photosynthesis can be broken down

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.900
into the light-dependent
reactions and the Calvin cycle.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.617
And the light-dependent reactions is

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.313
where we take light as an
input along with water,

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:14.882
and we'll see the water is
actually a source of electrons,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.891
and we can use that to store energy

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.308
in the form of ATP and NADPH,

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.769
and as a by-product we
produce molecular oxygen,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.693
which is very important for us to breathe.

00:00:24.693 --> 00:00:26.558
And then that ATP and that NADPH

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:28.186
can be used in the Calvin cycle,

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:32.870
along with carbon dioxide,
to actually synthesize sugar.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.551
What we're gonna focus on in this video

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.633
are the light-dependent reactions.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.335
How does this process right here work?

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.729
And to help us think about this,

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.812
we're going to zoom in
onto a thylakoid membrane.

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:48.356
So this is a thylakoid right over here,

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:50.607
sitting inside of the chloroplast.

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:52.591
And if we zoom in on its membrane,

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.514
we see it's a phospholipid bilayer,

00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:57.215
like many membranes
that we see in biology.

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:58.875
And at first glance, this might seem

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:00.555
like a very complex diagram,

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.356
and that's because it
is a complex diagram,

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.492
and you will often see things like this

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:04.807
in your biology textbooks.

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:06.312
They can be very intimidating,

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:09.599
these proteins and molecules and complexes

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.148
have very complicated-sounding names,

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:14.502
but the general idea
of what's going on is,

00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:17.984
you'll hopefully find,
pretty straightforward.

00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:19.707
You have the energy from light,

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:21.655
photons from light are going to,

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:25.587
either directly or
indirectly, excite electrons.

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:28.794
Those excited electrons,
they're in a high-energy state.

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:32.132
They're gonna be transferred
from one molecule to another,

00:01:32.132 --> 00:01:34.214
and they're going to go
to lower energy states.

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:35.705
That's what allows those transfers

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:39.099
to be as spontaneous, for
them to actually occur.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.390
They're going from a high-energy state

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.744
to a lower-energy state.

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:43.801
The electrons are getting more

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:45.091
and more and more comfortable,

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.834
and some of that energy that's released

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.817
as the electron goes
from a high-energy state

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.318
to a lower-energy state

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:54.485
is used to pump hydrogen
ions across the membrane.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:58.739
From the outside of the
membrane, in the stroma,

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.761
to the inside of the membrane,

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:03.257
to within the thylakoid lumen.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:07.424
So you are building a hydrogen
ion concentration gradient.

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:15.659
Concentration gradient.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.995
Where you have a higher
concentration inside

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:20.468
than you have outside.

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:22.103
And this by itself,

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:24.143
this concentration gradient as we'll see,

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.213
can be used to fuel the production

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.130
of ATP by ATP synthase,

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:32.241
that those hydrogen ions
want to get back out.

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:34.693
They wanna go down their
concentration gradient,

00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:37.984
and as they go back out
through the ATP synthase

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:39.641
it essentially turns that motor

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.808
that can jam the phosphate
group onto ADP to produce ATP.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:46.737
So one way to think about it,

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:50.936
this is producing a hydrogen ion gradient.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.011
So we could do it this way,

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:54.428
we could say H plus gradient,

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:59.925
which is then being used
to produce the actual ATP.

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:04.706
Now the electrons going
from a high-energy state

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:07.491
to a lower-energy state in this part

00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.417
of the light-dependent reactions,

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.894
that by itself isn't the only
thing that is contributing

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:15.859
to the hydrogen ion
concentration gradient.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.857
Once that electron gets donated,

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:19.869
you might say, well how
does it get replaced?

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.113
Well the thing that's doing the donating,

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:23.340
the thing that eventually gets excited

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.639
and donates that electron,

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.969
it's a chlorophyll a
variation called P680.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.629
P680 is referring to the
P stands for pigment,

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.870
680 stands for 680 nano-meters,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.215
the wavelength of light
that it absorbs best.

00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.297
And so when it gets excited, it becomes

00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:43.093
you'll see the notation off of P680*,

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:45.085
that's when it has an excited electron.

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:49.229
And then after it gives away its electron,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.979
it becomes P680+

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.257
with a positive charge.

00:03:55.257 --> 00:03:57.986
And this P680, we could call it P680 plus

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:00.615
right over here, maybe a P680 ion,

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.331
this is actually a very
strong oxidizing agent.

00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:06.268
One of the strongest,
if not the strongest,

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:08.232
that we know in biological systems.

00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:11.997
And so it really likes to grab
electrons from other things.

00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:13.483
And the thing that is around

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:16.739
that it can grab electrons
from is actually water.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.188
And so this is such a
strong oxidizing agent

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:22.528
that it can essentially
oxidize the oxygen in water,

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:23.761
and oxygen as itself.

00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.842
I mean, oxidizing is named after oxygen

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:27.738
because oxygen is such a strong,

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:30.732
it's so electronegative,
it's such a strong,

00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:34.160
it's the thing that's
normally doing the oxidizing.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.294
So anyway, it grabs its electrons,
once it gets this P680+,

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:40.558
grabs an electron from water,

00:04:40.558 --> 00:04:43.272
and then the water essentially falls apart

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:45.031
so you're left just with the oxygen

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:46.616
and then the hydrogen ions.

00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:50.116
And so those hydrogen ions also contribute

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:55.228
to the increased hydrogen ion
concentration on the inside.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:59.650
And this is where we get
the oxygen by-product

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.540
right over here.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.825
Here we have one half of an
O2, so if you do this twice

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.502
you're going to have a molecular oxygen.

00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:08.811
So, so far we've talked about
how the oxygen gets produced,

00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:11.629
we've talked about how
the ATP gets produced.

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.397
What about the NADPH?

00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:17.251
Well we've started our
process in photosystem II.

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.868
You might say, why's it
called photosystem II

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:20.508
if that's where we start?

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:21.578
Well it's actually that's because

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:23.501
that's the second
photosystem to be discovered.

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.990
You might say, what is a photosystem?

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.330
Well these photosystems and complexes,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.906
they're combinations of
proteins and molecules,

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:33.880
and photosystem in
particular has chlorophyll

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.533
and variations of chlorophyll
and pigment molecules

00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:39.156
that are responsive to
light that are very easy,

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:42.178
that have electrons that
can get excited by light,

00:05:42.178 --> 00:05:44.160
and they can transfer that energy

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.359
back down to the P680 chlorophyll a pair,

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.885
which then can have its electron excited

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:53.618
and then it can give that
to an acceptor molecule

00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:56.469
and then it can go to
lower, lower energy states

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.990
and pump those hydrogen ions out.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.980
But that's not the entire
light-dependent reactions.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.487
That electron can eventually make its way

00:06:05.487 --> 00:06:08.210
over to photosystem I, and
why's it called photosystem I?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.660
Well it's because the first
one that was discovered.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.525
In photosystem I, there's another

00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:15.143
chlorophyll a pair called P700,

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:17.979
and that's because it optimally absorbs

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.455
light of a wavelength of 700 nano-meters.

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:22.496
And you have something
similar that happens,

00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:23.882
that light can either directly

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:26.556
or indirectly excite its electron.

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:29.243
And then that electron, as it
goes to a lower-energy level,

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:30.757
it goes from one molecule to another,

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.674
it can be used to reduce NADP+ into NADPH.

00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:40.961
And so that's where the NADPH comes from.

00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:45.781
And then once again, once the
P700 has given its electron,

00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:47.457
it wants an electron,

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:49.361
and well it can get that from the electron

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:52.627
that's been going from lower
to lower, lower energy states,

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:55.500
that's essentially been
making its way from,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.260
you can conceptualize it as the electron

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.126
that's been making its
way from photosystem II.

00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:01.867
And so that's why you'll
often see these diagrams.

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:04.992
Lights come in, electron gets
energized, it gets excited,

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:06.943
it goes to lower and lower energy states.

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:08.489
As it's doing that it's being transferred

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:09.803
from one molecule to another,

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:11.728
being facilitated by enzymes.

00:07:11.728 --> 00:07:13.699
That energy, part of that energy

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.704
is being used to transfer hydrogen ions

00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:19.371
into the thylakoid
lumen, into the interior.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:24.372
Then in photosystem I, you
have another excitation event.

00:07:25.393 --> 00:07:27.757
That thing that got excited
can grab that electron

00:07:27.757 --> 00:07:29.303
that went to lower, lower energy states,

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:31.221
and its excited electron can once again

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.813
be transferred from
one molecule to another

00:07:33.813 --> 00:07:37.177
in order to fuel or provide energy

00:07:37.177 --> 00:07:41.472
for NADP+ being converted into NADPH.

00:07:41.472 --> 00:07:43.323
And once again the whole idea

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:46.065
of the hydrogen ion
concentration increasing here

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.637
can fuel ATP synthase, which
allows us to jam a phosphate

00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:52.355
onto ADP to produce ATP.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.875
So that is where we actually
get all of these things

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.458
and the by-product of
course is our oxygen.

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:02.855
And if you wanted to see that same idea

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:05.571
but kind of just thinking from
an energetic point of view

00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.759
without all of the complexity

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.472
of seeing the physical
components involved,

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:10.760
you see it right over here.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.927
Where you have light energy
comes, excites the electrons.

00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:19.618
Once the P680 has given
that electron away,

00:08:19.618 --> 00:08:21.500
it wants an electron really badly.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.576
It gets it from the water.

00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:24.984
And then as that electron goes

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:27.012
to lower and lower and
lower energy states,

00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:29.601
it can eventually be grabbed by P700

00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.144
that has given away its own electron.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:36.379
And then that electron
that was excited at P700

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:38.287
by, once again, more light energy,

00:08:38.287 --> 00:08:41.230
that can be transferred
from one molecule to another

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.730
to fuel the creation of NADPH.

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:48.850
And this part right over here,
this phase right over here,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.397
as the energy goes from
a high-energy state to a-

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:54.227
as the electron goes
from a high-energy state

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:55.492
to a lower energy state,

00:08:55.492 --> 00:08:57.996
fuels the pumping of hydrogen protons

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.246
into the actual thylakoid.
