[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.840
LAURA LING: How do you think
your life would be different

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.910
if you had access
to reliable energy?

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:24.790

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.990
LAURA LING: Mwanaidi Mwende
lives with her grandchildren

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.010
in a small village in Tanzania.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.030
Every few days she
scours the land

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.080
around her home in
search of firewood,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.580
which she uses to cook.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.556

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.790
MWANAIDI MWENDE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.140
LAURA LING: And do
your grandchildren

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.090
help you gather the wood?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.785
MWANAIDI MWENDE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.505
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.310
LAURA LING: This is
one of the reasons why

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520
so many girls are
not going to school

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.730
and getting an education.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.520
It's because they're out here
helping their families gather

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.370
wood and other materials
that can be used as fuel.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.340
And it's a very
clear example of how

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.970
the energy crisis impacts girls
disproportionately to boys.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.880

MWANAIDI MWENDE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.255
LAURA LING: Does that create a
lot of smoke inside the house?

00:01:57.255 --> 00:01:58.796
MWANAIDI MWENDE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.546
LAURA LING: Sometimes you
cry because of the smoke?

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.087
MWANAIDI MWENDE:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.030
LAURA LING: As
Mwanaidi was cooking,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.250
you could hear her coughing
and her grandchildren

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.780
coughing around her.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.660
And as she explained,
she has no other choice

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.160
but to cook this
way even though she

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.770
knows that it can cause harmful
long-term health issues.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.160
What's incredible is that smoke
inhalation kills more people

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.340
worldwide than HIV
and malaria combined.

LAURA LING: I hope
your dream comes true.

Please check out
this next video.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.140
18-year-old Hussein Mwende
has lived his entire life

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.302
without ever having
electricity in his home.

00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:54.760
HUSSEIN MWENDE:
I'm studying always

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.975
because I want to be a doctor.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.102
Sometimes I have to
walk far distance

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:01.310
to find the place where the
electricity is available.

00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:05.930
