00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:03.293
You may by now be familiar with the notion

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.157
of evaluating a function
with a particular value,

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:09.265
so for example,
if this table is our function definition,

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:12.935
if someone were to say,
"Well, what is f of -9?"

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.007
you could say, okay, if we input -9
into our function,

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:21.264
if x is -9, this table tell us
that f of x is going to be equal to 5.

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.711
You might already have experience
with doing composite functions,

00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:31.521
where you say, f of f of -9 plus 1.

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:36.033
So this is interesting,
it seems very daunting,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.670
but you say, well we know
what f of -9 is, this is going to be 5,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.690
so it's going to be f of 5 plus 1.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.884
So this is going to be equal to f of 6,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:49.974
and if we look at our table,
f of 6 is equal to -7.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.078
So all of that is review so far,

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:57.128
but what I want to now do is
start evaluating the inverse of functions.

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.273
This function f is invertable,

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:04.203
because it's a one-to-one mapping
between the xs and the f of xs.

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:09.637
No two xs map to the same f of x,
so this is an invertable function.

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.410
With that in mind,
let's see if we can evaluate

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.980
something like f inverse of 8.

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:19.425
What is that going to be?

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:24.315
I encourage you to pause the video
and try to think about it.

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:28.404
So f of x, just as a reminder
of what functions do,

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:33.284
f of x is going to map from this domain,
from a value in its domain

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:38.430
to a corresponding value in the range.

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.561
So this is what f does,
this is domain...

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.494
and this right over here is the range.

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:51.742
Now f inverse, if you pass it,
the value and the range,

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:56.042
it'll map it back
to the corresponding value

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:58.986
in the domain.

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.783
But how do we think about it like this?

00:02:01.783 --> 00:02:05.034
Well, f inverse of 8,
this is whatever maps to 8,

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:08.854
so if this was 8, we'd have to say,
well, what mapped to 8?

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:14.563
We see here f of 9 is 8,

00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:19.003
so f inverse of 8
is going to be equal to 9.

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:30.048
If it makes it easier,
we could construct a table,

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:37.613
where I could say x and f inverse of x,

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:41.734
and what I'd do is swap
these two columns.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:47.584
f of x goes from -9 to 5,
f inverse of x goes from 5 to -9.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.709
All I did was swap these two.
Now we're mapping from this to that.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.812
So f inverse of x is going to map
from 7 to -7.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:58.143
Notice, instead of mapping
from this thing to that thing,

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:01.677
we're now going to map
from that thing to this thing.

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:06.086
So f inverse is going to map
from 13 to 5.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:10.710
It's going to map from -7 to 6.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.987
It's going to map from 8 to 9,

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:21.137
and it's going to map from 12 to 11.

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.735
Looks like I got all of them, yep.

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:27.981
So all I did was swap these columns.

00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:30.457
The f inverse maps from this column
to that column.

00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:33.706
So I just swapped them out.
Now it becomes a little clearer.

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:35.458
You see it right here,

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:40.080
f inverse of 8,
if you input 8 into f inverse,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.677
you get 9.

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:44.527
Now we can use that
to start doing fancier things.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:51.956
We can evaluate something like
f of f inverse of 7.

00:03:54.966 --> 00:04:01.827
f of f inverse of 7.

00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:04.027
What is this going to be?

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:06.166
Let's first evaluate f inverse of 7.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:11.626
f inverse of 7 maps from 7 to -7.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:16.673
So this is going to be f
of this stuff in here,

00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:22.991
f inverse of 7, you see,
is -7.

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:28.332
And then to evaluate the function,
f of -7 is going to be 7.

00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:31.320
And that makes complete sense.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.620
We mapped from f inverse of 7
to -7

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.168
and evaluating the function of that,
went back to 7.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:44.253
So let's do one more of these
just to really feel comfortable

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:47.131
with mapping back-and-forth
between these two sets,

00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:51.299
between applying the function
and the inverse of the function.

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:56.049
Let's evaluate f inverse
of f inverse of 13.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.761
f inverse of 13.

00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:10.027
What is that going to be?

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:13.652
I encourage you to pause the video
and try to figure it out.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:16.178
What's f inverse of 13?

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:20.840
That's, looking at this table right here,
f inverse goes from 13 to 5.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.890
You see it over here, f went from 5 to 13,
so f inverse is going to go from 13 to 5.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.091
So, f inverse of 13 is going to be 5,

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.911
so this is the same thing
as f inverse of 5.

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:42.336
And f inverse of 5? -9.
So this is going to be equal to -9.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:49.027
Once again, f inverse goes
from 5 to -9.

00:05:49.027 --> 00:05:53.969
So at first when you start doing
these functions and inverse of functions

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.524
it looks a little confusing,
hey, I'm going back and forth,

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.925
but you just have to remember

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.960
a function maps from one set of numbers
to another set of numbers.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.799
The inverse of that function
goes the other way.

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:09.067
If the function goes from 9 to 8,
the inverse is going to go from 8 to 9.

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.807
So one way to think about it is,
you just switch these columns.

00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:17.667
Hopefully, that clarifies
more things than it confuses.
