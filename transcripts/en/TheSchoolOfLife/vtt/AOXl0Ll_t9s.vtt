00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.320
We're often appalled by how sly and dishonest many politicians are,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.740
but we shouldn't be. In moods like this

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.420
we need to remember and read the works of Niccolo Machiavelli.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.100
A late 15th century political advisor and political theorist

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.440
who argued that we shouldn't think that politicians are imoral

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.400
and simply bad for lying and dissembling and maneuvering.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.260
A good politician, in Machiavelli's remarkable view, isn't one who's friendly and honest and kind.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.060
It's someone, however occasionally dark and underhand they might be,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.880
who knows how to defend, enrich and bring honor to the state,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.900
which is also an extremely important goal.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.420
Being nice may well be a virtue in general, but what citizens most need from their rulers

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.820
is effectiveness, which may well call upon some darker arts.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.120
Once we understand this basic requirement,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.980
we stand to be less disappointed and clearer about what we want from our politicians.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.880
Niccolo Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.960
His father was a lawyer

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
And so Machiavelli received an extensive formal education

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.000
and got his first job as secretary for the city of florence

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
But, soon after his appointment Florence exploded politically

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
And expelled the Medici family who'd ruled it for 60 years

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.980
And suffered decades of political instability and turmoil
