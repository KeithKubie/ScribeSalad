00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One, two, sing strong.

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:11.856
Go.

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:17.616
&gt;&gt;Class: Listen to the water, listen
to the water, rolling down the river.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.436
Listen to the water,
listen to the water--

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:21.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It begins
in the first grade,

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:27.236
and continues in middle school.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:29.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's the
mood of this music?

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:33.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It culminates in high
school bands and orchestral groups,

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.846
infusing the entire curriculum
of the Bay Shore school district

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.166
on New York's Long Island.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:48.836
Here students learn to read, write
and revel in the medium of music.

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:50.906
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: You're not educated
if you don't have the arts.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:54.666
Even in difficult times,
we try to make sure

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:57.616
that our students have
access to the arts.

00:00:58.146 --> 00:00:59.796
It's part of the air we breathe.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:03.506
We're so close to New
York and we have access

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:07.446
to so many wonderful
cultural opportunities here

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:11.216
and we want our children to
have those opportunities.

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:13.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have to know how
to harmonize "Jingle Bells."

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:15.096
You start on E and use your ear.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The district has been
providing musical opportunities

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:23.296
to all its students for decades,
and has been recognized as one

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:27.126
of the country's top music
programs by the Grammy organization.

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:29.656
&gt;&gt;Class: One little, two
little, three little robots.

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Children begin
to benefit from an exposure

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.196
to music in the first grade.

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:35.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Ta.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:40.186
Tee, ta, ta.

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:41.016
&gt;&gt;Carol: That's it.

00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:44.266
&gt;&gt;I think music is really important
in all areas of their development.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:48.026
When we work on movement,
it helps in the area of PE,

00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:49.546
and the gross motor skills.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.786
Rhythms help them with coordination,
playing the instruments also.

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:56.036
We work on singing.

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.866
We're doing reading, because
they're reading the lyric charts.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.506
They have to read from left to right.

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:03.986
All kinds of different skills
that generalize into other areas

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:05.776
of their academic schedule.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:10.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Bay Shore, every third
grader gets to choose and instrument

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:13.246
and take five weeks of
free summer lessons.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.346
And all students take a general
music class, where they learn

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:21.076
to appreciate the classics
and the basics of composition.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:26.266
Technology also helps high school
students pursue their passion

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:26.886
for music.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is an
advanced composition class,

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:32.626
and the final projects for the
end of the year is a requirement

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:34.876
that they submit a major work.

00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:39.096
&gt;&gt;Terry: Computers have turned
out to be an extremely powerful

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.736
and extremely flexible
tool for creativity.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:44.786
And it's really not
about the computers

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:46.786
or the software or the gadgets.

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.526
It's really about the
creative process.

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:49.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We'll talk about voicings.

00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:54.066
Like right now, this is kinda
muddy, but if you take these notes

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.556
and you move them up an octave,
now you can clear your voicing.

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:58.196
So now we're talking
about orchestration.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:02:59.496
And it's instant.

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:03.786
Now they can hear it back and forth,
you know, as you're demonstrating it.

00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.031
&gt;&gt;[orchestra playing]

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to conducting
the advanced musical groups,

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.956
Ted Scalzo teaches classes
in music composition

00:03:13.206 --> 00:03:15.186
and multimedia production.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:18.336
&gt;&gt;Ted: What makes multimedia
unique is the empowerment.

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:21.626
First of all, they're given projects

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:23.786
where they realize
they're high profile.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.006
Someone's gonna look at this.

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:26.686
Somebody's gonna be using it.

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:31.106
Someone's maybe gonna need it
some day and I think when you set

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.026
that high mark, that this isn't
just a class, we're treating you

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:36.326
like pros a little bit, you
gotta produce something that,

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:38.956
when it goes out into the
public, it's consumable.

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:53.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students use
their own musical compositions

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:55.176
to complement their
personal productions.

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:59.056
&gt;&gt;Molly: This is my final film
for my film studies project.

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:01.616
I know a lot of schools
don't have these programs

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:05.196
and I'm very privileged to be
part of Bay Shore High School

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:09.386
and having these programs, such as
multimedia and our music department.

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every year in June,
Bay Shore puts on an arts festival,

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:17.696
which helps raise money for the music
programs this community has come

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:18.346
to embrace.

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:23.146
For the student musicians, this
is the final exam they relish.

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:24.976
&gt;&gt;You know, that feeling
of getting on stage.

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:26.326
This is the moment.

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:27.716
There's no going back.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:28.926
There's only forward.

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:32.896
You're gonna produce something,
and what you produce is going

00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:34.746
to either communicate
or not communicate.

00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:37.496
You're either gonna move or
you're not gonna move an audience.

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:40.076
So they learn about pressure,

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:43.156
they learn about putting
themselves on the spot.

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:46.796
They learn about preparing
and training for the event,

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:51.626
very much like an athlete
in a lotta ways.

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:53.016
&gt;&gt;Terry: I think music and all

00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:55.266
of the arts benefit
children in many, many ways.

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:58.316
The aspect of discipline,
of studying really hard,

00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:00.236
focusing on achieving something.

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:03.436
There are cognitive
benefits, decoding skills.

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.706
Everybody's part is important.

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.446
You can't just have one
or two great players.

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:11.276
Everybody's gotta play the
right note at the right time.

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:17.016
Once you expose children to music
and the arts at an early age,

00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:20.186
they take that with them
for the rest of their life.

00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:23.226
And what I love about it
is that everybody wins.

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:27.366
&gt;&gt;Ted: Oh, let's do
that ending again.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.336
