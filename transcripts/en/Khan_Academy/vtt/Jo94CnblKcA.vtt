00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:04.786
- A circle in the xy-plane
has its center at 7, 14.

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:07.829
If the point 7, 34 lies on the circle,

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.149
which of the following is
an equation of the circle?

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.651
So let's just remind
ourselves the general form

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.044
of the equation of a circle.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:18.225
If any of this looks unusual to you,

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.013
if you haven't seen it before,
I encourage you to watch

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:23.635
the equation of a circle
videos on Khan Academy.

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:25.492
For the general form for
the equation of a circle,

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:30.019
if we have a circle that's
centered at the point h, k

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.576
The x coordinate of the center is h,

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:33.526
the y coordinate of the center is k.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.454
And if it has a radius of r.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.262
So the circle is gonna
look something like that,

00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:40.678
I'm trying to draw it
as circular as I can.

00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:44.114
And it's not so circular,
I think you get the point.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.599
So the radius is r, the equation,

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:50.082
the equation of this circle,
of all the points that are

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:54.860
exactly r away from the
point h, k is gonna be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.317
x minus the x coordinate
of the center, squared,

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:04.101
plus, y minus the y coordinate
of the center, squared,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.283
is equal to the radius squared.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.790
Now in this case we know
what our h and k is.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.298
H is 7, and k is 14.

00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:13.644
And we just need to figure out the radius.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.059
If we figure that out, we
will be able to figure out

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.520
the equation of the entire circle.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.398
Now they tell us that
the center's at 7, 14.

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.462
So that point right over there is 7, 14.

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:28.644
And then the point 7, 34
also lies on the circle.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:30.200
So it has the same x coordinate,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.844
its y coordinate is just higher.

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:36.705
That right over there
might be the point 7, 34.

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:37.749
It would be right above it,

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.559
we've just increased our
y without changing our x.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.321
So 7, 14 is the center.

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:47.432
This point right over here,
7, 34 lies on the circle.

00:01:47.432 --> 00:01:49.336
So the circle's gonna look,

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:52.702
something like this.

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:55.650
And so the radius of this circle,
what we have to figure out

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.321
is just the distance
between these two points.

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.133
And these two points, you
don't even have to really apply

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.362
the distance formula
or anything like this.

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:04.800
The distance here is just our change in y,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.845
our x doesn't change.

00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:08.560
It's gonna be 34 minus 14.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.557
So the radius here is equal to 20.

00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:12.509
So now we know.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.920
We know h is equal to 7, k is equal to 14,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.546
and r is equal to 20.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:23.546
So it's gonna be x minus
h, x minus 7 squared plus

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.857
y minus k, y minus 14 squared,

00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:32.857
is equal to r squared, 20 squared is 400.

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:39.544
And so let's see, that is
this choice right over here.

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:44.767
X minus 7 squared plus y minus
14 squared is equal to 400.

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:47.680
And we're done.
