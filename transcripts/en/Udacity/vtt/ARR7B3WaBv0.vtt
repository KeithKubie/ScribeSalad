00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.960
Meta reasoning arguably is one of the most critical process of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.290
the human cognition. In fact, some researchers suggest that,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.220
developing meta-cognative skills at an early age in life,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.530
may be the best predictor of a student success later in life. Actually,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.310
this makes sense. Meta reasoning is not about simply learning new information,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.230
it is about learning how to learn. About, learning new reasoning strategies.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.560
About integrating new information into memory structures. Meta reasoning is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.650
also connected to creativity. In meta reasoning, the agent is monitoring its

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.040
own reasoning. It is spawning goals. It is trying to achieve them.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.300
Sometimes it suspends a goal, sometimes it abandons a goal. These are all part

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.550
of the creative process. Creativity is not just about creating new products.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.600
It is also about creating a processes, that lead to interesting products.
