00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.760
Hi. Welcome, everyone.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.160
My name is Alda Migoni.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.730
And I'm President of the
Hispanic Cultural Society here

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.030
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.430
I work as a librarian of
the South American section

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.200
of the African, Latin, American,
and Western European division.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.320
On behalf of the Hispanic
Cultural Society of the Library

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.110
of Congress, I would
like to welcome you all

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.950
to this featured event in honor

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.730
of National Hispanic
Heritage Month.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.320
National Hispanic Heritage
Month is celebrated each year

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.090
from September 15
through October 15.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.030
Enacted into law in 1988,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.570
this month recognizes the
contributions of Latino

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.090
and Hispanic Americans
in the United States

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.470
and their heritages, cultures,
and many achievements.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.100
September 15 was chosen to
start the month of celebration

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770
as it coincides with
the anniversary

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.190
of five Latin Americans
country's independence days.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.540
September 16, 18, and 21 also
mark the independence of Mexico,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.630
Chile, and Belize respectively.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.030
Today we have the
honor of having

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.770
with us Representative
Pete Aguilar

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.890
in a moderated conversation
with law librarian

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.820
of Congress Jane Sanchez.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.650
So Jane Sanchez is the 25th
law librarian of Congress.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.040
She manages the operation
and policy administration

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.450
of the law library, the
world's largest collection

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.870
of legal material.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.240
She assumed the position of law
librarian on February 6, 2017.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.530
Prior to the law library,
Sanchez had been Chief

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.080
of Humanities and
Social Sciences

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.020
at the Library since
October 2014.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.610
The division provides
research service

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.940
in the library's main reading
room, its local history

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.860
and genealogy section, its
digital reference team,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.760
and its microfilm and
electronic resources center.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.320
Under her leadership, services
to researchers expanded

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.030
and outreach through
the divisions, RSS feed,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.890
has led to more robust use of
the collections and services.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.460
She's also served as a
business unit managing director

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.560

Justice Management Division,
U.S. Department of Justice,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500

Inc, a legal publisher, in
addition to library work

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.040
at Harvard and the
University of New Mexico.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.480
She has received numerous awards
over the course of her career,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.100
including from the U.S.
Department of Energy

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.400

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.330
and from the Justice
Management Division

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.990
and the Smithsonian Institution

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.460
So Representative Pete
Aguilar represents the 31st

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.410
Congressional District
of California.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.850
He was first elected
in 2014 and serves

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180
on the House Appropriations
Committee in the 115th Congress.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.190
He holds the leadership
positions of Whip,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.660
of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, and is an assistant whip

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.000
in the House Democratic Caucus.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.590
Representative Aguilar
is a voice

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.360

throughout San Bernardino County

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.070
and prioritizes legislation that
will nurture more fair economy,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.730
where everyone has
opportunities to succeed.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.650
He is committed to
policies that create jobs,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.830
reform our broken immigration
system, supports our students,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.680
and safeguards vital programs
for seniors and veterans.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.980
He resides in Redlands,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.510
California with his wife
Alisha and their two sons.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.020
So as a fellow Bulldog and the
University of Redland's alumni,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.420
I'm really excited and happy
that you are here to join us.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.010
And the Library of Congress

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.670

Society welcomes you both.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.110
So thank you, so much.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.090
After the moderator
conversation,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.370

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.000

that and also you are welcome

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240

Thank you.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.300
[ Applause ]

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.030
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Good
morning, everyone.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.330
I think this is on.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.770
Is it on? Okay.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.070
Good.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.370
Great.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.420
I'm going to have issues
with this thing here.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.290
Good morning, everyone,
and Congressman Aguilar.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.870
It is my great pleasure
to welcome you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.880
to the Library of
Congress today.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.740
We're so excited
that you're here.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.170
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Thank you
so much for having me, Jane.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.840
I really appreciate it and
thank you all for coming.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.300
Jane and I were just talking
that clearly this 10 a.m. block,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.970
there is a lot going
on here in Los Angeles.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.270
[Laughter].

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.570
So thank you for choosing

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.360
to spend a little
bit of time with us.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Yes.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.960
Thank you for choosing us.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.260
We're elated.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.930
Thank you for joining
us in celebration

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.660
of Hispanic Heritage Month.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.080
And if you're ready, I have
some questions for you.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.380
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Okay.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.680
I'm ready.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.980
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Alright.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.280
You are currently
the representative

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.230
from California's 31st
Congressional District

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.770
[inaudible] and the area
within the Inland Empire

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.720
that encompasses San Bernardino,
portions of Rancho Cucamonga,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.610
and of course, Redlands.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.590
As a former mayor of
Redlands and now Congressman

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.930
to the region, how did you
begin your political career?

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.150
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Well, I
began my political career

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.860
by just being devoted
to service.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
Right. But the most difficult
part is kind of figuring

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.100
out where you go from there.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.680
Quite honestly, I
was a staff member

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.040
for an elected official
and I loved that.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.260
I thought that was exactly
where I wanted to be

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.560
and who I wanted to be.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.190
I want to give my boss advice.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.420
I want to help make
recommendations and suggestions.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.180
I want to help make a
difference in the community.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.150
But no way, I don't want to give
any of those speeches or have

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.040
to live with these
tough decisions.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.520
And then, you know, the
more you get, I guess,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.860
comfortable with in the
public policy forum,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.740
the more comfortable I became
you know making decisions,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.240
giving advice, having a
little bit more of an opinion

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.150
on where we stood, the
direction we should take.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.820
And so, I started actually,
in the nonprofit world.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.410
I got involved and that would be
my lesson to the young people,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.060
is you know, just get
involved in your community.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.620
No matter what you're doing,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.520
no matter where you land it's
our responsibility to work

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.250
to make our communities a better
place and there are hundreds

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.550
and thousands of ways to do.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.040
Some very publicly and
then some were private.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.070
And so I got involved
with my community.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.370
I [inaudible] the board.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.670
I was President of
Board of Directors

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.550
for Habitat for Humanity.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.850
I got to know members
of the community.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.150
I started talking about
housing, affordable housing.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.340
And then I got on the
Housing Commission

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.060
in the city of Redlands.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.320
And that was a fun
outlet to dig into policy.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.610
And then a vacancy on
the City Council opened

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.910
and I put my name in for that.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.880
And I said, actually one
of my good friends, I said,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.390
no I don't want to do that.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.300
I just got married,
baby on the way.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.040
This is not the right time.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.200
And he said, there's always
going to be an excuse.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.300
There's always going
to be a reason not

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.370
to do something that's
difficult.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.820
But, you know, take the leap.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.830
We're all there with you.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.130
What's the worse
that can happen.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.930
I said, they say no.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.230
People say no.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.530
And he said that's fine,
in the grand scheme

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.150
of things, you'll be okay.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.650
I was appointed to the City
Council as the youngest member

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.310
of the City Council
in a hundred years.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.100
Became the youngest mayor
to the city after that.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.770
And it was just a lot
of fun to really dig

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.900
into local government,
try to find solutions

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.380
without party affiliation,
without any of that nonsense.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.320
You're just working with five
people for the people to try

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.560
and make a difference
in your community.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.250
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So
how was the transition

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.900
from mayor to congressman?

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.340
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Well, you have
to build a lot more coalition.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.900
When there's four other
members of the City Council,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.760
you need three votes
to get something done.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.060
So I really just
needed two friends.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.360
[Laughter].

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.040
But in most of the votes that
we had were actually a 4 to 1,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.170
5 to zero, and that's
the way we liked it.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.120
Here it's clearly
more difficult.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.160
It's more partisan
environment once you put a D

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.720
or an R behind your name.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.560
But I'll tell you there are ways

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.250
to be successful,
even in that climate.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.720
Just like any relationship,
it just takes work.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.040
You have to build
those relationships.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.900
You have to reach out to your
colleagues across the aisle.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.620
You have to understand and be
self-aware that you're not going

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.680
to agree with, you know,
everyone on every issue.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.850
But find the two or three,
or eight or ten issues

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.940
that you do agree
with them on and try

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.380
to [inaudible] the
needle and try

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.200
to build a broader coalition.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.520
I was proud to work with
Republican from South Texas,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.820
worked on immigration.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.230
We established a great
friendship as a result of that.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.700
I really enjoy spending
time with him.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.440
But we, you know, we're going
to disagree about the tax bill,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.600
we're going to disagree
about healthcare, probably.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.080
But we don't disagree
about immigration policy,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.400
making sure that
we have [inaudible]

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.190
for so many young people.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.700
So those are the things that we
can do when we work together.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.000
It's hard in this environment.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.300
But it's possible.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.350
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez:
Okay, very good.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.870
How did your Mexican-American
heritage affect your decision

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.530
to enter politics and how does
it now affect the policies

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.000
and legislation that
you're passionate about?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.800
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: My parents
and grandparents all grew

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.360
up in the city of San
Bernardino, where I'm from.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.860
So walking around that city,
being around that community,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.400
we always had -- we always knew
our diversity was our strength.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.220
We always knew that that
sense of community kind

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.570
of brought us together.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.830
And everyone of us was
afraid of our grandmother.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.130
[Laughter].

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.070
So that's what really
united us as a community.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.590
But, I think, as you're growing
up what you find is, you know,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.320
the elected officials and
the people in the community,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.210
and the business owners, doesn't
always look like our community.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:07.210
So that's why that kind of
activism, and that discussion,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.290
you know, really kind
of [inaudible] I've got.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.040
This is what I want
for my community.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.880
I want them to be proud of
their elected officials.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.180
I want their elected officials

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.900
to look the communities
in which we serve.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.730
And that's when I got a little
bit of the bug and wanting

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.040
to give back at a higher level.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.390
And it's still to this
day the biggest source

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.230
of pride is walking into high
schools and middle schools

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.450
and talking to young people,
saying I went to this school,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.080
this is what I was doing when
I was your age, and this is --

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.310
I didn't run for
student body leadership.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.610
I didn't do any of that.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:51.040
I was shy kid and usually
in the back, played sports,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.650
and loved hanging out with his
friends, and to kind of change

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:01.660
and grow and to become a little
bit more community minded

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.140
for what my surroundings were
has been a point of pride

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.000
for me and my community.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.310
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Very good.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.210
So you are currently the Whip

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.790
of the Congressional
Hispanic caucus.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.680
What was your pathway to
this leadership position

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.610
and what does it mean to be part

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.000
of the Congressional
Hispanic caucus?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.430
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar:
So there's 31 of us

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.210
in the Congressional
Hispanic caucus,

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.160
20 House members,
and two Senators.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.450
First Latino to be a
Congressional Hispanic caucus

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.720
member is now among us,
Catherine Cortez Masto from --

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.040
a Senator from Nevada.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:48.440
So it's been fun to
be part of that group

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.740
because we share that identity.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.350
We share the communities
that we represent.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.220
But it's also forced me to think
through, okay, what's important

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.160
to New Yorkers, what's important
to Floridians and Texans,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.460
New Mexicans, and Arizonians.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.040
We're all representing
similar communities.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.140
But also, you know,
Mexican-American is my heritage.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.470
But there are Puerto Ricans in
our caucus, there are members

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.070
from Central America,
heritage from Central America.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:20.600
And so make sure we because
Latino is so inclusive

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.180
in our communities making sure

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.770
that we're truly
representing everyone,

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.480
has been a focal
point of what we do.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.570
But it's allowed me to
have these member-to-member

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.840
conversations about what's
important to your district,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.450
keeping in mind that not
every district is the same.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:45.350
There are members of the
Hispanic caucus who are Latino

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.360
or Latina but maybe they don't
represent a very large Latino

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.050
or Latina population and
so be mindful of that.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.510
Maybe their district is what
we would call a swing district,

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.810
as well.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.730
And so knowing that each of
us represents a unique piece

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:08.350
in the community and we all
come together and want to work

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.880
with one another on
these shared issues is

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.000
so incredibly fascinating
and important.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.440
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So
what does a Whip do?

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.340
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Yes.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.050
So the Whip position
is a lot of fun

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:25.040
and Steny Hoyer is the
Democratic Whip for our caucus.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.190
And so I've kind of
learned from Steny.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.470
But I will tell you the
single biggest thing

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.900
for the Whip position
is knowing your members,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.040
knowing your colleagues and
having your finger on the pulse

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.340
of what they want
to get accomplished.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.960
You have to be willing
to put the shared goals

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.590
of the group before
your own personal goals.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.190
So the Whip position means
you need to know are there,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.710
in a group of 30,
are there 20 votes

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.010
for what we're talking about?

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.430
Are there 25 votes?

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.510
Or are there only five?

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.310
And maybe there are only five
but I'm one of those five.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.300
You have to have
the self-awareness,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.490
you have to have the leadership
to be able to say, I will go --

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.420
we will go where our
caucus wants us to go.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.590
And that doesn't mean that you
can't continue to learn and grow

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.680
and I always reserve the right
to try to convince my colleagues

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.040
that I'm on the right side, even
if I'm in that smaller minority.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.210
But knowing where
your colleagues are

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.570
and giving them space to make
those decisions, I think is one

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.880
of the things from my
perspective is truly a tell-tale

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.250
of Congressional leadership.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.650
You want to be able
to ask people

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.830
where they are on an issue.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.490
What is -- how would your
district analyze this issue?

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.960
Where do you come down on it?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:50.080
Well, this is what I would
do and this is how I talk

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080
about it in my community.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.560
I mean, if you think you
could get to a yes on this.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.470
But if they say no or I can't
or maybe, you have to know how

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.610
to calibrate, how to continue
that educational discussion.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.420
And we see this, questions

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.880
about the Congressional
Hispanic caucus

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.670
but I see this is a
broader Democratic caucus

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.970
that I worked in.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.200
There are a lot of our
colleagues who want

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.520
to be helpful to the
Latino community.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.370
They want to do what's right.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.230
They just don't always
know what that means

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.530
or how to talk about it.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.530
And they don't know our
community on issues.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.860
So I think a lot of this
is also our responsibility

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.270
in the Hispanic caucus
to talk to our colleagues

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.380
who don't know these
issues and to let them know

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.510
where the community stands on
something and how we might talk

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.850
about it or how you
might talk about it

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.790
if you represented a district
that doesn't look like mine

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.220
to give people the
background and the information

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.520
to make an informed decision.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.250
But at the end of the day
we just have to respect

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.830
where your colleagues
are on this

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:00.050
and that's the beautiful part of
this institution is being able.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.070
I'm the only one that's here to
represent my entire community.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.880
And that is an incredibly
heavy weight that I have

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.410
and each of us has that.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.250
So I trust that my colleagues
are making the right decision

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.550
for their communities as well.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.560
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Very good.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.120
The Library of Congress
knows your office well.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.620
And your engagement with
our surplus book program.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.000
How would you define your
relationship to the library?

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.650
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: We were talking
about this a little earlier.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.010
I am just such a huge fan of the
Library of Congress and the work

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.710
that everyone in this
institution does.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.490
But, I'll tell you,
a lot of work

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.670
that they do is unknown,
under appreciated.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.960
And so, part of, I think, what
we need to do as members is

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.220
to be advocates for
the institution.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.820
But to also let our colleagues
know about programs like this.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.850
That maybe aren't
as widely utilized.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.790
And to let them know
the services

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.130
that the library can provide

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.180
to our communities back
[inaudible] this is one

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.200
that has been so
impressive to me.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.800
The fact that the library
is so generous with books

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.100
for our local school districts.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.720
We worked with you to send
a little care package.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.730
There was a shooting in a
school in San Bernardino,

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:28.150
where I'm from, and to be able
to send a care package of books

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.160
to this school after that
event to hopefully, kind of,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.840
raise their spirits, give them
something new and something

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.090
that they can tie them to
us was really powerful.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.010
And I always love that
it's stamped, it's courtesy

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.310
of the Library of Congress.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.400
Because I want that young person
to also open that and say,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.700
what's the Library of Congress?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.010
And well, let's research that.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.310
Let's talk about that.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.930
Let's talk about
what that means.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.950
And to know that someone across
the country was generous enough

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.350
to send them these books
is just means a lot to me

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.300
and means a lot to
all of us members.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.420
But it was -- when
you come and visit us,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.410
in our Congressional offices,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.490
you probably told me
about this program.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.930
Probably told me 50 things
that you do but, you know,

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.230
you just get into
town, and you're trying

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.530
to build your staff
and it's very tough.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.280
So it was a couple of
other members saying, hey,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.580
do you do this program?

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.600
You should make sure
your staff follows up

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.330
and we're all doing this.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.590
So it's also a little bit
of that peer pressure.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.990
And so that's where it's
important for members

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.630
to know the services that you
guys provide because I want

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.630
to be a resource to those new
first-year members who are going

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.930
to come in December
and say, hey,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.230
be sure you utilize
these services

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.530
and you talk to the librarian.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.230
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Great, great.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.120
I hope you know about our
initial library services

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.710
for the blind and
physically handicapped,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.110
and also our veteran's
history project, as well.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.410
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Yes, yes.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.710
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez:
Those are important.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.040
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Those
are important projects.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.490
And a little bit
about my history.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.820
My first job was working
for my grandfather

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.520
who was a legally blind operator

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.710
and there is actually a federal
program that trained him,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.190
called the Randolph-Sheppard
Act.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.280
And he served in the
Korean War, he came back,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.680
and he lost his eyesight
through a disease

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.860
when my dad was in his teens.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.320
And my grandfather
had to be retrained.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.510
And he didn't know that
this program existed.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.810
A friend had told him and
my grandmother about it.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.110
And so he became a legally
blind owner-operator.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.860
So the programs that you
provide go far in line.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:41.110
And that's what I appreciate
so much about the library.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.840
And so much about our processes.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.920
Those investments to make sure
that everyone has a chance

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.000
and an opportunity
that are so vital.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.960
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Thank you.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.840
What have been the legislative
goals of the Hispanic caucus

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.000
for the 115th Congress and
what progress has been made?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.360
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Well, it feels
like we've been playing a lot

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.660
of defense, obviously.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.380
And this isn't a
partisan discussion

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.440
and I'll tell you it's
been incredibly frustrating

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:15.420
because I do feel that the
administration is either

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.230
planned, executed,
or fomented some

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.530
of the most anti-immigrant
positions

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.830
that we've seen in a long time.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.910
And so to try to dial that
back, try to push back

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.600
with information, to try to
make sure that my colleagues

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.040
and I stand up for the right
things and that we push back.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.780
You can see the administrations
policies

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.550
when they're wrong
has been something

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.330
that the Hispanic caucus
has tried to execute

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.970
and put together a
plan on how we do that.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.470
It's been very public
that our plans,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.160
our focus are comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.400
But we don't just
want to be the caucus

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.840
about comprehensive immigration
reform when we have Latinos

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.140
and Latinas who are in
incredible positions,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.440
in small business committees,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.740
energy and commerce committees
throughout this Congress.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.770
We have individuals who have
the skill set and working

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.170
on these issues for decades.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.120
But this is clearly an
issue that is very personal

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.420
to us and means a lot.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.080
And so to ensure that we
are making progress toward

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.040
comprehensive immigration
reform has been a goal.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.630
And clearly the most important
thing right now is making sure

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:26.670
that we have a permitted
fix for guideline to ensure

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.870
that young people
who have DACA status.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.660
Those who are DACA eligible
have a path to citizenship,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.060
is something that we will
continue to fight for.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.380
That's the bill that I
authored and a bill that I plan

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.000
to continue to be a part of
in the next Congress as well.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.390
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Recently
we've seen a renewed interest

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.630
in politics and political
involvement

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.850
from younger generations.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.980
What advice and words of
encouragement would you give

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.860
to those who may be interested
in getting involved in local

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.160
and national politics?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.960
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Do it.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.260
[Laughter].

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.560
Jump in the water is fine.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.860
We need -- and here's
the important thing.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:10.000
We need young people to feel
committed to public service.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.500
And I want people to see members
of Congress conduct themselves

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.040
in the right way, to work
in a bipartisan manner.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.030
I want people to see that and to
say, yes, I want to do that job.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.490
I want to serve my community.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.560
I don't want them to see
the food fight of, you know,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.880
what's on TV sometimes,
the back and forth,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.870
and to get discouraged and
say, I don't want to do that.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.190
You know, so, how we conduct
ourselves is also incredibly

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.610
important because we
need another generation

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.810
and continued generations
of young people to say,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.420
I want to serve, I want to make
a difference in my community.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.360
It may not always be
the most glamorous,

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.560
it may not always
make the most money,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.460
but I can make an incredible
difference in my community.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.530
And so that's what
I hope that you --

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.120
I hope that you get there.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.870
I hope that you find that
sense of community in place

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.210
and want to give back.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.990
Like all of our parents and
grandparents to be able to make

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.620
that community a better place

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.080
and to leave it a little
bit better than we found it.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.620
That's getting more difficult
to say that we are doing that.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.320
And so we're going
to need policymakers

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.750
and thought leaders
to help us get there.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.430
The only way we do
it is by making sure

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.840
that the leadership tables
look like the communities

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.920
in which we serve, to make sure
that everyone has an opportunity

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.220
to give feedback and
help make a difference.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.370
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: What does
Hispanic Heritage Month mean

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.000
to you and how will your office
be celebrating this month?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.340
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: We attend a
lot of events and celebrate

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.640
and honor our heritage
and hone our culture.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.940
But we try to do
this year-round, too.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.240
Making sure that we honor
every culture in a community

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.540
and to make sure that
they feel welcome.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.660
And that's the story of
our country is to make sure

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.410
that immigrants are
welcomed and appreciated.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:05.800
And so, we want to make sure
that, especially this month,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:12.940
we're doing everything we
can to honor our communities

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.190
and to make sure that we're
doing outreach, to make sure

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.110
that everyone feels
that they have a place

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.060
in our society, community.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.000
And to make sure that they
are loved and respected,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.610
I feel is important
piece of what we can do

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.000
and that's what our office
will continue to plan to do.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.060
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Great.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.460
Once again, thank you.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.940
Today is a reminder
that diversity is one

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.430
of our country's
greatest strength.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.090
And Hispanic-Americans have
always been and will continue

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:47.370
to be a key part of this rich
mosaic, which makes our country

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.840
so unique and special.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.650
With that being said, maybe --

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.080
let's check to see if
we have any questions

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.720
from our gathering today.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.700
And we are delighted to have
our Gonzaga students here today.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.000
Thank you for coming.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.340
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar:
Thank you for coming.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.640
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Yes.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.940
So questions?

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.850
Oh, come on.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.920
&gt;&gt; My name is Carlos
[inaudible].

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:30.690
How do you feel that we as
Latinos do to overcome this gap

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.160
that we see at [inaudible].

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.090
You're at a position where
you can give us advice.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:42.990
So what's something you can
say to us that will push us

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.430
and drive us to be
comfortable with that.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.730
Can you talk about that?

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.630
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: I think
what I would tell --

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.020
thank you, Carlos,
I appreciate it.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:57.670
What I would tell you is if
you are just by virtue of being

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:03.120
in those seats, you are doing
things that make your families

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.970
and your community so proud.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.590
But the road needs
to go further.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.260
You need to continue to
make your families proud,

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.060
to continue your education,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:18.290
and to continue being thoughtful
members of the community.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.350
That's how we make a difference.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:25.300
And what I would say is, you
know, many people are going

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.820
to be the first in your
family to do a lot of things.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.120
I was.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:37.690
I was the first in my
family to go to college.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.220
I was the first in my family
-- this sounds very weird,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.520
but it was -- I was
in my mid-20s,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.820
and I was making more money

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.120
than my parents were
making at the time.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.620
And there's a responsibility
that goes behind that.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.060
And it isn't about
dollar and cents.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.160
It's about the responsibility
to pay it forward.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.430
The responsibility to
help teach someone else,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.140
to help mentor someone
else to be successful.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.250
And so, as you go
through your schooling,

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.920
as you go through your life
education, you're going

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.710
to meet people who help you.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.150
And the most special thing is
the individuals who help you,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.780
who you learn later in life,

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:22.050
there is no reason why
they needed to help me.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.040
They took an interest in me
and they saw something in you

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.040
when you didn't see
it in yourself.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.760
And I have those
individuals in my life.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.140
And it's tough not to
get emotional about it.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.010
There were individuals who
believed in me much more

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.050
than I believed in myself,
when I was in college

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.130
and when I went into business.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.970
And I wouldn't be
here without them.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:50.180
But they meant the world to me.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.700
So make sure you just pause
and that you think about what

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.570
that individual is
doing to help you.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.300
It could be giving
you political advice,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.310
it could be giving you
educational advice.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:07.040
It could be giving you an
opportunity to have a job.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:15.210
And so what that individual
has gone through, and every one

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.930
of the individuals
that I can think of,

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:26.440
three out of the four were
individuals in my community

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.790
who were older, Caucasian,
and they saw something in me

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.090
because they knew that our
communities were changing.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.590
And they knew that -- they felt
that I could make a difference.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.510
And they thought that
just by giving me a shot,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.350
giving me some advice,
that they could help.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.360
And so find people,
surround yourself with people

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.190
who give you the
benefit of the doubt,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.490
who will help you along the way.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.360
Those are the individuals who
you want to interact with.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.410
Those are the people you're
going to learn the most from.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:29:00.070
And they're going to help open
doors for you and they're going

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.370
to be your advocates and
throughout life you're going

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.670
to have those individuals.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.640
And later when you reflect it's
going to mean the most to you.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.640
You may not know it when
you're in the middle of it

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.440
but it's going to mean
the absolute most to you.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.180
And it's going to drive you
to make better decisions

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.000
and to help open the door
for someone else behind you.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.520
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Justin [inaudible].

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.630
What is the one experience
that you had

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.050
that really has taught you
an important life lesson

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.000
that you would like to pass on?

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.240
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: I'd say,
Justin, my first experience,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.690
I guess, as a community
organizer

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.400
in politics kind
of taught me a lot.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.980
I was 10 years old.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.960
And the Exxon Valdez
spill happened.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.660
It was a big oil spill
that dominated the news.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.300
Way before you guys were born

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.580
and now you're making
me feel old.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.880
[Laughter].

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.180
I'm a pretty young guy.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.380
I saw these images on
the TV and I just --

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.680
it drove me to want
to do something.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.030
I didn't know what to do.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.350
You see images of wildlife,
birds, or oil slick all over

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.060
and the clean -- the
massive clean up efforts.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.950
And so, what I did was,
I was 10 years old,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.500
my parents were not
political at all.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.010
And they voted every
election, took us to the polls.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.030
They showed us the
importance of that.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.610
But they didn't talk
about who they voted for,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.870
we didn't have those
family conversations.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.000
And so I just started
writing letters.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.250
I wrote a letter to the CEO of
Exxon, basically telling them

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.480
that you guys messed up and
you need to pay for this.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.780
[Laughter].

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.550
And you're a terrible company.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.850
Something like that.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.150
[Laughter].

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.450
And so, I wrote it
and I felt okay.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.750
But I also felt that
I should share this.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.260
And so, I went door to
door with my neighbor.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.140
And I got people to sign
the petition, basically.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.190
Just a lined piece of paper

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.550
and I said this is
the letter I wrote

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.990
and I hope you share
this position with me

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.750
and I hope you can sign
your name and I'm going

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.070
to send it to the CEO.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.760
And my neighbors were like,
what the heck are you doing?

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.060
[Laughter].

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.370
But I think they all appreciated
that that's kind of who I was

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.680
and it was a lesson,
and that was kind

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.720
of my evolution and my growth.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.360
And what it taught me was, you
know, don't be afraid to get

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.660
out of your comfort zone.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.120
You know, don't be afraid
to try something different

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.150
that you haven't done.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.670
If it's who you are and
that's what you believe.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.970
It's not wrong.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.730
And so, I also think that your
generation is the most open

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:52.100
about so many things that other
generations are not open to.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:59.430
So use that as a tool to
encourage other generations,

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.960
my generation and others to
be more open about who you are

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.280
and I think that's an
incredibly helpful.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.320
But I took it to school,
I wouldn't let any

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.070
of my friends sign the petition.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.400
I said, you're not
18, you can't vote.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.700
You shouldn't sign this.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.910
But I went to all the teachers.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.210
[Laughter].

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.510
And so, then I sent it.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.810
I don't think it was 40
or 50 signatures on it.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.330
My aunt convinced me to send
it certified mail so I knew,

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.790
I got a little postcard
back that they received it.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.050
I kept that postcard for years.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.130
So, you know, that
was my first lesson

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.440
in organizing, in leadership.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.400
And it taught me a lot
about just kind of getting

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.700
out of your comfort zone.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.310
Being a shy kid doesn't mean
you can't make a difference

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.610
or have your voice heard.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.010
We don't want to put all the
pressure on the Gonzaga kids.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.310
[Laughter].

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.420
&gt;&gt; Representing [inaudible].

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.290
I wanted to ask you about how
others see you in Congress?

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.010
When there's this
message of America first

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.310
and we're trying to
stifle diversity.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.430
What is the message that we can
bring forward to help others say

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:19.470
that diversity is important and
how do you carry the narrative

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.770
that your past [inaudible]
community

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.070
over the majority of Americans?

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.370
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Yes.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.670
That's a great question.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.160
And my response is every
community deserves a voice

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.620
at the table and every
individual matter.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.970
I think it's generally accepted
among my colleagues is what we

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.270
should be doing.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:43.450
I think the voices we hear and
some of this fervor we hear

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.160
from the administration
is counter to that.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:52.050
But I find it -- I find that
having those conversations

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.230
with my colleagues makes me
feel a little bit more at ease.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.710
And I'm talking about
both sides of the aisle.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.530
Folks understand that we
need to solve these issues.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.500
We might not always agree on how
to get there but I do have a lot

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.380
of confidence in the
institution of Congress.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.550
I think that we can do
a lot more to ensure

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.190
that we raise our voices
and we stand up to wrongs

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.040
where we see them as a group.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.610
I do feel that we can do more.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.970
But I do think that we are
building coalitions in order

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.270
to accomplish that goal.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.130
And that's what it's
going to take.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.860
Because not every
member, as I mentioned,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.980
is going to feel comforted
knowing what it took --

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.060
what's important to
them in a community.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.210
So it's our job to
[inaudible] a segment

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.980
of the community is just not as
large as mine or someone else's.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.360
And so my belief is that
they want to do right

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.660
by [inaudible] districts.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.320
So we just have to show them.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.300
We just don't know how, yet.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.060
And so, it's on us
to show them how.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.540
To show them that the Latino
dream is the American dream.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.110
Better jobs, better wages,
all the affordable healthcare,

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.300
access to education,
better life for our kids.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.840
That's the American dream.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.060
How is that -- how
are Latinos different?

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.360
We're not.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.050
We want the exact same thing,
clean air, clean water.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.050
Those are things
that Latinos want.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.010
Not every Latino
wants comprehensive

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.310
immigration reform.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.650
And we shouldn't act
as if that's the case.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.520
But everyone wants
a better community,

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.040
better life their kids.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.580
So let's start with
that as the umbrella

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.130
by which we can have
a conversation

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.430
about all these other issues.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.340
&gt;&gt; I actually have
followed up question.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.140
You mentioned the DACA bill --

00:35:48.140 --> 00:36:20.500
[ Inaudible question ]

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.230
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar:
That's a great question.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:29.760
And I think what we try to do
is you almost work backwards.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.360
It's what's the goal?

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.050
Who do we want to help?

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.620
And then let's make sure
that the legislation fits

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.900
that -- fits that goal.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.210
So at first, quite honestly,
we had to decide in our piece

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.090
of legislation who
we wanted to help.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.980
And then that would serve
as the basis for the --

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.050
road map for the legislation
that we would develop.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.340
And clearly, and I
was very selfish,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.370
in all of my conversations
with my Republican colleagues.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.670
I would rather try
to help more people.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:06.090
And so that meant removing
barriers, removing age caps,

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.530
that meant removing whether
someone actually has that status

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.360
or whether they meet
the DACA criteria,

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.120
what we call DACA eligible.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.080
I want them to --
I wanted to make it

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.380
as expansive as possible.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.190
So my colleagues agreed.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:30.130
And so we were able to do
something that was a piece

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.340
of legislation, that was more

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.000
than 700,000 who
have DACA status.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.300
It was two -- it would help 2
million eligible [inaudible]

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.600
people receive the
path to citizenship.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.900
But you have to work backwards.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.740
And you have to, you know,
you have to work to ensure

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.040
that we honor that humanity

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.440
and that we're all
focused on the same goals.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.350
But you have to stop to
realize that not everyone

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.930
in Congress reads these
pieces of legislation.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.410
And part of what we have to
do is we have to message it

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:58.710
and we have to sell it.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:04.620
And so, honestly, we
told many individuals,

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.040
look help us with this DACA fix.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.210
This will put folks on
the path to citizenship.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.130
And that was all they needed.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.050
We didn't even get into
the details about age caps.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:17.840
We didn't get into details
of you have a free pass

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.950
to citizenship if you
work, go to school,

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.510
if you've served the military.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.810
Some people wanted
more information

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.110
and some people didn't.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.130
Some people this
is a different part

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.100
and why I think it puts a
[inaudible] on relationships.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.520
And some people see the
messenger and say, okay, yes.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.040
I've got no -- I've worked
with you on things before.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.290
I know that when you
talk to my staff,

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:46.630
but I know that you wouldn't
try to pitch me on something

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.040
that wasn't right
for my community.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.910
And so, I think, that puts a
premium on the relationships

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.210
that we have as members
to say, hey, you know,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.510
worked with me on stuff.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.810
Let's talk about this.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.110
Let me answer your
questions here.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.410
I want to pitch to
your staff on this.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.320
I want to go through
the details of this.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:08.500
Because oftentimes, what became
a hurdle were leadership offices

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.120
here in Congress that
were giving members

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.570
incorrect information.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:17.470
And so we had to debunk that.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.840
We had to put on out
our own topic points.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.510
We had to put out
frequently asked questions.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:27.070
And we had to really work
on a one-on-one basis

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.520
with our colleagues
to educate them

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.820
and tell them [inaudible]
piece of legislation.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.120
So making sure that the goal
was always the same for us.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.740
We have good partners and a good
piece of bipartisan legislation.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.410
And the goal is the
same for both of you.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.460
That's a great place to start.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.590
And so that's what we try to do.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:52.230
There are a lot of other
social and societal discussions

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.780
that we could have
under that discussion.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.620
But honestly, we were
just so laser focused

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.280
on how do we add
five co-sponsors?

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.080
How do we get this
think on the floor?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.760
How do we improve this
coalition of the bill?

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:16.480
You know, those were the
things that we were focused on,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.780
the very micro issues

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.080
of [inaudible] something
that happens.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.380
And it was just an honor
to be part of that.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.680
I'm going to go down to
Texas and talk a little bit

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.980
about the path forward
on immigration

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.280
with Representative
Hurd this weekend.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:32.610
And I hope that we can continue
this bipartisan dialogue

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.340
that needs to --
productive piece

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.660
of legislation that
we can enact.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.930
And put on the President's
desk in the next Congress.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:49.020
Again, I want to thank you and
the Society for having me --

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.340
I don't think it's time
to close yet but thank you

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.640
so much for the invitation.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.940
It really means the world to
me to be able to share some

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.240
of my experiences and talk
about my time in Congress.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:41:00.120
&gt;&gt; Alda Migoni: Oh, thank you.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.300
Before closing there are still
a little time for questions.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.280
But we -- I do feel kind
of separated from Congress

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.690
and I suppose you are our boss.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.990
There are a lot of times
when [inaudible response]

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.290
and I just really appreciate
that you took the time to speak

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.590
to us and to [inaudible] the
issues and to speak [inaudible].

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.010
So that's great.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.750
We are a tunnel away.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.050
[Laughter].

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.350
Any other questions?

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.650
5

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.000
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: We
have someone here, too.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.250
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is [inaudible].

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:41.090
My question is Congressman,
there is talk

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.130
about [inaudible] task force
American citizens along the

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.800
[inaudible] Mexican borders.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.100
What are your thoughts
about this?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.400
Do you support it?

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.690
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar:
No and this stems

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.750
from a Washington Post
article that was recently put

00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:03.550
out where the Trump
administration is challenging

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.800
citizenship, challenging
DACA immigration

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.500
that individuals have
used to secure citizenship

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.520
and legal permanent resident
status and citizenship.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.110
And look, I think -- and
this is what's difficult.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.070
I want we -- there's
a lot we need to learn

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.130
about the questions they're
asking and what they're doing.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:22.690
I have signed on to some letters
to the Secretary to ask some

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.500
of these questions, of USCIS
and of Homeland Security.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.290
And I look forward
to the responses.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.150
What I would say is, we
don't know enough yet.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.180
But what we have heard,
troubles [inaudible].

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:40.470
And I feel like that statement
can apply to so many things here

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:45.600
in the immigration space
from this administration.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.860
But I want to make decisions
that are based on fact,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.300
based on correct information.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:59.990
But if they are going to
individuals, if they are looking

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:07.300
at documents and
challenging documents

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.670
without basis then I have
a huge problem with that.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:15.750
If they are targeting border
communities and creating hurdles

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:21.890
and roadblocks in order to
stifle someone's continued --

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.330
LPR status or their
citizenship, then I'm going

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.630
to have a huge problem
with their activities.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.350
So we need to make sure that
we get the right information.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.550
We get to know who
they are talking to.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.770
And what questions
they are asking.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:39.440
But I'll tell you, certainly
the appropriations committee

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.740
and all that's questioned,
you know,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.040
what we were doing in committee.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.190
I passed an amendment that
surprised me, passed unanimously

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.740
in the Homeland Security
subcommittee

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.940
that prohibits the
administration

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.800
from deporting anyone
with active, valid status.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.090
And active, valid status who
has served in the military.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.150
And I thought it was
going to be controversial

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.690
and they accepted the amendment.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.450
We haven't passed that bill.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.140
That's one of the CR
that is carried forward.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.760
But we have our colleagues
on record that they are --

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:18.070
that they want to pause
on any deportation

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:19.370
of individuals with DACA status,

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.180
which is a good place to start.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:26.270
[inaudible] other proposals,
like that you mentioned,

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.650
that give me a great deal
of anxiety and heartburn

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.530
because it's [inaudible]
to send a message

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.260
to our community
that in some way,

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.560
the administration is watching
and action you have taken

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.040
in the past could
be brought back up.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.040
public charges in the
news, this week as well.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.170
So the fact that the
administration wants to try

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:56.310
to prevent U.S. born citizens
from utilizing services

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.190
for United States citizens,
whether that be SNAP,

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:59.490
whether that's Headstart,

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:05.100
or whether that's healthcare,
troubles me greatly.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.200
Because those are things,
I think, are out of bounds

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.620
and those are things
that are in line

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.550
with who we are as a community.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.930
Definitely in line
with the guidance

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:18.420
that Congress has given.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.540
So we need to make sure that we
push back but we need to do it

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.880
in a way that uses information
that we're gathering right now,

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.210
the administration has been very
slow to give us those details.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:35.080
So I look forward to survey and
to getting more information.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.520
And if there is a change
in the next Congress,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.910
I would hope the
administration will be --

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.750
our tools to encourage them

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:47.100
to be more responsible
will be utilized.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.430
So we'll continue to ask these
questions and to make sure

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:56.280
that they're treating everyone
correctly without harassment,

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.580
without discrimination.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:28.000
[ Inaudible question ]

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.150
A little bit of what I said
before is to surround yourself

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.740
with people who believe in you.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.040
Right?

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.340
And once you have that
core group of friends

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.990
and family members, it doesn't
matter what anybody else says.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.470
You can turn off that noise.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:46.150
But, look, my path is
probably similar to yours.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:50.370
I have people -- when I was
accepted to college, who said --

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:55.330
I got a high school classmate
who was valedictorian

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:59.510
and we went to the same
university and he said,

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:04.160
that I got into the same
school he did because of I got

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.270
to check a box that said
I was Hispanic or Latino.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:12.070
And in some way, in their minds,
the contributions and the work

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:17.080
that I had done in high
school to get there

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.370
and so there are going
to be individuals

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.170
who minimize what you've
done to get to where you are.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:27.300
And the tough part of it is,
you know, pushing through that,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:33.440
knowing who you are, surrounding
yourself with friends who are

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.430
in similar positions, making
sure you always have somebody

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.730
to talk to about that.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.080
It may not always
be a family member

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.620
because not every
family member is going

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:47.250
to have those experiences.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:51.160
So making sure you have this
corporate friends around you

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.910
who are looking out
for you is important.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.100
That will help you push
through that adversity.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.480
But don't every let
anyone minimize the work

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.590
that you've done to
get to where you are.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:08.300
And now different people
handle things differently.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.060
I just kind of shrugged
and kind of laughed it off.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.290
And that's fine.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:19.100
I don't mind that, I'm a
pretty even keeled person.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.040
I'm not a screamer or yeller.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.560
But I was pretty
fired up about that.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:29.790
And it drove me to want to
do better and to want to --

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:34.350
you know, it's always good,
it's always healthy to walk

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.180
with a little chip
on your shoulder.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.410
To have self-awareness
to say, look,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:40.750
not everyone thinks
I can do this.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.760
But I think I can do this.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.830
And I think a little
bit of that is healthy.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:49.040
And so just know that
there are a lot of people

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.580
that want you to succeed.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.550
And your community
needs you to succeed.

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.490
And so that needs to always
be in your background.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.790
People you've never met.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.090
People you don't know.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.390
They want you to succeed.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.690
They want you to do well.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:07.430
And that will help you to kind
of push through any negativity

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:08.730
that you may hear or see.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.230
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible]
Gonzaga.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:20.680
You mentioned that you were
the first in your family

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.550
that had gone to college.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.280
My mother also was.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.080
Why do you --

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:38.610
[ Inaudible question ]

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:39.910
&gt;&gt; Pete Aguilar: Yes.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.540
So my advice is try everything.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.520
And that's why -- I love --

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.220
I went to a liberal arts
college and I loved that.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.240
I went in thinking that I was
going to be a business guy.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.540
I loved business.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.040
It was kind of what
piqued my interest.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.590
And I kept taking these
government classes

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.990
and finally a government's
professor said, hey,

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.800
I'm going to have to kick you

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.570
out of class unless
you change your major.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.870
[Laughter].

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.310
And so you don't know what
you're truly going to love

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.880
until you try a bunch
of these things.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.180
Right?

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:15.450
That's why your parents let you
play musical instrument while

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.720
you're doing sports,
while you're doing art.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.020
You just don't know.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.540
I mean, I've got a 12-year-old
and a 9-year-old right now.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.410
And they are driving
my wife and I crazy

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:27.040
because they want
to try everything.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.200
And we want them to do that.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.860
We want them to find something

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.390
that they're truly
passionate and love.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:39.010
I'll tell you, when you do that
and the light clicks, you know,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.750
your Mom's going
to be proud of you.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:45.880
You're going to feel like you're
ready to make the next step.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:51.180
So that's going to be a powerful
thing but don't feel the need

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:56.420
to just do one or two things
or just try one or two things.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:02.290
You know, you guys are
going to be going to college

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:03.840
and visiting schools and you
know, visit a couple of schools,

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.430
visit some that you think isn't
necessarily, like, I don't know

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.730
if that's right for me.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.840
But just get out of your
comfort zone and see.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.300
Walk around that campus and see

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.080
if you can envision
yourself being there

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.840
and contributing there.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.290
Those are things, I think that
will make your parents proud.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.560
And will lead to you
being successful.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.500
But, you know, get out
of your comfort zone

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:35.050
and take some different classes
that you may not always like.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.430
I really think that will
help make you a more

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:37.730
well-rounded student.

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.110
It will help you focus
on what you truly like.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:42.800
I didn't know about how
much I disliked science

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.770
until I took astronomy.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:46.090
And I said, this is hard.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:47.390
There's a lot of math.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:48.690
I thought I was going
to look at the stars.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:49.990
[Laughter].

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.290
That was astronomy.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:55.050
Man. And so, I said, I'm
going back to government.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:58.610
I told my friends I picked
government over business,

00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:59.910
I doubled major in both.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.260
But I picked government
because I loved that I could --

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:09.110
it only mattered if I could make
an argument in those classes.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:13.010
If I could make an argument it
didn't matter what my position

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:14.570
was as long as I could prove it.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.620
In business and in math,
right, there's always answers.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.390
There's always answers
to these questions.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:23.100
But in government, let's
talk about these issues.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.620
Let's talk about 2nd amendment.

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.370
Let's talk about
what this means.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:30.450
And if you can, you know, argue
it and believe it and back it

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.160
up with facts and
citations, you're going

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.900
to do well in those classes.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.200
I wanted to do that.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.220
I wanted to kind
of make my argument

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.450
and to give my viewpoints.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:46.630
So be comfortable enough to
know that there are other things

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:50.460
out there that you may not
even have taken classes

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.250
on that you may grow to love
and be passionate about.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:57.590
Every one of us in professionals
has these types of stories.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.690
So just be prepared
that you're going

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.050
to always continue to learn.

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:03.670
I tried to -- in these
roles people will give you

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:04.970
a microphone.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.930
They expect you to talk for,
you know, a long, long time.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:12.350
And I truly just love hearing
what other people think

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.650
and listening and learning.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.000
Never stop, and the
librarians will tell you thin,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.300
this is a journey,
never stop learning.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:26.280
And just be aware enough
that even if something is

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.940
where you truly love,
keep learning,

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.240
keep reading, keep absorbing.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.540
And you're going to do --
you're going to be just fine.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.610
You're going to make
your Mom proud.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.100
But don't feel it's a huge
weight on your shoulders.

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.520
Right. You're doing exactly
-- she may know sacrifices

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.290
and she took those -- she made
those decisions so you could be

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.930
in the chair that
you're in right now.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.800
Know that, acknowledge that.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.100
But that's not a weight.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.790
You should be proud of that.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:55.710
Your parents are going
to be proud of you

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.210
in your next steps
and your journey.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.730
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:04.140
And we're all excited to
see what you guys do next.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.490
Having to honor your family and
your culture and your heritage.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:09.790
My grandmother told me two
things every time I would

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:11.090
leave here.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.870
I could just go to the
store and come back.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.660
And she'd tell me two things.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:24.610
Right. Which are to be careful
and never forget who you are

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.280
and where you came from.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.540
She tells me that and
I always think about it

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.980
because I have an obligation
to family, to community

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.280
to make this world a
little better place.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.580
That's what I want to do.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.880
And that's what you could do.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.180
I know that's what you could do.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:52.650
[ Applause ]

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:54.230
&gt;&gt; Alda Migoni: On behalf
of the Library of Congress

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.130
and the Hispanic Cultural
Society at the Library

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.050
of Congress, thank you so much
for this moderated conversation.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:00.780
I'd like to thank
you both personally

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.010
for just a really illuminating
and fun conversation.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.040
And this is a turbulent time.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.130
So it's great to have
these words of wisdom.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:11.910
And I'm really happy that
we also have our high school

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.210
students in attendance.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.160
I did want to plug,
on the same note,

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.980
we had a HACU intern
ask a question.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.320
And I'm a former HACU intern.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.970
So before you leave
off to college,

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.740
look up these type
of internships.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.000
It's a Hispanic Association
of Colleges and Universities.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.400
They give you paid government
postings when you're in college.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.710
So that will actually help
you try everything, you know.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.300
You could be placed
in a government agency

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.600
like the Library of Congress

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.280
and realize you want
to be a librarian.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.900
Or realize you don't,
and that's fine, too.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.200
[Laughter].

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.740
But thank you again.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.290
And I do want to plug the rest

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.660
of our Hispanic Heritage Month
celebrations will continue.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.020
Tomorrow we have the America's
Award in honor of two authors

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.090
who have produced great
children's and youth literature

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.830
and in the honor of
Hispanic Heritage,

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:03.100
Latino and Latin-American
communities.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:07.020
So please celebrate with us
tomorrow here at the library

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.320
in the Jefferson Building.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.010
So thank you, everyone,
for attending.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.000
