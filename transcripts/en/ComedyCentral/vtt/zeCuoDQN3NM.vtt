00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:07.908
YO, STRAIGHT UP,
LET'S GET DRUNK, BABY.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.112
- OKAY.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.981
YO, THAT TINY PROFESSOR
WAS RIGHT.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.817
HOW AM I GONNA BE A DAD
IF I DON'T EVEN KNOW MY OWN?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.586
AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO KNEW WHO HE WAS.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.755
I FOUND MY MOMMY
IN A HALFWAY HOUSE,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.292
BUT HER ANSWER WAS NOT
AS SIMPLE AS I HAD HOPED.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.627
- YOU GOT A GIRL PREGNANT.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.295
BRING A GIRL OVER
FOR YOUR MOTHER

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.264
TO MEET THE GIRL BEFORE
YOU GET HER KNOCKED UP?

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:32.266
- I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER.
IT'S PART OF THE SHOW.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.534
IT'S PART OF--
THAT'S WHAT'S <i>DAD ACADEMY.</i>

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.902
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS TO--

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.236
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.604
LET THE DADS GET
THEIR OWN SHOW.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.807
I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF YOU
ALL BY MYSELF,

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:45.012
AND IT WAS THE GREATEST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE, MY BOY.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.015 line:0%
 
I'M LIVING IN A HALFWAY HOUSE.
I'M DOING GREAT.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.850 line:0%
 
- I WISH I COULD JUST
STAY HERE WITH YOU.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.785
I DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK OUT THERE.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.754
BUT <i>DAD ACADEMY</i>
SAYS I GOT TO FIND MY DADDY.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.355
- I COULD HELP YOU.
- REALLY?

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.657
- YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.958
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF HERE.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.160
- BUT AREN'T WE--ARE YOU
ALLOWED TO LEAVE HERE?

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.696
- FORTUNATELY,
C-CZAR IS VERY DISTRACTIBLE.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.098
THIS IS MY PLACE, OKAY?
- REALLY?

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.934
- I OWN THIS HALFWAY HOUSE.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.837
MAMA IS DOING GOOD.
- MAMA'S A BALLER, HUH?

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.272
- C-CZAR CAME AT A REALLY
GOOD TIME FOR ME.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.942
OKAY, WATCH THE DOOR, AND MAMA'S
GONNA GO OUT THE WINDOW.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:17.711
- WAIT, WHY ARE YOU
GOING OUT THE WINDOW?

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.646
HOLY CRAP,
WE'RE STRAIGHT-UP VILLAINS.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.115
[exciting music]

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.652
YO, WE OUTSIDE.
LIKE, TELL ME WHO MY DAD IS NOW.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.321
- THERE WERE A LOT OF MEN,
C-CZAR.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.856
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR DADDY IS.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.757
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PATIENTS, MOM?

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.160
- I AM A PATIENT, YOU IDIOT.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.162
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.864
BABY, MAMA'S GOT TO FLY.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.132
DO WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO.
FIND HIM, C-CZAR.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.701
- BLAP, BLAP, BLAP, BLAP!

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.637
I'M THE ONLY VILLAIN
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD!

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.172
MOM, I'M COMING FOR YOU.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.875
I JUST CAN'T RUN FAST
'CAUSE MY PANTS ARE SO LOW.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.477
- PULL THEM UP, BABY!

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.646
I'M SORRY I LIE A LITTLE.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.249
- IT WAS DISAPPOINTING
NOT TO KNOW WHO MY DAD WAS,

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.584
BUT IT WAS GREAT
TO RECONNECT WITH MY MOM.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.153
AND THAT MEANT IT WAS TIME
FOR ANOTHER SWEET TATTOO.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.056 line:0%
 
THE PRODUCER SAID
THAT THIS TATTOO SAYS,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.259 line:0%
 
"SORT OF COMING TO
TERMS WITH MY DAD,"

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.894 line:0%
 
WHICH I ALMOST DID.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.362
I STILL CAN'T READ.
