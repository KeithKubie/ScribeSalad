Speaker 1:          00:00          The general gun experience. No. One thing that exists now that really didn't exist when Obama was running for president is the impact of social media. It's just tenfold what it used to be. But with that also comes this reality that we're living in right now where there's only a few companies that are controlling the discourse in this country. Yeah. I mean, you really have essentially a Facebook, Google, youtube, Twitter, and Facebook owns Instagram. That's right. And there's, you know, a couple of other small ones, but that's the bulk of our discourse. Yeah. What concern do you have about these private companies controlling the vast majority of communication between people on social media? It's extremely dangerous. It's extremely dangerous when you think about it. And there's a few things. There's, gosh, with Facebook and Google for that matter. You know, they, they can set their algorithms, uh, Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and said his algorithm to control what information is coming across our news feed in Facebook.

Speaker 1:          01:05          What are the stories that we're seeing? Instagram, same thing with Google. They can control. When you punch in something, what are the first stories that you're going to see a on the first page that pops up? Uh, when you think about that kind of power of influence that has on the American people literally being held within the hands of a couple of people unchecked and without oversight or transparency, it's incredibly dangerous. Talk about free speech. There's just been news recently about Facebook banning certain individuals, uh, from having Facebook accounts because of their speech. They disagree with the speech that they're, they're using are the things that they're talking about, the ideas that they're pushing forward, unchecked first amendment rights going completely out the window. And the argument is a don't apply because it's a private company, right? Yes. But they're trying to get the best of both worlds.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Um, the fact that that, you know, they're claiming to say, hey, this is a free space for open communication for everyone. Right. While at the same time going and saying, actually, you know what, Joe, I don't like what you're saying about this. So we're going to ban you and whoever your friends are from, from this conversation. Um, I think that's, that's a big problem. It undermines, it undermines our first amendment rights. When you look at privacy, the privacy concerns of all the information that they're collecting and Facebook from us, all the information that they're collecting from us, uh, with Google and how they're monetizing that and selling or sharing that information with other people with really without our knowledge or agreement. Or You, you're fully sober guy did not sober guy. Yeah, I was a mess. I mentally, I felt like a mess. I mean I was, I never killed anybody or anything, but I was at, I mean, I'm an alcoholic.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Yeah. I shit in the girl's shoe and yeah, I had some fun. Oh yeah. Girl Shoe. Why what'd she do to you? Uh, nothing just invited me to stay at her house. I don't remember doing it. I was in a blackout or whatever, but um, yeah, I was all fucked up and then I woke up and, uh, I had to Piss so bad. Like, I just woke up in the bed and I was like, I got a Penn and I was like, I don't know where I am. I actually had a flight, I had to cross. I was going to the Seattle comedy competition. Did you ever do that? No. It was like, it's like a month long competition and uh, yeah. And it's not, they call it Seattle, but it's like actually all over Washington state. It's like a, you drive like three hours a night.

Speaker 2:          03:41          It's pretty crazy. Yeah. But, um, I had to like be there the next day for a month. I had like a 10:00 AM flight and I woke up at like nine 20 in the morning and this girl's bed and I was like, I gotta get the Hell Outta here. But first I gotta Piss. If I piss in this woman's bed, it's going to be, it's going to be horrible. So I ran to the bathroom and found the bathroom pissed for like a half hour, you know, those. And I've tried to like put my shit to get my, I'm all fucked up. And then I came out into her living room and her table had been like, smashed like a Chris Farley fucking table. And you're that feeling when you're fucked up, we are looking at something and you're like, that was definitely me. I can just feel like, ah, I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for that.

Speaker 2:          04:24          And then I was like, I gotta go find my clothes. So I went back into her room and uh, on the way there I saw like kind of like footprints of poop. And then I came in and she had a high top Nike sneaker that just had like a big yeah. And there was some little pieces around. And then there was like a big puddle of urine too. Like I didn't just, cause you never just shit. So I like pissed and shit, but I got it inner sneaker, like I fucking nailed it. Purpose. Well I think, I mean I was in a blackout so by, but I think what happened was I thought it was a toilet because that's not like my sense of humor. I'm not like a, I've never been like a take a shit places. So I think I just saw a cylinder twin.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Well if it's dark, it looks it's black and it's a whole, how big is her fucking choose real big feat. It was, um, it was a big woman now, so I shit in there. And then what did what, did you lose contact with her after this or no, so I was like, I gotta get Outta here cause I gotta go catch this flight. So I took my sock and put it on like a, like a puppet, like a hand puppet, a sock puppet and just kind of picked it up that way and then turn the sock inside out. Right. Which is like, like almost like a shit in the sock and threw that away. And I tried to wipe up as much of the, she asleep? No, no, they're gone. Oh my God. I thought it's like nine 30 in the morning. I thought I just went so crazy that they all fled their own home. So then I get in the cab to go to the airport. I'm missing my flight. And I texted the girl and I was like, I'm so, I want to kill myself. Like can never I can show. Sorry. Did you tell her that? I shouldn't know. I figured she knew. So she wrote back. It's okay. Yeah. Uh, it was, it was crazy. Crazy night. It was fun or whatever. And I was like, man, this girl must fucking party. Like, she's just like, okay, with the shooting, I was like, this woman's wild.

Speaker 3:          06:14          Historically there's been bears. I mean, he's got, they've got like 40 or 50 bears in this little confined space. I mean, there's nothing, there's no more, no greater abomination of nature that I can imagine than a solitary, largely solitary animals. So the confined to a bunch of them of the species. And then historically they have ripped each other apart. And Dude, it's crazy. I can actually delve into marine lens history deeper than I can. Uh, you get to hear the full spectrum of some of the things that happen in bear in mind. And it's important to note. It was a different time, different times, different things happen. And that's just, that was the, that was the, that was the norm. It's, it's, you know, starkly contrasting time to when marina and started. So, but the stories are like really, um, it's jawdropping it's really jaw dropping stuff, but it's on one hand when you have children and you bring a child to the zoo, on one hand it's really fascinating to watch this little person look at all these different animals and freak out and, and see how amazing it is.

Speaker 3:          07:14          But that's the only pro is introducing human beings, like little human beings in particular to these animals. Everything else is a con except for the animals that are like really endangered and they protect them and help breed them. And then sometimes they were responsible for some reintroduction efforts. But other than that, it's an animal prison man. Weird. I don't take the position or ideal, I don't, I'm not at this person that's trying to represent an ideology necessarily. I'm not against all zoos, but I have to say that there's nothing more sad than seeing elephants. Cats, bears. I mean, cats, man, the cats, when they're pacing back and forth, I mean, just get him out of there. Who serve, whose purpose are you serving? Is that good for you? I mean, seeing an animal that's got zoo coast, this, I mean, it's a, it's, it's, it's a mental case and we don't know what the fuck's going on in their head. So we have no idea who those people just to watch and think, this is just maybe normal or something. Right. A lot of people were not. See because the veil is only now it's sort of coming off and people are started now getting the truth, uh, on the matters. You start to see things for what they are. Like if Tom Cruise decided to come out of Tom Cruise is gay and he decided to come out, like that'd be a real problem.

Speaker 2:          08:20          You know what? I was talking to somebody about this the other day, you know, it would be a hilarious movie idea, a gay couple because Tom Cruise and John Travolta, John Travolta, John Travolta gets kidnapped and gay. Tom Cruise has to save his gay husband John Travolta and, but other than that, it's a real action movie. Wow. It's just gay. I like it. Would that be fucking cool? Like just a straight get, if anyone out there's a screenwriter that have addict cause I'm never going to write it. Would that fly when people enjoy that? Like if it was really good like John Wick style? I think it would, I really think it would if it was, if the guy does kick, it's not like gay guys are like a feet and if I know plenty of like rough gay guys that will whoop your ass bro. Bears Bro. They got, they got their own ground.

Speaker 2:          09:11          That's how fucking bad these guys are. Uh, yeah, I too really it would be fucking so cool. Like, and he was gonna yet cause that's how I feel with someone like drunk coming out. I'm like, I don't care. Okay. I know it's never come up are we've been good friends for a decade. Just never came up. Yeah. Like it. He didn't seem that interested in women, but I don't, I also don't think he's not introduced. Just maybe there's definitely a spectrum. Right. And so people are Joseph. Yeah. And that's fine too. Yeah. Yeah. I'm also not Matt, like if I were on the spectrum, I think I would absolutely do it. Yeah. I'm just not on the spectrum like I, but in terms of opportunity, there's a lot of nights a year, Joe. Oh yeah. There's 365 nights a year. Oh yeah, you can, you're not going to do the Pussy Dick Pussy.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Yeah. Go back and you go back and forth. Same Nice. Split it up. Dahmer. I had the best joke about that. He goes, he goes, I, he goes, this is how little I give a fuck. He goes, I wish I was gay just so I could come out. Yeah. It was, I wish, I wish I had a secret like that. Yeah. That's how little I give a fuck. It's true. It's like his joke about I'm gaining weight for a movie. I don't know what the movie is yet, but it's fucking great joke. Um, yeah, but the gay action movie would fantastic. I like it. I do too. I, within a year or two, people would be definitely ready for it.

Speaker 4:          10:32          You want to hear the scariest Ai Story? I know. Oh, it's old, right? It's like an dim the lights from the catalog, but it's from like the early days and gather round children. This is like early days of Darpa. Okay. And this is when we were really seriously afraid that the Russians were going to send, you know, a hundred thermo nuclear warheads at Washington and take out the whole country. Okay. Right. So Darpa sets up this station at the top of the world, um, to monitor the Soviet launch. So that, you know, cause it only takes 24 minutes for an ICBM to get from the launch pad in Russia to hit New York or Washington. Okay. So we set up the station up there, um, and to monitor this. So we would have some kind of a jump on this. Okay. Like we'd learned at about eight minutes. My God, the, you know, it was a radar station.

Speaker 4:          11:27          That station called the [inaudible] site or Jay site is connected to the no rad station in Cheyenne Mountain, you know the one from the movies, right. Okay. And it's like the first week of business and the guys that are sitting there in the station looking for the alert are sitting there and they've been trained like the alerts never go off and all of a sudden the alerts go from one, two, three, four. Number five is end game. Okay? So information that the technicians are getting is now 1000 Soviet thermo nuclear missiles are on their way to Washington DC with 99.9% certainty. Actual story. Okay, the guy panics but he trusts, he says, wait a minute, you know, cause he supposed to now give a launch code, let's try and get the generals on the phone. They can't get the Pentagon general in charge of no Rad. They get a Canadian guy named general Sleeman and slim and you know, my God, we should we launch, should we launch Slamon's like wait a minute.

Speaker 4:          12:26          Human thought. He remembered that the night before he thought he saw Chris Jeff on TV at the UN. You know that him, he's famously banging his shoe and he says, where's Cruise Jeff? Right now they check. He's in New York City. Why would the Soviets send a thousand nuclear weapons are way while their own leaders in New York. They said, I don't know sir, but the radar returns are reporting this and they're so someone had the idea at that be mu site to go outside and lo and behold, what was there a big full moon. The system was reading the moon moving and misinterpreted it as a thousand nuclear thermonuclear ICBM. BMS coming crummy didn't launch. So we came that close to the end of the world. I mean, and it's an astonishing story. The documents are now declassified, but is this an actual indication of why that element of human intervention, why trust, why other information like, oh, I think I saw Khrushchev on the TV last night is so important because the machine said with 99.9% certainty this is happening, you ma, we must launch in retaliation. True Story.
