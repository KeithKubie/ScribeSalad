JIM GREEN: We've been studying
the dust storms of Mars

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.867
for quite some time.

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:11.734
And there's a particular season
where some of the dust storms

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.900
can actually go global.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.667
Not just regional, but global.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:21.000
Dust storms on Mars can
be absolutely enormous.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.266
They can be 20 to
30 kilometers high.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.367
And in fact, the
dust can get charged.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.300
And in the case of these
really tall dust storms,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.467
lightning can strike.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.367

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.200
ANDY WEIR: These
dust storms are huge.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.533
They can cover
the entire planet.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.300
And they can last for months.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.233
They're visible from space.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:43.433
Mars just kind of turns
into a hazy red ball.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.266
And we can't see
surface, uh, features

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.033
anymore with our satellites.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.367
The dust, it's not like sand.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:51.700
It's like talcum powder.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.066
It's-- it's very, very
microscopically small,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.033
nasty dust particles.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.600
And if they get into your lungs,
it's a human safety issue.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.166
So, uh, you would
want to try to keep

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.166
it out as much as possible.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.667
STEPHEN PETRANEK: There's
a lot of dust on Mars.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.567
You know, we've
learned from our rovers

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.133
on Mars that they're constantly
getting covered in dust.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.100
And one of the problems
with solar panels

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.433
is the dust would cover
them almost instantly

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.000
or they would simply
block out the sun

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.633
so much that they don't work.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.834
If you got a dust storm that
lasted for a month on Mars,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.467
and you were relying on solar
power, you'd be in big trouble.
