00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.506
Let's take a look at
the alien adventure app.

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:04.789
You're going to see this
app in different forms, but

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:09.070
the core concept for the app will be the
same every time that you work with it.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.480
You start with their hero robot who
needs some help exploring this strange

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.900
new planet.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.210
Above the robot,
we see some dialogue, and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.590
if we tap the screen then we can
progress through the conversation.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.770
So tap the screen, and
our robot starts moving along.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450
And we've reached our
first alien encounter.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.188
I'm going to be quiet for now, and
I'm going to let you read the dialog.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:46.895
Well, that wasn't so good.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:49.620
Our robot didn't give
the alien anything.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.030
But that's where you come in.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.130
Each time a robot encounters an alien,
a question is going to be asked.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.580
It'll be your job to correct
the code responsible for

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.532
making the robot's decision.

00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:01.580
I'm going to go ahead and
make a quick fix and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.590
see what it might look like if
a robot answers more intelligently.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.700
Okay, let's give this another go.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.450
I'll tap and
I'll let you read the dialog.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:51.840
Nice, the robot made it through.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.270
Now you probably noticed in this demo,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.610
each alien always asks
the same question.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.655
They were looking for the most valuable
object in the robot's inventory.

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:02.645
That won't always be the case.

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:03.455
As you work on this app,

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:07.985
we'll keep introducing new more complex
questions, but I know you can handle it.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.835
The robot's adventure depends on it.
