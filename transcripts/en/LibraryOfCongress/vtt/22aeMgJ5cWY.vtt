00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; Narrator: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Jordan: I am so honored
to introduce our next author.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.530
She's an elegant and
an exciting writer.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.840
She's the kind of person that
other writers just adore.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.780
Stacy Schiff.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.550
And boy does she know
how to pick a good topic.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.860
Unbelievable.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.920
You know, even John Stuart
was interested in Cleopatra.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.320
She is -- she somehow
brought to life Cleopatra

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.120
in a way that nobody else had.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.760
And by the way, a lot of people
knew Cleopatra for a long time.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.320
Of course she's won so many
prizes, it's fairly ridiculous.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.540
When she was a child she won the
Pulitzer Prize, for writing "Vera",

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.030
about the wife of Vladimir Nabokov.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.290
She was a runner up for the
Pulitzer even earlier in 1995.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.290
And when she comes up here
and you see how young she is,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.560
it's super annoying for the rest of
us writers [background laughter].

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
Ron Chernow, who knows how
to write a book himself,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.620
said this about Stacy.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.080
"Even if forced to, at gunpoint,
Stacy Schiff would be incapable

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.650
of writing a dull page
or a lame sentence.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.080
And David McCullough, you know,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.110
that guy that just always writes
best sellers just like Stacy?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.160
His most recent, "The
Wright Brothers".

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.290
I love what he said about her.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.790
"History in the hands of Stacy
Schiff is invariable full of life,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.860
light, shadow, surprise,
clarity of insight.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.630
And so it is again, and then some,
in her latest work, 'The Witches'.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.340
Few writers combine as she
does superb scholarship

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.060
and an exceptional
gift for language,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.260
with amazing reach
and agility of mind.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.010
It is simply a superb book.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.530
I'm going to turn it
over, setting the stage

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.220
in the hands of Stacy Schiff.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.960
She brings you back to
17th Century Massachusetts.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.450
It's an exceptionally cold winter.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.630
And the mystery begins

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.350
when a minister's daughter
starts to scream.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.150
Stacy.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: Thank you Mary.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.760
If you're here at this hour,
you are either a die-hard

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.390
or a passionate lover
of history, or both.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.740 position:56%
Or you just want someone else to
walk your dog [background laughter].

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.490
We'd like to think
that history is eternal

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.630
and immobile like Mount Rushmore.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.770
But it turns out to be
an oddly malleable thing.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.400
It has moods and fashions,
and changes of heart.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.170
It's studded with misconceptions
and outright fictions.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.710
The Pilgrim's had never heard
anybody talk about Plymouth Rock.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.690
And George Washington really
didn't have any particular grudge

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.040
against cherry trees.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.650
Some of the lushest fictions grew

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.930
up around our commemorations
of the past.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.880
Which reminds me of the
hands-down best-ever library joke.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.930
A man walks into his
local library --

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.950
I can't tell this with
a straight face.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.910
A man walks into his local library
and he asks, "Can you tell me why

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.010
so many major Civil War battles
were fought on national park land?"

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.630
[Background laughter] none of
which explains what we've done

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.580
with this one immutable truth.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.230
During the summer of 1692,
upon much deliberation,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.490
the Massachusetts Bay Colony
executed 19 people for witchcraft.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.550
Those innocent men and women --
they were 14 women and 5 men --

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.870
were convicted in the Salem,
Massachusetts courtroom.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.140
They hanged several
miles away on a spot --

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.870
and this will tell you something
about how the epidemic was viewed

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.600
in its immediate aftermath --

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.180
in a spot that we can
barely locate today.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.770
Sometimes it seems as if the
trauma of an event can be measured

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.520
by how long it takes
us to commemorate it.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.510
And by how thoroughly we
mangle it in the process.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.670
Because if you go back to
Salem today to get a taste

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.640
of this startling chapter
in our history,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.970
you discover that the
town has embraced its past

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.510 position:56%
with what you might call an uncommon
fervor [background laughter].

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.880
In 1692, nearly 180 people
were accused of witchcraft,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.070
but none of them was a
pirate [background laughter].

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.810
One of them was a Harvard
educated minister,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.790 position:56%
and another was the richest merchant
in Salem, but that's something else.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.500
For several hundred years, Salem
did everything it could, in fact,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.080 position:56%
to bury this chapter of its history.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.870
As late as 1952 when Arthur Miller
visited to research "The Crucible",

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.820 position:56%
the subject of witchcraft was taboo.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.330
"You couldn't get anyone
to say anything about it."

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.210
Complained Miller.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.230
The stigma lifted only with the
Salem filming of the ABC sitcom,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.740
"Bewitched" [background laughter].

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.240
I see some of you remember
that show.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.540
The conceit of that show was

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.710
that a modern housewife
had supernatural powers.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.370
And that with a twitch of her nose,
she would open the garage door;

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.620
make the vacuum cleaner work.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.530
This was annoying to
her very mortal husband.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.130
For various reasons it made
sense in 1970 to shoot a number

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.060
of sitcom episodes in Salem.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.690
And that allowed the town to
embrace its inglorious past.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.110
And here is how it did so.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.090
In 1992 it unveiled
this gleaming memorial

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.490
to Elizabeth Montgomery
[background laughter],

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.810
the television show's star.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.110
She had effectively
laundered the history.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.630
And so over the next years, Salem
vigorously re-branded itself.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.210
This is the town paper.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.190
This is the football team
[background laughter].

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.760
And this is the police cruiser.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.960
Generally, it became -- it
turned itself into "Witch City".

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.770 position:56%
Every possible slogan, you get to
see every one of these when you walk

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.740
around Salem, but this
is my favorite;

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.590
this is a t-shirt [background
laughter].

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.280
After "Bewitched", a community
of Wiccans established themselves

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.700
in Salem, and it's today a very
good place to buy crystals,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.140
or a broomstick, or a magic wand.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.370
It's also a very good place,
by the way, to get a tattoo.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.160
A witch museum opened
in a former church.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.460
The restored home of one of the --

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.110
of the 1692 judges recast
itself as the "Witch House".

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.590
And of course Halloween now
belongs completely to Salem,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.030
where October 31st is a
month-long celebration.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.990
This is particularly
ironic, as the Puritans --

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.750 position:56%
and in 1692, most of New England was
Puritan -- had a horror of holidays.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.570
They renounced Christmas and
Saints Days, and they wound

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.860
up with a calendar that
has been described as,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.180 position:56%
"The dullest in Western
civilization" [background laughter].

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.580
But in other words, you
could leave Salem today

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.260
without a hint of its
actual history.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.990
But you'd better book now if you
want a room for next Halloween.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.450
What precisely did happen in 1692?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.800
Toward the end of January, after
an especially harsh winter,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.730
two little girls began to
bark and yelp and shutter.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.030
They fell dumb.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.490
They seemed to fly across rooms.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.950
They lived in what was then
known as Salem Village.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.070
A hamlet five miles down
the road from Salem Town.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.750
And a community today known,
to its immense relief,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.220
as Danvers, Massachusetts.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.050
The girl's father and uncle was
the village minister, Samuel Paris.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.640
For some time, he resisted what
seemed the obvious diagnosis.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.680
Four years earlier, a family

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.120
of Boston children had
suffered identical symptoms.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.300
They accused a local woman of
having cast a spell on them.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.210
She hanged in November, 1688.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.230
That case was very well-known.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.690
Probably as much to the village
children as to their parents.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.020
After weeks of prayer with no
change in the girl's condition,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.620
and no other viable explanation
for it, it seemed clear

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.880
that witchcraft was at work.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.040
The girls soon named three
names, and three different --

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.090
said that three different
women had enchanted them.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.600
One of them quickly confessed
that she was, in fact, a witch.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.720
She did so in kaleidoscopic detail
with a story about yellow birds,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.700
and red cats, and black hogs.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.130
She said she'd been recruited
by the Devil himself.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.680
And that she'd flown in the
wink of an eye to Boston.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.460
She had had several accomplices.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.150
Three separate reporters
took down her testimony,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.630
which created a sensation.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.090
Immediately, grown men began
to hear unearthly sounds.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.460
They met with large, winged
beasts in the moonlight.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.000
Already the girl's symptoms
had spread to a cohort

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.820 position:56%
of teenagers; many of them servants.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.650
They would play the
starring roles in 1692.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.420
Identifying the witches.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.900
Displaying their bruises
and their bites,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.320
and their bloodied
limbs to the courtroom.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.170
Ultimately predicting whom
the witches would attack next.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.000
Fingers pointed soon
in all directions.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.200
The epidemic spread
to 24 communities.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.940
We call them the "Salem
witch trials", but Andover,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.770
Massachusetts was the village
most severely affected.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.960
One in ten of its residents
would be denounced.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.750
So many stood accused, that
witnesses confused their suspects.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.030
The youngest was five,
and the eldest nearly 80.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.860
Daughters accused mothers.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.540
Brothers their sisters.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.920
Parishioners their ministers.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.200
With astonishing frequency,
husbands tended to assure the court

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.880
that they had long suspected

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.760
that their wives were
witches [background laughter].

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.810
Let me talk for just a few minutes
about witchcraft and how it worked.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.510
What exactly was a witch?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.270
To the early Americans, she
existed -- or he existed --

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.390
as plainly as did heat or light.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.150
As one authority had
it, it was as obvious

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.000
that a spirit could convey
men and women through the air,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.410
as it was that the wind
could flatten a house.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.340 position:56%
The early American witch -- I should
add -- did not look like this.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.090 position:56%
Although there is something of "The
Wizard of Oz" about the Salem story.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.040
And nor did the 17th
Century witch look like this.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.920
This, by the way, is the
original Wicked Witch of the West,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.360
from the 1900 edition
of "The Wizard of Oz".

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.500 position:56%
I particularly like the flying
pigtail, and those unexpected spats.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.600
This is an early Halloween witch.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.900
Or it should be.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.670
There she is.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.080
The first Halloween was celebrated
without witches, and when finally,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.670
the witches appear on the
scene, the tend to be colorful.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.540
They only become --
they only dress in black

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.500 position:56%
after the 1939 "Wizard of Oz" movie.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.160
The witches of 17th Century New
Englander knew her as someone

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.460
who performed unnatural
feats by virtue

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.740
of her contract with the Devil.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.400
And from that pact, she drew
the power to transform herself

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.230
into cats, wolves, rabbits.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.030
A witch could be a man or a woman,
though she was more often female.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.410
And she had a menagerie of imps,
or familiars who did her bidding.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.910
Those could be turtles or weasels.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.930
Cats, dogs, and toads
were prevalent.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.910
This 17th Century woman was feeding
her blood to her diabolical toads.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.620
This is a woman with her
great black cat familiar.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.280 position:56%
She illustrates a 1621 English case,
and in fact, this woman is acquitted

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.570
of all witchcraft charges.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.830 position:56%
These are more diabolical familiars.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.910
And you'll see that they range from
the standard issue barnyard pig

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.770
to fantastical, gargoyle-like
creatures.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.150
A surprising number
of Massachusetts men

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.690
in 1692 would report
assaults in their bed by cats.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.110
By over-sized cats.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.410
Killer cats.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.730
Glow-in-the-dark cats, or
neighbors disguised as cats.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.800
Black cats were the
favorites, though they turn

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.110
up throughout the Salem testimony.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.660
Black dogs recur in
the Salem records too,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.940
though historically English witches
tended to prefer feline form.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.790
This, by the way, is
not a witches familiar,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.950
this is our family cat
[background laughter], Moose,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.770
looking I hope just a little bit
demonic [background laughter].

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.960
A witch signed her pact with the
Devil in blood, and she enchanted

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.880
with ointments and effigies.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.170
She could be a muttering,
contentious malcontent.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:02.340
Or she or he could be explicably
strong and unaccountably smart.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.240
Both kinds of witches would turn up
in 1692, as would wealthy merchants

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.130
who were witches, sea captains
who were witches, ministers

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.340
and homeless five-year-old
girls who were witches.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.490
While her power was supernatural,
her crime was religious.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.610
And her ultimate target was
the soul rather than the body.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.970
And her connection to
the convulsing children?

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.690
Every Englishman had long known
what enchantment looked like.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.780
According to the legal guide
on many Massachusetts' desks,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.880
and which was about to land on
the Salem minister's desk --

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.650
this is the volume -- it manifested
as trances, paralyzed limbs,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.180
frothing, gnashing,
and violent shaking.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.640
In other words, the
symptoms of the Salem girls

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.160
to a T. Among the abundant proofs

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.320
of her existence was the
biblical injunction against her.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.110
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live" commands scripture --

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.230
I'm sorry to have to share with
you the basic English translation

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.370
of Exodus 22:18.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.570
Which is, "Any woman
using unnatural powers

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.300
or secret arts is to
be put to death."

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.430
That pretty much covers every
woman I know [background laughter].

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.430
When Massachusetts
establishes its legal code,

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.200
the first capital crime
was idolatry,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.410
and the second was witchcraft.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.010
Just so you know, blasphemy
comes next,

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.890
and murder only comes
after blasphemy.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.570
In the years since those
laws had been codified,

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.290
New England had indicted
about 100 witches.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.790
Massachusetts, however,
had hanged only six.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.000
So beside the mystery of the
Salem symptoms is really a

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.380
greater mystery.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.620
Why in 1692, the hasty
and merciless prosecution?

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.360
The charges were familiar
from earlier cases.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.290
Casting spells on livestock
was a common one.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.250
Salem witches enchanted
fireplaces, and muskets and wagons.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.880
They sent dishes sailing.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.940
They bit and they clawed and they
bludgeoned anyone who would refuse

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.190
to sign the "Devil's Book".

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.380
This wood cut is from
an early English case.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.540
These accused women
did not fare well.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.110
Why though are they riding a pig?

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.720
Oh, they're not riding a pig.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.980
Oh no, they seem to have gone away.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.630
Oh well. They should've been
riding a pig below that.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.500
Some witchcraft is
clearly at work here.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.550
They've been accused of pig
bewitching is the short of it.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.090
New England witches do
a great deal of flying

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.440 position:56%
down chimneys, and over apple trees.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.230
And ultimately to a
diabolical Sabbath.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.510
But traditionally, the
English witch did not fly.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.030
Continental witches however did,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.700
which will provide a significant
clue as to what happened in 1692.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.880
Those who confess to witchcraft
will have flown, I should add,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.290
by their own confession,
on the Devil's shoulders,

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.480
or on poles; on branches or sticks.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.780
No New England witch
would ever fly on a broom.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.660
Here are possibly -- there
they are -- some French fliers.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.910
This is 15th Century, but leave
it to a French woman to be able

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.670
to fly gracefully [background
laughter].

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.640
The accepted logic on the
phenomenon went like this.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.330
Witches existed in
all times and places.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.600
How is it possible that imagination
could deliver the same conceit

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.820
across cultures and eras?

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.620
In other words, witchcraft was

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.100
so preposterous, you
couldn't make it up.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.740
To the impossibility
of a shared delusion,

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.940
was that of the most compelling
reason to believe in witchcraft.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.290
Not to subscribe to it was heresy.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:28.030
In 1692 then, a witch
could be someone

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.920
who was a foot stamper
or a troublemaker.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.480
But it could also be someone

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.950
who simply denied the
existence of witchcraft.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.320
Faith aside served a purpose.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.950
It made sense of the
unfortunate and the eerie.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.680
The sick child and the
disappearing kitchen scissors.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.980
What else?

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.680
Shrugged one husband in court,
might've caused those black

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.930
and blue marks on his wife's arms.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.790
One more breathtaking
thing about the trials.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.610
They came to an end
because the scope

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.530 position:56%
of the crisis taxed the imagination.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.760
Could there really be
that many witches flitting

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.560
around Massachusetts?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.530
And because of what appeared
to be an over-zealous court.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:13.310 position:56%
Carefully, quietly, and anonymously,
sane men began to speak up.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.220
Few of them however, questioned
the existence of witchcraft.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.080
At issue was simply the
difficulty in identifying it.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.070
Many would believe that
innocence had died in 1692,

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.490
but most also believed that
guilty witches had escaped.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.900
To my mind, writers could
be immensely unhelpful

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.620
about what nudges them
toward a particular subject.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.230
I can't say precisely where
my interest in Salem began,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.180
but I can report that you don't
head off into the long haul

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.170
of writing a book without
some kind of obsession.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.180
The kind that wakes
you up in the night.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.960
That makes you read the daily
newspaper through the eyes

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.290
of someone who lives centuries,
or hundreds of centuries earlier.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.110
And so I began thinking
about Salem; it began to feel

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.190
to me eerily topical and familiar.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.730
Oral culture, like internet
culture, feeds on rumor.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.300
Both very effectively
so mass hysteria.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.630
We too know something
about conspiracies

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.560
and their political utility.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.910
About how fear can
corrode our thinking.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.460
About how raging against the
powers of darkness can convince us

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.580
that we stand in the light.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.640
Here was an instructive tale about
a very different war on terror.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.680
About the politics of fear.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.210
Both of them conducted
by enlightened men.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:34.390
Because of the center of the events
in 1692 were increased, Mather,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.820
the most illustrious of
Massachusetts' ministers,

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.350
and his brilliant 29-year-old
son, Cotton.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.180
Cotton Mather had no trouble

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.430
with hysteria whipping its
way through Massachusetts.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.450 position:56%
He was convinced that the colony was

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.560
under assault from
a subversive crew.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.690
More to the point, he
relished that attack,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.300
which proved the colony's
special status.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.540
The epidemic seemed
like a badge of honor.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.760
Further proof that New
Englanders were the chosen people.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.160
American exceptionalism
really begins here.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.240
The civic authorities
regularly appealed

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.540
to the Mathers for guidance.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.700
They owned the most
extensive collection

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.110
of printed matter in Massachusetts.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.360
They had devoured libraries
on the subject of witchcraft.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.240
It was to Cotton Mather
that we owe our knowledge

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.210
of the earlier Boston epidemic.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.280
He had published a best-selling
volume on the subject.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.900
He wrote more about
Salem than anyone else.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.530
A decade afterward,
he was still puzzling

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.870
over what could've caused
the witchcraft epidemic.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.730
He concluded, for the
record, that it was the fault

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.600
of the Native Americans
[background laughter].

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.690
One additional thing that may have
contributed to my Salem obsession.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.780
It's not lost on me that after
writing about Ben Franklin's years

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.070
in France -- eight years for
which there's two-and-a-half times

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.020
as much documentation as the
rest of Franklin's life combined.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.590
I wrote, "A Life of Cleopatra", for
which there is of course no shred

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.120
of documentation whatsoever.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.790
So here with "Salem",
blessedly was an archive.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.610
It included diaries and
sermons, and church record books.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.790
And best of all, nearly 1,000
transcripts of depositions,

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.870
arrest warrants; petitions.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.170
This is a page.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.810
This is the best of 17th Century
penmanship, from the sermon book

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.430
of Samuel Paris -- the
Salem Village minister.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.170
This is the accounting of
one of the many jail keeps

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.540 position:56%
who incarcerated the witch suspects.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.420
A 17th Century prisoner,
had the obligation

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.230
for paying for his own charges.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.110
So the jailers tended to be very
meticulous in their records.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.980
The trials then struck me as
terrifically, urgently relevant.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.440
Especially when you
factored in the anxiety,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.040
and the very familiar
conspiracy theories.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.290
I think we're always
obsessed with our origins.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.060
And thanks in large part to
Hawthorne and to Arthur Miller,

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.730
the trials have inserted
themselves into our DNA.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:55.480
In talking about "The Witches" this
past year, it sometimes seems to me

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.640
that half of America
descends from some settler

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.230 position:56%
of 17th Century New England, and the
other half starred in "The Crucible"

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.530
in high school [background
laughter].

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.000
Let me end with the
witchcraft confession

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.550
of a 72-year-old farmwoman.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:16.740 position:56%
Because for me, she was the start of
the story, and finally of the book.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.390
We don't know who initially
accused Anne Foster.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.620
But we do know that she
submitted to three very intense,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.210
back-to-back interrogations.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.910
Initially she denied any
involvement with witchcraft.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.180
But soon she began to
unspool an astonishing tale.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.600
I should say that six
alleged witches had hanged

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.700
by this time; it's now mid-summer.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.750
The epidemic really
takes off at a gallop.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.890
It begins in January or
February, and from start

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.530
to finish it lasts only 10 months.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.350
The Devil, Foster admitted,
had appeared to her as a bird.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.890
And at his direction she had
bewitched several children

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.190
and a hog.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.320
This is the record, by the way,
and through repeated examination.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.880
This is not the best of
17th Century handwriting.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.780
A neighbor who was a witch, had led
her to a diabolical Sabbath in May,

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.580
arranging their trip
through the air.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.080
Foster provided precise
details of that gathering,

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.770
to which the witches have flown
from all over New England.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.660
We can reconstruct the meeting
from over 50 sworn testimonies.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.620
But alas, we have no image.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.580
This is the closest we can come.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.320
This is a 17th Century engraving
of a German witch's Sabbath.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.020 position:56%
It's a far more decadent production,
but certain themes are familiar

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.080
as these men and women also fly
by various means to a clearing.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.860
You remember that I said
that there had been no flying

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:46.390
in Massachusetts before 1692,
well suddenly everyone is aloft.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.420
In her second interrogation,
Foster revealed that she'd flown

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.120
to the meeting on a pole.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.500
One that she shared
with her neighbor.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.680
As they sailed through the
air, the woman had crashed.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.880
They took off a second
time though, thought --

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.080
though Foster had hurt
her leg in the fall,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.670
you can see that there was -- she
was not the first woman to plunge

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.070
to the ground at such a moment.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.130
We know about the crash not
only from her official account,

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.530
but because a local minister
had heard her confess,

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.260
and he had questioned her
privately afterward in prison.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.310
He was fascinated by the
mechanics of witchcraft.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.500
Did she ride to the
meeting on a stick?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.950
What had she done about food?

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.330
She told him that she had carried
bread and cheese in her pocket.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.940
She described the sandy
ground on which she sat.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.760
She provided details of the timing
of the flight in both directions.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.470
As for the accident, she claimed
that her leg still hurt her.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.670
She was entirely forthcoming,
balking only when asked

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.650
if it was true that she'd
recruited her daughter

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.050
into the Satanic conspiracy.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.810
It hardly mattered
that she denied that,

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.100
because her daughter
immediately confessed;

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.020
incriminating her mother
as she did so.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.400
Foster's 18-year-old granddaughter
was arrested after that.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.950
She assured the authorities
that both her mother

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.950
and her grandmother
practiced witchcraft.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.300
But let me go back to
Anne Foster's account.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.540
To enter into the world
of the early American.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.490 position:56%
To grasp what could power a
witchcraft epidemic, you have to buy

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.310
into what we today
consider to be a delusion.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.590
This was a novel merit
of challenge for me.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.890
Essentially I was writing
a book of non-fiction,

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.050
which had at its center
an illusory event.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.960
So in short, the challenge was

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.370
to make a crazy thing
seem perfectly rational.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.080
And then afterward, to
show why it had been crazy.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.640
Foster's crash seemed
to me to point the way.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.630
Here was a woman who not only
believed she had attended a

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.710
diabolical Sabbath, or had reason
to lead others to believe she had,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.160
but who had envisioned
difficulties getting there

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.530
and felt she could still
feel its aftereffects.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.630
Moreover, that Sabbath stood
at the center of the story.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.720
The authorities felt
that it amounted

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.800
to a full-blown conspiracy
against the state.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.710
They felt the witches were
plotting to overthrow the church

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.540
and Massachusetts'
newly seated government.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.620
So this was the original
plot against America.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.840
Foster reported there
were 25 conspirators;

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.860
her granddaughter said 70.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.650
And the estimates would
soon rise to 500.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.520
Its gravity, in part, explained
the ruthless prosecution.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.540
The witchcraft became a
political crisis for a colony

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.770
that felt vulnerable for
any number of reasons,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.330
having nothing to do
with witchcraft.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.920
All of which convinced me that the
book opened with Foster's flight.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.450 position:56%
It sends us into the heart of the
matter, and it signals to the reader

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.400
that odd and implausible
things were afoot.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.800
I had to begin then with
how Anne Foster had traveled

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.450
from her Andover farm

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.470
to a diabolical meeting
in Salem 12 miles away.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.160
Here was the initial stab at
the first line of the witches --

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.440
yes, I write on yellow legal pad.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.230
So it's -- I know,
it's embarrassing.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.100
This ultimately became the
first line of Chapter Two,

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.800
because I much later
wrote an introduction

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.340
which my canny publisher
retitled Chapter One, "Because",

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.890
he explained, "No one
reads introductions."

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.880
Should you care to know how
long it takes to write a book,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.320 position:56%
it seems that I made these attempts
at an opening line on April 8, 2013,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.740
and I did not see my children
for the next two years.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.440
By later that day, the
line had evolved to this.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.100
I had in hand Anne Foster's sworn
testimony, along with the account

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.470
of that minister who
interviewed her in prison.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.050
But I also had to check
a number of details.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.050
For example, if in fact, you
flew just above the treetops,

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.970
southeast from Andover to Salem,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.990
what exactly did you
see below you in 1692?

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.400
Could you see as far as the ocean?

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.730
How thick were the trees?

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.120
Through this I plagued the
Danvers's town archivist

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.220
who was kind enough
to take me seriously.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.350
And of course I needed
to verify the inky night.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.750
Thereupon followed an
extensive correspondence

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.670
of my favorite research librarian.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:08.270
A man of superhuman tenacity, of
which this will give you some idea.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.570
This is one of several multi-page
emails in which he confirmed

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.070
that in fact, the night of
May 15, 1692 was not inky.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.460
A bright, gibbous moon shown
over Massachusetts that evening.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.840
So yes, you're hearing correctly.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.700
I spent hours checking
the factual circumstances

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.280
under which a fictive event took
place, which is surely a definition

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.580
of lunacy [background laughter].

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.690
But let me point out
something else too.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.390
In trying to recreate Foster's
flight, which she had described

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.100
in exquisite detail,
I too had landed

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.510
in the proverbial dark
wilderness of error.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.250
You may have noticed it already,
but I didn't see it for months.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.410
Indeed, Foster had claimed
that she'd flown at high speed

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.400
over the trees to the
Salem gathering.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.290
And indeed, she had
done so on May 15

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.120
when there was a bright
moon in the sky.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.880
But nowhere had she said
that she'd flown at night.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.080
This is the kind of thing that
makes you sit bolt upright

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.010
in bed at 3:00 in the morning.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.430
As I did many, many months
after I'd written those lines.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.980
I went back and I reread every
account of the Satanic celebration.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.390
Not one of the 50 people
included a word about the dark,

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.410
or about navigating the dark.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.770
In fact, no one seemed to have
had any trouble seeing at all.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.960
Some of the celebrants talked
about the color of the wine.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.220
Several confessed that they had
signed the Devil's book in red.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.220
Details they would've had
trouble ascertaining by moonlight.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.030
In part I was a victim
of my research.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.680
I had wanted to tie Foster's flight
to that of another woman who rode

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.890
through the darkness in
1704, if on horseback.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.790 position:56%
I had wanted to stress how much the
dark, the velvety, sound-amplifying,

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.520
disorienting, terrifying blackness
was a player in the story.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.240
And after all, everybody
knows witches fly at night.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.280
Of course when I went back
to look, there it was.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.290
Foster's granddaughter very
plainly tells the justices

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.750
that the meeting had
taken place at noon.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:13.230
And so ultimately in the
final draft, a plush carpet

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.780
of meadows unfurls below Anne
Foster as she flies to Salem --

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.880
or at least swears that she did --

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.380
over red maples, and
over meandering streams.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.540
There's a bright moon in the
sky which is no longer dark.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.020
There were, of course, no
flights through the air in 1692,

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.500
or goblins in the parlor,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.440
or supernatural conspiracies
in a meadow.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.250
How then did these
things seem to happen?

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.400
When you pry the whole
chapter apart,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.380
you see that it makes uncanny
and wholly modern sense.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.080
I tell you about Anne Foster,
because I hope that you may take

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.340
from the book what I
took from my misreading.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.580
A reminder of how swiftly
we jump to conclusions.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.040
How easily ignorance and
information can lead us astray.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.000
Fear warps our thinking.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.610
Preconceived notions trip us up.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.500
We like to lead but explanations.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.820
Above all, the Salem history
reminds us of the importance

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.480
of keeping our heads, even when
that leaves a question unresolved.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.140
Even when it leaves us off balance.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.890
That's an uncomfortable state.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.440
But as a later Bostonian
noted, bewilderment is crucial.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.190
We would be lost, in
fact, without it.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.300
"It seems probable", wrote Henry
James 200 years after the trials,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.350
"If we were never bewildered,

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.200
there would never be a
story to tell about us."

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.000
Thank you.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:50.520
[ Applause ]

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.520
We have time for questions,
and there are two microphones

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.760
in the aisles for whoever
gets there first.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:04.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Question: I'm wondering about why
people would confess to something

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.820
that they didn't really do.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:13.320
But you know, there was this
situation in Central Park

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.060
with the Central Park Five.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.750
These were teenage boys
and they confessed.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.110
The police worked them
over, but they confessed

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.880
to crimes that they didn't commit.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:33.060
And I'm wondering what the process
is, whereby somebody's going

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.740
to do something like that?

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.930
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: Turns
out to be remarkably easy

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.510
to extract a false confession.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.220 position:56%
But it -- in the case of Salem, it's
exacerbated by a few other issues.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.570
First of all, with some of the
young men that are accused,

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.230
they are actually tortured.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.770
And we have evidence of the
fact that they had been hung

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:56.030 position:56%
up in a rather grotesque fashion, to
have the truth extracted from them.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:00.590
But many of the people who
are brought in are women.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.250
Many of them have never been --

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.500
have never stood before
an authority before.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.560
The men who were interrogating them
are the best-dressed, wealthiest,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.690
best-spoken men in the colony.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.990
They're terrified.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.800
They often are men who are able

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.480
to reason very logically
and very nimbly.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.320
So that, for example, a woman
who comes into the court

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.070
and says, "I'm not a witch.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.370
I've never practiced witchcraft.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.910
I don't even know what a witch is."

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.240
Is immediately asked, "How then can
you be certain you're not a witch,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.600
if you don't know what a witch is?"

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.120
So you see, the manner

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.400
of questioning was [laughs] rather
circular, and rather imprisoning.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.620
It's exacerbated by the fact

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.210
that confession comes rather
naturally to a Puritan.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:47.740
And this sense of inadequacy, and
the fear that you might actually,

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.020
on some level be complicity.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.360
It's very close to the surface.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.290
So that you hear in the -- in some
of the testimony, people saying,

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.550
"I wasn't able to confess,
but I don't know if I couldn't

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:04.340
because I was innocent, or if
the Devil was stopping my words."

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.640
So there's a certain confusion.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.690
Everyone feels he has a
spot on his conscious;

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.280
a blemish on his conscious
of some kind.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.980
And there's -- because there's no
such thing as a guilty conscious

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.170
in the 17th Century, that must
feel diabolical in some way.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.720
By mid-summer, the
confessions begin to run rampant

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.850
for an additional reason.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.450
Which is that it had
become clear to people

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.110
that if you confessed,
you did not hang.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.430
So only the people who resist the
authorities who go to the gallows.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.020
And so confession is used as an
additional means of protection.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.650
And of course inside every
confession is a gleaming bit

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.540
of shrapnel known as an accusation.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.080
Because if you confess,
you generally hand

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.140 position:56%
over the name of your coconspirator.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.490
And that is one of the reasons
that the epidemic spreads

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.050
with the fury that it does.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.350
Yes?

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.650
&gt;&gt; Question: Hi.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.970
So a large part, obviously,

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.510
is the whole Salem witch
epidemic is gender politics

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.350
in 17th Century Massachusetts.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.040
But also interested in
hearing your thoughts

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.460
on Arthur Miller's later take
on the Salem witch trials,

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.560
and particularly how, at least
in my thoughts, it kind of adds

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:18.070
to those gender politics in a
way that it makes the women;

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.960
the young girls who, at
the center of the story,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.170
to be the accusers; the evil ones.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.640
Rather than the individuals
who may simply be trying

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.930
to assert whatever power
and agency they might have.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.230
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: I guess the
short answer to your question,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.210 position:56%
Miller diverges from the actual
records in any -- in a zillion ways.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.090
Whatever you think of
the "The Crucible",

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.060
it's a play; it's not history.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.670
But the most interesting thing I
think he does with the girls is

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.780
to sexualize them and to sexualize
the relationship with John Proctor.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.570 position:56%
Obviously, to do that he has to
raise the age of Abigail, of course.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.880
But he gives -- he makes
this into sexual politics.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.940
The missing piece -- among the
many missing pieces about Salem is,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.910
did any of these girls actually
suffer some kind of sexual abuse?

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.280
They're -- the colony feels
vulnerable at this time.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.050
The girls feel tremendously
vulnerable.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.330
They're living in a world where
Indian attack is imminent.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:12.920
And many of them have
survived Indian attacks,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.070
where they have often been -- where
girls have often been assaulted

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.960
by their -- the men in the
homes in which they live.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.330
Most of these girls
didn't live at home.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.380
They're servants in
other people's homes.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.290
Which means that they are
prey to their masters.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.260
The boys in the house; the
other servants in the house.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.790
There's a lot of sexual
imagery in the accusations,

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.470
but we can't pin any of it
to these particular girls.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:41.120 position:56%
There are any number of aggressions;
rapes, unwanted advances

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.960
in the court records; but
not in the Salem records.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.260
It's very hard to connect the two.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.640
And I guess that's
where I would say is

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.160
that Miller took the greatest
liberty, was in using some

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.730
of those vulnerabilities and
attaching them to the story.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:56.610 position:56%
Where we know a lot about -- seeing
hints that these girls have dropped,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.960
but we have nothing on the record.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.260
Yes, sir?

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.560
&gt;&gt; Question: A personal question.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.860
In 1953, a fellow

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.230
from my neighborhood
named Arthur Miller went,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.150
and he was very much
influenced by the McCarthy era.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:13.100
And he went to Salem because
he was looking at an image.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.850
Did you have something like that,
a political thing in your mind

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.130
that motivated you
to go and do that?

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.460
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: Arthur
Miller's wonderfully clear

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.260
about what his motives
were, and you know,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.410
obviously the McCarthy beat was
a perfect analogy in many ways.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.710
&gt;&gt; Question: Yes.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.750
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: As I said, I'm not
particularly adept at being able

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.300
to say why I wrote something.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.780
I'll give you an example of that.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.520
Only after I finished this book,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.150
for reasons which I thought I had
just explained, did a friend say

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.910
to me, "Did you notice that the
entire time you were working

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.440
on this book, you were living
with an adolescent girl?"

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.850
No, that was totally
lost on me in fact.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.910
And moreover, a girl who
was between the age --

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.360
was of the age of the accusers
of the bewitched girls.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.080
I would say that I was
reading this material

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.540
about this subversive assault.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.510
About these swarthy
terrorists in the yard.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.720
Because a lot of this is about
the Indians lurking outside.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.100 position:56%
And the nefarious Catholics were
about to disembark in Boston harbor,

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.980
and you know, take over
the Puritan establishment.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.310
I was reading all of
that in the wake of Iraq.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.290
And yes, I think I probably
saw an echo of this kind

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.170
of alien invader idea;
these invisible enemies,

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.520
you know, lurking among us.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.740
Our -- all of our -- it's
really all about, in many ways,

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.710
terrorism and immigration.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.460
And those are two issues
which we seem

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.540
to be grappling with still today.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.790
So yes, I think that may have been
some of it, but I didn't really see

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.180
that in any conscious
way at the time.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.480
&gt;&gt; Question: Thank you.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.780
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: You're welcome.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.080
Yes, sir?

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.940
&gt;&gt; Question: So I did not
act in "The Crucible", but --

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.460
and actually a direct descendant
of Suzannah North Martin,

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.870
who was one of the
witches who was killed --

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.170
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: My favorite.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.470
&gt;&gt; Question: And so
one, I'll be interested

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.770
in any little stories
you might have about her.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:01.970
But the lore from the family is
that she was targeted as a widow

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.550
who was sort of in a family,
you know, property dispute.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.960 position:56%
And so I was wondering how much you
think there was sort of intentional,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.080
kind of bickering and
targeting going on.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.210 position:56%
And whether, as in a general matter,
whether sort of new arrivals;

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.840
sort of the immigrants to the area,
or whatever, was there any kind

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.310
of rational way that there was
certain people being fingered?

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.610
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: Suzannah
Martin's one of my favorites,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.400
because she's one of
the few of the accused

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.230
who actually uses sarcasm
in the court.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.620
And she is very disrespectful
with the justices.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.470
She's been strident and
outspoken in the past.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.940
And she's been accused of
witchcraft in the past.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.630
And that's true of a number
of the suspects in 1692.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.400
It's very hard to determine if
they had been accused in the past

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.370
because they were strident,
or if they're strident

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.520
because they've been
accused in the past.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.000
But all of those leftover
accusations come back --

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.950
all of those former
accusations come back

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:59.880
to be reactivated by
the fury in 1692.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.740
No one really seems to
be prosecuted for reasons

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.960
of claiming his or her property.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.470
But many people are -- and many
people seem to be prosecuted for --

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.690
accused for different reasons.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:15.210
In one case there is a decades-old,
longstanding, unresolved,

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.740
overly litigated familial
grudge over a property line.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.700
And that claims a few lives.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.860
In Suzannah Martin
and a few other cases,

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.650 position:56%
there had been previous court cases,

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.100
which people still had
bad feelings about.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.190
In many cases, men are accused

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.790
because they had formerly
been officials;

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.480
constables; justices of the peace.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.250
And they had told people
what they didn't want

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.160
to hear, and so they are accused.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.920
And in fact in one case, an
Andover constable is accused

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.650
because he refuses to round
up any more witch suspects.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.980
And so after his saying,
I -- you know, "I'm done",

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.010
he's immediately accused
of witchcraft.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.310
Yes?

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.800
&gt;&gt; Question: You eluded to it
earlier when you showed some notes

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.110
on a legal pad and different
drafts that you had for,

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.410
you know, for "The Witches".

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.710
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: Yeah, that
embarrassing thing I showed you?

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.010
Yeah. Yeah.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.310
&gt;&gt; Question: Yeah, well I
didn't find it too embarrassing,

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.770
but my question is, can you take us

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.600
through when you have an
idea to finished product?

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.200
Do you have motivation
and then you kind

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.370
of outline what the book will be?

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.330
Or do you just start writing?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:19.710
And do you allow it to
pivot from point-to-point?

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: In short -- because
I could do this for several hours --

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.840
it usually takes me
four to five years,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.730
of which I spend the first
three years in the archive.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.790
So I really have no idea
where the book begins.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.570
I have no idea what I'm
looking for necessarily.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.940
And I'm just kind of following
my way through the archive,

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.820
and just reading as much as I can.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.170
For example, I didn't know when I
started this book that I was going

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.070
to be reading mountains
of Puritan sermons.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.590
Had I known that, I probably
wouldn't have attempted this book.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.190
Not really good for the
soul [background laughter].

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.670
And I don't start till I really
-- till the material starts to,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.730
in some way, marinate or ferment,

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.130
or whatever verb you
want to use, in my mind.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:41:00.000
I knew Anne Foster was going
to be the way into the story,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.720
but you're always surprised
by what you find.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.470
And the whole idea is, in a funny
way, to have a very open mind

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.290
when you first begin a project.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.030
Because you don't really
-- if you follow your --

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.160
if you follow a thesis
through the woods,

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.640
you're going to end up
proving your thesis.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.640
And especially in this case, where
I felt it really incumbent on me

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.500
to leave the answers to the
end of the book so that it read

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.760
as a thriller, with the real
explanations on the end.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.740
That was important, as was the
idea of conveying what it felt

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.180
like to live and breathe
the New England air in 1692.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.480
What did these people dream about?

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.780
What did they fear?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.130
What were their preoccupations?

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.430
What were their obsessions?

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.730
What were they yearning for?

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.740
And that was something I hadn't
found in a previous book.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.990
And I'm being told we
have one minute left.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.290
So if you have a quick question --

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.170
&gt;&gt; Question: Yes, so I was
just wondering about the extent

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.470
of the research that you do.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.950
Like, did you find
yourself in a courtroom?

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.110
Did you find yourself
talking to like,

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.060
a geologist about like
what the rocks looked like?

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.910 position:56%
Or you know, kind of just, what kind

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.310
of wood did they use
to build their cabins.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.110
Like did you actually sit
in a courtroom and see how

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.400
that would be displayed even
though it was still rough

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.700
like [inaudible] --

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.640
&gt;&gt; Stacy Schiff: I try to get as
close as I can to ground-level.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.280
This is harder when you're
writing about Cleopatra, you know,

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.830
in a world that -- I mean
Cleopatra's Egypt is gone.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.380
Only the coast -- not even the
coast is in the right place.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.590
The moon is in the right
place; that's about it.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.070
So this was a little bit easier,
but it's very hard to recreate.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.800
At one point, I said to
an archivist, you know,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.570
"What did the houses smell like?"

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.150
And he said, you know, "Go
to Plymouth Plantation."

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.450
Brilliant!

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.750
I hadn't thought of it.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.440
And I went to Plymouth Plantation
and I said to the women --

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.890
"What are the" -- the
women reenactors --

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.700
"What are the worst
months of the year?"

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.810
And every single one of them
said, "January and February".

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.560
Which, of course, is precisely
when the witchcraft broke out.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.860
Just saying.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.290
Anyway, thank you very much.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.570
