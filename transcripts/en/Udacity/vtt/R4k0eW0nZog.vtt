00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.484
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can think of negative x over 8 as x divided by negative 8, since the

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.393
negative sign can go either with the numerator or the denominator. It just

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:11.420
belongs to the fraction as a whole. That means to get x by itself, you just need

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.050
to multiply both sides by negative 8. On the left side, that leaves us with x.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.059
On the right side, we have negative 16. But, just like before, we have to flip

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.067
the sign direction. We get x is less than negative 16. As always, I'm going to

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.826
check my solution with a number line. X is less than 16 is this region over

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:35.593
here. Let's pick one value inside this region, and see if it satisfies this

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:40.188
inequality. Negative 20 is over there, so negative 20 over negative 8 is just 5

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:44.445
over 2, or 2 and a half. 2 and a half is greater than 2, so we're good on that.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:48.924
Now let's pick one value to the right, in the region where values that we plug

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:53.497
in should not satisfy this inequality. I'll pick zero, since it's always my

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:58.344
favorite number to pick. Zero divided by anything, including negative 8, is just

00:00:58.344 --> 00:01:02.625
equal to zero. And zero is not greater than two, so this also confirms our

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.209
solution set. So we can see that whether we divide or we multiply both sides of

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:11.185
an inequality by a negative number, we have to switch the sign of the

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:15.900
inequality. Remember, division and multiplication are very, very intimately

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.385
linked.
