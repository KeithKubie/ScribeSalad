and you know we still have you know vast
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109
and you know we still have you know vast
majority of humanity to get online and

majority of humanity to get online and
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640
majority of humanity to get online and
to reach but like we're getting there

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
to reach but like we're getting there
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789
to reach but like we're getting there
and it's moving forward and you know I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
and it's moving forward and you know I
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340

kind of I guess I ultimately feel like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
kind of I guess I ultimately feel like
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.760
kind of I guess I ultimately feel like
things do work themselves out and and I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
things do work themselves out and and I
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469
things do work themselves out and and I
feel like in my own life I've been very

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
feel like in my own life I've been very
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.499
feel like in my own life I've been very
very fortunate where you know even you

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
very fortunate where you know even you
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179
very fortunate where you know even you
know when things like an you know when

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
know when things like an you know when
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950
know when things like an you know when
things seem like they're falling apart

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
things seem like they're falling apart
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230
things seem like they're falling apart
or not going the way I want them to like

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
or not going the way I want them to like
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539
or not going the way I want them to like
things do tend to work themselves on it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
things do tend to work themselves on it
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.359
things do tend to work themselves on it
so I try to be i tended I guess I'm

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
so I try to be i tended I guess I'm
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950
so I try to be i tended I guess I'm
fundamentally optimistic that I think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
fundamentally optimistic that I think
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630
fundamentally optimistic that I think
that we will find solutions for our

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
that we will find solutions for our
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.219
that we will find solutions for our
problems and then we'll have all sorts

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
problems and then we'll have all sorts
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139
problems and then we'll have all sorts
of new problems to deal with like you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
of new problems to deal with like you
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240
of new problems to deal with like you
know that that my hope is that you know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
know that that my hope is that you know
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830
know that that my hope is that you know
with global warming that that will find

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
with global warming that that will find
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.770
with global warming that that will find
you know new technologies and to me and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
you know new technologies and to me and
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.240
you know new technologies and to me and
that is you know maybe one of the most

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
that is you know maybe one of the most
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.030
that is you know maybe one of the most
pressing issues you know they are facing

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
pressing issues you know they are facing
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.830
pressing issues you know they are facing
us as a species is how do we deal with

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
us as a species is how do we deal with
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.730
us as a species is how do we deal with
global warming and I'm sort of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
global warming and I'm sort of
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.459
global warming and I'm sort of
optimistic that and maybe overly

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
optimistic that and maybe overly
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109
optimistic that and maybe overly
optimistic that you know technologies

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
optimistic that you know technologies
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790
optimistic that you know technologies
will emerge that will help us solve

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
will emerge that will help us solve
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080
will emerge that will help us solve
those problems that it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
those problems that it's
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.210
those problems that it's
just about you know getting off oil but

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
just about you know getting off oil but
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.190
just about you know getting off oil but
it's about finding new ways to remove

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
it's about finding new ways to remove
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.440
it's about finding new ways to remove
carbon from the atmosphere and to help

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
carbon from the atmosphere and to help
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.000
carbon from the atmosphere and to help
you know bring things back into balance

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
you know bring things back into balance
 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.309
you know bring things back into balance
and that someone will well will create

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
and that someone will well will create
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.650
and that someone will well will create
something and there's definitely got to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
something and there's definitely got to
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000
something and there's definitely got to
be the financial incentive to do it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
be the financial incentive to do it
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.670
be the financial incentive to do it
right and that will be able to solve

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
right and that will be able to solve
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.830
right and that will be able to solve
these problems so I guess I'm

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840
these problems so I guess I'm
 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.130
these problems so I guess I'm
fundamentally optimistic that you know

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
fundamentally optimistic that you know
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.869
fundamentally optimistic that you know
that we'll figure it out if for no other

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879
that we'll figure it out if for no other
 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.890
that we'll figure it out if for no other
reason then I see so many I mean there's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
reason then I see so many I mean there's
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.180
reason then I see so many I mean there's
so much creativity in so much

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
so much creativity in so much
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.690
so much creativity in so much
intelligence and you know the Internet

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
intelligence and you know the Internet
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.759
intelligence and you know the Internet
has made it possible for people who are

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
has made it possible for people who are
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.860
has made it possible for people who are
intelligent or who have who are creative

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
intelligent or who have who are creative
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380
intelligent or who have who are creative
to actually interact with the rest of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
to actually interact with the rest of
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.370
to actually interact with the rest of
the world now in a ways that they

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
the world now in a ways that they
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.289
the world now in a ways that they
couldn't before that we're tapping into

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299
couldn't before that we're tapping into
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.650
couldn't before that we're tapping into
so much more like human talent who you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
so much more like human talent who you
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.970
so much more like human talent who you
know human capability then we then we

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
know human capability then we then we
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.530
know human capability then we then we
would have been we had we were able to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
would have been we had we were able to
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.920
would have been we had we were able to
10 or 15 years ago and so I think when I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
10 or 15 years ago and so I think when I
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.270
10 or 15 years ago and so I think when I
look around the world when I look at

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
look around the world when I look at
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.069
look around the world when I look at
like the world the little mini world I

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079
like the world the little mini world I
 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.410
like the world the little mini world I
live in and like online you know web you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
live in and like online you know web you
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.300
live in and like online you know web you
know online media or whatever that it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
know online media or whatever that it's
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.250
know online media or whatever that it's
so much so competitive and there's so

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
so much so competitive and there's so
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.750
so much so competitive and there's so
many so much innovation and so many

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
many so much innovation and so many
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.340
many so much innovation and so many
ideas coming out and so many people

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
ideas coming out and so many people
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.490
ideas coming out and so many people
trying to outdo each other that it's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
trying to outdo each other that it's
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.379
trying to outdo each other that it's
hard to imagine you know a species that

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389
hard to imagine you know a species that
 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.030
hard to imagine you know a species that
that is constantly trying to outdo

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
that is constantly trying to outdo
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.099
that is constantly trying to outdo
itself with innovation isn't going to be

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109
itself with innovation isn't going to be
 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.720
itself with innovation isn't going to be
able to solve these problems it's really

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
able to solve these problems it's really
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.479
able to solve these problems it's really
just a matter of us always innovating

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
just a matter of us always innovating
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789
just a matter of us always innovating
and always working hard and you know

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799
and always working hard and you know
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.900
and always working hard and you know
innovations a word that gets tossed

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910
innovations a word that gets tossed
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.190
innovations a word that gets tossed
around a lot but you know it you know

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
around a lot but you know it you know
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440
around a lot but you know it you know
you do see it you know it is happening

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
you do see it you know it is happening
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.580
you do see it you know it is happening
and it's happening a lot faster than it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
and it's happening a lot faster than it
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530
and it's happening a lot faster than it
used to and people are evolving and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
used to and people are evolving and
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.270
used to and people are evolving and
trying to outdo each other trying to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280
trying to outdo each other trying to
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.800
trying to outdo each other trying to
build better things and I think that's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
build better things and I think that's
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.989
build better things and I think that's
great
