00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.935
I don't like the narrative of
the shark.

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.137
- It is weird that, like...
- Cause they don't -

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.305
I know how to beat up a shark.
Like, they always tell you...

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:07.439
- Just hit it in the nose.
- Just punch it in the nose,
yeah.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.542
And if you want to make it come,
you squeeze its balls.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.245
(upbeat music)

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.114
- We have Rainn Wilson coming
in.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:16.215
Any thoughts about this?
- So excited.

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.385
- Leading up to Rainn Wilson
coming into our studio?

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:20.686
Ian, go.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:21.654
- [Ian] I am so excited.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:26.626
Ten years ago, I
exclusively used his quotes

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.429
to pick up women in chats.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.296
- Damn.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.163
- In chats?

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.098
- Yeah, like when you talk to
someone,

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.199
remember AIM?

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.333
- Sure.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.804
- I like would use Office
quotes as my away message,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.605
and then a girl would be
like, "That's so funny."

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.507
And was like, "Yeah, you
know, did you see this?"

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.508
- Here he comes.
- Here he is.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.676
- Get ready.
- It's the best.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.679
- He looks very, like, cool.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.314
- God, he's so cool.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.584
He's like handsome and rugged
and cool.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.486
He's got a whole team coming
with him.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.089
Rainn Wilson, hello!
- Posse, what up?

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:56.890
- I have a posse.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:57.857
- Yes, you do.
- What's up, man?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.425
- Hi.
- How are you?

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.495
- Hi, I'm Nikki nice to see you,
or meet,

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.831
well, I hate to be that person.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:09.836
I don't like when people
go, it's nice to meet you

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.772
or, it's nice to see you, or,
again--

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.639
- This is you.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:14.473
- Okay, what's the story?

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:17.110
- Okay, it's actually a good
story.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.414
We met at the Tonight Show in
2009.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.449
It was my first time doing
stand-up on the Tonight Show,

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.118
and you were the guest on the
show.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.888
It was you, me, and I was
filling in for Paula Abdul

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.126
because she had a problem
probably at the time.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.327
Woke up not feeling great.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.461
(laughing)

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:36.429
So they call me the morning of,

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.533
and they ask me to fill
in for Paula Abdul,

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.336
and I did stand-up in the
second chair position,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.470
which is unheard of, really.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.471
- [Ian] Oh, wow.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:46.772
- And then Hoobastank
was the musical guest.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.374
- That is very weird.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.679
- Wow, what a weird and somewhat
lame

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.781
assemblage of talent for a talk
show.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:56.648
I'm sorry.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.684
I'm throwing myself into that as
well.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:01:59.852
- Oh, I was so excited that you
were on.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.622
You made it legitimate and so
exciting.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.158
- But here's the thing, here's
the thing,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.795
my celebrity star has waned
in the sky of celebrity.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.164
(laughing)

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.232
Which, maybe is a good thing,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:17.203
but now I can't be a first
guest on a talk show.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.204
Like you slip down--

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.372
- [Ian] Well how do you
think Hoobastank feels?

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.441
(laughing)

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.177
- We're going after the
stand-up.

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.347
- [Ian] What's the reason?

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:29.582
- It's so funny how that works,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.585
how when the Office was on

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.287
and we were getting nominated
for awards,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.289
they would beg me to come on
Letterman

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.523
and be the first guest and
stuff,

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.293
and now it's just like, hey,
I'm promoting this big movie.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.460
Can I be on there?

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:42.362
Nah.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.898
- Yeah, you've been
through each side of it,

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.768
where you've been the first
guest.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.469
What does that feel like?

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.503
Do you even let it get to you?

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.604
Do you care?

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.974
- You know, it dings
your ego a little bit,

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.544
but for me, I don't really care.

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.414
I had a great run.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.618
I'm a weird-looking doofus.
- Yeah!

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.420
- I wasn't supposed to be a
celebrity.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:10.389
Thank you, that's why I
needed to shake your hand.

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:11.357
- [Ian] I relate!

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.993
- Brothers from another
mustachioed mother.

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:14.894
- That's right.

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.965
- So, it was such a great
ride to get on that show

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:19.832
and get to do that.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:20.800
So it's all fine.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.703
- And you're first seat
on this show today,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.637
so that's nice.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.638
Well, second, I guess.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.975
- Oh no, I'm the second
guest on the radio show?

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.244
Oh, man.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.478
- It's worse than you thought.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.947
- [Ian] Incubus is coming in,
they're gonna kick you out.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.616
(laughing)

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.483
- Third Eye Blind.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:40.486
- Oh, I love that.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.787
- [Ian] Yeah, that'd actually be
great.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.257
- Yeah, they're pretty good.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.861
- I actually I remember I
crept into your dressing room

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:52.298
when you were on the
couch talking to Jay Leno,

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.300
because they didn't give
me a bar in my room,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.368
and I needed, I was drinking at
the time,

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.004
and I was like, I need a
beer before I go out there

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:58.972
and do my television debut.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.773
I don't go on stage without a
beer in me,

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.509
so I stole a beer from
your room and chugged it.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:04.376
- Nice.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.377
- [Nikki] Right before I went on
stage.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.280
- Was I nice to you or
was I kind of a dick?

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.514
- You were, of course you were
nice to me.

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:09.482
You were so nice.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.850
- There's been times
when I've been a dick.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.319
- I'm sure, but we all can be
dicks,

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.422
but in that kind of setting and
I'm another piece of talent,

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:18.991
you were so lovely, and I even,

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.726
it was such an embarrassing
moment for me,

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.028
because I went back and watched
it,

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.829
and I didn't realize it at the
time,

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:25.965
but you were so lovely
because I finished my set

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:28.467
and I walked over to the couch,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.304
and you go, "Oh, hilarious, so
funny."

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.806
And I go, "Thanks, Dwight."
- Oh, no.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.441
- And I called you Dwight on
camera

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:38.611
so humiliatingly because I
obviously knew your name.

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:39.679
- Get out.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:40.613
(laughing)

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:41.648
Get out now.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.783
- I know.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.485
It happens to you a lot
though, I'm assuming.

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.654
- Sure, yeah, it happens all the
time.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:49.789
- I'm really sorry I was one of
the ones.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.990
- [Ian] Never on the Today Show.

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:54.860
- Yeah, usually not other
fellow performers in Hollywood,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.796
like, Hey Dwight.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.765
But guys on the street,
like, Dwight! Dwight!

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:01.767
Yo, Dwight, can I get a selfie?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.536
Dwight, Dwight!

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.804
I get that a lot.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.872
- [Nikki] I would say every day.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:09.508
- And I wanna say, you are
so charming and friendly

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:10.843
and relevant.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.679
Yes, I will take a selfie with
you.

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:15.481
- What do you do?

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:16.349
Do you just go, no?

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.584
What's your punt?

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:19.452
- Fuck you.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.353
- [Tom] Nice.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:25.124
- No, I try to always give a
nice photo

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:28.427
to a respectful fan who's just
being a decent human being

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.596
and is obviously a fan of the
show,

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.065
but like, drunken frat boys

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:35.468
who are neither drunk nor a frat
boy,

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.005
shouting Dwight across the
street?

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:41.640
I just ignore them.

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:43.576
- Good, punish them.

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.611
They should know.
- They should.

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:46.979
- They shouldn't get what
they want all the time.

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:47.913
- [Ian] Murder them.

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.515
- I Hoobaskanked 'em!

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:52.485
(cheering)

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.686
- [Ian] You got 'stanked!

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.921
You got hoobed!

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.525
- Yeah, it's a delicate thing.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:00.626
- What was crazy though, sorry
Nikki.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.495
- No, please.
- I know it's your show.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.663
The craziest thing, I went
and did a play in Chicago

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:08.467
and people in New York and
L.A., they're pretty savvy

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.537
about celebrity, and you can
tell like they recognize you,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.406
but they're like, okay,
there's celebrities around.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.640
Whatever, we'll be respectful.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:18.144
In Chicago, I don't think they
get any celebrities at all.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.912
It feels weird talking
about myself as a celebrity,

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:21.046
but you know.
- You're a celebrity!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.750
- Whatever, I'm a recognizable
former sitcom figure.

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:28.421
They just went crazy in Chicago.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.423
I mean, they would paw at my
clothes

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.458
and grab my arm on the subway

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:33.959
and just like, be shaking.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:36.729
A girl came up with tears
running down her face.

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:39.832
They don't get any kind of
celebrities.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:42.768
You would be huge there in
Chicago.

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:43.635
- Yeah!
- He would.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.204
- I'm going next weekend, hell
yeah.

00:06:45.237 --> 00:06:46.071
- What's your deal?

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:46.939
Who are you?

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:48.507
Are you a stand-up?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.909
- He gets recognized on the
street,

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:52.678
and he's not been on anything.

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:56.515
Like, people just want a picture
with you.

00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:58.751
- I know, he's just got a
great, what is your name, again?

00:06:58.784 --> 00:06:59.985
- Ian Fidance.

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.454
- Finance?

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:02.121
- Fidance.

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:02.988
- Fidance.

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.023
- Finance with a D.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:04.890
- Fidance.

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:05.992
- And he is hilarious.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.728
- Yeah, I feel like I
wanna manage your career.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:10.729
- [Ian] Let's do it.

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:12.531
- I feel like I wanna
take him to Hollywood

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:15.000
and be like, this is Ian
Fidance.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:15.868
- [Ian] That's right.

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:16.869
- And he's an actor.

00:07:16.902 --> 00:07:20.239
He will be someone that
people will be screaming

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:21.974
whatever your character
name is eventually.

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.910
- Paw at me in Chicago, baby.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:32.251
- I love that, because you
are a character actor guy,

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:33.819
much like Rainn was.

00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:37.490
Rainn, I was researching you
this morning,

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:38.657
you were in Almost Famous,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.792
which is one of my favorite
movies.

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:40.826
- It was my first film.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:41.527
- I know!

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.394
Tell me about that experience

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:43.963
and tell me about booking that
movie,

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.164
how exciting that was.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:48.000
I mean, that's a huge movie
to book as your first film.

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:52.204
- Yeah, you know, I put
myself on tape in New York

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.507
and then didn't hear anything,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.709
like I didn't hear anything

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:57.877
for most of the auditions that I
did.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.214
And then had moved to L.A.,
and then just got a call,

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:03.983
like, you've got a callback.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.252
And I was like, holy shit.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.787
And they were like, you
can read the script,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.955
but it's under lock and key.

00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:12.091
You have to go into Cameron
Crowe's production office,

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.661
you have to sign in, you
have to sign an N.D.A.,

00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:18.097
and you can only read it in the
office,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.666
and you can't take it with
you or take any pictures.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.301
They confiscate any cameras or
phones.

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:25.738
So, it was like this sacred
pilgrimage

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.941
of going down to Vinyl
Films in Santa Monica,

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:32.278
and they brought it out,
like on a silver tray.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.780
It was like a chorus of angels

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.216
- [Ian] Like the suitcase in
Pulp Fiction?

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:38.884
- Yeah, exactly, lighting up.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:43.923
And it's truly one of the
great screenplays ever written,

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.793
especially the full one,
the 200-page version

00:08:47.826 --> 00:08:50.930
full screenplay, it's a novel.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.232
You laugh, you cry.

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:54.900
And I sat there and read the
whole thing,

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:56.302
I was like crying and laughing.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.270
And of course I was just
auditioning for small roles,

00:08:58.303 --> 00:08:59.905
but it was super cool.

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:01.106
And then I went in and met
Cameron Crowe,

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:03.242
who's one of the coolest human
beings,

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:05.711
and I'm sitting on a
little chair in his office

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:07.947
and he comes in in flip-flops

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.951
and sits cross-legged on
the floor in front of me.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:15.788
With a little Handycam
to film the audition.

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:20.125
But totally disarming, like,
hey man, I totally love that

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:23.195
audition you did, you were so
funny.

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:25.631
Let's figure out, let's read
these things,

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:29.001
and you have any ideas what you
wanna play

00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:30.069
or how you wanna play it?

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.605
And just totally collaborative,

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.039
and a very, very different
experience

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:35.841
than auditioning for most
people.

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:39.845
- Yeah, an ideal audition, I
would say.

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:43.048
Because you felt comfortable
and he was rooting for you

00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.951
in that moment, and he already
liked what you had done.

00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:48.988
And you did do something
really, you made a lot of

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.190
hard choices on that character.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.192
It really stands out to me as
soon as,

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.727
and I didn't even realize it was
you

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.795
until I read that this morning.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.262
I was like, Oh, my god,
of course I know that guy.

00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:58.363
- I had a mustache like Ian's in
that.

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:00.866
- Yeah, you worked at
Rolling Stone, the character

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:01.834
was the editor?

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.637
- Yeah, he was an editor at
Rolling Stone.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.772
Dave, now I'm blanking on the
name.

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:09.174
- Because he's based on an
actual person.

00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:12.645
- Yes, and I met him, he came by
the set

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.213
when we were shooting.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:17.816
And he was Cameron's
mentor as a young writer.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:18.617
- Wow.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.785
- In fact, when I read the
script,

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:21.186
there was an amazing scene

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:24.657
of this guy Dave with
the kid at the airport,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.094
and it's a two-page
scene all about writing

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:31.030
and what it means to
fall in love with a band,

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.264
but don't fall in love too much

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.166
'cause you've gotta be a
journalist,

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.735
and just about life.

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:39.838
So when I got cast, that
scene was still in the script

00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.907
and then they called me
a month or two later,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.875
like, that scene's been cut.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.710
I was like (growling).

00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:47.112
- You get this role,
and you're so excited.

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:51.316
It still, you still
really shine in that film.

00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:54.086
I just love that, that
that was your first film.

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:56.355
Because what'd you been
doing up into that point?

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:59.725
- I went to NYU and I was
doing theater in New York,

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:01.060
for the most part.

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:05.464
So I spent 10 years doing
Shakespeare and just little
plays.

00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:08.133
Some big plays, I was in
a few Broadway things,

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.135
and regional theater.

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:13.472
I went for classical, I was
not in the comedy world.

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:16.408
People always think I was a
stand-up or a sketch comedian

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.444
or improv guy, I never
did any of that stuff.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.847
I just played weird characters
in plays,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.916
which kind of worked for Dwight

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:26.018
to transition into that role.

00:11:26.051 --> 00:11:27.986
From doing Shakespearian clowns

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:30.089
to Dwight is actually
not that far of a shift.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.423
- It isn't.

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:33.025
Yeah, you bring that to that
role.

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:36.962
That really makes a lot of
sense to me that you, yeah.

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:40.466
I wanna ask you about the movie
that you are currently in,

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.501
and out, and that is
the reason you're here.

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:43.335
It's called the Meg.

00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:47.473
It's based on, I didn't know
what it,

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:50.442
I just thought it was
about a girl in a sorority.

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:53.479
(laughing)

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:56.048
- [Ian] Yeah, she's haunting the
sorority.

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.149
You guys.

00:11:57.182 --> 00:12:00.419
- It's the megalodon,
which is the extinct shark,

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:05.524
and this is a monster movie,

00:12:05.557 --> 00:12:08.127
and you play a scientist?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.430
- No, I'm so glad you did your
research.

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:13.265
- [Nikki] I did, you let 'em
out.

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:15.735
- Wrong, wrong.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.703
- [Ian] My favorite part
of the trailer is when

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.806
you tell Jason Statham that
he had an attitude problem.

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:21.840
- Yeah.

00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:23.041
- [Ian] That was great.

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:27.747
- So, I play Morris, who is
a billionaire industrialist

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.183
who funded the whole scientific
operation

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:33.952
and built this underwater lab

00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:36.989
that the scientists in
it discover this kind of

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:41.994
secret area of the ocean that's
never been uncovered before

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.529
and they go down under it

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:47.366
and then they unleash the
megalodon, who comes up into

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.435
the waters to chomp on
thousands of people.

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.138
- Yes, and you shot this in New
Zealand.

00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.072
- We shot it in New Zealand.

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:54.873
Amazing.

00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:57.109
It was three months in New
Zealand,

00:12:57.142 --> 00:13:00.012
which is the most
incredible country on earth.

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.914
- Yeah? Had you been there
before?

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.315
- I'd never been there before.

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.417
It's amazing, if you get a
chance to go.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.021
It's a long ways, but,
man, it's spectacular.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.323
And, yeah, it was one of those
dream jobs.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:13.492
It's like, oh, you're
gonna pay me all this money

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:16.461
and I'm gonna be in New
Zealand with Jason Statham?

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:18.030
Cool, this is awesome!

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.899
- But you spent a lot of
time on a boat filming.

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:25.003
- Yeah, so we spent a few weeks
on a boat out in the actual

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:28.974
ocean and shot some stuff
out there, but most of it was

00:13:29.007 --> 00:13:30.843
that same boat that we
were on in the ocean,

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:33.278
it's so weird how they do
these things in movies,

00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:36.248
they made another version,
they made two boats,

00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.384
and then that second one they
cut in half,

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:42.888
and then we shot on the
back of that half of a boat

00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:45.457
in a tank, in a giant, giant
tank,

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.359
about the size of a soccer field

00:13:47.392 --> 00:13:48.994
that's like six feet deep,

00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:50.863
and they put that boat in the
tank

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:53.432
and then giant green screens
around it

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.601
and the cameras, and
they can kind of rotate

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:58.904
the boat and turn it and stuff
like that,

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:03.175
so we, yeah, we spent months on
that boat,

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:04.109
but we had a lot of fun,

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.411
and it's a really fun ensemble
of people.

00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:07.913
- I mean, it sounds like it,

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.382
and you were there during the
election.

00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:12.618
You said you were like out on
the water

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.987
when the results were coming in.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.088
- That was weird, so weird.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.456
- Can you tell me about that?
- Take us to Canada.

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:19.658
- Yeah, exactly.

00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:22.061
I'm just staying, I'm
staying in New Zealand.

00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:24.463
I was out on the harbor

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.632
and we were shooting this chase
scene

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:30.903
where the shark is chasing
about to devour Jason Statham,

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:37.576
and it was like 1 p.m., but
the polls had already closed

00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:42.114
and I was just kept hitting
refresh on my CNN app,

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.048
and the results were coming in,

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:47.653
and there were only two other
Americans.

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:50.990
It was Page Kennedy, who didn't
care,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.558
and Jon Turteltaub, who
was directing the film,

00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:56.962
who was so busy directing
a $150 million-dollar film

00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:58.530
that he didn't have the time to
care.

00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:01.133
So it was just me, and the
other people are Australians

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:05.504
and Icelandic people,
and people from England,

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.406
they kind of cared, but didn't
really,

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.240
but it was nuts.

00:15:09.607 --> 00:15:12.077
- That's isolating, man, that's
brutal.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.447
- The scariest monster of
all, the Megalodonald Trump.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.350
(laughing)

00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:21.186
- Did you grow up liking
these...

00:15:22.253 --> 00:15:24.022
let me just talk to you about
sharks.

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:25.724
How did you feel about
sharks going into this?

00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:27.192
What was your knowledge of them?

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:28.059
Are you scared of them?

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.195
Are you someone who enjoys the
ocean?

00:15:31.162 --> 00:15:31.930
- Yeah, I like the ocean.

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:33.999
I'm a real wimp around the
ocean,

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:36.702
so people say, do sharks scare
you?

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.203
It's like, yeah, sharks scare
me,

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:39.638
but you know what else scares
me?

00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:40.639
Salmon.

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:42.007
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.708
(laughing)

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.675
We were talking about earlier,

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:44.343
you were talking about going
scuba diving.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.478
Seaweed would creep me out.

00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:49.181
- Yeah, kelp brushes against my
thigh,

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.582
I'm like, (screaming).

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:51.249
- Yeah, I don't want to be
touched.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.484
I don't like bugs and stuff.

00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:54.353
- Yeah, like barnacles.

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:56.255
- Yes!

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.157
- Jellyfish.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.492
- I get squeebed out by
all manner of things.

00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:02.294
- Even the water, the tides,

00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:05.030
that's the thing that scares me
the most.

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.031
- [Ian] Like a riptide?

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.033
- Yeah, you gotta swim
parallel to the shore.

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.167
You gotta have all these plans.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.034
- [Ian] Lifeguards.

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:10.602
- You've gotta punch a shark in
the nose

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:11.469
if it comes up to you,

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.772
you gotta swim parallel to the
shore,

00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:14.906
you've gotta remember all these
things.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.409
- The punch in the nose
thing is kind of what you do.

00:16:17.442 --> 00:16:20.145
The main thing that you
have to do, which just seems

00:16:20.178 --> 00:16:25.317
so counterintuitive, is to just
float there and do nothing.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.652
- That sounds like something
the sharks put in your head.

00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:29.254
(laughing)

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:32.090
That sounds like more
bad news from big shark.

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:33.993
- The shark's PR firm.

00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:38.096
Tell the humans to just lie
there.

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:38.764
- Take it.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:39.898
- [Ian] Cut yourself.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:44.336
- Seals splash around, and
that's when the sharks go.

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:46.338
So supposedly, if you just lay
there,

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:50.108
they kind of smell you, and
then maybe you have your

00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:52.244
surf suit on, your wetsuit,

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.212
and then they're like, ah, fuck
it.

00:16:54.245 --> 00:16:58.316
- Yeah, most shark attacks
are just a shark tasting you

00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:00.185
and going, I don't like that.

00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:02.087
And so when people get bit by
sharks

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.089
it's usually just a sample.

00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:05.123
- [Rainn] Which I'm kind of
offended by a little bit.

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:08.060
What's wrong with us humans?

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:08.894
- [Tom] I taste good.

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.829
- Have you tried to taste a
seal?

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:12.464
Has anyone had seal sushi?

00:17:12.497 --> 00:17:13.765
They're disgusting.
- I've never had seal.

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.467
- Humans are delicious.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.435
- We should start eating seal.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.670
- I think sharks are
racist against humans.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:21.206
- Oh, my god, thank you.

00:17:21.239 --> 00:17:23.042
Finally someone's saying it.

00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:24.776
- Hashtag.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:25.644
- [Tom] I think we need
to fire these sharks.

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:26.512
- Shark racism.

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:29.681
Get 'em out of the water.

00:17:29.714 --> 00:17:31.850
This has gone on long enough.

00:17:31.883 --> 00:17:32.717
- [Ian] Eat me!

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.585
That's a bumper sticker.

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.087
Hey, sharks, eat me!

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:41.460
- I would love, I was part of
shark week,

00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:43.728
I was doing Shark after Dark,
this show,

00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:44.696
and we were talking about--

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:46.131
- [Rainn] Is that a
euphemism for something?

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:47.866
- It sounds like it.
- It does.

00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:49.801
- A sex show on Cinemax.
- It's a sex move.

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:51.603
- Shark after dark.

00:17:51.636 --> 00:17:52.737
- [Ian] Take a bite.

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.673
- There was a shark expert on.
- My fin is so thick.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:58.343
- And I was asking him about
all these things, and the bite.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:17:59.744
I would love to get bit by a
shark.

00:17:59.777 --> 00:18:01.613
If I can guarantee to get bit by
a shark

00:18:01.646 --> 00:18:02.781
and then not die from it.

00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:04.516
- [Ian] What, like a little
teething or a whole chomp?

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:06.818
- Just to have a scar, a shark
scar.

00:18:06.851 --> 00:18:09.221
I think that girl that
has one arm is so cool.

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.323
You know the girl that
was young and got bit.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.324
- The surfer.

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:15.460
- I think she is so, I
mean, I don't want that.

00:18:15.493 --> 00:18:17.362
- Were you on shark week with

00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:19.164
a guy who lost his arm or arms?

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:20.298
- No.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.167
- Because there's a guy
covered in scars with one arm

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.303
who had it lost, an
Australian guy, to a shark.

00:18:25.336 --> 00:18:26.605
And they're like, wow, that's so
cool,

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.607
we're gonna make you
the host of shark week.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.776
- That's gotta be so
triggering for him every day.

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:33.178
- He's legit, you know?

00:18:33.878 --> 00:18:34.679
- I mean, yeah.

00:18:34.712 --> 00:18:36.681
I think sharks are so
fascinating,

00:18:36.714 --> 00:18:40.319
and I think that I care about
them a lot

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:42.187
and want people to know about
them

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.589
and know that although
these movies are fun

00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:47.692
and sensationalized and
make us scared of sharks,

00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:49.928
that they're really not,
there's so many more things

00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:51.263
to worry about in the ocean than
sharks.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.531
- [Ian] Sharks are people, too.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:54.199
- Literally, worry about--

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:55.600
- I'm way more worried
about humanity than sharks.

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:57.335
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.368 --> 00:19:01.406
- But also, even if you died by
shark,

00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:02.574
what a way to go.

00:19:02.607 --> 00:19:03.708
- What a way to go!

00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:04.576
- You're gonna die anyway.

00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:05.810
- The best way.

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:08.513
- You're probably gonna die
choking on Raisin Bran someday.

00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:10.882
It'd be way better to go out
with a shark.

00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:14.586
- I remember one time I
borrowed my handyman's van

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:17.222
to go down to Home Depot
and pick up some stuff,

00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:19.958
and I pulled out kinda onto the
street,

00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:21.760
light traffic, and started
going,

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:23.461
and I was like, oh the
seat was too far back,

00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:26.264
so I bent down to kind
of pull the seat forward

00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:27.498
to hit the little thing,

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:31.670
and then my finger got stuck
literally as it slid forward,

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:33.205
it slid over my finger.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:33.906
It didn't chop it off or
anything,

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.408
but it was like weirdly stuck.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.743
And I was trying to drive this
big van

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:40.478
with my finger under the thing,

00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:41.980
and I was already kinda in the
traffic

00:19:42.013 --> 00:19:43.682
and I couldn't find a place.

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:45.850
And I was like, I am gonna die
in this van

00:19:45.883 --> 00:19:47.252
with my finger under the seat,

00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:48.987
and they're gonna take a
photograph of me,

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.855
TMZ is gonna come over,

00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:55.894
and I'm gonna look so
grotesque and pathetic.

00:19:56.661 --> 00:19:57.929
I'd much rather get eaten by a
shark.

00:19:57.962 --> 00:19:58.630
- Oh, absolutely.

00:19:58.663 --> 00:20:00.899
- You should have a deal where

00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:02.467
in your will it should say like,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.869
hey, if I die like that,
plant a shark on the scene

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:08.340
so it looks like that was part
of it.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:12.544
- You could make big money from
that shark-planting service.

00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:15.413
- I always think about that,
like those times where you go,

00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:17.382
oh, my god, I could have
just died just then,

00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:18.750
and that would have been the
story.

00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:20.986
I always think about on Dawson's
Creek,

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:25.357
Dawson's dad died because he
was licking an ice cream cone

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.926
and it fell off into the seat
next to him

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:29.327
and he tried to reach for it

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.496
and then swerved off a cliff.
- Oh, yeah!

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:32.998
I have done that with
fro-yo so many times,

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:33.865
like dropped the spoon.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.300
- I know somebody who died like
that.

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:37.569
They were making a baloney
sandwich

00:20:37.602 --> 00:20:39.037
by reaching in the backseat.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.339
It's a cousin of my grandma or
something.

00:20:41.372 --> 00:20:42.907
But I was like, yeah,
that's a dumb way to go.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.975
- I'm sorry I'm laughing.

00:20:44.008 --> 00:20:45.710
- I fell into a river
once, and when I fell in,

00:20:45.743 --> 00:20:47.979
I went (yells), and I spun
around,

00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:49.881
and that would've been my last
words.

00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.350
A pirouette and a (yells).

00:20:53.384 --> 00:20:54.452
- For some reason, I think

00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.655
that's how you're gonna go
anyway.

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:57.756
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hope.

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:59.357
- Yeah, you're gonna get
some kind of weird disease,

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.559
and on your death bed, you'll go
woo-hoo!

00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:02.661
- Oh, I hope.

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.562
I hope that's my last words.

00:21:04.595 --> 00:21:06.731
- Rainn Wilson, thank you
so much for being here.

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:07.866
You're such a great guest.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:08.733
- Thanks, you guys.

00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:10.001
This was a hoot.

00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:12.504
- This was a true treat for all
of us.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.873
We were so excited to
meet you and see you,

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:18.576
and you just blew us, you're
just awesome.

00:21:18.609 --> 00:21:19.510
Rainn Wilson, everyone.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.780
We'll be back with more show
after this.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:24.483
(upbeat music)
