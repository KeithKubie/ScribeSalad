00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Then we have a qualitative understanding of the energy involved

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with this spring moving back and forth.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's do some actual calculations. So let's say we told you the mass, the spring constant,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and Xmax the amplitude of oscillation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Could you tell me the maximum velocity this object will reached

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and remember think in terms of energy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We know the potential energy it has when it's back here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We know something about the kinetic energy, at least the equation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which describes kinetic energy over here.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in m/s.
