00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.040
PROFESSOR: All right,
today's the last official day

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.970
of lecture.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.180
We'll finish up Joshua
and Kenneth [? Reids ?],

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.750
and then we'll jump right
into post production.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810
Whenever you're ready.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.745
Laptops down.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.910
JOSHUA: The science of search.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.510
Have you ever found it difficult
to find a particular item

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.660
in your house?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.630
Let's say you have
lost a pair of gloves.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.710
And you spend an entire
afternoon looking for it,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.570
but you just can't find it.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630
You have encountered
the same problem

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.960
that companies like
Google or Yahoo

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.960
try to solve every single
day, the problem of search.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440
Just like a house, which stores
about 1,000 different items,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.240
Google stores 45 billion
different index pages

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.570
of information.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.340
If each page of information
was a sheet of paper

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.520
and we stack them
high altogether,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.380
we would create
a tower 610 times

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.000
taller than Mount Everest.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.990
How can a search
engine like Google

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.400
find your results
so quickly, when

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.990
we find it so difficult
to find a pair of gloves?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.610
Well, it turns out, that
searching on the internet

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.230
is kind of like looking for
a person in a hotel room.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.390
Let's suppose we're looking
for a guest called James.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.760
To find James, the
simplest way would

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.180
be to run to every room nearest
to you until you find him.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480
But that would take very long.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
There's a better way
known as binary search.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.110
Let's say the people were
arranged in alphabetical order

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.730
in increasing numbers
of the hotel rooms.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.440
We could run to the
room in the middle

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.000
and check if the name
of the person is James.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.370
If the person's name starts
with the letter before J,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.650
we head to the right.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.730
If not, we would go to the left.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.490
We then head off to the middle
room of the newly sectioned

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.400
area, and we rinse and repeat.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300
Eventually we'll find James,
just like the first method.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.560
But we found him much faster
than using the first method.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.250
How much faster would that be?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.670
Well that depends on the
people staying in the hotel--

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.290
the number of people
staying in the hotel.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.090
Let's say it takes ten seconds
to knock on each hotel door,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910
and that's 500 people.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
It will take about 80
minutes for the first method,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.770
and one and a half
minutes for binary search.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.370
But if there were 1,000
people in the hotel room,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.070
it would take 160 minutes
for the first method,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.750
but only 1.6 minutes
for binary search.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.360
Now that's a whole
lot of difference.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.000
A name like James is just a
word, but companies like Google

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.330
taking searches for long
combination of words,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.230
making it a little
bit more complicated.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.860
Just like identifying the word
James from its first letter,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.060
Google identifies
unique characteristics

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.380
of search phrases using
over 200 different factors.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.040
Also, notice how the
better method depends on

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.160
prearrange the people
in alphabetical order?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.240
Company scientists are
always actively looking

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.020
for better methods to sort,
manage, and eventually retrieve

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.030
the data.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.830
In the same way, simply
by placing your home items

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.920
in location where they
have a natural relationship

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.930
to make it easier
for us to find them.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.900
For example, the TV
remote goes near the TV.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.060
The shoes goes
near the shoe rack.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.990
The coats go near the
cupboard, and the winter gloves

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.960
goes in the winter jacket.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.970
Ah-ha, so that's
where my gloves are.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.520
And that's the story of search.

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:59.530
PROFESSOR: You're clocking in
around three to four minutes,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.780
which is a really
good place to be.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.050
All right, Joshua's script
is up on annotation studio.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.964
Let me turn this on.

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:14.437
AUDIENCE: Turn to
this [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:16.425
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.520
Joshua, this script has come
along a really, really far way.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.960
This is really tight, very good.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.650
I think the flow of
it is very natural.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.100
I also thought your
delivery was very natural.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.320
I don't know if
you've been practicing

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.130
or maybe you've just felt a
little more at ease today,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.840
but I think the way you
pause at certain words,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.580
and just sort of the natural
feel of it is-- it's nice.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.880
It sounds like you're
really just talking to us.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.744
JOSHUA: I think I
learned a lot of Andrea.

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:56.994
PROFESSOR: From Andrea - yeah.

00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:58.280
JOSHUA: [INAUDIBLE] yesterday.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.400
PROFESSOR: When she
said-- what was it

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.735
that you said during class?

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:04.235
Remember--

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:05.859
JOSHUA: It was
basically just observing

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:09.935
how she presented that I
learned how [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:14.670
PROFESSOR: Oh, you were sort of
copying her style a little bit.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.870
Let's see, here we go.

00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:25.520
I think something
that works really well

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.740
for this script is that
you build complexity.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.430
Which is a topic that
we sort of talked

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.740
about earlier in
the class, but I

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.980
think is hard to really
understand unless you

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.120
see a specific example of it.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.700
But he starts off with
a very simple example

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.580
of losing your gloves,
and then he clearly

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.430
relates it to how
Google searches

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.710
for something that is
far greater in number

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.042
and complexity.

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:51.500
But he connects it very clearly
to the glove analogy, which

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.890
is why I think it works.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.320
I think this explanation
of binary search

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.280
is very clear, because
you're relating it

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.690
to the context of
the hotel analogy.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.330
I know in earlier
iterations of your script,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.620
you were just
describing binary search

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.100
as a concept where people
take a set of data,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.690
and then they split in half
and then they search the data,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.747
and then they split
in half again.

00:06:16.747 --> 00:06:18.580
I think that's the
tendency that a lot of us

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.940
would have in defining
concepts and topics.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.910
But for me, personally, I
think that this definition

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.240
works really well in the
context of this video.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.620
Did anyone have any
thoughts about the script

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.750
up until this point,
up until right here?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.750
PAUL: This is purely cosmetic.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.470
I thought the
script-- I definitely

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.624
understand the basics of binary
search after listening to you,

00:06:50.624 --> 00:06:51.790
not even reading the script.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.140
I think that's really good.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.980
Just something I do, and
this is-- you could take it

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.520
or you can leave it,
but whenever I do 610--

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.420
I don't know, sometimes
if I did hundreds of times

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.240
of the Mount Everest, that
kind of-- it could be 100

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.280
or can be up to 1,000 so it
scales it a little better,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.180
but that's very
nick-picky I think.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.270
And the other one was over a
1,000 different items, maybe

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.371
just thousands of items in
your house or something.

00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:24.570
That was it, though.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.810
I thought the rest
was really good.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought it
was really beautifully written.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.750
Those layers of complexity,
the way that they--

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.120
I'm not someone who processes
particularly well just

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.570
by hearing something.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.890
But the way that you brought
me from a simple concept,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.870
to making it more complicated
and more complicated,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.820
and then bringing it
back to the simple.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.520
It was a beautifully
designed piece, really well.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.750
PROFESSOR: But keep in
mind this has happened

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.350
over several iterations.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:58.300
And I wouldn't feel
discouraged if maybe you

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.220
feel like your script isn't
in as tight as a place.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.550
Because if you look at
your earlier iterations,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.300
I mean it was a very,
very different idea,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.610
a very different script.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.580
And we talked a lot after class.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.560
Pretty much every day last week.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.377
But I think-- do you feel
happy with how it is right now?

00:08:17.377 --> 00:08:18.460
JOSHUA: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.543
PROFESSOR: You feel happy.

00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:21.460
I think the challenge
is going to be

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.430
in realizing this visually.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.460
Because the script itself
is very tightly written,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.330
but executing the whole
hotel analogy, I think,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.809
will be really key.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.220
And it's nice that you
actually have access to a hotel

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.970
since you're staying
in the Hyatt right now.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.210
But scaling back far enough
so that people understand, oh,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.830
the key to the reason why
this works is that people are

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.040
arranged alphabetically
in ascending,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.120
numerical hotel rooms
is a really vital piece

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.541
of information that you can use
the visuals to convey really

00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:57.040
well.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.600
Let's see, what about the
second half of the script?

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.930
I don't think you need
this last thing right here.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.971
I mean that's what I was
trying to say yesterday.

00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.440
That oftentimes we
feel like we have

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.440
to continue the ending
longer than it needs to be,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.180
like this is why
this is awesome.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.650
And that's the story of search,
and this is the definition

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.240
of prime numbers.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.120
It reads a little-- at the end.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.230
I personally just don't
think it's as necessary.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.836
But I like how you tied
it back to your opening.

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:40.960
I think that's very strong.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.255
Does anyone have any
comments about this at all?

00:09:54.146 --> 00:09:58.628
FEMALE SPEAKER: On the 80
minutes for the first method

00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:02.612
and then 1 1/2 minutes
for binary search,

00:10:02.612 --> 00:10:05.600
you explain how
you derive the 80?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.110
Because it's 10 seconds
and there are 500 people.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.660
But then how do you
get the 1 and 1/2?

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.910
And I guess my point
is you might not

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.240
need the let's say it takes 10
seconds to knock on each door.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an interesting point,

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.100
because you could explain the
calculations you did to get

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.660
to the binary search estimate.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.880
But, again, I don't think it's
super necessary to the point

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.578
of the video.

00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:36.036
FEMALE SPEAKER: You don't need
the other calculation either

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.480
and that'll make it
a little cleaner.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.700
Because I really think the 1
1/2 minutes is very dramatic

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.590
in the comparison.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.242
And I started to picture
little pods pop up.

00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:46.700
JOSHUA: Because I
was also thinking

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.960
about they could be
instead of 500 to 1,000,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.010
it could be 500 to
5,000, but I don't

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.140
know how-- I'm not so sure
whether how realistic that

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.199
would picture be of
5,000 people in a hotel.

00:11:03.199 --> 00:11:05.490
PROFESSOR: But, I mean, I
understand why you brought up

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.990
the specific numbers,
because you're

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.610
trying to show sense of scale.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.690
That the difference
between the two methods

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.650
isn't as exaggerated
when you're only looking

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.120
through a few hundred items.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.420
But when you up
that to thousands,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.310
or even close to
what Google searches,

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.200
than the difference in the time
becomes super, super dramatic.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.140
In that sense, I
mean, I personally

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.950
am totally OK with having
those numbers in there,

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.080
because I think that the
script is written naturally

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.760
enough to where I'm not
overwhelmed or distracted

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.780
too much by the numbers.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.062
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
had one thought.

00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:43.200
And I know the
hotel concept works,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.040
because when I
think of a hotel, I

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.480
think of a very simple box
with a very linear line

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.180
through it and rooms going off
in different directions, which

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.480
is why it works.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.950
But I wondered if having
instead of it being a hotel,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.550
it's looking for
something at MIT.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.085
Because then instead of it
being grounded at the hotel,

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:09.460
it grounds the film on campus.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.720
JOSHUA: Yeah, it could
work with-- but I'm not

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.210
so familiar of the campus.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.350
Is there a place where--

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: Totally.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.735
JOSHUA: --it's very uniform--

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.818
FEMALE SPEAKER: --very The
infinite corridor, down

00:12:18.818 --> 00:12:24.540
the middle hallway, is a very,
very standard place with doors.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.700
That was the only thing
that fundamentally

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.750
felt like if we could shift
it, it would help ground this,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.850
instead of being at the Hyatt,
to being here on campus.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a nice suggestion.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.200
And there are a couple
fun ways that you could

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.387
shoot that if you wanted to--

00:12:39.387 --> 00:12:43.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: Getting 5,000
people at MIT is very easy.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.396
PROFESSOR: If you wanted
to shoot centered like this

00:12:47.396 --> 00:12:51.860
and start-- whoever is filming
you, start relatively close.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.505
And you have the classrooms
branching off this way.

00:12:56.505 --> 00:12:58.130
Does this drawing
make sense to people?

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.005
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:59.005 --> 00:13:01.950
PROFESSOR: OK,
instead-- you'd have

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.610
to find some sort of dolly,
maybe take a rolling chair.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.830
But then slowly pan
back as he says,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.100
but if there were
like 5,000 people,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.662
and then it's a nice reveal and
it's an exaggerated angle too.

00:13:14.662 --> 00:13:17.110
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
knocking on every single door.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, that'd
be a nice B-roll to put there.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: Or even all--
I mean having a little fun.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.640
It's not about [INAUDIBLE]
looking for days

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.560
and then all these funny
buildings on campus.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.960
I mean not that it
takes up all our time,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.380
but it's a fun way to
ground this really and being

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.285
about an MIT experience.

00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:35.951
PROFESSOR: Do you
want to say something?

00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:36.865
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think a
really good place for that,

00:13:36.865 --> 00:13:39.705
and that's where I
imagined, is Building 4

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:42.826
if you go on the first floor.

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:46.526
That it's just a standard
hallway, and all of the rooms

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.942
I'm pretty sure are classrooms
so they're available if you

00:13:48.942 --> 00:13:50.093
want to enter them.

00:13:50.093 --> 00:13:53.544
And then also there's an
exit to [? Killian ?] Court.

00:13:53.544 --> 00:13:56.502
That may be a nice location,
because there's the dome

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.981
and grass and all that.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.410
PROFESSOR: Any final
thoughts about this script?

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.660
Again, I think it's
come a super long way.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:15.060
This is pretty much
ready to film, I think.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.110
All right, Kenneth,
you are next.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.496
Do you mind giving
your mic to him?

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.870
KENNETH: Do you want to
just do some of this?

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.816
Not the whole thing.

00:14:26.816 --> 00:14:27.316
Yeah--

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:29.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's exactly
talking [INAUDIBLE]--

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.583
KENNETH: Yeah, but I don't know.

00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:32.514
I just sent-- I just
checked the link

00:14:32.514 --> 00:14:34.930
it has the doc-- you know what,
Google Doc has everything.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.820
There's still a few
paragraphs below that.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.675
It's OK, I'll just
read what I have.

00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:40.258
FEMALE SPEAKER: When
we read together,

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:41.720
I'll just pull up
the Google Doc.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.950
KENNETH: Yeah, sure.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.740
OK, how do you feel
if you organize

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.580
a party and no attends?

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.350
Pretty much like
this one right now.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.820
And then it'll show me at the
head of the table with lots

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.420
of food and no one.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.070
And I say, oh right, I forgot
to send the invites out.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.751
And then they'll cut to a shot
of me dropping the-- sticks

00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:03.000
the envelope into the mailbox.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.789
And I say, hmm, wait a minute.

00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:08.330
I guess the only way that anyone
could attend the party right

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.300
now is if they actually
travelled back in time.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.099
But if they had
received my invite,

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:14.640
they would have
traveled back in time

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.810
and I would have
seen them, and that

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.220
means I may not send
out this invitations.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.540
Oh, right.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.960
And then after that
would be-- sorry.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.250
This is actually what
we call a time paradox,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.080
but let me just go in and
talk about-- OK, never mind.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.710
I'm ad-libbing right now.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.676
I'm sorry.

00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:37.642
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

00:15:37.642 --> 00:15:39.725
In your real thing, you'll
probably be ad-libbing.

00:15:39.725 --> 00:15:42.962
KENNETH: Yeah, then somehow
there's a transition.

00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:44.920
There will be a transition
so just [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.790
But wait, could we actually
travel through time?

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.410
This was in fact an experiment
conducted by Stephen Hawking

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.070
in 2009 to show that time travel
was probably improbable to be

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.120
invented, even in the future.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.619
But wouldn't being able to
travel through time be cool?

00:15:58.619 --> 00:16:01.160
We could submit that homework
that was due yesterday but only

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.840
completed today or head
to the really cool party

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.630
that I just organized.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.880
But how could we time travel
and is it actually possible?

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.110
A lot of what we know
about time travel, all

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.300
what we think we know,
comes from Einstein's theory

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.480
of special and
general relativity.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.660
Now this is all part of
what we call modern physics

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.274
and is still being explored
and tested as we speak.

00:16:21.274 --> 00:16:22.940
It doesn't mean that
all of if is wrong.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.290
It just means that we're so
unfamiliar with much of it,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.620
as we are with the
universe around us.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.080
Now back to time traveling.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.580
When you think about it, we are
all actually time traveling,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.770
but not in the manner sci-fi
movies has often depicted them.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.300
We are traveling through time
at a pace of one hour per hour.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.220
In other words, as our bodies
experience an hour of time,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.800
the wall around us has also
experienced an hour of time.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.710
It sounds simple,
but stay with me.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.670
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.922
Within Einstein's theory
of special relativity,

00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:52.380
there is a phenomenon
he describes,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.660
which is known as time dilation.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.780
And there will be a subtext that
says, dilation means to expend.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.570
Now, the gist of this
phenomenon states

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.210
that the faster you travel, the
slower time passes around us.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.819
In other words,
at high speeds, we

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.770
could be traveling at a
higher than one hour per hour.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.520
This is, however, only
noticeable traveling at really,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.670
really high speeds, near
the speed of light itself.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.970
And then the c
equals the 3.0 times

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.770
10 above 8 meters per
second will appear overhead.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.890
And say I invent a spaceship
that could travel at 90%

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.190
the speed of light and I
have a pair of newborn twins.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.990
And I'll have two babies in
my hands, cartoon babies.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.330
And one of them, I'll
put into this spaceship,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.030
and he will be in a spaceship.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.230
And I'll send this spaceship
off to space for a year.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.260
After the baby comes
back for a year,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.076
the baby will have
aged a full one year,

00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.700
while the one that
remains on the earth

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.899
will have aged approximately
2 and 1/2 years old.

00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:53.690
We can see that they
have experienced times

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.470
at different rates
and the baby on earth

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.440
had experienced
times about a 2.3--

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.090
has experienced time at a
rate of now 2.3 years per year

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.604
where we travel at [? .049 ?] c.

00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:08.270
If my spaceship was
capable of traveling

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.570
at even higher speeds, now I
fling the baby's to one side.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.270
This rate would
increase exponentially,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.130
as shown in this
particular graph

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.275
as you travel toward the speed
of light, which is-- there

00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:19.632
will be a graph overlay.

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.340
As you travel towards
the speed of light,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.730
the magnitude of the time
would change dramatically

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.660
and exponentially.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.450
We could potentially
travel forward in time,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.200
we just have to travel
extremely high speeds to do so.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.440
But, I think the question
on everyone's mind

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.140
is, how do we
travel back in time?

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.970
I mean surely isn't that a lot
more interesting and a lot--

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.979
sorry, I need to scroll back.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:45.020
Isn't that a lot more
interesting than travelling

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.220
forward in time?

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.039
Do we have run backwards
really, really quickly?

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:50.580
And then we'll show
the flash running

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.184
backwards across the screen.

00:18:52.184 --> 00:18:54.100
All this change is
probably just the direction

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.190
we're facing as we
travel, unfortunately,

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.100
and that doesn't seem
to be helping our case.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.954
Now looking back at
our previous graph,

00:19:00.954 --> 00:19:02.870
we can see that the
amount of time that passes

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.470
seems to be asymptote
to the speed of light.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.740
What happens on the other
side of the graph then?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.880
Scientists think that the idea
to-- think that the secret

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.880
to time traveling
at negative rates,

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.780
and subtext negative 3
equals time travel backwards,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.580
lies on the other side.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.820
Rephrasing that, we would
have to travel faster

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.320
than the speed of light to maybe
be able to travel back in time.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.090
And this is where the
dicey part comes in.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.590
In general relativity, Einstein
describes another phenomenon

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.156
known as relativistic mass.

00:19:33.156 --> 00:19:34.530
When you have an
object traveling

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.500
at high enough speeds,
the mass of the object

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.880
would increase severely.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.740
To move an object with higher
mass at the same velocity,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.870
one would also require
a lot more energy.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.000
Einstein proposes that as we
put more energy into an object,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.420
both the speed and
mass would increase.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.680
However, as we approach
the speed of light,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.150
it is more likely
that the energy

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.020
put in increases the
mass of the object,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.740
rather than the
speed of the object.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.610
And thus, to be able
put in enough energy

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.280
to push an object beyond
the speed of light, that

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.430
will require possibly an
infinite amount of energy,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:10.190
and thus rendering faster than
light motion highly improbable.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.500
But why are we so
obsessed with time travel?

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.130
Time travel often come with
it's own set of problems.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.780
Referring back to
my initial problem,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.770
and say I do have
friends in the future who

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.754
are capable of
traveling back in time.

00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:24.170
If they received invitations
after the party and travelled

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.870
back in time to attend it,
I wouldn't have had an empty

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.490
party.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.310
Since I don't have
an empty party,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.760
I wouldn't have to send all
my invitations after it,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.302
and if I had not sent
out my invitations,

00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.260
they may not have received
it, and they may not

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.950
have traveled back in time.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.420
And this is where the whole
confusing part comes in,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.850
and this is what
we call a paradox.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.370
In fact, this
particular paradox is

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.940
known as the
grandfather paradox,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.670
in which two conflicting
series of events

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.300
occurs, based on whether
I choose to time travel

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.812
or not to time travel.

00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:55.020
This is just one of the
three theories of time travel

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.970
and more details can be
seen at a link below,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.270
and then they'll be a link
to a YouTube description bar.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.180
Because if not, the thing
gets really, really long.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.750
It seems our current
understanding

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.260
of modern physics-- based
on our current understanding

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.860
of modern physics, time
travel might not be possible

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.370
for us to achieve yet.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.950
That's not to say
that things might not

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.360
change over the next
decade or the next century

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.492
as we are slowly figuring out
the world around us better.

00:21:20.492 --> 00:21:22.700
But for now, if they're
going to be planning a party,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.810
be sure to send out the
invitation before it,

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.101
and don't count on your
friends on being able to travel

00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:28.630
back in time just to attend it.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.296
PROFESSOR: Nice.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.580
All right.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.790
KENNETH: And I know
this one goes way--

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no, it's OK.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.280
This is great
stuff to work with,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.810
and actually I think that
with just a couple fixes,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.670
you will also be pretty
ready to film as well.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.505
This is not your script, you--

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:53.030
KENNETH: Yeah, if you
could open Google doc-- I

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.130
just-- I'm not sure.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.435
Because I'm updating it in
Word, it's of-- no, I'm Kenneth.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:21:59.756
PROFESSOR: Is it this one?

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:01.165
KENNETH: No, I'm Kenneth.

00:22:01.165 --> 00:22:04.909
PROFESSOR: Oh wait,
oh, I'm so sorry.

00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:08.260
KENNETH: It's okay.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.876
Yeah, yeah, this should be it.

00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.292
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
feel like I have

00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:19.590
a fairly easy fix for the
time-- speaking of time.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.920
I feel like the whole party
invite thing is too confusing.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.420
KENNETH: Too
confusing, yeah, that's

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.210
what I felt when
I was writing it.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.604
But then, the
grandfather paradox is--

00:22:29.604 --> 00:22:31.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
actually-- I like how

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.840
you explain the
paradox at the end

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.470
because it answers
the question, well,

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.670
if Stephen Hawking proved that
time travel wasn't possible,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.540
then why are we still
thinking about it now?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.881
Like what sort of
loop holes exist?

00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:41.823
I think that--

00:22:41.823 --> 00:22:43.849
KENNETH: Maybe not
mention [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:45.890
PROFESSOR: I know that
you had restructured this.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.431
And I'm guessing
you restructured it,

00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:50.240
because George had
said earlier, it

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.900
would be nicer if
you could actually

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.300
get Stephen Hawking
in this video

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.758
as you were talking
about the video

00:22:54.758 --> 00:22:56.970
or as you were talking
about the party.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:02.360
But all this can go away.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.700
I think that you can
explain the set up

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.484
with just what you had before.

00:23:10.484 --> 00:23:11.900
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Why do we need-- I

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.990
mean I get that
it's a cool story,

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:20.515
but I feel like you
explaining this idea of-- I

00:23:20.515 --> 00:23:23.046
must admit that I have
not yet once in my life

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:25.526
thought about time travel
ever, before this moment.

00:23:25.526 --> 00:23:28.326
It's not something
I think about.

00:23:28.326 --> 00:23:29.742
In fact, I don't
even think that I

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.492
was capable of thinking
about time travel,

00:23:31.492 --> 00:23:33.600
because it seems like
this very abstract idea

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.750
that my brain probably
doesn't think about

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.122
or capable of thinking about.

00:23:37.122 --> 00:23:40.540
You did an incredibly good
job at helping me even

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.540
understand how
someone would even

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.610
think about that
idea, which I think

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.210
is the beauty of your piece.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.440
That's like the essence
of what you've done

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.140
is you've simplified really
complicated set of theories

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.920
and all of that into something
that I could now follow and be

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.690
like, oh, I now understand
how people devote their life

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.690
into studying this idea.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.960
I would have never, ever
thought about this before.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.401
The party, to me, I don't
need it all in this to me.

00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:12.420
Not at the beginning,
not at the end.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.998
The idea is time
travel even possible

00:24:16.998 --> 00:24:19.270
is interesting enough
without that story,

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.400
from my perspective.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.600
That I think the
party piece is just--

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.540
it's got so many
double negatives in it

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.800
that it's just
really complicated

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.854
to wrap my head around.

00:24:30.854 --> 00:24:33.520
I just wonder what it would look
like if we took the party thing

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.090
out entirely and focused on--

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.460
KENNETH: I was actually
thinking an alternate was maybe

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.680
a B-roll of footage
from Hollywood films

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.100
of people traveling back in
time like in Harry Potter

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.220
or in Star Trek.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.303
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't
think you need it, I mean,

00:24:46.303 --> 00:24:46.910
personally.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.326
PROFESSOR: Then there's like
a whole IP issue, which we're

00:24:49.326 --> 00:24:50.870
going to talk about it an hour.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.230
I mean here's the
thing-- and again, this

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.040
is the part where like
personal taste comes into play.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.360
I think that the story is nice
as a storytelling element.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.741
That you end the video
nicely, because you reference

00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:05.490
the beginning, where
you're just like just

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.690
send out your annotations.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:12.150
But I do agree that it takes a
really long time to explain it,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.120
and I wonder if you can cut
this intro down to a sentence.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.490
I think this is an OK
start, held a party,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.580
but you can take
out all this stuff.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: I guess I
get lost with the he sent

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.975
the invitations, no one came.

00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:32.130
How does that-- I don't know.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.136
It's really-- maybe I'm
less adept at thinking

00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:37.650
this way than the
rest of this room,

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.200
but I really struggle with this.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.156
PROFESSOR: Yeah, PJ?

00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:43.550
PAUL: One thing I found
when I was redoing my script

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.040
was-- mine was pretty
wordy to begin with

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.770
and I think the story--
I think it's good,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.160
and I think you get
a lot of those words

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.886
based off what we were shooting.

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:56.843
There's no one
there, and the fact

00:25:56.843 --> 00:25:58.946
that you're describing
again, I don't

00:25:58.946 --> 00:26:03.257
think you have to do it because
they're going to get all that.

00:26:03.257 --> 00:26:06.610
I like the Stephen
Hawking story,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.119
but like it was with [INAUDIBLE]
doing a sentence based

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:11.660
on all the visual queues they're
going to get from the video.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.201
PROFESSOR: Because I like that
you talk about the grandfather

00:26:14.201 --> 00:26:16.130
paradox.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.300
And I actually didn't super
understand the grandfather

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.844
paradox until I heard you
read this paragraph aloud

00:26:21.844 --> 00:26:23.010
in the context of the party.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.310
But again, Paul
is totally right.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.630
You can complete
rely on the visuals

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.240
to tell a lot of
these words for you.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:38.360
So you could say, back in 2009,
Stephen Hawking held a party

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.850
that no one came to you,
and he smiled at himself,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.794
because he had just proven
that time travel was possible.

00:26:44.794 --> 00:26:46.460
All right, so you're
reducing everything

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.580
down into a sentence.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not possible.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
is not possible.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.930
The reason is that he
sent his invitations out

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.680
after the party had
finished, thinking

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:01.070
that if people in the future
were capable of time travel,

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.140
they'd receive those
invitations after the party had

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.430
ended and come.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:11.064
So, because the party was empty,
time travel is not possible.

00:27:11.064 --> 00:27:11.730
You know I mean?

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.140
Really, really condense
it down to two sentences.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.010
Really challenge
yourself to explain

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.135
the story in two sentences.

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.718
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
I might need a-- I

00:27:18.718 --> 00:27:21.270
mean, for me, I might actually
want an animation in this part

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.909
too.

00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:23.450
I don't know.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.366
I don't know why I find
it really complicated.

00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:28.400
PROFESSOR: It is, it's a
complicated-- it's complicated

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.880
because you don't really explain
it until the very end, which

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.040
is OK.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.100
I agree that it's not
vital to your content,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.050
that the content is
fascinating enough.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.060
But it's used really well,
right now, as the storytelling

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.100
device to open and close the
video, and then in the middle,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.660
you bring it up again.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.100
I think that there's a
lot of stuff in the video

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.000
that you can take out
that might give you

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.150
some time to play around with.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:58.900
For example, this whole
chunk can be cut down a lot.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.740
Let me change this to--
I'll just resolve this.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.540
I think the question that
you can set yourself up with

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.440
is, so time travel-- if
you disprove time travel,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.450
why are we still fascinated
by-- or why do physicists still

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.470
think about it?

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.260
Well, what exactly
is time travel?

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.578
A lot of this--

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:25.770
KENNETH: In otherwords--

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.570
PROFESSOR: Here, I don't
I think you necessarily

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.611
need these two sentences.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:39.920
I also wonder if you
need this paragraph here.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.197
Yeah, I mean it's fun.

00:28:43.197 --> 00:28:45.530
It's going to be a little
hard to execute visually given

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.450
the amount of time
you have left.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.804
So, just from a production
standpoint, it'll be tricky.

00:28:50.804 --> 00:28:52.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Actually,
this really worked for me.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.400
PROFESSOR: It did?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
at least for me.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.713
When you-- I mean
with the babies,

00:28:57.713 --> 00:28:59.213
you don't actually
need real babies.

00:28:59.213 --> 00:29:00.120
You can have dolls, right?

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.244
KENNETH: No, I was thinking
of just cartoon babies.

00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:04.445
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
or whatever-- plus,

00:29:04.445 --> 00:29:07.270
as a mother-- oh, there's no way
I would lend you my [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.524
for this film.

00:29:08.524 --> 00:29:10.880
No offense, but there
is no way I would

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.826
lend a child for this film.

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:16.430
But I think that this example
actually was very concrete

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.865
and I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:17.865 --> 00:29:18.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.750
PAUL: I'm just going to say
that example, I thought,

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.583
was really good too.

00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:23.240
But I think you can--
not the sentence

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.877
before but the paragraph before,
you could turn that into one

00:29:25.877 --> 00:29:27.460
thought, because
you're explaining how

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.990
you travel in hour per hour.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.816
I think if you were
able to just maybe get

00:29:31.816 --> 00:29:33.940
a sentence out of that and
just get rid of the rest

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.783
and then blend it with that now
I take a pair of newborn twins'

00:29:38.783 --> 00:29:40.196
paragraph, that'd be good.

00:29:40.196 --> 00:29:41.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
think the only issue

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.450
with it is that it takes so long
to getting to explain to how we

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.280
travel backwards in
time, and I don't

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.070
know from the beginning
of the script,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.160
that you're planning
on explaining that.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.550
And then I'm just
sort of waiting

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.820
to see where you'll go next.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:00.700
Maybe if you preface I'm going
to explain what time traveling

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.200
is.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.400
You can say, well,
first-- in your own words,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.940
you can say first
I'm going to talk

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.340
about how we travel forward in
time, and then backward in time

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.040
or somehow indicate
that to the viewer.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.040
I don't know if anyone
else felt that confusion.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.590
Sorry, Andrea.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.423
ANDREA: I almost wonder
if you shouldn't you

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:18.551
lead off with the baby example.

00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:20.986
As like let's do
this experiment,

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.908
let's do this side
experiment where we do this.

00:30:23.908 --> 00:30:26.840
And it might-- I think
it'll help with your pacing.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.440
It was difficult
for me to listen to.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.580
It was pretty wordy.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.330
I think if you
actually like just

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.479
grabbed two props as
though you're acting it out

00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:38.924
and ad-lib it and record
yourself doing it,

00:30:38.924 --> 00:30:41.739
you'll get something that flows
a lot better, because you'll be

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.030
able to cut out a lot of words.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.555
Because you'd be like,
here's a one-year-old baby

00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:47.780
and here's a 2 and
1/2 year-old toddler.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.670
ANDREA: That's
what would happen.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.128
PROFESSOR: There are a lot of
just little phrases like this

00:30:52.128 --> 00:30:54.812
like we are with the universe
around us that are very poetic.

00:30:54.812 --> 00:30:56.270
They sound really
nice in an essay.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.450
But if you actually
strip some of this

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.180
away and really just
try to distill it down

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.110
to the essential facts,
I think that's going

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.040
to save you a lot of time too.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.500
But, overall, at this
point it seems more

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.540
like distilling ideas sound.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.010
Do people agree with that?

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.290
I'm glad that you
flushed it out, though,

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.200
because before it was
sort of missing some

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.770
of the essential
explanations, and I

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.510
know you were worried about it
getting too long because of it.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:31.450
But I think the overall
structure of it is very sound.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.740
Yes, Julia?

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:40.900
JULIA: Well, I was going to say
that all of the topics involved

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.288
in the script kind of to
me don't seem necessarily

00:31:44.288 --> 00:31:49.720
connected, because
the paradoxes are more

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.960
in the field of philosophy,
and then relativity is physics,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.050
and then the twin paradox
is a thought experiment

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.430
so that's closer to philosophy.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:05.936
I think it will be nice to
separate the two to mention

00:32:05.936 --> 00:32:08.396
this is actually
scientifically proven

00:32:08.396 --> 00:32:12.830
and this is just something
that people think about.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:18.330
Also, the most compelling
part to me was,

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.808
and that's something that
answers the question of time

00:32:21.808 --> 00:32:24.495
travel the best, is the part
where he talks about traveling

00:32:24.495 --> 00:32:27.688
forward in time and
travelling backwards in time.

00:32:27.688 --> 00:32:34.987
And the backward part was not
very flushed out whereas there

00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:38.684
was a lot of time spent
on the twin paradox that

00:32:38.684 --> 00:32:42.037
doesn't necessarily have to
do that much with time travel.

00:32:45.762 --> 00:32:49.340
Do you think there's a
way to restructure it?

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:54.034
Or focus on something other
than time travel that would be

00:32:54.034 --> 00:32:58.874
paradoxes that arise when
you work with relativity

00:32:58.874 --> 00:33:02.262
and travelling at
the speed of light?

00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:05.390
That would be the twin paradox
and the grandfather paradox,

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.505
and then you could explain
them in more detail.

00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:11.485
Especially for the
grandfather paradox

00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:13.960
that would help, because you
could split up the explanation

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.930
into different sentences so
you wouldn't use would of

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.646
and had multiple times.

00:33:19.646 --> 00:33:21.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
mean the only thing

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.870
is that you are working with
a very tight time constraint.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.780
And I think all of this
information is nice

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.010
and it's good and, it helps
me understand it better.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.730
And would work
really well if this

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.880
were a blog post, for instance.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.250
But you do only have
four or five minutes.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.250
And I actually
like the structure

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.720
that you have waiting until
the end to address the paradox,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.844
because you're kind of
going back to the beginning.

00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:48.880
And you're saying, why
isn't time travel possible,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.760
aside from the
fact that we can't

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.975
go beyond the speed of light.

00:33:52.975 --> 00:33:55.350
How else are you going to
support Stephen Hawking's claim

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.100
that time travel isn't possible?

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.960
I like that the
way you've split up

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.380
putting the paradox at the end.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.000
I don't know how you
guys feel about it.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
How do you guys feel about
the overall structure

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.970
of the script?

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:13.435
MALE SPEAKER: I think
that he has to-- I think

00:34:13.435 --> 00:34:15.415
a paradox should be at the end.

00:34:15.415 --> 00:34:17.890
I think time travelling
backwards should be after time

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:20.365
travelling forward.

00:34:20.365 --> 00:34:22.840
I think that he--
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.305
but I think that you don't have
enough information for time

00:34:26.305 --> 00:34:30.265
travelling backwards because
nobody knows how to do it.

00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:33.235
Nobody knows the [INAUDIBLE]
travel backwards in time,

00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:36.460
so you can't give a really
concrete example for it.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.255
PROFESSOR: Right, like you
can't have an analogous example.

00:34:39.255 --> 00:34:41.570
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, because
we don't really know.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.510
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.510
PROFESSOR: Nathan, did--

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.969
MALE SPEAKER: I
think [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Nathan did
you want to say something?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.942
NATHAN: Oh, I just thought that
Chris saying the structure-- I

00:34:51.942 --> 00:34:54.025
actually really liked how
everything was laid out.

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.780
And that I feel like
most of the work

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.980
is just shortening
individual parts.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I agree
with Nathan on that.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.180
And honestly, the thing
about the traveling backwards

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.370
in time, for me
personally, it's just

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.260
that you don't get
to it soon enough, so

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.880
that I feel like we're
wading through a lot of intro

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.920
and a lot of explanation
of moving forward,

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.600
which are important.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.260
I wouldn't say take them
out completely or anything.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.880
But that I had no
idea what any of this

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.950
was actually before I read this.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:29.230
And I'm glad that you put it
in there, because that's really

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.570
what the meat of it is.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.982
What exactly does it mean
to travel back in time?

00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:37.410
And at first I was like,
why is he putting graphs up?

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.290
This is being really
physicsy, but now I

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.520
understand why you're
talking about asymptotes

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.700
and everything.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.070
It's just that it took a
really long time to get there.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.570
And--

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:50.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think,
if I hear everyone, we just

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.130
be ruthless going
through paragraphs

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.955
and cut it-- information that
you don't think is essential.

00:35:55.955 --> 00:35:59.334
Because the overall
structure works, but there's

00:35:59.334 --> 00:36:00.640
just too much.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
this paragraph is very vital

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.590
and I would shorten
that unless you're

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.880
like going to take
out fluffy words.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.030
If anything, I would take out
from this stuff before it.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:18.300
And this stuff is
super interesting,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.802
and I don't want
you to take it out

00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:21.510
because it's a further
explanation of why

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.220
time travel isn't possible.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.500
But it gets really dense here.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.520
This is the part when
you were talking where

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.285
I was like what is happening.

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.060
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's another video.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:42.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is OK.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:52.920
But this paragraph, can you just
say that would-- it would also

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.230
need a lot more energy, actually
an infinite amount of energy

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.920
to move it.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.825
Traveling faster than the speed
of light is highly improbable.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.150
KENNETH: I'm just afraid that
it condenses the whole chunk

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.504
on traveling back in time--

00:37:10.504 --> 00:37:11.420
PROFESSOR: --too much.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.240
KENNETH: Yeah, that's why I
decided to talk a little more.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.930
No, and I'm glad that
you flush it out.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.454
I know that you were
hesitant to add more stuff,

00:37:20.454 --> 00:37:22.370
because you were aware
of the time constraint.

00:37:29.448 --> 00:37:33.025
MALE SPEAKER: And mention
e equals mc squared.

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:33.900
KENNETH: Not exactly.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.960
It's, effectively, he goes--

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.790
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] e
equals mc squared then as he

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.820
increase e-- as e increases--
normally you'd think that m

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.410
stays the same and c increases--

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.330
KENNETH: Actually, e equals
the [INAUDIBLE] mc squared.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.210
That's why I didn't really
want to bring it in.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:49.876
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:49.876 --> 00:37:53.290
Yeah, I don't think you should
add any equations to this.

00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:58.040
Aside from the fact that
like e equals mc squared

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.637
is like the characteristic
Einstein equation that people--

00:38:00.637 --> 00:38:02.470
KENNETH: But the thing
is, it doesn't really

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.440
fully explain this.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.690
That's why I didn't
really feel like putting

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.420
the other equation in.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.080
PROFESSOR: I agree
with Jamie, overall.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.330
The structure, I
think, is there.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.830
The substance is there.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.370
I don't think you
necessarily need

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:20.230
to add anything except for
maybe a transitioner or so.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.530
But at this point, I really
think it's just, again,

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.000
being ruthless about
taking words out, taking

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.580
a sentence out or two.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.090
You're only over
by a few minutes,

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.183
which actually is an eternity.

00:38:34.183 --> 00:38:35.558
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] fast.

00:38:35.558 --> 00:38:36.035
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:36.035 --> 00:38:38.451
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I will say
that slowing down your pace

00:38:38.451 --> 00:38:39.924
will help people--

00:38:39.924 --> 00:38:41.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I think I started

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.400
getting lost around
the Einstein,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.010
because you were talking a lot
faster in that section too.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.520
But I'd say at this point it's
really just paring it down

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.750
to the essentials.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.290
And we can help you with
that during office hours

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.800
if you want.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.560
Any final thoughts for Kenneth?

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.540
Yeah, Joshua?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.990
JOSHUA: I do agree
with your point

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.950
just now about [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.420
I think it's helpful.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.235
It's been a bit confusing
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:09.235 --> 00:39:11.360
KENNETH: Yeah, I was thinking
whether I should even

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.000
mention a paradox straight
off or not to mention it

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.520
at the top.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.380
That's why I was
just playing around.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.521
And, yeah, I think no.

00:39:19.521 --> 00:39:23.488
JOSHUA: Is there a to
phrase it in the positive?

00:39:23.488 --> 00:39:25.904
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're saying
because the double negatives

00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:27.377
are really confusing?

00:39:27.377 --> 00:39:29.332
JOSHUA: Yes.

00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:31.165
I was thinking perhaps
it might be something

00:39:31.165 --> 00:39:36.220
like he was happy because he
proved time travelers wrong,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.740
and they could not
come back in time.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.446
So he makes it very clear
that once that-- perhaps it's

00:39:44.446 --> 00:39:49.153
like once [INAUDIBLE]
proved time travel wrong.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:51.694
PROFESSOR: Yeah, maybe just a
little wording thing like that.

00:39:51.694 --> 00:39:53.670
JOSHUA: He might lose
a level of complexity

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.128
that you would want
people-- I guess

00:39:57.128 --> 00:40:01.574
it's not the intent to help
them understand this part.

00:40:01.574 --> 00:40:06.020
The intent is to tell them
that Stephen Hawking proved

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.502
time travel is wrong?

00:40:07.502 --> 00:40:09.972
Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:15.406
Then you might be OK to
hide the complexity away.

00:40:15.406 --> 00:40:16.394
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:16.394 --> 00:40:19.900
Just keep thinking about
why is that, why is that--

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.109
how did that prove it?

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:22.400
How did that prove [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.310
PROFESSOR: And you talk
about it at the end.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.800
I think the whole grandfather
paradox part is nice,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.630
because it is an expansion
of why maybe his proof wasn't

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.550
really a proof and
why people are still

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.514
thinking about time travel
even though he supposedly

00:40:39.514 --> 00:40:40.805
proved that it wasn't possible.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.724
FEMALE SPEAKER: What if you
take the structured approach

00:40:49.724 --> 00:40:52.958
that Josh took in his whole
piece in that little part?

00:40:52.958 --> 00:40:55.134
Make it really simple at first.

00:40:55.134 --> 00:40:57.360
Stephen Hawking hosted a party.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.596
No one showed up.

00:40:58.596 --> 00:41:01.160
It proved that time
travel wasn't possible.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.100
Actually, it's a little
more complicated,

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.037
and explain it a little further.

00:41:05.037 --> 00:41:07.370
PROFESSOR: Actually, you could
open the video like that.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.453
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:08.453 --> 00:41:11.242
FEMALE SPEAKER: Just
really tight and then it

00:41:11.242 --> 00:41:14.290
allows you to use that story
throughout, but not confusing

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.488
people with all the details.

00:41:15.488 --> 00:41:16.154
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:16.154 --> 00:41:18.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right?

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.586
PROFESSOR: PJ were you
going to say something?

00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:21.085
OK.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.960
All right, any final thoughts?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.600
I mean this is in
good shape too.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.400
Again, it's much
easier to-- I think

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.640
it's easier to pair
down from something

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.620
that has too much content then
the other way around for sure.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.965
And the delivery
again will help too.

00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:45.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: These
have come so far.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.760
PROFESSOR: They really have.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.218
I mean I don't know if you guys
have looked at your pitches

00:41:49.218 --> 00:41:50.470
that you made last week.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.910
But they really have--
I mean I'm really

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.010
excited to watch these videos.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:57.740
Yes.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.490
JULIA: I'm just going
to say that I really

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.030
liked how you were
able to explain

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:07.030
this complex phenomenon in
words that are understandable.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.364
KENNETH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:08.364 --> 00:42:10.030
JULIA: Yeah, I think
that's really cool.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and that's
the whole building learning

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.510
confidence with the
viewer too that I talked

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:18.482
about on the first day of--
simple explainer videos

00:42:18.482 --> 00:42:20.440
are so compelling to
people even though they're

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.180
quote unquote boring,
because people feel good

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.570
when they feel like
they've mastered

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.180
a seemingly complex subject.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.680
And this is a video that is
going to help people understand

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.410
special relativity.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.950
I think that it's going to
be a very compelling thing

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:34.927
to watch for people.

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:36.510
They're going to
want to keep watching

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.251
because they're understanding
what you're saying.

00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:40.750
All right.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.455
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
seem so smart when

00:42:41.455 --> 00:42:43.100
you get something complicated.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.931
I'm like, oh wow, I just got a
really complicated [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:45.931 --> 00:42:47.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you're helping them

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.520
achieve mastery, which is nice.
