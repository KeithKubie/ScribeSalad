00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.260
The technology of warfare is in constant flux.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.451
I mean, there weren’t even drones as we
know them until late in the last century,

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:06.600
and now?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.760
RELEASE THE SWARM.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.370
Hey there friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.429
Military technology has been a driver of innovation
for centuries.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.130
Scientists, keen to see their research funded,
have been recruited into government programs

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.760
and helped create some truly fearsome technology.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.890
In the last few weeks, we’ve seen a number
of pieces of military tech that have given

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.399
us the shudders…

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.120
For example, in January 2017, the Pentagon
announced they’d successfully launched 103

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.830
microdrones from F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter
jets.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.440
A DRONE SWARM!

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.039
In fact, according to the Pentagon’s statement,
the 103 microdrones are very much like a Zerg

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.039
swarm.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.910
They’re, quote, “not preprogrammed synchronized
individuals, they are a collective organism,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.109
sharing one distributed brain for decision-making
and adapting to each other like swarms in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.109
nature.”

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.109
End quote.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.970
Let all those who oppose the Overmind feel
the wrath of the swarm!

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.530
The modern unmanned aerial drone was first
imagined by Nikola Tesla in the 1890s.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.880
Now more than 100 years later, we’ve created
a hydra-like swarm of six inch (16cm) autonomous

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.630
vehicles that could (according to Popular
Mechanics) jam enemy communications, form

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.939
an ad-hoc communications network, carry explosives,
trick or jam enemy radar, and even attack

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.079
individuals.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.580
The terrifying goal is to create the drones
in batches of 1,000 and be able to launch

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.450
them from fighter jets or large cargo planes.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.570
Of course, in this crazypants future we’d
also need a way to fight drones… so why

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.760
not lasers?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.420
IT’S THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.400
In December 2016, the Department of Defense
announced a 51-percent budget increase (to

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.280
328 million dollars) for “directed energy”
weapons...

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.930
Fancy budget talk for LASERS.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.180
The DoD’s research group, DARPA, has been
working on laser weapons for a long time.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.380
They tried mounting lasers inside 747s, but
they were relatively slow, and not particularly

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.380
accurate.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.710
The Navy mounted a laser on the USS Ponce,
which uses heat energy to destroy drones and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.840
other targets, the Army has a laser on the
back of a truck that can attack drones and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.129
mortars, and the Marines are working on a
humvee mounted laser of their very own.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.350
Of course, this new research is still classified,
but with such a sharp budget increase, there

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.750
must be something going on.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.580
Lasers are still bulky energy hogs, but in
an email to Seeker’s own Eric Niller: the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.510
director of the Directed Energy Professional
Society said the biggest issue is just getting

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.560
the military to actually use lasers.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.200
I mean, if we can shoot a drone with a bullet
or other traditional projectile, why use a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
laser?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.010
There is one obvious reason, pollution.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.099
Lasers are energy, but a bullet leaves behind
a casing, and the lead from the projectile

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.099
itself.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.019
And it’s not just bullets, shell casings
from grenades and explosives also are left

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.500
in warzones.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.330
Over time, the lead from the bullets themselves
can pollute ground water and poison the soil.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.500
Once in the environment, lead causes damage
to the “brain, blood, kidneys, heart, and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.670
reproductive organs” and can kill wildlife
too.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.750
Even though it sounds hippy dippy, the DoD
has a solution: biodegradable, lead-free bullets!

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.180
Sadly, not the actual small bullets, just
40 and 120 millimeter sized casings to start

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.269
-- they’re used in mortars and tanks.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.670
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has developed
and tested bioengineered seeds that can be

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.180
embedded in the shells, that grow plants after
they’ve been left in soil for “several

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.180
months.”

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.280
Those plants then absorb chemicals and contribute
to the rehabilitation of the warzone.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.010
Yep, the U.S. Army could shoot shells that
result in new forests.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.290
Warfare of tomorrow might not be Terminators
and Matrices.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.380
Instead, we might be shooting lasers, at swarms
of unmanned aerial drones, and if we do have

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.520
to fire a round, it might leave behind the
seed of a new life.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.269
The future is weird.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.069
One thing is for sure, scientists will keep
working on projects that push humanity forward,

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.829
and sometimes, it will be thanks to war.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.049
For example, Ex-Nazis and Jewish scientists
were responsible for getting us to the moon.

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.330
Amy’s got the story for you here.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.330
How do you feel about these?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.390
Do you have a favorite?
