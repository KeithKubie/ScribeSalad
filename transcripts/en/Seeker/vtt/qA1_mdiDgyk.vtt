00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.860
[TRACE] The passenger pigeon, the gastric
brooding frog, the wooly mammoth, they all

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.280
have one thing in common, they’re extinct....
dead as a dodo, if you will.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.070
In fact, scientists estimate that 5 billion
species have come and gone off this planet.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.060
But what if we could bring them back?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.420
What if extinction didn’t have to be a permanent
thing?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.480
Right now scientists are using revolutionary
new genetic techniques to try to bring back

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.490
some of these species.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.920
For example the wooly mammoth could roam the
Northern Tundra.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.629
[TRACE] It sounds like a science fiction,
but it could happen.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.199
So how close are we to de-extinction?

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:53.859
[TRACE] The woolly mammoth is an impressive
specimen.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.850
It was the king of the tundra for millions
of years.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.799
Then it rather suspiciously disappeared around
the same time that humans appeared.

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.230
Most scientists think it’s likely that they
were hunted to extinction.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.320
[JACK DUMBACHER] Most of the species that
have gone extinct in recent years is because

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.670
we destroyed the habitat, we've introduced
species, or we've killed them outright, like

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.750
the passenger pigeons.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.860
It was hard to imagine, at the time, that
this bird species that's so abundant could

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.420
actually be hunted to extinction.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.740
But we managed to do that.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.740
[TRACE} While it’s normal for species to
die out over time because of evolution or

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.590
a cataclysmic event some scientists think
the Earth is now entering a new age of mass

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.590
extinction, called the Anthropocene or Holocene
extinction, caused by, you guessed it, us.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.590
Animals, plants and insects are dying out
at a rate of 1,000 to 10,000 times faster

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.680
than ever before, with dozens of species going
extinct every single day.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420
Some scientists estimate that as many as 30
to 50 percent of all species could be headed

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.330
towards extinction by end of the century!

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.780
But again, what if extinction didn’t have
to be a thing?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.690
What if we could bring species back at will?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.259
To do that, we’d need DNA, an egg cell,
and a birthing Mom.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.660
Which is why Jurassic Park will never be a
thing.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.310
[JACK DUMBACHER] The dinosaurs are so old,
that all those chemicals, have been turned

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.310
to rock.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.239
There’s no source of DNA that we have right
now for dinosaurs, There's no way that we

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.069
could create a dinosaur, because we don't
know what it's genome looked like.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.659
[BEN NOVAK] We can’t get dinosaur DNA so
no Jurassic Park on the bench, but we can

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.879
get DNA dating from tissue and fossils from
organisms from 10,000 years ago to 100,000

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.370
years ago so the woolly mammoth is an active
project.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.760
[TRACE] That’s right.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.260
The wooly mammoth could be a thing again!

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.810
[JACK DUMBACHER] Mammoths are very different
than dinosaurs because scientists are able

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.220
to go up to the Arctic, and find thawing chunks
of earth that still have frozen mammoths in

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.849
them and those have DNA.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.340
And that‘s where scientist are going to
get the DNA from the mammoth in order to reconstruct

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.609
its genome.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.159
That's why mammoths are different than dinosaurs,
because we have that DNA.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.709
[TRACE] And they’re closer than you think
to bringing them back..

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.090
[BEN NOVAK] So right now .. there are cells
dividing and living in a little Petri dish

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.510
at Harvard that have mammoth mutations.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.680
We have a mammoth genome.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.529
We have mammoth habitat, we have a good motivation
for doing it.

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.819
We just need the filler in between who’s
making the mammoth.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.069
[TRACE] Woah woah, Ben.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.400
We’re not quite there yet.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.409
We’ve got the DNA, but it’s not exactly
perfect.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.959
DNA degrades over time, it has a half-life
of about 521 years.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.419
Meaning we need to fix any mammoth DNA before
we can clone it.

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.370
Cloning is the closest thing we have to reviving
extinct animals right now.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.499
And we’re not bad at it!

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.780
Remember Dolly the sheep?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.099
Now we regularly clone cattle, pigs, camels,
frogs, lab rats, and even your pet dog!

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.889
Now, even with perfect DNA cloning is really
hard, but they can make DNA even more perfect

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.819
by editing it.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:12.449
[BEN NOVAK] The revolutionary technology that
made considering de-extinction possible which

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.040
also opens up all those new genetic rescue
capabilities is what’s known as precise

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.220
genome editing.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.070
It’s using things like CRISPR Cas9, or talens,
or megaTALs.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.210
[TRACE] In case you haven’t heard of it,
CRISPR Cas9 is an editing tool for DNA.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.220
It’s able to go through millions of strands
of DNA, locate a specific genome and remove

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.640
or add to it.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.800
In de-extincting the Mammoth - scientists
are using the DNA of an Asian Elephant and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.380
replacing parts with a mammoth’s DNA.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.560
To make a ‘mammophant’.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.290
A name I hate.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.530
So, we have cloning technology, we’ve got
elephant and mammoth DNA that we can edit

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.420
together, and the plan is to try to artificially
inseminate an Asian Elephant mom to carry

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.420
the baby.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.720
But, just because you bring back one mammoth
that doesn’t mean de-extinction.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.170
De-extinction by definition, is bringing back
a whole species.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.010
And just because we can bring the wooly mammoth
back ... should we?

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.920
[JACK DUMBACHER] I think sometimes people
think about de-extinction like, oh you wouldn't

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.360
it be cool to have a passenger pigeon, or
a California grizzly, or some other species?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.720
But, it's not just about that species and
it being cool.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.670
Sometimes it's about, those species have a
role in the ecosystem, which is now empty.Jack:

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:36.780
A great example, that a lot of people are
aware of, is wolves in Yellowstone...we've

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.920
seen huge changes in the ecosystem in Yellowstone,
that people are attributing to the wolves,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.190
[TRACE] So if we do put a mammoth back into
the world, what would happen?

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.310
Where would it go?

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.680
What would it eat?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.150
If mammoths ate up all the grasses, what would
happen to other herbivores in the Tundra?

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.340
If the wolves of Yellowstone can change the
course of a river, what would a herd of mammoths

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.340
do?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.810
[JACK DUMBACHER] I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with releasing weird, hairy Asian elephants

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.810
into the tundra.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.600
[BEN NOVAK] Once you have your animals, breed
them up in captivity, condition them for the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.620
wild, put them back into the wild and that’s
where you start getting into all of your ethical

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.790
questions of whether or not we should or should
not be doing this.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.050
[JACK DUMBACHER] Wooly mammoths have been
extinct and one question is “has that ecosystem

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.530
already become something different?”

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.650
And when you put wooly mammoths back are you
gonna end up having detrimental impacts on

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.721
things that are living there now.

00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:40.530
[TRACE] there are other animals that we might
bring back first.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.150
Like the humble passenger pigeon.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.730
We hunted it to extinction, and changed the
forests of North America.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.520
Oak trees need the pigeon for regeneration
as well as controlling the underbrush, which

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.250
is a major fire hazard.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.100
If we de-extinct them we fill a hole in the
ecosystem -- a hole that we put there.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.190
[JACK DUMBACHER] There's a portfolio of extinct
animals that you could potentially bring back.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.240
The challenge is trying to figure out which
of those is going to have the biggest positive

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.760
impacts, and then working on those first.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.650
[TRACE] So, in less than ten years we could
de-extinct the passenger pigeon, maybe someday

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.770
we’ll have Wooly mammoths roaming the tundra
or even see dodo birds waddling around.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.560
How close are we to de-extinction?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.140
REALLY REALLY close.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.530
But just because we can, doesn’t mean we
should...

Did you know the Border Wall between Mexico
and the U.S. is causing extinction too?

Yeah.
