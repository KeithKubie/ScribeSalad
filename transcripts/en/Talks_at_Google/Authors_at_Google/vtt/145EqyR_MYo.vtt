[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.180
ERIC KOZIEL: It's
really a pleasure

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.890
to be here and talking
about something

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.000
that was one of my passions
in recent years and something

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.910
that I've really come to
enjoy the full process of.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.100
And that's something
that I wanted to share.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.680
I struggled a bit
in trying to come up

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.680
with exactly how I wanted
to frame this talk,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.660
whether or not I
should go into kind

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.870
of the nitty-gritty
details or give a more

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.229
full-blown look at everything
that might go into this.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.940
And I decided I'd go into
the inch-deep, mile-wide type

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.850
of approach and cover all
of the different things

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.620
that people might enjoy.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.800
My goal at the end of
this is to show you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.530
all the different complexities
that go into running a game,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.080
as well as hopefully convince
a couple of you to possibly

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.170
try it out.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.200
So with that, I
just want to cover

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.940
a little bit of my
background as far

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.810
as how it helps out in
discussing this talk.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.119
Like many folks, I grew
up playing video games

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.160
all through my childhood.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.190
It was something that was
a great activity for me.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.150
I formed bonds with
all sorts of games

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.800
and really enjoyed just playing
and learning the lessons

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.940
that they had for me.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.590
But beyond that,
it was an activity.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.210
It was something that I enjoyed.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
It was not something that
I had intended to turn

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.910
into a lifelong passion.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.540
My first foray into more
competitive-focused gaming

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.460
occurred in my teenage years.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.980
I became part of the
"Super Smash Bros.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.670
Melee" competitive
community in the mid 2000s.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.710
And that was
transformational for me.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.030
It was something
where I was good.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.180
I was not great.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.970
But it was something that
let me travel to tournaments.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.502
I could meet up with
all sorts of people,

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:46.960
get different
perspectives on that.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.250
And really, some of my best
memories are part of that.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.670
But back on the
real-life side of things,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.926
I went through and
started my schooling.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:57.640
I went through and got master's
degrees in computer engineering

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.080
and cyber operations.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.630
As far as how that
applies to the talk,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.360
it really is just
my note of, I have

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.060
a formal background
in engineering,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.910
software development, as
well as reverse engineering

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.580
and, let's say, knowing how
to treat software creatively

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.530
to try and get certain
things out of it.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.050
And I'm very fortunate
to be able to continue

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.822
that in my professional
work with MIT.

00:02:23.822 --> 00:02:25.780
But really, what we're
here to talk about today

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.238
is the speedrunning
side of things.

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:28.900
And this is something
that I started up

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.250
because I missed out on all
of the competitive aspects

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.831
that I had to drop when I
started school of "Super Smash

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:37.330
Bros."

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.030
But I also had this deep
nostalgia for all these games

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.290
that I played as a kid.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.330
And speedrunning was my way
to actually dive into that.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.290
And over the course
of the last 10 years

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.640
or so, I've completed
speedruns of more than two

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.070
dozen different games,
most of which from scratch.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.430
So I'm hoping to share
some of those lesson

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.550
today as we go through
more of the talk.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.130
But that's the main thing.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.650
What we're talking about today
is, of course, video games.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.482
And we'll differentiate
that online

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:10.690
usually by just putting it
as one word instead of two

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.710
to differentiate it
from athletic running.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.110
But what we're
talking about here

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.200
is completing a game quickly.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.870
The duration of this
usually goes from the time

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.720
that you press Start until
the time the credits roll.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.150
And what I'm going to
be talking about today

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.030
is all things performed by
hand, all things that are

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.392
done without tool assistance.

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:30.850
There are other
types of speed runs

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.160
that are performed
with tool assistance.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.030
And they're really interesting.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.530
They have a whole bunch of
other different things to them.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.946
But for the lessons
that I'm going

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:41.350
to be talking about today,
we're going to be just focusing

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.150
on the human element to things.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.440
Some other important lingo as we
go through this is "category."

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.480
And when a speedrunner
or anybody else

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.670
talks about a category,
they're really

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.850
talking about the rule sets,
the restrictions, and the goals

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.270
that they're trying to
perform this run under.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.810
And this is really important
because it will differentiate

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.300
a speedrun done with no
restrictions versus one that's

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.550
done towards complete
item collection

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.310
or restricting different
techniques that you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.510
might be able to use.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.510
So that's what it is.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.730
Why would you want to do it?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.970
What a lot of people see
is the competitive aspect.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.910
It's something that if
you get good enough,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.800
you can claim that you are the
best in the world at something.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.390
And that's certainly
worth of bragging rights.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.160
There's a real sense
of accomplishment

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.210
that comes from that.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.700
But I would say
that that's actually

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.670
kind of in the minority
of primary motivations

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.830
in why you'd want
to get involved.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.660
What's a much
bigger piece of that

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.910
is actually diving into the
community side of speedruns.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.960
So one of the things that
is really good for newcomers

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.541
is that as you come in,
there's all sorts of people

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.040
who will be supporting
you, who will

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600
be commenting on you, enjoying
your own progress as you

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.840
go through and try to challenge
yourself, reach new goals,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.030
and really test your own limits.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.220
And that's the most
fulfilling part.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.590
And a lot of people
are drawn to that.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.960
They don't necessarily need
to be the best in the world.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.340
But they really
want something that

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.131
will let them play the
games that they love

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.000
and enjoy it in a brand new way.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.300
And that's what speedruns
help to accomplish.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.350
But why would you choose speed
as a particular challenge?

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.320
Why not score or some other
difficult type of challenge

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.280
in the game?

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.371
Well, that's where things
get a little technical.

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.120
Speed is important
because it has a number

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.290
of different trade-offs.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.340
They increase the difficulty of
performing at the human level.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.850
And one of the examples that
I have for this on the chart

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.570
on the left--

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.360
this is just a
quick graph showing

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.130
the time taken to travel one
mile as you increment speeds.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.610
And the thing to note here is
that as you're going forward,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.590
you're actually encountering
diminishing returns.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.950
So for each additional
unit of speed--

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.170
let's say that it took
the same amount of effort

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.826
to increase one unit
of speed as it goes--

00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:08.450
you're actually getting less and
less benefit the further along

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.620
it goes.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.710
And that's really important when
you're trying to, let's say,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.320
save small fractions
of a second--

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.610
because that means that for
every new small amount of time

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.010
that you're shaving off,
that's a huge amount

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.550
more effort in order to
get to that next step.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.400
The other side of
things-- if you treat

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.470
the game as just a black box.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.130
And you're sending inputs
to it to try and achieve

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.750
some optimal goal, some state
within the game that is going

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.560
to tell you you've succeeded.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.510
This is a classic state
explosion problem.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.890
Even in a game
that only responds

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.424
to two different inputs,
just even for one

00:06:49.424 --> 00:06:50.840
second of gameplay,
you're looking

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.180
at 120 bits of possible paths to
search through and try and get

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.680
that.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.250
That's on par with some of the
cryptographic block ciphers

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.580
that we have today.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.160
And that's just not happening.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.500
But of course, you can cut
that down, use intuition to try

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.020
and limit the number of paths
that you need to search.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.350
But at this point, it's not
even really playing the game.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.400
This is trying to treat it
as an optimization problem.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.380
And this is actually a
really important point

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.360
that I want to draw
some more attention to.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.180
So we're going to
take a slight break

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.960
and go into something
a little different.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.940
Let's talk about art.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.800
So this is a particular image
from artist Tatsuo Horiuchi.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.500
And I am just about
the last person

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.170
that you want talking anything
about art and characteristics.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.180
But it seems
perfectly competent.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.190
It's pretty.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.205
It's some piece of art
in an East Asian style.

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:44.690
It seems fine.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.210
I'd be happy to have
this up in my home.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.000
The caveat on this
particular piece of art

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.480
is that it was created
in Microsoft Excel.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.600
And this is just
about the last thing

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.440
that people would expect
from Microsoft Excel.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.860
This is a program built up
entirely around data tabulation

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.090
and organization.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.690
And Mr. Horiuchi
here is using it

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.470
to set up all sorts of things to
create this fantastic picture.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.449
And this just goes to show that
just because Excel was created

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:17.990
to work with numbers
doesn't mean you

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.040
can't do other things with it.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.010
And in fact, it has
all the functionality

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.517
that he needs there to
create something like that.

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:26.600
And he's not the only one.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.100
There's hundreds
of other people who

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.840
will do art in Excel
just because it

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.550
has the tools available.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.554
And it's something that they
can easily get to and work with.

00:08:35.554 --> 00:08:38.600
It might not be as powerful
as Illustrator or something

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.490
else meant for that purpose.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.990
But it is effective.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.020
And it still lets people reach
their creative expression

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.420
and create the products
that they want.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.660
So what about speedruns?

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.100
What a lot of casual
observers and other people

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.260
who are watching speedruns--

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.600
a lot of their first
impressions are,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.150
that's not how I play the game.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.890
That's not what the developer
intended for the game.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.710
And in a lot of
ways, they're right.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.360
That doesn't really
matter, though.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.050
The goal here is to create
an optimized solution

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.430
through the game.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.130
The game itself-- the narrative,
all of the different elements

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.940
that the developers put into it
to try and make an experience--

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.610
don't matter as much.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.540
It's still the game.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.540
But they're more concerned
with, this is the world.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.900
These are the rules that I need
to work within to try and reach

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.620
my end destination.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.430
And that's really
what's going on here.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.119
But if the speedrunners
aren't bounded

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.160
by the rules set by the
developers, what are they

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.090
bounded by?

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.900
And this is where we go into
a lot of other topics dealing

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.570
with how speedruns
should be organized.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.450
What constitutes
a valid speedrun?

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.640
How do you make
things comparable?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.500
For example, even the
timing methodology

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.720
is something that varies
pretty significantly

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.880
by the different games.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.670
Some of the major
timing methodologies

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.320
are listed on the
right side vaguely.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.970
But the main thing is
that even though you're

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.430
getting a metric of time,
what you're measuring

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.594
is actually the skill
of your performance.

00:10:12.594 --> 00:10:14.510
And it's always important
to keep that in mind

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.330
as you're trying to set up
these different qualifications

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.566
on what's happening.

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:20.690
And as you look through
some of these other topics,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.965
really what we're doing is this
is all experimental design.

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.340
You want to create
something that

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.830
is comparable between
different people

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.310
performing under the same
set of goals and restrictions

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.040
so that you can determine,
is this run better?

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.180
Is that run better?

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.580
What is the skill that they
used to accomplish this?

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.670
And that's largely what happens
with speedrun organization.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.150
But that's just the
highest-level look

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.660
at how speedruns are formed,
talking about everything

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.262
that a speed run is.

00:10:49.262 --> 00:10:50.720
From here on, I
really want to talk

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.580
about how to do a speedrun.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.500
And that's kind of
where the meat of things

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.590
is and really the most
interesting parts.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.430
The general process that I
devised and really espouse

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.330
in this is going through
a three-phase approach.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.830
You start out with
investigation,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.229
where you're trying
to understand, what is

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:10.520
the game that I'm working with?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.353
What are its limits?

00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:12.710
What can I do?

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.970
You take that knowledge.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.777
And you apply it once
you get to routing,

00:11:15.777 --> 00:11:17.360
where you actually
make the decisions.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.730
You want to come up
with, here's my path.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.470
These are the set of
decisions that I'm

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.370
going to respond to and really
what I believe to actually make

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.606
an optimal solution
going through this game.

00:11:27.606 --> 00:11:29.230
And then finally,
you get to execution,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.600
because just having a
theory about what's fastest

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.320
isn't good enough.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.800
You need to actually
put it through the end,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.130
make your best
attempt to reproduce

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.860
that particular route,
and then go from there.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.560
This is not a waterfall-style
approach, though.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.800
There is all manner of
things that you might find.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.340
And you're going to wind up
going back to earlier parts

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.759
just so that you can either
increase your understanding,

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.300
make some different decisions
when something doesn't work out

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:57.890
right.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.590
And really still,
at the end, you're

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.139
always getting to this
point of doing the run.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.430
And that's the important piece.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.980
So what I'm going
to go through here

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.010
is just some of the major
topics in each of these

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.880
as we go through.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.770
So a lot of people will
skip over investigation.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.910
Or they won't give it the proper
credit due just because it's

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.290
not the most glamorous.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.600
Really, what you're trying
to do is catalog data.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.433
You're trying to build
up your own knowledge

00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:28.550
pool as you're going through and
making sure that you actually

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.750
document it correctly,
putting it into notes,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.249
making sure it's communicated
out so other people can follow

00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:33.890
the same thing.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.830
But this is basically
the entire phase where

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.630
you're understanding the game.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.250
And that understanding
is really what

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.960
you're going to be
exploiting as you go

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.640
through each individual step.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.250
But for understanding,
you really

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.850
have to first understand
what else is out there.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.760
And the very first
thing that you should do

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.590
is just go out there
and find what is known.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.770
This might be kind
of an obvious step.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.960
But really, the depth
that you go through this

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.130
is kind of surprising
to a lot of people.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.950
Obviously, you start with seeing
if there's other speedruns.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.620
And I'm not just talking
about speedrun videos.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.520
Find out if there's other
comments, other posts,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.210
anything that's actually
indicative of the thought

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.887
process that a person went
through in planning a speedrun.

00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:21.470
It's all very important
because you'll

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.480
be able to work with
that and go from there.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.510
The second level
where you're still

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.490
going to find a lot
of useful information

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.250
is just the general guides
for a particular game--

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.170
so the player's guides, anything
online game-guide related.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.512
Different fan
franchise sites will

00:13:38.512 --> 00:13:40.720
have a lot of useful
information that other fans have

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.886
cataloged-- maybe not for
the purpose of a speedrun,

00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:44.150
but it's data to you.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.500
So you're going to take
it in all the same.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.540
Where a lot of people miss out
is actually in these tier three

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.680
types of resources.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.530
And the way that
I set up the tiers

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.420
is just the likelihood
that you're going

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.040
to find useful information.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.500
But in the same
way, you might find

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.390
some of the most
interesting stuff when

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.880
you start to really
stretch the limits of what

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.720
you're looking at.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.080
So finding any other
related gameplay videos--

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.970
there's actually a lot
of times that people

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.349
are doing a let's play.

00:14:12.349 --> 00:14:13.640
And they'll do something weird.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.280
And they're like, huh.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.613
I didn't know that would happen.

00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:17.450
And a speedrunner will
come along and like--

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.110
I can use that.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.830
And it's really important
to go through that step.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.240
But international sites is also
something that really doesn't

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.470
occur to a lot of people.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.902
In some of my own
research, I was

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.610
working on a game
called "Front Mission--

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.440
Gun Hazard."

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.040
And it's a Japanese-only game.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.616
So of course, most
of the resources

00:14:35.616 --> 00:14:36.990
there are going
to be in Japanese

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.420
on the other side
of the internet

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.930
that I don't go to very
often because I can't read it

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.870
very well.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.490
But in actually doing the due
effort and going over there,

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.660
I was able to find a lone page
on some fan site squirreled

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.054
away that described
a particular glitch.

00:14:53.054 --> 00:14:54.470
And it had enough
details in there

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.050
that I was able to figure
it out and reproduce it.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.570
And that actually ended up
getting used in a speedrun

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.070
to pretty good effect.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.880
So that was my story about
really going the extra mile

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.850
and trying to investigate that.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.700
But this is all about
everything that is known.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.310
What do you do for the
things that aren't known?

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.820
And for that, we go back
to our good old friend

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.300
the scientific method.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.160
One of the biggest
things that is

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.050
really exciting about this
part is the raw discovery

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.740
of what it is that
you're looking at.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.150
So just imagine that
everything that we knew

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.830
about physics was wiped clean.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.840
You could still tell that
when you throw a ball,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.423
it's going to follow
some sort of arc.

00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:35.230
But you don't know the
mechanics behind it.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.810
You don't know, let's say,
what the concept of gravity is

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.160
or anything else like that.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.170
That's something that you
do every time that you

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.425
step into a new video game.

00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:44.050
And you're really
trying to figure out,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.670
how do these things interact?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.430
What are the rules that
govern how they actually work?

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.900
And for that, the
scientific method

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.450
is perfect for actually going
through and figuring out

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.770
the individual things.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.840
And for many of us,
this is something

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.090
that we don't get the chance
to use in our daily lives.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.750
It's something that they
taught to us in middle school.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.880
And we knew it enough
to pass the test.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.400
But getting an
actual opportunity

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.487
to exercise it is
something that--

00:16:09.487 --> 00:16:12.070
for everybody I've talked to who
has tried to experience this,

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.278
it is really rewarding when
you actually come through

00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:16.510
and you figure out, wow,
that particular formula

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.207
works this way.

00:16:17.207 --> 00:16:18.790
Or, I didn't know I
could influence it

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.580
with trying to just
run up and kick

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.170
a wall, or something like that.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.300
And really, you just
follow the same steps

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.860
of identifying what it is that
you actually want to know,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.430
developing a hypotheses,
setting up an experiment,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.076
and then ultimately
trying to analyze

00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:34.450
the results of that experiment
and decide how it actually

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.182
impacts things.

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:37.390
And that's how you build up
all of the knowledge that

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.180
isn't already known and
written down elsewhere.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.927
But this has helped
a little bit simply

00:16:42.927 --> 00:16:45.010
because you're living in
a land of software, which

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.720
means that everything
in that world

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.780
is going to be bounded by
the restraints of software.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.520
And really,
everything is governed

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.810
by some amount of math.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.636
And that's really everything.

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:57.010
For a lot of casual
players, they

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.700
don't realize that, let's
say, the power-up state

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.830
of Mario in "Super
Mario World" is actually

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.800
governed by a single
address that is responding

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.069
to whatever that value is.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.569
All right.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.694
That's interesting to know.

00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:12.970
But why would I care about
that as a speedrunner?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.880
Well, it just so happens
that that particular value

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.020
goes into an index
into a big table

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.420
that you might be able to
do some funny things with.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.569
And you get some fantastic
results just so long

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:29.200
as you know the math and
fundamentals behind that.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.000
Beyond that, some
of the other things

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.590
that you take for
granted are still

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.810
governed by different
calculations-- for example,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.500
a typical hitbox scenario.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.080
And this is basically
when two objects deciding

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.300
whether they're colliding
or not is simply

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.860
whether two squares
are overlapping

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.380
on a Cartesian map,
something relatively

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.700
simple to do and implement.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.130
But it's not
immediately apparent

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.110
simply because of all
of the artistic work

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.600
on top of the game
that's going on.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.330
And then, of course, there's
also just the regular formulas.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.010
The "Final Fantasy
V" sword damage

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.840
formula is illustrated
there at the bottom.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.367
And the important
part is knowing

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.200
all of the different
pieces that go into it.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.200
But as a speedrunner,
you will absolutely

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.470
need to know what all of
those different factors are

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.350
and how best you can
optimize it so that you wind

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.260
up with enough
damage to take out

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.194
that boss in a certain
number of turns.

00:18:19.194 --> 00:18:20.860
And that's the kind
of thing that you're

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.570
going to try and look for.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.430
The last thing in
investigation--

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.950
and this is probably the most
fun for a lot of people--

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.000
is discovery.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.910
So once you start to know
what those limits are,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.880
you can really start to push
them and find out other ways

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.980
to use and abuse the game beyond
what anybody really expected.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.780
This covers
everything from using

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.980
basic aspects of the
game-- for example,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.460
in "Mega Man 4," if you
take damage from an enemy,

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.870
you have a brief period of
vulnerability afterwards.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.169
Well, you can abuse that
brief period of vulnerability

00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:54.460
and interact with things that
would otherwise instantly

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.470
kill you for as long
as you're invulnerable.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.011
So you can use that
to your advantage

00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.850
and skip through some things
that would otherwise not

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.280
be very polite.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.460
There's also
instances where if you

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.730
know the fundamentals of how
the game is actually operating--

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.449
in this case, the random number
generation sequence of a game--

00:19:12.449 --> 00:19:13.990
you might be able
to actually exploit

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.198
that so you can make what
would be a lucky occurrence

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:17.840
into a consistent occurrence.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.160
And that's something that we're
getting much more exposure

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.010
to recently as people really
dive into what makes the games

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.530
tick and seeing just
how much a human can

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.960
interact and influence it.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.300
The last thing that I
want to discuss here

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.870
is actually illustrated by
that picture on the right side.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.380
And I really love this picture.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.920
This is from a glitch
exhibition for a game called

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.300
"Ocarina of Time."

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.110
And really, every time that
you look at this picture,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.440
you will find something new
that is just out of place.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.730
Even if you're not
familiar with the game,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.271
you can probably tell there's
a whole bunch of things in here

00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:52.660
that aren't going right--

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.080
21 hearts, 37 keys, sold out.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.550
What the heck's going on here?

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.200
And what's wonderful
about this is

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.850
that this is all
stuff that is achieved

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.590
within the bounds of the game.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.260
You have a player who is
going through and manipulating

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.500
a game in such a way to make
all of these crazy anomalies

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.906
that nobody would normally
encounter into a reality.

00:20:11.906 --> 00:20:13.780
And it's the fact that
you can stretch a game

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.780
to those limits that is really
exciting to a lot of people.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.840
Next up is routing.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.320
And this is where you put
all of that information, all

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.200
of that extra work and
investigative knowledge,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.220
to use.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.440
And really what it
comes down to is

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.270
trying to solve the
puzzle of the game.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.810
And this goes at the full
scope of start to finish,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.780
as well as going down
to much smaller levels--

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.971
the individual rooms, the
individual patterns that

00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:42.470
you're going to
need to go through--

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.930
in order to reach
the end solution.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.571
And this is
particularly difficult,

00:20:47.571 --> 00:20:49.820
especially as a game has a
lot of different variables,

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.260
has a lot of different
options that you need

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.700
to try and take into account.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.160
There's a lot of different
planning methodologies

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.220
and strategies that really
make this successful.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.180
One of the main ones that
I try to work with and tell

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.390
people to follow is actually
the engineering design process.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.030
And this is one of
those standard ways

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.660
that an engineer will go
through looking at a product

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.550
that they want to
design and going

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.430
through an iterative process so
that they can improve upon it,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.390
meet the needs, and
also still satisfy

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.880
a variety of conditions.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.689
It's kind of weird to think
about a speedrun as a product.

00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:24.230
But really, it works
really well here

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.438
because you're going through.

00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:27.422
You're trying to
identify a solution set.

00:21:27.422 --> 00:21:29.630
And then you're trying to
make that solution set work

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.270
within your own constraints.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.250
This covers a similar process
to the scientific method.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.956
The particular version of it
that I've set up here goes

00:21:37.956 --> 00:21:40.580
through identifying and actually
making sure that you know what

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.870
it is that you're
trying to solve--

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.090
because that can get away
from you a lot of times--

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.850
enumerating what's
possible, comparing them,

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.950
and then ultimately
testing it and making sure

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.895
that it works within
the full scope of all

00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:53.520
the other solutions that you've
come up with, and then finally,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.050
using that and communicating
it either in text,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.880
making a video of it,
or actually doing it

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.840
in a speedrun.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.700
So that enumerates
the whole process.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.240
And it's really important to
try and follow this and identify

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.540
what is going to make a
particular path fastest

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.820
and best to try and work with.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.670
One of the other common
aspects is resource management.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.700
And this is something
that a lot of people

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.200
treat as fairly obvious.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.020
But it becomes a
really complex piece

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.990
of the puzzle when you start
to have to make trade-offs.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.770
And in this case, you might have
an opportunity to, let's say,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.657
spend health.

00:22:28.657 --> 00:22:29.990
Health is an important resource.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.150
It's something that
you can actually trade

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.040
in a lot of games for time.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.112
You can try and save time
by using your health,

00:22:36.112 --> 00:22:38.570
something that you're trying
to otherwise conserve and keep

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.160
up as high as possible
to reduce risk.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.800
In the same way, you might have
other expendable resources,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.660
illustrated in this by bombs.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.310
But you have the
trade-offs of, well,

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.580
if I keep more bombs, how can
I use those to save time later?

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.940
How much is a bomb
worth in terms

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.520
of the time that it saves?

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.530
And this can be used to
offset risk, trying to make,

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.670
let's say, a boss fight easier
or a next stage a little more

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.340
consistent, things like that.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.960
Time is also an
important resource.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.920
And this is in the context
of, if I spend more time now,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.050
will I save more time later?

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.500
It's all trying to make this
great weight measurement

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.960
about what's actually going
to get you through optimally.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.710
And it's a lot to keep track of.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.590
But when you come up with
something that feels good,

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.270
it's just that much
more satisfying.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.970
When you identify something
that trades off all the risk,

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.160
gets you through
optimally, and you're still

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.060
looking at a good run,
resource management

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.160
is really what comes
out on top as far as how

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.650
you distribute your actions.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:45.560
One of the least-recognized
pieces of actually planning out

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.320
a speedrun is actually
working with consistency.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.810
And consistency in
this case is everything

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.990
that has to do with making sure
that you actually go through

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.520
and succeed at the very least
the worst case, but most

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.690
often the average case.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.910
And this is just an
example for this.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.580
Let's say that there's
a four-way stop.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.110
You need to travel from home.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.770
And you need to go do some
chores at the bank, the grocer,

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.040
and the post office.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.650
You need to visit all
three and return home.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.189
The distances to all of them
is approximately the same.

00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:18.230
How would you actually
make sure that you proceed

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.290
optimally, assuming that
you don't know, let's say,

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.820
what the traffic
is on the roads?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.769
You don't know the
actual light pattern.

00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:26.810
You have no guarantee that
it's going to be green

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.950
when you're going to it.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.580
So what kind of things can you
do to increase your consistency

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.877
in getting through faster?

00:24:32.877 --> 00:24:35.210
And that's a large part of
what consistency planning is.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.280
So you can, in this
particular example,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.000
start to think about, well, if
I can do a right turn on red,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.910
I'm going to basically skip
out on most of the times

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.940
that I would otherwise get
stopped by only a stoplight.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.530
If I avoid left
turns so I don't have

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.110
to worry about oncoming
traffic, that will also

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.510
increase my consistency in
actually getting through

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.010
quickly.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.259
And these are some of the
other things that you really

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:58.200
need to think about
making it successful.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.280
There's an example in a
game called "Castlevania--

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.320
Symphony of the Night."

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.440
There is a strategy that,
if done successfully,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.910
saves 10% to 20% off of
the current fastest time.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.830
And this is a very
competitive game.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.870
The caveat is that to
execute this successfully,

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.010
you at the very least
need a 1 in 4,100 chance.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.540
Nobody has done this yet.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.250
Nobody has even really tried.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.320
And it's just one
of those things

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.080
that even if you know something
is faster, if it's not

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.700
going to ever work
out so that you're

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.470
going to keep your sanity while
trying to do these attempts,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.670
then, yeah, you're probably not
going to try to incorporate it.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.890
The last thing I want to
talk about is execution.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:46.330
And this has everything to
do with how you're actually

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.800
able to perform in the game.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.070
How are you able to
play at a high level,

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.315
do human-level
optimizations, and understand

00:25:54.315 --> 00:25:55.690
how it is that
you're going to be

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.314
able to practice and reinforce
these things mentally?

00:25:58.314 --> 00:25:59.980
When a lot of people
are getting started

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.290
or just watching speedruns
for the first time,

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.720
they see these people
doing incredible things

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.440
in these games.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.730
And they're like, wow.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.200
I'll never be able to do that.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.190
They're superhuman.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.500
They've got all these
gifts and abilities.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.630
And they're able to
complete the game so fast.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.700
It's not something
I'd be able to do.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.980
Well, at the end of the day, no.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.750
Nobody is really
superhuman here.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.181
They've just
trained excessively.

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:24.430
They didn't get their abilities
by coming into contact

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.950
with a radioactive spider.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.050
It's much more
along the lines of,

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.800
they've put in a
whole lot of work.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.270
They've done the training.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.704
They've done all of the practice
necessary to actually reinforce

00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:36.370
these things that
they're doing and then

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.190
to really cut down on the
overhead of their own actions.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.550
And for that purpose, it's much
more like trying to be a ninja.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.640
You're trying to be an average
person who just happens

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.920
to be very trained
in a particular thing

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.220
and do it particularly well.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.480
And there's a lot of
strategies to actually do this,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.620
starting first and
foremost with practice.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.530
And really, what we're talking
about when we mention practice

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.000
is you're trying to learn.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.940
Practice is all about trying
to learn how your body works,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.030
trying to learn how
you're going to respond

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.020
in certain situations,
making that

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.294
into an automatic
mechanism so that when

00:27:17.294 --> 00:27:19.460
you come across something,
you don't think about it.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.680
You just do it.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.380
And there's a lot of
different pieces of psychology

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.050
that are important here-- trying
to set up appropriate chunking

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.020
strategies, trying to
work with scaffolding.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.050
And there's many
different aspects

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.410
to trying to train effectively
so that that training isn't

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.370
lost, so that you
actually improve faster.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:44.110
And it really is just about
understanding your own brain.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:48.626
But even beyond that, once
you have the practice in,

00:27:48.626 --> 00:27:51.250
once you've built up the muscle
memory, there's a lot of things

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.280
that you really need to do to
rely on the game to synchronize

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.240
up those actions.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.300
And this is where
various cues come in.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.700
So you're looking for
things in the game, things

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.470
that you generate yourself
or just get a feel for,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.160
to actually set up your
actions so that they actually

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.036
work within the realm
of what you need to do.

00:28:09.036 --> 00:28:10.660
There's a lot of good
examples for this

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.220
in "Super Metroid," where
just by complete chance

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.770
there are plants, foreground
objects, other things that you

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.920
can look for that you can
use to identify where I need

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.910
to execute a particular move,
where you need to jump off

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.430
a wall and get up to somewhere
that you're not supposed

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.110
to, all sorts of
things like this

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.969
that you can rely on to help
you sync up what you're doing.

00:28:32.969 --> 00:28:35.260
There's another example with
"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!"

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.687
where the developers actually
made a dynamic audience

00:28:38.687 --> 00:28:41.020
in the background that otherwise
doesn't do a whole lot.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.880
You're primarily
focused on the fighter.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.760
But while the fighters
are doing certain things,

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.770
they included cues
in that audience

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.470
that help you to identify
when you're actually supposed

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.180
to start up a
counter attack, when

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.976
you're supposed to do a dodge.

00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:55.600
Some of these examples--
they're pretty

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.820
hard to see in this
particular picture.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.515
But there's a guy flashing a
camera at a particular point

00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:02.140
that you're supposed
to counter attack.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.030
There's another one
who drops his glasses.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.470
And all these
little extra details

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.011
that the developers
actually included

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.830
really help out in
trying to identify

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.080
how you're going to
counter these otherwise

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.280
difficult threats.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.980
But even beyond visual things,
audio is really important.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.690
And this is important not
only from a reaction speed

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:20.660
standpoint.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.510
You can actually
respond to audio

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.090
about 20 to 40
milliseconds faster

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.560
than you can visual cues.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.670
But it's also just really
important in terms of knowing--

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.390
let's say I'm in a boss area.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.390
That boss is going to
spawn at a particular time.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.730
And the music just so happens
to be synced up with that.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:41.440
And in this case, in a game
called "Hagane," which I run,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.800
you're using a particular part
of that intro sound sequence

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.470
to know when to start to launch
your attack so that you can get

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.720
a very powerful attack in
right at the beginning when

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.470
he's first coming out.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.800
One of the last things that
I really want to discuss

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.180
is that what you're
doing is a performance.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.160
It's a complete
execution of your route.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.650
And as part of that,
you also have instances

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.440
where you're getting into your
mind, where you are starting

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.320
to doubt yourself, where
you're trying to actually

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.470
keep up with a high level of
play as you're going through.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.240
And what's actually
shown along the bottom

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.220
there is a heart rate graph of--

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.250
this is my heart going through
a speedrun of "Skyblazer,"

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.890
which is the first game
that I've speedrun.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.280
And each of those instances--
as you're going through,

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.920
you can see that it
gradually increases.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.140
And I'm just sitting down.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.760
This gets up to the point
of moderate exercise

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.790
all while I'm in a
chair just because I'm

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.950
trying to rectify whatever
is going on with the screen

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.720
and keep up my
composure so that I can

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.490
continue to perform optimally.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.380
And that's really
another thing that

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.530
comes in with conditioning--
trying to do these runs over

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.160
and over again.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.520
You identify, here's
my best strategy

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.820
for trying to calm down.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.690
Here's how I don't
start to mess up simply

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.350
because I've put too much
effort and thought into what's

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.700
going on on the screen.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.530
And it's a significant part of
it when you're going through

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.670
and your heart's racing.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.080
You've got the adrenaline
pumping and all that.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.227
But it's another really
fun part of a speedrun.

00:31:15.227 --> 00:31:16.810
If you're able to
get through the end,

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.190
you get a great release.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.440
It just feels amazing.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.440
Even if you drop a
run right at the end,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.270
it can still feel
really rewarding

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.250
that you've done so
well and that you know,

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.080
I can get there again.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.420
So that covers the
overall process.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.000
Here is just a dump of a
whole bunch of other topics

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.870
that fit into these general
parts of the phases.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.140
And what I just
wanted to show here

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.270
is that what I've
talked about today

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.960
is just scratching the surface.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.470
There is so much
to optimization,

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.590
to planning, to proper
presentation of facts

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:55.390
and details about games that
there's something for everyone.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.940
Even if you're not intent on
trying to go for a world record

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.300
or anything like that, you
can enjoy the running process,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.110
coming up with a solution.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.630
You can enjoy
breaking apart a game,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.030
finding out what makes it
tick, and then exploiting

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.000
those boundaries and taking
it to something further.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.120
And still, you can enjoy
the practice properties--

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.700
improving yourself, coming
up with a real product that

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.540
shows iterative improvement.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.690
So just to wrap up everything
related to the speedrun

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.460
process, my main recommendation
is if you're getting started,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.560
even if you're already
a conditioned runner,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.820
you want to try every step.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.280
Try every bit of the
phases even if it's

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.410
a game that's been
done to death just

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.736
so you know what you enjoy.

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:38.110
You can find all
sorts of things,

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.270
as well as improve
your own understanding

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.940
of what you're doing and
increase your enjoyment

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.020
on top of that.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.890
And really, to get the most
satisfaction about this,

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.280
you want to be trying
to push yourself.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.477
Don't necessarily just shoot
for a record because it's there.

00:32:54.477 --> 00:32:56.560
You really have to make
it something that is worth

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.685
the effort that you put
into it and something

00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:00.310
that you can be proud
of after the fact

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.890
beyond simply being the
top of the leaderboard.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.520
And also, never forget that you
have a great opportunity here

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.620
to work with others.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.970
There's a very supportive
community all around who's

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.861
willing to help, who's willing
to support and just watch

00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:13.360
your runs.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.000
And it feels great
to be a part of.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.780
I want to end out with just
a quick discussion of where

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.180
speedrunning actually is today.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.700
As a practice, it really is
something that's only blown up

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.740
within the last 10 years or so.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.150
This particular chart is
showing the total amounts raised

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.670
and the average viewership
of what are known

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.020
as the Games Done Quick events.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.420
And these are twice-annual
events that are entirely

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.300
speedrunning focused.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.420
But they're benefiting
a particular charity

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.590
at each event.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.460
And it's something that has
really exploded in popularity.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.637
But it mimics the
growth and attention

00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:52.720
that's been given to
speedruns it's going through.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.510
If this graph included
this year's numbers,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.670
we'd also see the
trend continuing.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.640
And one of the things that's
the most rewarding to me

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.740
is that this is a
hobby with video games

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.270
that's actually making a
difference in the world.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.320
We raise millions of dollars
simply because people

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.199
enjoy watching it
and are particularly

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.800
generous with appreciating
the skills going into it.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.480
And that's something
that I honestly

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.310
find particularly wonderful and
is really rewarding beyond just

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.900
doing the speedruns itself.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.875
And that wraps up everything.

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:26.500
Everything that I've
talked about today

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.060
is a subset of some of the
topics that I address in a book

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.719
that I've been working on for
quite a long time now called

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:34.510
"Speedrun Science."

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.480
And it tries to break down
every little bit of it.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.020
In addition to discussing
the actual process,

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.630
it goes into the
philosophy, some

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.179
of the history of how it
actually evolved and became

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.330
more important.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:51.940
And finally, it'll be
available in just a few weeks

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.449
for preorder, probably
arriving at people's doors

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.920
somewhere around February.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.200
A special thanks
to Kari Fry, who's

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.120
my Illustrator for the book.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.980
She provided many
of the illustrations

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.790
that you're seeing throughout
the slide deck as well.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:10.000
And Tony Kuchar, who
is my layout editor,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.860
also produced a number
of these graphics.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.110
So special thanks to them
and the rest of the Fangamer

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.630
crew for working with me in
the production of this book.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.310
And with that,
I'll close it out.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.790
You can reach out to me at
any of those social media

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.590
or email addresses
at the bottom.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.565
And with that, I'm happy
to take any questions.

00:35:27.565 --> 00:35:28.940
AUDIENCE: So I
had some questions

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.840
from people who aren't
in the office right now.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.970
First, save the Yoshis?

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.130
ERIC KOZIEL: No.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.640
No.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.250
AUDIENCE: And second,
a question from Iowa,

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.951
what's the weirdest way you've
seen someone discover a trick?

00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:45.200
ERIC KOZIEL: The weirdest way?

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.430
Oh, man.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:52.430
So there's a particular
game called "Dragon View"

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.720
on Super Nintendo.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.992
And this game-- oh, my.

00:35:56.992 --> 00:35:59.450
A friend of mine was working
on the speedrun for this game.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.440
And at a particular
part, we discovered a bug

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.880
that had not prior been known.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.290
And the only way that
you execute this bug

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:07.831
is simply that you
haven't turned off

00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.430
the game after completing
a certain story element.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.138
And then you reach
another story element.

00:36:12.138 --> 00:36:14.560
You were expected to take a
break somewhere in the middle.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.310
And you never would
have seen this happen.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.650
But they left some
dirty memory somewhere.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.651
And what actually ends
up happening is a huge--

00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:23.150
oh, my.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.100
It's a very scary bug.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.035
Basically, it allows you to
overwrite the entire memory

00:36:28.035 --> 00:36:28.535
contents.

00:36:28.535 --> 00:36:32.585
It even tries to start
fiddling with ROM.

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:34.294
It does a lot of very
interesting things.

00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:36.210
But this was discovered
completely by accident

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.540
simply because they were
trying to go through the game

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.680
all in one sitting.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.750
And it actually
turns out that if you

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:47.750
get the exact magic conditions,
you can make this warp you

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.900
into the ending credits
so that you effectively

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.630
have a choice between-- if
you try to play it completely

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.290
like this, you either
completely crash the game

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.860
or you make it to the end.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.790
And it was just a
really interesting find.

00:37:04.532 --> 00:37:05.990
If you want details,
I can describe

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.330
that afterwards a little
bit more about what's

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.274
actually going on
under the hood.

00:37:10.274 --> 00:37:12.440
AUDIENCE: I think I saw a
speedrun for "Half-Life 2"

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.590
that worked by saving and
reloading the game so that when

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.860
you reload the game, you're
in a different position.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.310
And the video for
those runs were

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.740
edited so you can
only see the gameplay.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.320
Is that something that's
a specific category,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.300
as you mentioned the
categories before?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.060
ERIC KOZIEL: That would be
a segmented run for the most

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.320
part, especially if they're
removing the in-between.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.370
But it really is up to
how the community defines

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.510
what is challenging what
you're actually trying to show.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.930
And in this case, let's
say that Half-Life 2--

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.150
simply by saving
and quitting is what

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.070
actually alters your position.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.520
Then that's something that
you can use in what's called

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.930
a "single-segment run,"
done in one sitting.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.450
But most often, for
those kinds of things,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.150
it's going to be segmented
in that you do a block of it,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.772
try to get it as
optimal as possible.

00:38:03.772 --> 00:38:05.480
In that save, you're
going to bring it up

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.910
again and do another one.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.310
Whether or not it's
allowed or expected

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:11.700
is really up to the game.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.580
And it really depends
on how the game

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.000
interacts with those saves.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.060
All right.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.630
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.000
It's my pleasure to talk.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.050
[APPLAUSE]
