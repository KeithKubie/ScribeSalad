00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.380
CHUMLEE: What do you have here?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.710
CHRIS: I have a pair of
brass duck foot pistols.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.670
CHUMLEE: Wow, those
are pretty cool.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.380
CHRIS: These are
volley pistols that

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.620
were made for a British Naval
officer in the 18th century.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.540
CHUMLEE: Mind if I grab one?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.170
CHRIS: Go right ahead.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.830
CHUMLEE: I see where they
call them, uh, duck foot.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.460
Looks like a little duck foot--
CHRIS: It does.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.170
CHUMLEE: --swimming
through the water.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.420
Even though I'm not supposed
to deal with high priced items,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.170
these guns are some of the
coolest things that I've

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.330
seen coming into the shop.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.920
I can't let this guy walk.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.250
It's time to prove Rick,
he's not the only one

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580
that can wheel and deal.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.920
What do you want
to do with them?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.580
CHRIS: I'd like to sell them.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.920
CHUMLEE: OK, how much are
you looking to get for them?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.330
I'm interested.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.750
CHRIS: I'm asking $50,000.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.920
$50,000?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.000
Um, I mean, it
could be possible.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.750
If you let me take these to
the gun range and fire them.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.170
I'm fine with that.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.540
I-- I'd like to fire them, too.
- All right.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.080
Well, you got time today?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.830
CHRIS: I'm free all afternoon.
CHUMLEE: All right.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll meet at the gun range, in
say, about an hour and a half?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.170
OK.
That sounds good to me.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.380
All right.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.210
I'll write the
address down, home.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.830
I'll be right back.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.080
CHRIS: OK.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.290
I think once we get
out on the range

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.750
and he actually
fires them, I think

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.750
we're going to make a deal.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.420
RICK: Well, you guys
look really busy.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Oh, just-- I was waiting
for you to get back, actually.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.620
I got to take the rest
the day out of the shop.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.960
But I'm still going
to be working.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.290
RICK: Oh, shi-- what
are you going to do?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.580
CHUMLEE: I just-- I'm
about to go purchase a gun,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.750
duck foot pistol.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.080
I need to go make sure it works.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.790
I told the guy to
meet me at the range.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.960
RICK: And how much are
you going to buy this for?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.120
Well, he said $50, but he
was just throwing in an--

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.750
- $50?
- Thousand.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.960
But he was throwing
an amount there.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.120
COREY: OK.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.040
I'm definitely going
with you, then.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.380
CHUMLEE: No, I got it.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.250
I'm going with you,
I don't worry, man.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.880
CHUMLEE: No, I got this.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.120
Trust me.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.790
RICK: I will meet
you guys out there.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.580
COREY: Wha--

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.080
RICK: I was more or less forced
to come out of the gun range,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.120
because Chum set up a time
to meet him at the range

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.290
and test them out.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.960
I asked Alex to come
down to meet us,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.290
because I need a second
opinion, because I unequivocally

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.500
do not trust Chum.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.920
So what do we got here?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.580
I have a pristine pair
of duck's foot pistols.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.500
COREY: Whoa.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.830
RICK: Well, those are cool.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.620
COREY: Wow.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.170
Check that out.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.620
RICK: Wow, Chum, you actually
didn't screw this up.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.330
CHUMLEE: Told you.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.250
ALEX: The real term for
this is a volley pistol.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.330
And the reason they
designed this, though--

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.830
it was for crowd control.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.830
So any time that you might
have a mass of people

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.580
trying to get you,
you would want

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.620
to volley pistol in your hand.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.000
RICK: Oh, wow.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.500
ALEX: And look, you guys
see that mark, has a V

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.750
and there's crown over it?
COREY: Yeah.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.460
Those are British proof marks.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.790
Basically, they passed a law,
because they didn't want gun

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.120
makers making bad guns
that would blow up and kill

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.670
people who are firing them.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.710
So in England, any
time you made a gun,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.710
you had to submit it
to the proof house.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.000
They would put three
times the amount of powder

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.790
in it that it was supposed
to be able to handle.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880
If it didn't blow up,
they stamped it with a V

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.170
with the crown-- means viewed.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.540
So each of these
barrel is viewed.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330
That's a really good sign.
COREY: Sweet.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.830
RICK: OK.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.880
So, um-- it's all right
with you if we shoot them?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.880
Yes.
Go right ahead.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.830
RICK: All right.
Well, load them up.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.880
ALEX: All right, Chum.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.120
That is cocked
and ready to fire.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.540
Corey?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.460
COREY: Chum, you're first.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.330
[muffled gunshots]

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.710
[laughter]

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.460
RICK: Chum's didn't
all fire at once.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.210
They went bup-bup-bup.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.580
ALEX: Yup.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.670
Me now?

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.080
[muffled gunshots]

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.670
[laughter]

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.500
COREY: That was, uh, not
what I was expecting at all.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.750
ALEX: (LAUGHING)

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.380
COREY: Did I hit anything?
ALEX: Yeah.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.580
Yeah, you got hit.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.540
Here, and you got there.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.080
That's two, three, four.
COREY: Oh, wow.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.580
ALEX: Chum got-- one--

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.170
RICK: You had four barrels,
and you shot the target once.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.080
CHUMLEE: What?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.380
[laughter]

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.000
COREY: So, I mean,
I know they're cool,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.620
but what are they worth?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.120
They're the real deal.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.120
They're rare, they're really
early, by a known maker,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120
and they fire.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.620
These are not
inexpensive pistols

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.620
I value them at $45,000.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.880
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.620
COREY: OK, um--
well, man, I really

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.210
appreciate you coming down.
- You're welcome.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.250
Good luck.
Nice to meet you.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.790
Thank you.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.420
ALEX: There's a huge market
for duck's foot pistols.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.120
I do think it's worth it for
the shop to purchase them,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.380
because they're never going
to see a pair like this again.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.460
So what are you looking
to get out of them?

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.750
I was looking to get $50,000.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.210
(SIGHS) You know
I can't pay that.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.540
Um-- I'm more in the
$20-- $20,000 range.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.460
Could you come down
a little bit, or--

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.330
Would you accept $40,000?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.000
I'll tell you what, man, uh--

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I could do $30 grand.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.330
That's the most I can do.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.170
CHRIS: Would you do $35,000?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.620
I-- I wouldn't.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.330
$30 grand's what I can do.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Sorry, I can't take
anything less than $35,000.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.920
Well, I appreciate it, my man.
CHRIS: Thank you.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.830
Maybe next time.
Take care.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.170
CHRIS: I wasn't able
to make a deal today

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.830
with the volley
pistols, but, you

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.000
know, I think that
I'm going to have

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.960
to fend off a whole
crowd of buyers,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.960
once I get them back out there.
