Welcome to our project
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:18.660
where Spanish-speaking experts
from Latin America

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.066
will show you some
our tools,

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.660
developer products,
APIs and new tricks.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.033
This course is divided
into five parts.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.297
We invite you to watch it
and learn along.

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:30.792
Here we go.

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.792

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.660
in an automatic manner.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
And finally,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.990
we performed a practice
where we built

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.363
our first HTML5 app
hosted on Google Drive.

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.198

into a pie chart.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:20.495
Y finally,

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:23.528

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:25.792
with Google Charts.

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:28.858

with the information
from Spreadsheets in real time.

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:48.990
And finally,
we performed a practice

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.396

to Google's Cloud.

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.759
In lesson 4 we covered
the following subjects:

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.396

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:28.066
I hope you enjoyed it
as much as I did

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.924
and that it inspires you
to create big HTML5 projects.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:32.891
