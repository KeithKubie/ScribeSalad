it's always difficult to award a Nobel

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159
it's always difficult to award a Nobel
 

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.949
it's always difficult to award a Nobel
Peace Prize because there is so much

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959
Peace Prize because there is so much

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.240
interest and there are so many
candidates then we had to resolve

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.250
candidates then we had to resolve
 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.310
candidates then we had to resolve
whether it would be in the committee's

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320
whether it would be in the committee's
 

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.490
whether it would be in the committee's
interest to go into the situation in

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:51.500
interest to go into the situation in
 

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.910
interest to go into the situation in
China there are obvious complications

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920
