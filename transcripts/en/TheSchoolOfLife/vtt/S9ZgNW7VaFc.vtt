00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.270
In dark, honest moments, we are liable to
recognise – with considerable agony – that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.770
there is so much missing from our lives. We
have been unable to get quite the career we

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.110
wanted. Our partners leave us largely unfulfilled.
We have made some catastrophic mistakes that

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.890
can never be corrected. Our appearance is
shameful and in decline. And there is, correspondingly,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.880
so much that we envy. No philosopher has ever
taken envy more seriously than Friedrich Nietzsche.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.020
The 19th-century German philosopher described
it as the most important emotion at work in

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.110
individual and collective life. In his writings,
he referred to it with a slightly unusual

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.960
word, the French term ressentiment – which
places emphasis on the humiliation we experience

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.460
in the face of what we desire but cannot have.
In his book On The Genealogy of Morality,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.720
published in 1887, Nietzsche presents us with
a ground-breaking diagnosis of envy. He opens

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.950
with a speculative history of how our ideas
of good and evil developed – and the crucial

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.290
role of envy therein. In ancient times, Nietzsche
argued, what counted as negative or positive

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.960
was defined in a rather direct and simple
way by the powerful. Those who held military,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.110
financial and political authority

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.880
got to decide what sort
of actions and behaviours would be thought

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.799
admirable. Because of the aristocrats’ attachments
and tastes, ‘good’ came to be synonymous

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.600
with aristocratic values like winning, making
money, being confidently sexual, knowing a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.580
lot and securing fame. Assured of their own
virtue, the powerful in ancient times slept

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.319
soundly. But the aristocracy’s reign did
not go on unchallenged. There were too many

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.200
weak, powerless and downtrodden people at
large, a mass of men and women whom Nietzsche

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.300
alternately and with a dark playfulness – deliberately
designed to appall sensitivities – called

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.310
‘the slaves’, ‘the plebeians’ or ‘the
herd’. These people increasingly wanted

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.189
to avenge themselves against the powerful.
At the same time, they lacked any practical

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:36.860
means of doing so, having no money or political
leverage. Then they hit on an idea of genius:

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.480
They would
fight back against the rich and the strong

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.980
with the weapon of guilt. They couldn’t
attack the powerful physically, but they could

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.879
leave them unable to sleep well at night.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.530
They would ruin them
via their consciences. A central weapon in

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.819
this revenge attack was – for Nietzsche
– the ideology we know today as Christianity.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.459
Christianity was for the philosopher a brilliant,
devilish instrument of revenge dreamt up by

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.150
the weak to make the strong feel guilty for
their advantages. It was Christianity’s

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.689
strategy to relabel as bad everything once
associated with aristocratic values – and

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:23.230
to anoint with the term good everything with
which the ‘herd’ was identified. So, in

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.370
the new Christian moral scheme, having no
money was relabelled ‘noble poverty’,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.299
having no education was praised as ‘sincerity’,
lacking sex was hailed as ‘chastity’ – and,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:44.150
as Nietzsche put it, ‘not-being-able-to-take-revenge’
turned into ‘forgiveness.’ Envious for

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.930
what they couldn’t have, Christians made
the powerful feel untenably guilty – and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.903
insisted that the kingdom of God belonged
to the weak, the meek, the chaste, the poor

00:03:52.903 --> 00:03:55.100
and the persecuted.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.900
Nietzsche
almost admired the audacity of this move but

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.479
at the same time held it to be responsible
for an appalling bad faith and the degradation

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:12.030
of European civilisation. In a cantankerous
tone, he wrote that: The man of ressentiment

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.829
is neither upright nor naïve, nor honest
and straight with himself. His soul squints;

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:26.320
his mind loves dark corners, secret paths
and back-doors. For Nietzsche, the psychological

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.660
health of a person or society depends on being
able to resist denigrating what one wants

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.130
but can’t have. It involves resisting the
urge to deny the gaps in one’s life for

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.310
the sake of inner convenience. It is, for
Nietzsche, always better to say what one wishes

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.610
to be and have rather than to twist one’s
entire personality to avoid discomfort. We

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.110
must, for the philosopher, be strong enough
to face, and stay honest about, our own misfortunes.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.840
Though Nietzsche spent a lot of time studying
Christianity, he understood that the desire

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.320
to redraw values on the basis of repressed
envy was a manoeuvre that could appear under

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.590
many guises. His attacks may seem harsh and
potentially even an absurd defence of boorish

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.210
upper class set of values. But it’s important to
remember that Nietzsche himself was no aristocrat:

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.440
he lacked money, sex, an audience, friends
– but he was committed to honesty with himself

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.470
and so didn’t shirk away from admitting
that, in certain moods, he would dearly have

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.460
wished to be more heroic, fulfilled and brave,
yet lacked the talent to be so. Nietzsche’s

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.000
message is that one of the most mature acts
we are capable of is to admit to the strength

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.400
of our envy – and the scale of our regret
– without falling prey to defensive philosophies

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:02.760
of denial, in all their many and ingenious
disguises. Our Western Philosophy cards, features
