&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So hi everyone. We're here,
I mentioned at the last All Hands that we're

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.870
gonna have Josiah Citrin come out and visit.
And that he's a nice guy. That we'd talked.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.560
He was going to give us an actual demo which
I think is a very special treat and I also

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.880
pointed out he was arguably the best chef
in Los Angeles. I've eaten at his restaurant.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.660
If you haven't, Melisse. It's really worth
going to and checking out.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.039
He's also got some really interesting, I've
learned more from looking at the internet

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.989
some really interesting concepts on food.
He's gone through a very interesting evolution

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.320
personally in his life. And hopefully will
share some of those experiences and answer

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.350
some questions.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.739
I'll point out three things. He was one of
the first chef-owners to win a, two Michelin

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.460
stars. There's four of those restaurants in
Los Angeles. And Melisse was one of the very

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.610
early ones. He lives local to Google LA here
in Venice. So if you wanna stop over for lunch.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.610
[laughter]

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210
You might wanna give it a shot.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.860
And he's a surfer. So I know we've got some
surfers here too. So if you have surfing related

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.500
questions or tips you want. Here's the guy
to ask.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.170
And he's been, they've been very generous
in providing us books. Which is the author

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.240
"In Pursuit of Excellence." They're in the
back. And there's actually a great, I'm not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.520
going to give a more detailed intro. 'Cause
there's a really great intro of you in here.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.890
And some interesting pictures. Including surfing
pictures. Which I think is awesome.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.270
So thanks so much for joining us.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.450
&gt;&gt;Josiah: It's a pleasure to be here. Alright.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.410
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Josiah

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.670
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Welcome. Thank you all.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.670
[applause]

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.880
&gt;&gt;Josiah: OK, so, as Tom said I'm from, I
was born and Raised in Santa Monica. They

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.350
said there's no native Californians or LA-ans,
LAngelinos. I am one. I grew up here surfing

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.519
out in Santa Monica. My mom was a chef. Not
a chef like I am per se. But she had a cooking

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.000
school actually in Santa Monica. Where the
Santa Monica Place is. It's a new, old, new

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.280
mall. So she had a cooking school there. It
was called the Southern California School

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.030
of Fine Cuisine. Most of the time she taught,
at that time was mostly rich executives' wives

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.010
how to cook. She had a great palate. A lot
of different interesting cultural foods. So

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.780
I grew up with this amazing food in the house.
The good thing now is if I said at eight years

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.750
old, I knew I wanted to be a chef. But that's
not true. I just wanted to surf. So I would

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.209
peel some carrots here and there. And try
to make little couple bucks so I can go on

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.120
surf trips. But then when I was 17 and I was
you know, time to go to college or wondering

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120
what I'm gonna do.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.469
I decided you know, I wanna be a chef. It's
kinda when Wolfgang Puck was getting known.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:08.630
1986. At that time it wasn't like now obviously.
We didn't have Google. So we couldn't check

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.750
everything out and see. And there wasn't,
this raft of information. So at that time,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.099
its' the beginning of the celebrity chef.
So I went around to five different chefs.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.270
And I asked them "What should I do? Should
I move to France? Should I work? Should I

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.799
go to school?" 'Cause my dad being French,
I have papers to go work in France. And four

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.700
out of the five chefs recommended that I just
start working.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.639
So I got a job at a restaurant that was called,
uh, the first job was at The Wave. Which was

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.599
right down the street here. It just, a new
restaurant just opened there. So it's on Ashton

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.549
and Main. Used to be 20, uh, 2020 or 20, I
don't know, Royal Café. Just turned over.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.609
Found my first job. It lasted for like a month
and a half. And then they were going out of

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.939
business so they let everybody go.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:52.939
[laughter]

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.389
So then I went to the West Beach Café. I
don't know if anybody remembers the West Beach

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.129
Café. It was Bruce Marder. Who had Capo.
He had the Broadway Deli. The Chorus Café

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.780
maybe. You know? So I went to work there for
six months. And you know, I kinda got addicted

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.750
to the chaos of the kitchen. The adrenalin
rush. And I was enjoying it. I had a girlfriend

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.859
who I had been dating in high school. She
wasn't enjoying it. I was working too many

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.330
nights. She dumped me. And from there I decided
to move to France. So I moved to France and

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.330
I lived there three years.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.789
And it was a really a wonderful experience.
Culturally. Learning about cheese. Wine. Food.

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.090
I mean. At that time in America we didn't
have these farmer's markets. We didn't have

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.191
all this available fresh produce. And fresh
seafood. It wasn't the same. It's not, we've

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:49.020
come a long way in the 26 years that I've
been doing this. So I moved to France. And

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.860
just learned all about that. Worked there
for three years. And after three years it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.470
got to the point where it was kind of like
"Well, should I move back to California? Should

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.069
I stay in France?" kind of like, what am I
gonna do? I had to kinda start developing

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.360
my life. I wanted to have a bed and TV. Anyway,
so I moved back to LA

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.199
And I got a job at Shin-La on Main. Then I
came back to work for Wolfgang Puck. And it's

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.729
a great experience. I learned a lot. And I
wanted to, you know, France at that time there

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.310
was no influence of Asian products. It was
all French. And we maybe a hint of ginger.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.039
Besides that they didn't use anything in the
French cuisine. So I really wanted to learn

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.850
about different ingredients from different
parts of the world and how to introduce that

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.770
into French style cuisine. So that was a great
experience at Shin-La on Main.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.420
From there I went on to work at Bettina. So
Bettina is a great restaurant. At that time

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.080
it was, Joaquim only had Bettina. There was
no Pino Bistro or Bettina Group. So it was

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.509
really hands on and he really taught me a
lot about running a business or what it meant.

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.330
So from there I felt like I was ready to go
on my own. Become a chef. So I actually got

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.509
a job with my friend Raphael. And, Capri,
is where we had our first job. Which is now

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.190
that wolf in sheep's clothing. It's kind of
hot right now. So they did, the guys that

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.580
are doing that actually did what we did in
1993. We went in there and kinda took over

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.840
the restaurant. From there we got a job in
Jackson's Restaurant. Which was on Beverly

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.860
Boulevard. Restaurants come and go. It's hard
in LA. These are all, you know. Can't remember

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.729
them all. And then from there Raphael Manetta
from JiRaffe. And myself. We opened JiRaffe

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.990
restaurant. Anybody know JiRaffe restaurant?
So that's why it's a J-i-capital R. It's for

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.099
Josiah and Rafael. OK.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.540
So we grew up surfing together. That's my
best friend since childhood. We're still friends

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.090
today. Our kids are great friends. I'm the
godparent. And he's the godparent to my kids.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.879
So we opened JiRaffe restaurant in 1996. And
we had a lot of success and it did well. And

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:51.550
in 1997 we won the Best New Chef Award from
Food and Wine Magazine. So that was a huge

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.650
accolade. It was all that-- Like I said at
that time the internet wasn't what it is now.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.660
And you couldn't, there was no blogging. And
no one would know you if you didn't get national

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.009
press. So we got the national press. And then
our restaurant became a lot more popular.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.539
From there we were invited to cook on cruises.
To do demonstrations. And so you get your

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.960
name out there. And every time you get to
go away and do those events you learn. 'Cause

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.259
you have 10, 15 chefs coming together from
around the country. And you can learn. Its'

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.979
great. You see other chefs what they're doing.
You see different techniques. Different ideas.

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.410
So it was a really great experience. That
was wonderful.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.680
And then in 1999 I kind of wanted to really
have my dream and have a really fine dining

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.560
restaurant. Because that's what I trained
in France. So I really wanted to, you know,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:43.819
open a fine dining restaurant. So I opened
Melisse restaurant in 1999. And we've done

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.699
really well there. It's been great. I think
Melisse restaurant, for those who've had,

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:54.460
I know a lot of people have been there. And
our goal at Melisse restaurant is to create

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:00.930
an experience. A great experience. A memory.
A souvenir. Of a time in your life. Maybe

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:07.030
a birthday. An anniversary. A promotion. So
that's really our goal. So we really work

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.349
hard. And that begins for us, shopping at
the farmer's market. Procuring the ingredients

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:16.840
that we're gonna use to prepare. Because that's
the first and most important thing. Is if

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.310
we don't have good ingredients, can't make
great food.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.940
So it starts, we have four or five of us go
to the market every Wednesday. The Santa Monica

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.030
Market. And some Saturdays one of us goes.
Not as many on Saturdays. And it's pretty

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.750
much of a treat when you go see us there.
We really scour through everything. I mean,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.120
we are basically hand picking each ingredient
for our diners. Each ingredient is handpicked

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.390
to create that experience. And that's where
the experience starts for me. Is every morning

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.060
in the kitchen to create it.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.490
Moving all the way to the front of the house
.and the front of the house its' really about

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.621
creating the experience of kings and queens.
Alright? So when people come in we want them

00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:55.820
to feel like kings and queens. And every once
in a while we get a letter, where people say

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.820
"We felt like kings and queens." And that's
like, you know, then we know we're really

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.270
doing our job well. Alright. So that's really
our goal.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:09.780
So that being said, today I would, gonna demonstrate
a simple mushroom soup. Mushroom soup with

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.410
a truffle mousse and a little hash. I always
like to add something to a dish to kinda give

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.540
it another dimension. A textural dimension.
But before that we're gonna taste a little

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.440
molecular gastronomy. 'Cause I know that's
pretty hot. So I think they're ready. They

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440
can bring in the spoons.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.290
So the first thing we're gonna do is something
we serve as hors d'oeuvres at Melisse. Which

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.520
was inspired by Ferran Adria. Well it was
actually inspired, the flavors we use, the

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.260
technique was inspired by Ferran Adria. The
flavors we use. The grape wrapped in the goat

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.021
cheese and the pistachio was inspired by when
I was in France I didn't get paid. So after

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:49.130
work I would go work for a caterer. And I
would roll these goat cheese, just huge amounts

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:57.670
of catering. A lot of weddings. Jewish weddings.
So I would roll grapes with goat cheese and

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:03.440
pistachio. So that became an hors d'oeuvre
at Melisse. Before molecular gastronomy. Then

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.420
I said well, I wanna use these same flavors
but I wanna make a modern presentation. So

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:17.480
this came up here. Where we have a sphere
of grape juice and inside of it is a goat

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:25.621
cheese and it is then macerated in pistachio.
And then we sprinkle a pistachio on top. Fleur

00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.889
de sel and cracked pepper. Fleur de sel is
a flour of the salt. The best salt available.

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:34.130
One of the best salts available. But what
I think is the best salt. There's a lot of

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.350
great salts out there.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.110
So this is made with, we, this is made by
using alginate. Which is a kelp product. Its'

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:48.750
been modified. And calcium gluco. Gluco. Which
is a calcium lactate and a calcium glucinate.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:54.160
So what happens is this is a reverse spherification.
There's two kinds. Right. One is a sodium

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:02.660
chloride solution that you put the alginate
mixed with the ingredient inside of it. Inside

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:08.340
the solution. And then there's the reverse
where you put the alginate as a solution of

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:15.290
water bath. And then you put the gluco inside
of it. So seems easy but different flavors

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:21.019
and different amounts of pH. It changes everything.
So you have to go through it and find it.

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:25.930
Most of that work is being created by scientists.
Most chefs are really not in there doing that.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.861
We have dinner to do. So luckily we have a
lot of help from food scientists. Which, when

00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:32.870
I was growing up I never would have thought
that I ever would rely on a food scientist

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.889
for anything. Because it's kinda everything
opposite for what you learn in the back in

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:40.459
the old classical style of French cooking.
So we're gonna pass these out and then I'm

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.861
gonna start getting, preparing on the mushroom
soup.

00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:43.861
[calm strings music plays]

00:11:43.861 --> 00:12:01.920
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Alright, so for the soup that we're
gonna do, we're gonna use some mushrooms.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:16.839
We just have some white mushrooms here. And
then we have some dried porcini mushrooms

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:17.839
here.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:18.839
[dishes clink]

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:25.780
We have some onions. Leeks. A little garlic.
So the garlic here, we take the germ out of

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.850
it. So with all garlic we always take that
little germ that goes down the middle out.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.220
That's really the part that kinda, when you,
after you have a lot of garlic and you start

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.910
getting indigestion. That's the part, if you
remove that it really helps. It's the bitter

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.910
part. OK?

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.910
Remove the germ.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.910
[dishes clank]

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:47.040
Some onions. We have some celery root. And
we have some apple. I find that mushroom is

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.269
set off nicely by the celery root and the
apple. That really strainy root vegetable

00:12:52.269 --> 00:13:00.529
with the acidic of the green apple. And we
have some good old cream, chicken stock, mushroom

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:04.959
stock. And some bay leaf and thyme. Some chestnuts.
OK?

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:10.420
So when you start, whenever you start you
wanna a start off by, I mean, the idea is

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.940
we're trying to coax flavors out of these
ingredients. We wanna find a way to make these

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:21.250
taste like the most amazing onions, leeks,
celery, all together in one. So we wanna coax

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.139
the flavors out. So to do that, we need to
turn the heat up a little bit.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:32.700
We're gonna sweat the onions. And the garlic.
Inside of a little butter. You know, everything

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.670
is quality. So the best butter you can find.
I think clover butter is a great butter available

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.600
at Whole Foods. We have all the imported French
butters. Most of those have been frozen. So

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.529
doesn't mean it's' not as good. But some of
it doesn't. OK.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:47.529
There we go.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:48.529
[pause]

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:49.529
[spoon clanks in pot]

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:50.529
[strings music continues]

00:13:50.529 --> 00:14:12.360
&gt;&gt;Josiah: So when we're sweating it off, you
wanna add the butter and you wanna sweat it

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.079
off slowly. By the way I'm cooking on an induction
burner. So this is the magnetic heat transfer.

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:19.850
They're great. I mean they've not really caught
on that much in restaurants or in homes. But

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.250
it's not like usual electric. So everybody
says electric's bad. But it's boiling now.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.970
I can just turn it down and instantly the
heat stops.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.970
[vegetables sizzling]

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:26.970
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #1: Do you use those
in the restaurant?

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:33.730
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yeah. We have two induction burners
in the restaurant. And the next time I remodel,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.600
I wanna do my whole kitchen more induction.
If I ever get to that stage. I got two kids

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600
to send to college, but.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600
[laughter]

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
But I'd like to do the induction burners.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600
[sizzling and clanking]

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.120
OK. So here we're gonna sweat this off. Now,
to bring out the flavor, the most important

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.610
ingredient is salt. Right. And I think it's,
how do we use salt can really determine how

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:59.670
you, how much you use. So by putting a little
salt in here at the beginning to bring out

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.260
the flavor.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.790
[sizzling]

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:08.670
This is the sel gris. Sel gris is, it's a
French salt. A sea salt. And it's what we

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:14.290
use in all of our seasoning for everything.
Our basic seasoning. We don't use kosher salt.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:20.630
We use sel gris. Used to be, used to come
in, it's really wet salt. Ok. And so we used

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.440
to get it in and we had to dry it out. And
we had to grind it in a mortar. Now more people

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.399
started using it so they come in this form
which is ready to go. I don't know. It used

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:33.879
to be like dry it out, grind it up. It's a
lot of work. Our Robot Coupe never had a blade.

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:34.879
[sizzling]

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:39.120
Ok. And so here we're just gonna sweat this
off. We put a little salt in. and then we're

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.290
gonna add the leeks. And a little salt also.
Every time we put an ingredient to cook, we're

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:50.230
gonna add a pinch of salt. And we wanna sweat
that out until it's soft and translucent.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.459
It's about five to seven minutes. OK.

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:55.459
[clanking]

00:15:55.459 --> 00:16:01.470
So always mixing it. Really, you know, bringing
out the flavors. Slowly cooking it. And then

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.620
we're gonna add a little bit of celery root.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.480
[clanking and sizzling]

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:16.019
At that point too we're gonna put a pinch.
Now when you're using salt like this. It's

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:19.950
just a little bit each time. You don't wanna
over salt it. And if you're gonna reduce something

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.560
you can't do that. Another time you can't
add salt in the beginning is when you wanna

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.300
make something brown and crispy. Alright,
'cause it's gonna leach out the water. So

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.819
basically we're taking out the water. And
so now we're gonna simmer it inside of its

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:32.920
own juices. OK.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920
[sizzling]

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.460
Then we're gonna add the apples.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.490
[sizzling]

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.520
[inaudible]

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.540
[sizzling]

00:16:49.540 --> 00:17:01.629
OK. And once this is nicely cooked down.

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.779
[pause]

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:09.240
OK. Then we have the mushrooms. So when we
put the mushrooms in, we're gonna turn the

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.770
heat up. OK. These mushrooms are gonna leech
a lot of water out. OK, so we have to turn

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:21.070
it up so we can reduce down and concentrate
the flavor. So add the mushrooms.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.870
[clanking]

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.670
[sizzling]

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:37.860
Turn it up some.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.840
And now and again we're gonna add a pinch
of salt.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.460
So it's' pretty interesting right? The grape
the way it. So what hap—it cooks the outside,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.690
OK. So the alginate and the gluco they have
the chemical reaction. It starts cooking it.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:58.130
So the alginate's cooking the lactate inside
of it. So it keeps cooking. So if you leave

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.420
'em overnight in the solution. It's gonna
be like a ball you can bounce on the ground.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.420
[audience chuckles]

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.420
[sizzling]

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:09.520
But we leave it in about probably about a
minute. Minute and a half. Two minutes.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520
[mutters]

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.390
So we're gonna cook this and we're gonna let
this cook down. OK. And then another part

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.840
of this dish we're gonna have is we're gonna
have a mushroom and potato hash. So while

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.390
that's cooking I'll go through this.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:27.210
So basically what we have is we have, we like
to use Yukon potatoes, right? Great Yukon

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.940
potato. Its' a big one. So we cut this into
a dice. Again. And we're gonna put this in

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.909
water. So one quart of water to one tablespoon
of salt. That's the ration we always use at

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.760
the restaurant. We're gonna put it in cold
water. So whenever you cook potatoes you wanna

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.750
start 'em in cold water. OK. And the salt
already inside. We're gonna bring it to a

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:51.330
boil slowly. But not all the way to a boil.
Never wanna boil potatoes. So contrary to

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.260
what everybody thinks, like when we make mashed
potatoes, we don't boil the potatoes. Right?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.560
'Cause we don't want the sugar and the starches
to get activated and they get that gummy flavor.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:09.210
And they lose that flavor. It starts to, it
starts to change the sugars in it. OK? So

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.220
we wanna cook it until it is cooked through
though. And we're gonna take 'em out. Strain

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.940
'em out of water. And then we're gonna dry
it really well. You have to dry it really

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.070
really well. Then we're gonna take some of
these white mushrooms. So if you're gonna

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.409
make this, find, well if you find some porcini
mushrooms, that's the best. When they're available.

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:30.360
Then you're gonna take these. And you wanna
find the biggest ones you can. 'Cause these

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.110
we're gonna. The white mushroom we're gonna
remove the, um

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.450
[pause]

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:47.610
We're gonna dice 'em. So it's a lot easier
the bigger they are. Then we're gonna cut

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:53.000
'em in nice little dices. Now, whenever you
cut the mushroom, bigger than the potato.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.900
Because the mushroom is gonna shrink more
than the potato did. So we can end up with

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.960
a nice size hash like this. I don't know if
any, you all see, all be able to see. I don't

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.750
know if you can see that. OK.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:10.750
OK. So then we just cut 'em in a nice dice.
Little bit bigger than the potato would be.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:16.090
And the mushroom you kinda gotta work fast.
'Cause they will start to oxidize. Once they've

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.070
been cut. So you gotta kinda go fast once
you do this. So this would be something you

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:25.430
do at the last minute. OK.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.350
[pause]

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:33.270
So we have our, we have our mushroom hash.
Mushroom and potato hash. So we have our soup

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.570
which is cooking. And then we're gonna make
the little. In the recipe there's a really

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.990
complicated way to make the truffle mousse.
But I'm gonna show just a quicker way we can

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.340
do this right now.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.020
So we're just gonna take some crème fraiche
as a whipping cream. We're gonna whip it up.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.470
We're gonna grate, grate a little fleur de
sel. A little salt inside. We're gonna grate

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.860
a little black truffle. Fresh black truffle
season right now.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.860
[pause]

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.559
This is a black diamond.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.799
[audience chuckles]

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:09.400
You see now, it's been a hard year because
it's been so cold in Europe. So it's freezing

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.980
so it's gonna end really early.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:19.179
They're much, anybody can make it more expensive
they always do anyway, so.

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:21.490
[laughter]

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.809
Hmm.

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:26.140
[clanking]

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.140
So we're just gonna take the

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.929
[clanking]

00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:34.330
A little bit of crème fraiche. A little bit
of heavy whipping cream. So we use Kendall

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:42.500
Farm crème fraiche at the restaurant. And
we also use Clover Cream from. And unfortunately

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.250
I'm kinda trying, I'm kinda thinking about
petitioning Alta Dena maybe to start more

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.260
of a--couple chefs we're gonna try to get
together. Maybe they'll start more of a artisanal

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.090
side for their milk. There are some locals
we have here. One of 'em. I don't know how

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.700
long people were in LA. There used to be a
creamery right here on, uh, Edgemar. The Edgemar

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.240
building? You know where the Edgemar building
is? The Ben and Jerry's. That was Edgemar

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.440
Dairy. So that used to be, they used to bottle
milk. It's crazy right? It used to be the

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.450
milkman right? Imagine years ago the milkman
would go to every house and drop the milk

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.150
off. That was coming from local places. And
kinda cool. So hopefully Alta Dena might start

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.150
doing something like that.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.150
[clanking]

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.150
OK. So. We're gonna whip the, whip it up like
you would to make

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.150
[clanking]

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.150
[mutters]

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:39.540
OK. So while this is cooking now we're gonna
add the chicken stock. No, sorry we're gonna

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.970
add the chestnuts. Chestnuts, now, chestnuts
you can find. Right now it's not the season

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:50.480
so frozen chestnuts. They're really good.
And then if you have fresh chestnuts it's

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.510
great. You have to kinda slit them down the
middle. In the book there's a description.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.762
And you roast them in the oven at like 375
degrees so that the skin loosens up and you

00:22:58.762 --> 00:22:59.762
can peel 'em off. OK?

00:22:59.762 --> 00:23:02.590
Uh, I that bag. I need a spoon to do the crenel
and few other things.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:09.740
Alright, so we're gonna add the chicken stock.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.110
And the mushroom stock.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:19.140
Now if you don't have mushroom stock it's
not necessary to have it.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.970
&gt;&gt;Male #1: How do you make it?

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.610
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Uh, you make it, you just take mushrooms.
White mushrooms. The easiest way to make it

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.900
would be to fill a pot with some white mushrooms.
And if there's wild ones available. Throw

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:32.029
a few there. Don't cover all of it with water.
Cover it ¾ of the way with water. Sprinkle

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:41.510
with salt. And then a bay leaf. And thyme?
OK? And then from there you would bring it

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.390
to a boil. Let it to a simmer. And let it
cook until, just 45 minutes until all the

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.720
liquid comes out. There should be more liquid
than you started with, from the mushrooms.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.720
Then you strain it out and then taste it.
If it's not strong enough reduce it slowly

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720
by half. Again in the beginning you put a
little salt. Not a lot. 'cause you're gonna

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.500
reduce it after. Mushroom stock. Great stocks.
Always make a lot more than you think. Throw

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.500
'em in the freezer. Never underestimate. If
you're gonna make stocks and you wanna cook,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:12.030
make your own stocks. Make the stocks. Take
a day. Make the stocks. You know. Cool 'em

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.250
down. And then freeze 'em.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:20.050
Great. To have 'em. And they're better than
these store bought stocks they have. OK?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.520
OK. So we're gonna bring this to a boil. Let
that simmer for a while. OK? Then we're gonna

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.180
add the cream inside. Then we're gonna simmer
that for a little while. Simmer it. We don't

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.679
wanna boil it too hard. Always bring it to
a boil. Simmer it. We're gonna simmer it.

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:38.309
And then, it's a real taste, I think it's
good taste. 'Cause cooking is, I mean it's

00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:43.100
evasive. It runs away. Sometimes it tastes
amazing, and you go "Wow it's good." And then

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.110
15 minutes later it doesn't taste the same
anymore. So you really wanna catch it at that

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:51.409
right moment. So taste as you go. Little tastes
as you go. You really wanna catch it. It's

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:56.140
important. I try to teach all the young cooks.
You wanna capture that one moment when its'

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.140
perfect.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.140
[clanking]

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:07.080
We're gonna whip this up. I don't do this
anymore. So you know. Takes longer.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.059
[laughter]

00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:11.039
[clanking]

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:27.850
Raw milk. And making curds and whey. So we're
separating it out. The Farmer's market, they

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.919
have one. Right now it's the big thing. It's
not. Pretty much raw milk is done, right?

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:39.730
I mean, the FDA is raiding Amish communities
right now. It's, and they've been doing this

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.770
for hundreds of years. They're raiding. They
arrest them. It's pretty sad. Sad, sad state

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.770
to be in.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.770
[whisk clacking against bowl]

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.770
About the raw milk. You know, it's

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.770
[whisk sound]

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.360
So but anyway, you separate the curds and
whey, then obviously I'm sure a lot of you,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:26:00.370
you've heard of like Noma. These restaurants
that are kinda getting popular, in the, so,

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.160
here you don't have to worry about this stuff.
But it's fun to play with it. We have the

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.710
vegetables all year. So we've been playing
with fermentation and aging vegetables. And

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.190
seeing what happens when you try to preserve
'em. It's kinda fun to do it when, one of

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.409
the most amazing flavors is when you make
like sauerkraut but you use like whey. The

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:24.220
amount of whey to 12 percent salt. It's amazing
the smell, the flavor. It's great. We've been

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:29.150
doing like kohlrabi and salsify, with kale.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.980
[whisk sound]

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:39.840
OK. So you just wanna whip this like this
'til it's, you don't wanna, we don't wanna

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.809
turn it into butter. But we just wanna whip
it.

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:45.970
[whisk sound]

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.620
We have nice soft peaks.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.789
[whisk sound]

00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:58.580
Soft peaks are like this. Just to form a nice,
you know. OK.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.920
[whisk sound]

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:10.330
Now one thing you, you texturally want, we're
gonna grate a little truffle in here. Microplane

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:15.220
works great for the truffle. So.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.360
[grating sound]

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.440
[tapping]

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.070
OK. And then.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.070
[clanging]

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.289
Once you've whipped it up to where you don't
wanna whisk any more, just gonna put a little

00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:35.250
salt. Then we're just gonna fold it together
to create the, to get the texture we want.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.960
There we go.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.240
[clanging]
You wanna fold it in. Just like making a mousse.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240
[clanging]

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.230
OK. We're gonna have this here.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:54.559
So, our soup is done here. It was done. We've
put everything in. basically. The cream goes

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:57.460
in, we cook it, OK. And then at the end we're
gonna turn it off and we're gonna infuse the

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.510
mushrooms in. OK. So we're gonna put the mushrooms
in at the end. We don't wanna cook those mushrooms.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:07.210
They get a little bitter. So we're just gonna
put it in, stop it, and let it infuse inside.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.169
OK?

00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:12.029
There's also bay leaf and thyme that actually
goes in here when you add the stock. I left

00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:13.440
that out. Excuse me.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.679
Alright. So now we've got our, our beautiful
soup. It's done. Right. It's ready. The magic

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:20.070
of two bots and TV. Everything happens like
that.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.070
[laughter]

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:26.669
Um, so then we're gonna put it in the blender.
So. The blender is one of my favorite favorite

00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:35.530
favorite kitchen utensils. Because well, I
guess it makes, these vitamixes make such

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:40.919
fine purees. And we use so many purees at
the restaurant. Our food is based on really

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.980
taking an ingredient and playing with it in
a lot of different ways. I'll explain one

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.470
of the dishes at the end. So the blenders
really help with that. Back in the old days

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:52.789
we used to have to do it where I had to, you
know we had to put it through the Robot Coup.

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:57.399
Or went straight to the tamis. You know the
tamis. Hours. Before they had these powerful

00:28:57.399 --> 00:29:01.730
blenders. The tamis. You take for hours. Right.
And you get strong arms. But whoo. Difficult.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.390
OK so we're gonna turn the blender on. And
whenever you use a blender, you wanna start

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.450
by, on a low. Very very low. So you wanna
turn it on and slowly turn it on. 'Cause food

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.450
[inaudible] then you know I'll turn the blender
on. Have to clean the ceiling trick. So we're

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:19.640
just gonna turn it up. So it's loud.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.010
[blender whirring]

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:38.090
And we're gonna blend it, you know, 'til it's
pretty smooth and creamy. Ok, this is a little

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.460
thick. So I'm gonna take, steal a little of
this. So but if it's ever too thick. You just

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.649
add a little bit. Even I can't do it right
every time. So. You know, cooking is always

00:29:46.649 --> 00:29:57.429
details. Little extras here and there.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:26.760
[blender whirring loudly]

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:38.519
OK. So now at this point, there's two ways
you can do this. You can run it through a

00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:42.330
chinois raw into another pot. OK. We're gonna
add some butter while it's blending to get

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.330
it nice and saucy.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.330
[blender whirring loudly]

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.800
At this point we're gonna turn it really high
so it gets like really bubbly and light.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.800
[blender whirs louder]

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800
So, this is nice and light. And it. At this
point we have a beautiful soup. Do you have

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.100
the hand mixer? Can I use it? Or? After you
do that. Fine. But.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:57.159
Smells amazing and 
it tastes good. Smells amazing and, um.

00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.159
Beautiful

00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:59.159
Alright, good.

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:02.120
OK, so at this point we're gonna strain it.
Into another pot. Because, or into a tureen.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.090
A soup tureen or a fancy pot. So I like to
prevent the seeds and do it all tableside.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:16.299
So at this point we put this in. Let me just
put this back on. Here. And now we have our

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:21.010
beautiful soup. So. We use a hand mixer. You
don't have to. So at this point you can go

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.480
right into the pot. And then.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.480
[clanking]

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.170
We have our, how's that soup taste.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.570
&gt;&gt;Audience members: It's really good. It's
real good.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.779
&gt;&gt;Josiah: So just one quick note. I'm pureeing
and doing hot purees. So if you're gonna make

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:38.389
this soup—thank you—if you're gonna make
this soup and you're not gonna serve it that

00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:42.260
day. Or you're gonna serve it, you're gonna
cool it down first, it's important you just

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.320
can't put it in the fridge. Alright? Whenever
you cool something down, say you're making

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.140
soup. And you wanna make a lentil soup. Or
for the week, say you make a stew for the

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.300
week. I don't know, something. You need to
take a big bowl of ice. Stainless steel bowl

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.620
of ice. And then put another bowl on top of
that. Put a bowl beside it. And you wanna

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.470
transfer what you're gonna cool down into
that. Put it on top of the ice and then slowly

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.770
mix it. So you cool it quickly.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:09.380
Flavor wise, like I said, things disappear
quickly. You wanna do that for that. Once

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.090
we're done, we hit that spot we want to be
at, you wanna try to keep it in that area

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.470
so when we heat it back up. Another reason
is health reasons. Bacteria forms. When you

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:23.799
put it in the fridge it cools way too slow.
Especially in plastic. So just a little side

00:32:23.799 --> 00:32:30.010
note. Cooling things. It's called a ice bath.
You call it a water bath.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:35.190
OK. Alright. So now we have our mix, right?
We're just gonna finish sautéing it up.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.190
[sizzling]

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:43.909
Just do this. It gives a nice smell. It tastes
pretty amazing right? The hash, and--OK

00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:47.600
[dishes clanking]

00:32:47.600 --> 00:33:04.679
Sauté this up. OK. There's about, I think
the texture between the hash and the mousse

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:10.480
and the soup. For everything we do today we
try to give it a little bit you know, different,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:17.100
extra added texture. Flavor. To take the level
to make it the complexity more. So this you

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.929
just sauté them up, the mushrooms. Simple.
Reheat it. Or we'd start from the mashed potatoes

00:33:21.929 --> 00:33:24.899
and the mushrooms where you sauté it and
get the mushrooms golden. Add the potatoes

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:28.370
and sauté it 'til they're nice and golden.
And then we season this at the end. This is

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.029
one of those things you wanna season at the
end. Because we're trying to keep it crispy.

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:39.442
I'm gonna put a little thyme branch in there.
Thyme. You can add, you know, this is, cooking

00:33:39.442 --> 00:33:43.630
is one of those things. Feel free to add.
In this book, just 'cause the recipes are

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.820
written out doesn't mean you have to follow
those. Follow the techniques. Follow the ideas.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.663
But it's up to every individual to kinda play
with it and have fun. I hear some of you,

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:56.180
"I can't make that in the restaurant. Too
many ingredients." Well, cherry pick. Make

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:02.850
the vinaigrette. Make the sauce. Make the
puree. This is a book, 'cause if I did a book

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:03.850
where everything is simple everything's simple
everyone would say "Well why is it so simple?

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.457
At your restaurant you don’t cook like that."
So it's kind of like a catch 22.

00:34:06.457 --> 00:34:11.150
OK, so we've sautéed these up nicely.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.980
&gt;&gt;Audience member: [inaudible]

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:20.910
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Or we could just come cook for Melisse.
That's true. Now we're just gonna kinda form

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:22.920
a nice mold here.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.120
[pause]

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.720
Decorate this out.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.920
[pause]

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.310
[dish clanking]

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:47.490
Smells nice. Everything, you know smell is
so important to cooking, right?

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.920
OK.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.350
[pause]

00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:01.110
OK. So this is important. So this is the part
I love, where you hit--These do very great,

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.710
Bamix, Cuisinart ones

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.830
[hand mixer whirrs loudly]

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:11.740
[inaudible] but they're hitting it outside
there, they're hitting it every time. They're

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.400
really get it light, airy.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.460
OK, so.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:22.810
You can see how bubbly it is and beautiful.
So at the restaurant we finish it. We put

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:28.060
the crenelle on like this. On top of the potatoes.
We do a crenel. This is a technique in French

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.970
cooking called crenel. Right. Looks easy right?

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.970
[laughter]

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:31.970
It's not. Trust me.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.970
[laughter]

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:40.520
Most of the time, the big thing in the restaurant,
Melisse, we do a lot of crenelles. So all

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.040
the cooks that come in, they start cooking
there. It's like, OK. You have to learn how

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.501
to do crenelles. Or we can't afford them to
do truffle mousse crenelle practice all day.

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:54.880
The trick is, get some Crisco. Go home after
work, sit in front of the TV. And do some

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.790
crenelles. Did Ronnie ever do that?

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.790
[laughter]

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.260
See? Proof, that really happens.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.050
Huh? Cool whip. There you go. Cool whip. Crisco.
It's the truth. It really happens.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:09.980
OK. And then we take that little bit of garnish
here. So. I like to. Oops. Here we go. Garnish.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.440
Little churvo on top. So, they use these tools.
These are actually forceps. Actually cotton

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.230
tweezers. My best friend's a dentist. So I
go buy his office and I steal the cotton tweezers.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.230
[laughter]

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.530
Two things that I steal from him actually
at the restaurant. One, as we all know is

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:30.360
the syringe, right. 'Cause we have the chocolate-chocolate-chocolate.
So I take the syringes from him, and the forceps.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.670
Call them cotton tweezers.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:37.200
OK. There we go. So now, at home if you're
cooking this, and you're doing this dish and

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.100
whatever. Any dish. Any soup. And it needs
[ ]. So you put it at the table in front of

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:47.950
the guest. And then we come around here. And
then we'd just pour it around. It comes out

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.100
so nice and bubbly and airy. And that's the
hand blender just at the end. Or you can do

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.970
it in the blender also. You don't have to
have the hand blender. You can just run it

00:36:54.970 --> 00:37:00.410
in a blender for a while. Everybody can see
this. And then.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.360
There's our mushroom soup with truffle mousse
and hash. Chestnut mushroom soup. Everybody

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360
can see this here.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360
[audience comments and laughs]

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:11.880
You can pass it around, that's fine.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.280
[laughter]

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:19.620
OK. So as I was saying, at the restaurant
we like to do a lot of dishes based on purees

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.130
and I'll talk about one dish we do right now.
It's called, I like to say it's broccoli and

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:29.120
beef. Ok. So we take the broccoli. And we
try to find a longer broccoli with the long

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.310
stems. We take that off, we peel it, and then
we braise it off so it really gets sweet.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.020
Has a crunch to it. But really the best part
of the broccoli is the part that usually ends

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.200
up in the trash. OK. It's true. Alright. And
so we take that. We roast that off. Just braise

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.310
it and roast it. And we take the broccoli
crown and in the summer we make a pesto out

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:52.110
of it. So we're always trying to find, what
can we do a little different using the ingredients.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:59.110
So we make a pesto. But instead of using parmesan
cheese we use aged Gruyere cheese. Or Cantal.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:05.330
Great flavor. So we put that conte. We put
that in the pesto. With pine nuts. And a little

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:09.140
bit of garlic. And all the garlic we use we
remove the germ. And a lot of it we triple

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.430
blanch. That means we put it in cold water.
We bring it to a boil. Once. Chill it. And

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:19.380
then do that two more times. So three times
you do that process. It talks about it in

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.790
the book also.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:26.630
It's pretty cool. Uh, so, then we have the
broccoli, roasted broccoli stem. We have the

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:31.280
broccoli pesto. And a few other pieces of
broccoli. Pan roast them with a little bit

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.171
of lemon zest and some of the same cheese.
So kind of like cheese and broccoli. That's

00:38:36.171 --> 00:38:40.560
the plan, right. The cheese and broccoli.
American classic steakhouse. So we have our,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.110
there, and then the last part we take the
leaves of the broccoli. We deep fry it. So

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:50.660
we have the three, the four parts of the broccoli.
In different forms. It's wonderful flavor.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.250
It's interesting. I think it's intellectual
in a way. On the plate. And then we have the

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.550
beef. We have the rib eye that we roast. And
then we slowly finish it on, we kind of mark

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:05.250
it on the hibachi grill. And then we have
the cheek that we braise for 24 hours to,

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:10.020
the Wagyu beef cheek that we've braised for
24 hours in red wine. So we have two different

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.460
kinds of beef and four different kinds of
broccoli. And that's what I think is what

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:19.100
about food is playing with it. Then how do
we, I'm not really super molecular, at Melisse.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.830
I'd say we're modern cuisine. But we're not
molecular. OK? We do things like the glutinate

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:29.800
and things like that. So. That's kinda. The
idea behind the food that we try to create

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800
at Melisse.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.420
So I'm gonna try to do some Q and A right
now. So, anybody, I think we have some microphones.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:39.090
And questions. Anything you wanna ask about.
Like surfing. Where are you gonna surf tomorrow

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:42.090
morning? Is the wind gonna be the right way?

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.090
Yes.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.210
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: I wanna know
more about what you cook at home. What you

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:50.400
cook for the kids. And sorta, things like
this broccoli cheese pesto. I'm like, oh,

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.990
my daughter would love that. What else can
you suggest?

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:57.850
&gt;&gt;Josiah: OK, for my kids you know, well,
the difficulty with kids is, one likes one

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.110
thing, one doesn't like something. So. But
a lot of times at home I like to do like things

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:07.900
like, chop chae. I make it good, I get some
of the sweet potato noodles and do something

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.090
with chop chae. Every Monday I usually cook
at home on Monday nights. I like to do rotisserie

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:16.700
chickens. I have the Ronco rotisserie. It's
great. I mean, you know, how you brine the

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.180
chicken. I mean, when I, we let it sit in
the fridge and then I throw it on the rotisserie.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.210
Throw the potatoes under it. So they're really
good for days when you have things to do with

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.860
the kids and you've gotta go out. You put
it on an hour, come back, your dinner's ready.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.720
And you can put some, you know, mixed carrots
and everything underneath it. And the drips,

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:40.240
and it cooks inside there. Other things I
do, like the other night I just did tacos.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.450
I mean, made some tacos, my kids like that.
I just got buffalo meat instead. And then

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:50.090
I used, there was some great at Whole Foods,
I actually go shopping for my food. Because

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:55.270
I don't wanna go on my day off to the restaurant.
So then I used cabbage. Slice cabbage inside.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:00.710
Made a pico de gallo. You know, I might make
little different things. Different ideas.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:08.470
Um, soups. We do a lot of soups. I like to
make like minestrone where I'll make a sweet,

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:13.860
squash broth. And then put diced squashes
in it. And some pastas. And you know, different

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:19.961
beans. Kinda make a different version of minestrone.
What else do I cook for my kids. I mean, always

00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:25.450
they like the grilled meat. So like grilled
meat. Or they like the, you know they have,

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:30.180
my wife she makes a lot of times at home for
the kids. She gets the, there's actually the

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.910
Kalbi meat. Frozen at Trader Joes. And the
kids love it. So it's easy. I mean, you know.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.840
It's just that I try to add something like
the broccoli or sweet, we always try to add

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.181
something healthy. Whether it's a vegetable
or whatever you do. You know you make the

00:41:43.181 --> 00:41:47.910
stuff you know. Good thing at home. I mean
it's not healthy but you take some grated

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:53.510
parmesan cheese. And some butter and some
lemon zest and some parsley and you mix it

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:59.280
in the, with some bacon inside. You put some
sautéed bacon and you mix it and you roll

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.960
it into logs. In the cuisinart. Throw it in
the freezer. And you wanna make cabonari.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.430
Or cabonara. Put some egg in there too. And
then you mix it. Roll it into like logs. And

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.530
you need a fast meal for the kids. Boom. You
have your carbonara. Slice it up, throw it

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:17.140
in the pan, it's done. Right. Anyway. I mean,
where else do we cook at home?

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.140
[laughter]

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.140
Huh?

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.140
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: [inaudible]

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.700
&gt;&gt;Josiah: That's not healthy. This is for
healthy.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.700
[laughter]

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.850
But it's delicious alright?

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:28.850
[laughter]

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:34.030
You know, I mean it's hard, because we have
this, we have this, I'm never home at night.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.090
So my wife is always. And she's not really
a cook. So we have this discussion when she's

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.990
ordering takeout too much. So I gotta go home.
Maybe I'll make enchiladas on Monday and I

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.340
gotta freeze 'em so she can heat 'em up later
in the week. So pick your day to cook, I think.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.040
And then prepare things and then freeze it.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.130
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So you do order
takeout.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.002
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Oh, believe me. They had five days
this week.

00:42:53.002 --> 00:42:54.002
[laughter]

00:42:54.002 --> 00:42:58.830
We had a big discussion last night about that.
Too much takeout!

00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:59.830
[laughter]

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.850
Yeah. That's--but it's, I mean it's hard.
Kids are hard. Because one likes one thing

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.380
and the other doesn't. that's the problem.
My son eats anything. My daughter eats pasta.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:13.750
Even if we order racabania. Last night they
were at racabania. Just you know modest. I

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:17.860
haven't' been to racabania since I was, I
mean it's kind of like a ritual. 'Cause I

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.100
went there when I was eight years old. So
we were there last night. And my daughter

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.080
she only eats the rice and beans. And I said
"you can just make that." And my son eats

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.570
the chicken, not the tortilla part. I was
like, what's the point of ordering here?

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:31.570
[laughter]

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.780
Any other questions?

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:37.760
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Do you still own
JiRaffe?

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:44.460
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yeah. I don't own JiRaffe. Um. But
I'm still friends with him. And we do own

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.710
a restaurant together. It's called Lemon Moon.
Which is on Olympic and Bundy. And the Lemon

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:55.860
Moon name is actually 'cause it's our my last
name is Citrin and his last name is Lunetta.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.720
So it's lemon and moon. And that's how we
got the name. and now it's popular, Lemon

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.970
Moon, 'cause [ ] has been there. It's like
the last couple nights. So.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:02.970
Yes.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:09.130
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: So I've heard
stories about how it's really cutthroat competition

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:14.670
in the chef world. And you sort of made this
sound like it was really easy. So. [laughs]

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:15.670
&gt;&gt;Josiah: No.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.520
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: A little more.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.320
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Alright. It is very cutthroat. It's
hard. And it's, yes, that's a great question.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.210
It's cutthroat in the chef world. But it's,
every business is cutthroat. Everywhere you

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:34.650
look it's cutthroat. It's very competitive.
It's hard. It's grueling work. And you get

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.850
some, I mean a lot of it's luck. I mean it's
different now. I mean, people that can't cook,

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.930
they go on a TV show, the personality works,
they win the TV show. Then they're a famous

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:48.690
chef. It happens all the time. You're gonna
see in 10 years we're gonna pay for all this

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.240
craziness in the TV, when you have no good
chefs anymore because all people wanna do

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.860
is become a TV chef. So many kids come out
of school and their attitude is "Aw, I'll

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.440
get famous." But you have to learn to cook
first. But it's cutthroat. It was hard. I

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.100
mean we were competitive in the kitchens.
I mean, you're always fighting to get the

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:11.290
next position. I mean you wanna be the better
one. It's very competitive. I try to have

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.060
a different atmosphere at Melisse. And it's
not so competitive. But competitive people

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.370
succeed in life. That's the thing. And unfortunately
it works that way. Always push yourself to

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.960
be better. I mean, that's how I look at competitiveness.
So. I'm very competitive. I don't like being

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.360
number two so there you go.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.120
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: I want to ask
two.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.120
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yes.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:33.860
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: The first one
is, do you in your kitchen do you tend to

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:39.860
like people come out of, straight out of culinary
school? Or do you prefer people who just maybe

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.710
have worked at different restaurants and paid
their dues, so to speak.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:50.860
&gt;&gt;Josiah: OK. So culinary school or working?
Well, my, I prefer the working. Not the culinary

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:59.880
school. Not if you just take away two equal
cooks, two equal work ethics, but school.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.900
One is carrying a huge debt. OK? So what you
get paid in the kitchen is not much. So most

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:13.730
times you hire someone, that needs to pay
back that debt once those, it comes due, they

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:20.970
have to start making the payments. Then a
lot of great cooks end up in a hotel. In banquet

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.460
cooking. Could become a great chef. They end
up in banquet chef. Because they need the

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:32.481
money to pay it back. And then, becoming a
chef it's a, a marathon. It's not a race.

00:46:32.481 --> 00:46:35.370
So you hit the pinnacle they're making 40
thousand dollars and they're done. And they're

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:39.510
in a banquet kitchen and that's it. And then
it's all about how much money are you gonna

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.640
produce. You have to, we want a 19 percent
food cost. You know. So I think that that's

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.460
why. So I've had a great success. That's Ronnie.
Everybody knows Ronnie here? So Ronnie came

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.490
to dinner one night.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:59.210
If you don't know the story. Ronnie. She came
to dinner one night. Had dinner. Liked it.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:04.560
Came in the kitchen. Talked to the chef. Said
OK, and I guess emailed a couple times, didn't

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.941
get some response. Said "Damn, I guess I better
bring in some cake. Or some macaroons." Came

00:47:07.941 --> 00:47:12.090
to the, I wasn't in there at the time. I was
out of town at the time. Came back and then

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:17.150
we had Ronnie workin' the kitchen. So no experience
nothing. Ronnie she's actually worked three

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:21.570
stations there in a year. Pretty good rapid
going around. Excellent job. I still use her

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.120
all the time. Whenever, she's not working
there anymore, but, whenever I have, you know,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.260
she comes and helps us whenever she can. So
it's great. So that's a person, no kitchen

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:35.130
experience. Came in. it comes down to being
smart. You know. Common sense, smart, good

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.530
work ethic. So that's it.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:38.530
Next question.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.860
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: Second question.
[laughter]

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:48.780
You said you did your training in France.
Have you been back to France recently? What

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:55.020
is a great city to go eat? And, or in Europe
in general?

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.020
&gt;&gt;Josiah: OK.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.350
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: I know there's
a lot of--

00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.350
&gt;&gt;Josiah: That's a good question.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.350
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: And you know,
it's of Noma.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.350
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Spain.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.350
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: you know, so
like, where would you go?

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.720
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Where would I go? Well, I go back
to France pretty often. Every year and a half

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:11.110
I like to go to France. Paris is my favorite
city in the world no matter what. Maybe not

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.760
the food's not what it was. It's not, you
know. But to me it's the best city in the

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.620
world. I mean I love Paris.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:21.320
I mean, there's so many places to go. I think
it's a journey. I haven't been to Noma and

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:27.720
these restaurants. So I can't say if it's
great or not. I plan to go. So, I think, the

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.850
best answer, my best answer to that question
is, the best place to go is where you have

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:35.850
a desire to eat. What restaurant interests
you? You know I can't say one or the other.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:40.190
What you really wanna go, go to where you
wanna see. And what interests you. I mean,

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:44.510
Paris is great. Leon, if you like cream and
butter, go to Leon. I was in Leon last year.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.510
[laughter]

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.250
Let me tell you, I came back sick. I never
wanted to eat again. There was some much cream

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.450
and butter in everything. Foi gras everywhere.
And everything they eat is so heavy. But it's

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:58.590
good. It was good. The south of France in
the summertime. If you wanna eat good Mediterranean

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:03.790
fish. Nice pizzas. Italy. Italy to me is one
of the best foods there is. Especially so

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:10.720
fresh. And in Spain you have all these restaurants
in the San Sebastian area. So many great places.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.320
So it's pretty much a never ending journey.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.200
I mean there's a great place in Brazil now.
It's in the Amazon. Sao Paulo. It's called

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.070
Dome. This guy's cooking things that we don't
even know what they are. Like they're getting

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:27.210
it from the Amazon. So it's not known ingredients
to the rest of the world. Doing amazing stuff

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.970
with technique. So like I said earlier, information
travels so fast now. There's so many amazing

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.690
places that you can find. And people can go
in the middle of nowhere and do something

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:40.570
and people can find them. And then we can
go. So it's a hard question. Tokyo is a great

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.840
food city. If you have, I mean, that's to
me, when it comes to eating you can't go wrong

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.081
in Tokyo. You can Italian food, French food,
Japanese food, Chinese food. You can eat every

00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:53.390
food in the world is pretty much done better
than anywhere else in the world. So.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.390
[laughter]

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:59.851
I mean that's the truth. Coffee. There was
just a article about, coffee shops aren't,

00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:04.450
there's not a lot of coffee shops in Japan.
So they're starting to become popular. They

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:09.530
don't, one coffee shop will not serve espressos
yet. Because they can't make 'em properly.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:16.030
The espresso drinks. So they're only doing
Americano, the drip coffee. So I mean, that's

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:20.140
to their culture that's amazing.
Next question?

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.140
Yes?

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:28.520
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Ah, what are some
things I can do to become a better home cook?

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:33.290
Given that I'm not going to unfortunately
go to culinary school or come work at Melisse?

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:40.810
&gt;&gt;Josiah: OK. Well I think first off to become
a better home cook, start off by good ingredients.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:48.160
Taking time. And I think cookbooks are great
to use. I think there's some great books like

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.990
Mario Batali's books are amazing. They really
have a lot of basic stuff. And really good

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:57.180
technique. Sound technique. The Julia Child
books. They're good too. 'Cause they teach

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.300
you technique. I mean this is classical stuff.
I mean books like my book. It's harder stuff.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.280
But we really go through and talk about the
preparation and the way you thing. I think

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:12.190
it starts to be a way of thinking. A way of
cooking things. Taking time. Buying the right

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:16.470
ingredients. Whatever you do I think it's
reading the recipes. Three or four times before

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:23.130
you make it. And the more knowledge you put
inside, then when you're cooking, this happens.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.460
[snaps] So then all of a sudden you know to
move the pan now. You know to turn it down.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:30.060
Because you've read so many different recipes
and different ideas. And I think that's the

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:35.260
basic way. If you're not gonna go to, read
cookbooks. Read food blogs. I mean, Nancy

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:40.290
Silverton books are really good. I think the
[Java Deelantos] books are pretty good, too.

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:44.690
I mean for basic. Basics. Start basic and
work your way up.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.670
It's the best thing to do I think. I mean
cooking class and all that, it's not real.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:53.260
You have two hours to do a class, it's not.
It's great to go but I think just reading

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.260
great cookbooks.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.260
You had a question?

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.620
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: No, actually Matthew
had a question.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.620
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Matthew.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.970
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Is there another
restaurant in LA or other chefs that you look

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.690
up to, admire? I mean that you look forward
to going to?

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:09.660
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yes, there is. I mean I had an all
time favorite place. Which is called Mori

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.580
Sushi. I looked up to this, he actually sold
it. But I would look up to go there a lot.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:19.440
As much as I could. Because he had such deep
knowledge in fish. And I talked to him. I

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.220
learned so much every time I went there. Other
restaurants I admire. The chef of Bettina

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.700
right now. He's a French gentleman named Tony.
Downtown. He's amazing. Providence. The other

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:34.750
places that I've been that are really good,
uh. I like Gino Angelini. He makes great Italian

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:39.720
food. So there's a lot of chefs I like here.
I mean, Lee Hefter from Spago. Was an amazing

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.440
chef when he was at Spago. He's very much
corporate now, all around. There's so many

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:52.801
places. You know I try to keep my, be humble
and like everybody around. And wanna learn

00:52:52.801 --> 00:52:54.590
from everybody I can.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.480
Thank you.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.770
More questions? Any more questions? I saw
the people with their hands up earlier and

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:03.770
then.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:04.770
Yes.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:10.110
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Yeah. What techniques
could you recommend for preparing raw fish?

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:15.930
What do you need to look for? For buying?
And handling?

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:24.260
&gt;&gt;Josiah: I think you need to, get the best
fish possible. So I definitely would suggest

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.970
when it comes to raw fish going to the Japanese
markets. Like Mitsuwa. There's another one

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:35.150
on Sato across the way from, on Sato. There's
one off Olympic. I definitely--And the Nijiya

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.500
market. Nijiya. I definitely go to those places
and buy it. They have it prepped. And I think,

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:46.230
keep it cold. You have to have a really sharp
knife to slice it. And I think, buying the

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:50.390
best product you can. And you know I wouldn't,
wash your hands always before you touch it.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member#6: But do you place
much stock in the label "sashimi grade"?

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.210
&gt;&gt;Josiah: No.

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:58.140
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: No?

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:03.980
&gt;&gt;Josiah: That’s just so they can just say
that. I mean, you know, one of the people

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.570
that eat raw fish go there and buy that, and
they might put it there, I don't even think

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:11.950
at Nijiya it says that. It's all just, it's
just there. The fish. They have little blue

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:15.680
fin tunas. They have everything. It's good.
They have, great things there actually. Lot

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.610
of different variety. They pretty much have
I'd say whatever is kinda in season from the

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:24.320
Japanese market at the time in Japan. They
have most of that stuff. They, there's big

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:31.250
clientele, Japanese clientele that go buy
their fish there. So that's your best bet.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.250
More questions?

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.250
Yes.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:37.530
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: How do you think,
how often do you change the menu? How do you

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.840
come up with new stuff.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:46.150
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Well, creative is, it's evolution
to keep us creative. Of dishes evolving. I

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:51.560
have a team of people. I mean, we try to have
a great chef who's been with me 10 years who's

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:57.760
creative. And we try to get people involved.
And we do a thing now every Thursday night,

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.290
the cooks, one cook prepares a dish, and we
all taste it and critique it. So to try to

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:07.890
keep everybody kind of being creative. But
the most is just evolution. Farmer's market

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:13.710
is really what drives our creativity the most.
Products that you don't see all year. Ingredients,

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:18.250
vegetables that are gone for a year. Fava
beans, peas. Don't have morel mushrooms. So

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:22.490
they come back and then, you're excited to
use them. Start thinking of different ways

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:27.500
to use them. What we can do. I mean this year
we just started getting peas and bonita together.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:32.590
The dried bonita flakes. And peas, they're
sweet. And the smokiness of it. The dried

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:38.241
fishiness. Really nice together. So. Really
it's just the seasons, the vegetables. What's

00:55:38.241 --> 00:55:40.260
out there. I just try to always find it.

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:45.420
But that's our job. To be creative. You have
to stay ahead. I'm petrified of being the

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.610
guy, the old guy who's got that restaurant
that used to be good years ago.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.610
[laughter]

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.680
So. Gotta keep that edge always. That's why
I wrote the book, it's called "In pursuit

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.980
of excellence." Hopefully 'til I retire.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:01.980
I wanna be like John Elway. I wanna retire
after winning, not on the way down.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:02.980
[laughter]

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.530
Any other questions? Yes?

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.880
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: What's your most
recent food discovery?

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:14.450
&gt;&gt;Josiah: My most recent food discovery. Well.
Alright. Sumo. Sumo oranges. Sumo citrus.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:20.390
Alright? So I just, I have a little blog.
So I talk about it a little on there. At josiahcitrin.com.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:25.040
so it's, so I, it's, they were there last
year. They were out last year. But really

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:34.100
small quantity. Ok. So it's a Japanese breed
of citrus. That, dekopon. Depacon? So last

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:39.240
couple, last week I was at Whole Foods and
I saw 'em so I got 'em for my kids. And I

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:45.100
ate one. The most sweetest, amazing fruit.
I mean, to me there's one, the perfect fruit

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:50.450
is a pink lady apple. You know the tart sweetness.
The crunch. And this orange it's the same

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:56.300
thing. It's that perfect balance of food.
Of taste. If you can get that in every dish

00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:02.520
you make, you've hit a home run every time.
The balance in that sumo citrus. So the farmer's

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.490
market has them now. In three weeks they'll
have organic ones. So you can get 'em at Whole

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:10.140
Foods. But if you like making marmalade you
have to buy 'em at the farmers market 'cause

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:15.080
they're not waxed. Same farmer. But Whole
Foods they're waxed. Which if you eat 'em

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.480
raw, they're both conventionally grown so
it doesn't change that much. But if you wanna

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.680
make marmalade you have to go to the farmer's
market. And in three weeks they will have

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.730
organic ones at the market.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:25.730
Yes?

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:28.260
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Can you talk to
us a little about your book?

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:33.321
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yes I can. So my book is, obviously,
I think it's like every chef you wanna have

00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:39.430
a book. So it's, I started a year and a half
ago. I think about a year and a half ago.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:45.160
I really started like 12 years ago. You know,
I've, the making it was like a year and a

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:51.250
half process. Probably the hardest thing I've
ever done. Sit down. Have to write the recipes.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:56.040
Explain it. And be articulate. Took a long
time. But it's really a journey through what

00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:03.121
we do at the restaurant. And how we think
and our philosophy. About the way to prepare

00:58:03.121 --> 00:58:07.831
ingredients in what we do. So it's just really
a compilation of the last 12 years. About

00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:12.750
choosing vegetables. Storing vegetables but
really it was a high anxious, anxiety. A lot

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:21.081
of anxiety in the making of the book. Editing
is the hardest part. Cause once you, in a

00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:25.440
cookbook you go back and say, oh I could say
it better like this. It sounds better if I

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.080
say this. And it's not just one recipe. You
have to go back and try to make every single

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.360
one of those recipes consistent. And once
it goes in this format. There's no more work,

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.950
there's no more spell check. And that, adobe
or whatever. Creative Suite. There's no spellchecker

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:42.440
so it's like wow. Anyway.

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440
[laughter]

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:48.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I think we're almost
out of time on the tape. Could I steal the

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:49.970
last question?

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:50.970
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Yes please.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.940
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So if you could clone yourself
and have Josiah II go work and take care of

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.870
the restaurant side of the business, what
would your other career be?

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:01.713
&gt;&gt;Josiah: My, per, me, uh, you know I like
to negotiate and argue. So I'd probably be

00:59:01.713 --> 00:59:02.713
a lawyer.

00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:03.713
[laughter]

00:59:03.713 --> 00:59:08.750
I like. It doesn't matter. I always take the
other side the other person has. I could care

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.140
less about even agreeing on it. So I think.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.760
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We hire a couple of those.
So let us know.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.990
&gt;&gt;Josiah: You do. Right?

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.990
[laughter]

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:21.490
Not for the. I wouldn't even do it for the
degree of the job. Just for the. I just like

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.850
doing it. Me and my son's, my son's the same
way. So you should see us at the dinner table.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:32.310
Back and forth. It's good. So. That would
be my second job. But I don't wanna do the

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.490
eight years of school though. So.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you very much.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.490
&gt;&gt;Josiah: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be
here. Thank you all.

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:35.491
[applause]
