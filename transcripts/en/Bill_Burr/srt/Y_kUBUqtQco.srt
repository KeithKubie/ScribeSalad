1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:01,900
Okay.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,920
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:07,921
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday flap ea

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,330
and April 17th, 2017 what's going on?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,830
How are you? Happy Patriot's
day, everybody. Um,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
I believe that only move towards my
voice right now. I believe that uh,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,810
Massachusetts is Kinda the only place
that takes Patriot's day off kind of,

8
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:29,920
sort of, you know, they had
the Boston Marathon, right?

9
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:33,960
They usually play a red sox game during
the day for everybody doesn't want to

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,090
fucking run around and watch a bunch
of skinny people running down the damn

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,420
streets shitting themselves
on handbrake hill.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,260
Every year is somebody shits
themselves in that race.

13
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,900
You know that anytime there's a marathon,

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,290
there's people that push themselves so
hard that they literally shit themselves.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,090
It's the fucking running up the
hill. You know, those runners,

16
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,460
they were those little fucking
nylon shorts and stuff.

17
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:02,870
So there's nowhere for it to go.
And these maniacs say, just stay,

18
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,870
just keep running with shit going
down the back of their legs.

19
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,990
Like one of those fucking
horses that carries, you know,

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,650
drags the newlyweds around the park.
You know, but even them, you know,

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,580
they put the tail up, they
fucking shoot it out. Oh,

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,480
he's going in early with the shit jokes.
Everybody says what it's gonna be.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,860
Is it literally going to
be who should show? Um,

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,510
yeah, so whatever happy
page you'd stayed everybody.

25
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,270
I don't even know what
Patriot's day is. You know,

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,380
I don't think it's about the football
team because it's not football season is

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,430
just that when we raise the banner
Patriot state, let's look it up. Shall We?

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,410
People Patriots Day a
Hashtag. What the fuck is it?

29
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,930
Why does it automatically
go to fucking Wikipedia?

30
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:50,950
Even though I would've gone here. All
right. Then there's this Patriot Day,

31
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:54,340
a film starring mark, Mark Walberg.
That's not what I was looking for.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,370
Cock suckers. I just don't
understand. I had, oh my God,

33
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:04,110
I had the worst day with my
fucking phone. Like yesterday.

34
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,240
I tried to update it.

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,123
Um,

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,571
you know,

37
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:11,570
and then it comes back on and then you
need all your fucking passwords and no

38
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,600
matter how much I type them in,
the way they're supposed to be,

39
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,810
it doesn't recognize it.
Then it shuts down my phone.

40
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,150
Then it's going la balls,

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,830
your guten tag and like 50 different
fucking languages and I can't, I can't.

42
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,520
I came. So if I had not, I
haven't meditated in a month,

43
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:29,630
I'm not going to lie to you, but I, I,

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,820
if I hadn't meditated so much in
the beginning part of the year,

45
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:34,100
I would've broke my phone
in half. I grabbed it,

46
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:38,600
I turned it sideways and I fucking
started. I started to do it.

47
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,910
I started the fucking
break it and I stopped.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I did throw it at the couch into the
cushions and I also did throw my laptop

49
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:53,150
into the, they were all into the cushions,
not overly hot. You know, it's funny,

50
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,410
when I lift up the laptop,

51
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:57,290
I felt the pain of my rotator cuff
so I could only throw it so hard.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,020
It was really pathetic. It was
a pathetic display of anger. Uh,

53
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,400
okay.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,390
So, you know, I dunno, my phone
still fucking with me. You know,

55
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,570
I'm trying to go into the God damn apple
store here and they won't let me do it.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,700
I don't understand these,
you know, apple is,

57
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,290
everybody fucking loves
his got company. You know.

58
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,280
Can somebody please fucking explain to
me why they're so hostile when it comes

59
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,580
to any sort of customer support.
Is there a fucking reason?

60
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,510
There's not a phone number. I can't
talk to anybody. They're like, fuck you.

61
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:32,970
Here's our product that
doesn't work. Go Fuck Yourself.

62
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,490
We're not responsible for anything.
You don't know what we look like.

63
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,720
You don't know where we are.

64
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,920
Don't even talk to me about those fucking
apple stores with the people walking

65
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,820
around with the genius t shirts.
Give me a fucking break. Oh,

66
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:49,290
that sounds says cause somebody just came
into my house. I hear it all the time.

67
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,340
So I mean it doesn't mean
shit to me. Um, anyways.

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,830
[inaudible] that was like
an anger meter. You know,

69
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,700
as I was getting up higher would ring
and they would let me know to come back

70
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:01,320
down again. You know,

71
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,950
like an idiot light on some car that
your engine is overheating anyways.

72
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,120
Fuck those apple stores too.
All right, those that did that,

73
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,620
it's all bullshit. You're talking
to low level people in the,

74
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,650
in the company. Nobody who's fucking
designing these goddamn things.

75
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,380
It ended up being fucked up
is working at that store.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,780
Okay?

77
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,690
We give him that stupid fucking shirt
that says genius usted se [inaudible]

78
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,200
um, and then what do
they got to deal with?

79
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,080
Fucking balding hot heads like me
who come walking in going like, dude,

80
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,900
where the fuck did all my music go?
Where did you put it on the cloud?

81
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,490
I don't want you to have my stuff.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,130
Fine. I don't, you know, I should
have never stopped getting cds.

83
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:45,050
All I know is everything's
fucked up. Okay?

84
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,550
And so now I'm signing into shit on my
laptop. My phone's talking to me going,

85
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:53,090
hey, somebody signing in on another
device and there's no place for me to say,

86
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:56,360
yeah, I know it's me. And then
the laptop soon the same thing.

87
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,480
[inaudible] like it's like David Lee
Roth and Eddie van Halen. It's like,

88
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,400
you guys, you were great together.

89
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,300
We had the band and now you're fucking
breaking up and you're talking shit about

90
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:09,440
each other and don't even talk to me about
those fucking numbers I'm supposed to

91
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:12,770
punch in. Cause I did that
too. I went into my settings,

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,360
I fuck stupid. Uh, whatever.

93
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,890
Clicked on my name,

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,090
went into passwords type the fucking
number that they just sent me into the

95
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,670
thing and they said they didn't
recognize it and then they freeze up.

96
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:29,900
My phone frees up my phone. Like I'm
working in the Pentagon or something.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,690
It comes from fucking general.

98
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:36,960
I'm just some jerk off who wants to
listen to some fucking hair metal from the

99
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,370
80s KKR, you know, while I get on a
treadmill, it's all I'm trying to do here.

100
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,760
You know what it is. It's
fucking, it's incestuous.

101
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,470
Yeah.

102
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,140
You know how really rich people want
to keep the money in their family,

103
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,160
you know, so they just sort of,

104
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,120
they sort of breed with the same five
families I've talked to you this before.

105
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,130
So it's why, you know, you
look at the, it's like they're,

106
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,940
they're good looking from the forehead
down to like the mouth area and then they

107
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,490
smile and it's Whoa. You know,

108
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,100
starts looking like they should
be playing a fucking banjo.

109
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,773
Okay.

110
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,610
You know? So it's the same thing
with technology. Technology.

111
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,110
It used to be a radio
was radio over there.

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,750
It's my stereo dad over there
is the dishwasher, right?

113
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,200
Slash. Maid. I'm sorry.

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,360
She's thinking about the
time I was talking about.

115
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,610
And then you had your walk wins, right?

116
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,930
Then the walk when also had a fucking
radio and a phone was a phone and now

117
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:40,100
they've all fought. They've all
just been gang banging. Right?

118
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,510
This big fucking calendula.
Fucking fisting technological,

119
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,590
I dunno what they're all
the same goddamn thing now.

120
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,120
Everything, everything is just on
those fucking things. And I don't know,

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,580
it's ridiculous. So what I ended up
doing as I, after I started to like,

122
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,151
it was weird.

123
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:04,151
Like I had the strength signals sent
from all the way to like my risks.

124
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,560
I didn't let it get to my hands. I felt
the anger go all, it's like the hulk,

125
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:14,300
right? The fucking my arms turn green
all the way down to my wrist and I just,

126
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,500
I stopped myself from breaking in
and half, but I have to, Oh God,

127
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,740
that would've been such a
great feeling to just snap.

128
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:26,320
It has to be youtube videos of people
snapping it. Fucking phones in half. Um,

129
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,880
what I did was I just
said, fuck that phone,

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
fuck the laptop and I hit a drum lesson
and I got in my truck and I just fucking

131
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,100
drove over any, I can
admit, you know what?

132
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:40,430
It was kind of fucking nice
not having a phone, you know,

133
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,800
I wasn't looking at text
messages, dwell driving.

134
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,270
I wasn't doing any of that type of shit.

135
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,890
Trying to fucking scroll in the next
God damn song. None of that shit.

136
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,460
I just was, I dunno, driving a car,

137
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,810
like I used to talking to myself and um,

138
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,240
and I came back calm down.

139
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,850
I tried it again and about, I
don't know, maybe the 17th attempt.

140
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,930
I got it to work again and uh,
I just got it as, you know,

141
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,210
as great as these are and my ability to
communicate with you guys and everything

142
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,630
like that. You know, I,

143
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:19,850
I still would've been
alright without these things.

144
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,120
I could have made it the old fashioned
way is a comedian where you just keep

145
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,750
doing the clubs and doing the clubs than
I do with guest spot on the Hollywood

146
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,360
squares right next to
Paul Lynde. You know,

147
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,600
maybe do a fucking tonight show
and I just keep building up.

148
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,120
I could've made it that way. I
didn't need all of this shit.

149
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,690
All this shit that these
fucking Yolo Deuces, you know,

150
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,270
selfies and then the, the picture you
take that it takes sort of a video,

151
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,870
but it's a picture, but
it's also a video, you know,

152
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,080
these flying squirrel
suits, I mean, I don't know.

153
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,070
What is it you just to do shit that other

154
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,360
people didn't do? Is that what
it is? I don't fucking know.

155
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,900
You know, back in the day, you
know what it was back in the day,

156
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,901
you fucking did the clubs until you built
up enough of the following on your own

157
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,631
that you headlined clubs and then maybe
you got an hour special then you know

158
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,340
now if you're a middle act, you
need an hour special to headline.

159
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,940
Like the whole thing is to, I
just feel like this old man like,

160
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,383
okay,

161
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,010
what's the deal? But man, everything.
Alright patriots day, everybody.

162
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,870
Um, patriots day. Where is it?

163
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,420
Patriot stay in Massachusetts,

164
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:46,421
in Wisconsin and Patriot stay in
Maine is an official state holiday

165
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,290
commemorating the anniversary of the
battles of Lexington and Concord.

166
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,190
Well, what the fuck does Maine in
Wisconsin have to do with that?

167
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,670
The first battles of the American
revolution or does is main in Wisconsin,

168
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,460
the only other two fucking
states that respect our holiday.

169
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,000
The holiday was originally
celebrated on April 19th.

170
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,030
The actual anniversary of the battles
fought in 1775 since 1969 it's been

171
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:20,660
observed on the third Monday in April
in Massachusetts and in May. Doe,

172
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,850
let's get a three day
weekend out of it, you know,

173
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,910
fuck the 19th just make
sure it's on Monday.

174
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,140
It's also the first day of a vacation
week for public schools in both states,

175
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,980
in both states and a school holiday
for many low local colleges and

176
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,840
universities, both public and private.

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,130
The day is a public school
observance stay in Wisconsin.

178
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,460
Florida law also encourages
people to celebrate it.

179
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,970
Like those fucking people needed an
encouragement to celebrate. Anything else

180
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,890
you fucking celebrating? Like
everyday's Patriot's day.

181
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,750
Fucking meth day. Um, though it is
not treated as a public holiday.

182
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,863
Okay.

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,180
Obs, observances in reenactments
of battles occur occur.

184
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,490
I remember going to one
of those when I was a kid.

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
I thought those people were coolest shit,

186
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,040
shooting the guns and pretending
to die and all that stuff.

187
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,460
I thought it was awesome. Then I got older
and I was like, Hey, are you meeting?

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,490
If that's what he's into. All
right. The Boston Marathon.

189
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,790
He's run on Patriot's day
every fucking year. Therefore,

190
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,090
sometimes the holiday is
referred to as marathon.

191
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:30,630
Monday at the Boston red sox had been
sketched and had been scheduled to play at

192
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:35,631
home and Family Park and patriots day
every year since 1959 the games have

193
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,630
postpone to, to weather in 59, 61 65,

194
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:43,500
67 and 84 do I need all of this? All
right. We got it. Okay. We got it.

195
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,313
So that's what it is.

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,480
It's commemorating the first battles of
the American revolutions in a Lexington

197
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,880
and Concord, I thought was the first
one. That wasn't the first one.

198
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,440
Oh, there was a civil war. Oh my
God. Shaking my head. Shut up.

199
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,910
You fucking Wikipedia reading.

200
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,540
Can't nobody gives a fuck about your
war knowledge. Did you fight in it?

201
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,890
Well then shut up. All right. You know,
it was funny before I came in here,

202
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,880
right, I was watching the Celtics
lose. It's a fresh loss at, um,

203
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm, I'm taping this, uh, Sunday
night, uh, Celtics lost to,

204
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,050
uh, the giant Jamie Fox
and the Chicago Bulls.

205
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:24,440
Dude,

206
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,840
that Butler guy looks like Jamie Fox
circur like around somewhere in the 90s in

207
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:33,340
living color and uh, you
know, fucking brutal game,

208
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,500
brutal game, brutal game.
But it was also, you know,

209
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,420
with Isaiah losing his sister and
stuff, it was kind of like, uh, the,

210
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,700
the drama of the game was definitely
just looked at us just a fucking game.

211
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:45,780
Look what this guy's going through,

212
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,660
but the balls as much as
they're an eight seat, you know,

213
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:52,530
let's go a little sports morning, talk
radio today. You don't leave Chicago.

214
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,260
Paul's is much easier in AC.

215
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,290
Do you have a lot of veteran
presence ed in your experience?

216
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,860
Uh, where would you Dwayne
Wayne [inaudible] Rondo and

217
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,230
yeah, it's not going
to be an easy one. Um,

218
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,150
and then they got that
unit bomber guy like,

219
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:11,210
I dunno what the fuck that guy's
deal is. You know what I mean?

220
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,890
I think when I look at that guy,

221
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:16,970
his do the hairdo he has
in the fucking facial hair.

222
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,400
Okay.

223
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,620
I just hear his agent, you
know, going like, dude,

224
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:25,480
we've tried everything to get you
a lucrative advertising contracts.

225
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,460
We got nothing. So, you know,

226
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,170
why don't you just be the crazy
fucking hair and bearded face guy.

227
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,250
Why don't we try that? Did the
bird man retire yet? You know,

228
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,700
I used to get claustrophobic looking
at that guy's fucking tattoos.

229
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,610
They just kept going higher and higher.
Like the little here with choking them.

230
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm very colorful. Very
marvel comic. Um, yeah.

231
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:51,940
So we lost whatever man. Fucking one
game. You know, what are you gonna do?

232
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,570
I mean, we live and die, but we've got
one guy, we got fucking Isaiah Thomas.

233
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:59,470
That's our guy. Okay. He's the fucking
guy. We live and die by the threes.

234
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,300
We don't get fucking offensive boards.

235
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,820
End Up dying. Get Away with that in
the regular season. Come play off time.

236
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,654
You know, you weren't getting

237
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,990
both. That's what I'm worried
about. And the Bruins blow it.

238
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,920
Hmm?

239
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,190
You blow it. We fucking
blew game. We blew it.

240
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,590
We fucking blew it a game too.

241
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,610
I think we forgot that there was a
third period grown press with ourselves.

242
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:23,881
You know,

243
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:27,390
we scored three goals in the second
period or something like that or to

244
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:30,900
something. We were up three, eight
we have three to one up three to one.

245
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,310
Everything's going good.

246
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,510
And the crosschecking cons
that are the Ottawa Senators,

247
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,740
Jesus Christ.

248
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,160
Yeah.

249
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,430
If one auto was senator Finn bitched
about the refereeing in that game,

250
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,580
I saw one play like this fucking
guy crosschecked the same guy twice,

251
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:51,830
right in front of the net.
The guy went down twice call.

252
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,650
It was like every fucking third
crosscheck that that they would call.

253
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:59,230
And then that that color
commentator was so pro auto.

254
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,800
It was fucking ridiculous that that first
one they was trying to say that the,

255
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:07,240
you know, the goal was off sides. It's
like kind of fuck. Can you tell that?

256
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,550
He definitely seems like he moves his leg,

257
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:14,470
but there's no way you can see
from that shitty angle from nine.

258
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,220
I love the NHL too. It's
like they're going to,

259
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,040
they're going to implement fucking replay,

260
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,880
but then for whatever reason they're
gonna have a camera on top of the Goddamn

261
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,790
arena. Elise, that's the
feed we got. It's like,

262
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,590
how the fuck can you tell what the
guys on site or not? I don't know.

263
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,280
Might've been a good call.
Might've been a bad call.

264
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:33,430
I had no idea what the color
comedy was, was convinced.

265
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,990
Oh cool.

266
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,750
Well that the doubt that they should
that the teacher to call that one back.

267
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:38,231
Oh fuck.

268
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:42,370
You just go skate down the Goddamn
river and go get your fucking whatever.

269
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:46,360
Whatever the fuck you guys eat
up there. Um, so when it was,

270
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,070
we'll see how that one goes. Um,

271
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,653
okay.

272
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm hoping I both basically opened
the same thing for the Bruins and the

273
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:56,440
Celtics. I know we're not winning the
championship and either fucking league.

274
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm just hoping we can go
as far as we can. All right.

275
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,600
Get some good playoff
experience and build on that.

276
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:06,170
That's what the fuck I'm looking for.
That's it. That's all. Nothing crazy.

277
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,620
You know, I didn't even look to
see if a, I know the predators,

278
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,080
they won that first game. One
to nothing. A pitcher's duel.

279
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,750
See, you see what the fuck
happened with them and game two,

280
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,250
I ain't know the fucking ranges and
the fucking Canadians we're playing.

281
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,370
What have we got here? What's going
on? What's going on in the world?

282
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,490
The NHL fucking penguins.
They're the team that beat man.

283
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,030
Fuck the capitals till
the capitols do something.

284
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,820
Yeah.

285
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,540
Ah, the fucking Canadians want again.
Gotta hate those fucking bastards.

286
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,140
Then I could have went shit though.
Blues take a three game than none.

287
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:45,480
Series over the wild.
What else do we got here?

288
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,850
What's going on with
the fuck? Come on man.

289
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:51,400
Can you just give me the
fucking scores here? Yeah. Oh,

290
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,690
Pittsburgh wins in overtime.

291
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,603
Okay.

292
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,520
All right. Well where's the rest of
the, where's the rest of the scores?

293
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:01,070
What happened yesterday? Chicago win.

294
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
Should, should it be this difficult?

295
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,990
Should you just go on the website and
it's just all right there for mouth

296
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:12,530
breathing morons like me is, is this
asking too much? I went the wrong way.

297
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,460
Nashville one five to nothing. Oh my God.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,790
Okay.

299
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,120
Anaheim's up two games to not Nashville's
up two games to none. Toronto, B,

300
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,330
Washington and overtime. Oh, no wonder
I didn't hear from fucking Josh.

301
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,970
Adam Meyers. We lost in overtime.
All right, let's fuck this page.

302
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,440
I don't want to go back
and relive this shit.

303
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,140
So, um, yeah, that's what I did today.
That's what I've been doing this weekend,

304
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:45,210
hanging out with my daughter
and I'm just watching playoffs.

305
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I watched that fucking F1 race in
whatever the hell that one was at actually

306
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:56,190
taped at this time at a
great time watching that and
the Ferrari's when again,

307
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,840
when again, what's his face? One,
I didn't write down his name.

308
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,140
One of those v guys wanted, you know,

309
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,130
Hamilton got fucking penalize
five seconds for driving too slow,

310
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,310
slowing up Ricardo. And then people
would go in like, Hey, you know what?

311
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,510
I don't think he should have been. Uh,

312
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,700
I don't think he should've been
penalize for a, for fucking,

313
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,900
basically what was happening was Mercedes
was pitting both their cars at the

314
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:26,700
same fucking time, you know,
so the other guys in there,

315
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:31,320
the guy was not Nico Rosberg,
he's in there, that bolt to guy.

316
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,080
Right. And he's fucking
sitting there. It's basically,

317
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,150
it's like when the jet pulls
into the airport, you know,

318
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,830
and the in you're all excited,
you're 20 minutes fucking early.

319
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,920
But then the guy gets a catch me CUNA,

320
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,110
she could see we arrived
about 11 minutes early. Uh,

321
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,210
fortunately our gate is still occupied so,

322
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,930
well he doesn't make a difference.
We get here early or not.

323
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,830
We're still gonna pull up to the, uh,
the jet way at the same time. So wow.

324
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,190
Just sit back gladly as well.
Information that I'm going to wear.

325
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,970
What'd you do? Enjoy the a tarmac,
right? Same fucking thing. Okay.

326
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,130
So he's fucking guy. Sorry
that went on way too long.

327
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,040
I was just trying to remember the
names of the airport shit. Right.

328
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,350
So there's the other guys for
already sitting there. All right.

329
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,900
That Boutros Boutros poly guys
already fucking sitting there.

330
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,570
So he's pulling into the pits.
He knows he can't go there.

331
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:27,890
So he starts slowing the fuck down, you
know, causing the other fucking guy.

332
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:32,480
Ricardo is spots open. It's like, dude,
get the fuck out of the way. You know,

333
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,000
we set the way the official site, but I,

334
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:39,700
I actually agree with the officials
cause Lewis Hamilton is, uh, is, is I,

335
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,560
you know, I haven't watched
him much, but I think he's,

336
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:45,890
he's like that level competitive or he
will pull like a little cunty moves like

337
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:50,000
that. And I think that that's why you
get penalized, you know, cause you know,

338
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,340
it's like, it's like when Marshawn
got busted with the fucking, you know,

339
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,530
the stick to the boss,
you know what I mean?

340
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,290
You're going to get suspended because
even when we know we know the other shit

341
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,120
you've done, so I think Lewis Hamilton
gets the same fucking treatment. Anyways,

342
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,030
congratulations to Sebastian federal and
the Ferrari team. This has been great.

343
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:08,910
Three races, Ferrari wins. One
Mercedes wins the other. Now for Ryan,

344
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,450
once the third one I like, it's
gonna be a nice back and forth.

345
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,070
Sebastian Vettel leads fucking Lewis
Hamilton by seven championship points.

346
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,090
68 to 61. Tony, you guys get
into it. It's like 57 laps.

347
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,550
It's a great fucking time, judge.

348
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,800
Go see what the Illuminati
does with their money.

349
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,750
It's up to phenomenal goddamn sport.

350
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,530
It's already way better than last year
where it was just fucking the Mercedes.

351
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,360
It was a race to the first turn and then
that was it. It was over, but very, uh,

352
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,600
very happy with it this
year. Um, so anyways, um,

353
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,920
what else did I do this weekend? I've
been working out like a fucking maniac.

354
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,760
Um, actually get on the
scale. Set One 74, you know,

355
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,170
I got some acting work this week. I'd
like to be about a buck 72, you know,

356
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,240
that's the weight I kind
of need to be around.

357
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,360
So I don't look like a big
headed fucking jackass, you know?

358
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:01,750
Shout out to all you actresses out there
who think only women deal with that.

359
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,460
It's so hard is the love and it shut up.

360
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,100
Shut up. You're in a movie,
shut up. That's like, you know,

361
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,380
I gotta I can't be too loud.
My daughter's sleeping,

362
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,450
but my wife was watching that,

363
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:20,650
keeping up with the Kardashians and
they were having a tough moment in their

364
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:23,230
family, you know, and they were all
sitting there just, you know, you know,

365
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:26,800
I just, it just seems like
it's one thing after another.

366
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,250
And I know a lot of families deal with
that, but just, it's been really fucking,

367
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,610
it's been really hard. And
as they're saying this,

368
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,640
they're sitting in a private jet being
filmed for a television show on their way

369
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:39,774
to New York City

370
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,380
and they're all sitting there with these
sad pound puppy looks on their faces.

371
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:49,110
I don't give a fuck if I
was going to my own funeral.

372
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,100
If I was on a private jet
to fucking New York City,

373
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,690
I would be getting shit faced. The
pilots would love me, you know,

374
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,150
I wouldn't have a disrupt what they're
doing up there. I would be like,

375
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,130
I'm fucking temperate. You guys. Right.

376
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,603
Okay.

377
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,510
She sitting there all sad.

378
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,150
It's just hard because you know with
everything that happened last year to then

379
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,780
come into this year and have
more hard things to be happening,

380
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,220
it's just really hard.

381
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay.

382
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,620
I would love to take that clip, you know,

383
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,400
and show it to people who
actually really have problems.

384
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,000
Dual reaction video, you know,
whoever's sewed together,

385
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,710
they're fucking close
and I'm guilty of it too.

386
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:35,660
Everything I've fucking
wears made in a sweatshop.

387
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,800
I actually tried one time there was a,
there was a website called no sweat.

388
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,710
I don't know if it still exists
and they made all these clothes.

389
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,600
None of it was sweatshop labor,

390
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:48,680
and I looked at all the clothes and none
of it was cool clothes, and I was like,

391
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:51,980
wow, I want to do the right
thing, but I can't wear that shit.

392
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,390
All my friends are
going to make fun of me.

393
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,100
So I put my own insecurity ahead of
fucking people working for sweatshop labor

394
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:04,640
prices. I don't know. I just know
it's just really hard sometimes.

395
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:07,910
Even if you are in a private
chat on your way to New York City

396
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
drinking champagne, they
weren't even drinking champagne.

397
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,290
They were just sitting
there and looking sad.

398
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,660
They're big fucking brown Kardashian
eyes. You know what they look like?

399
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,030
One of those fucking
creepy paintings, you know,

400
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:25,200
they make the kids remember that that
artist that just had those giant fucking

401
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:29,400
eyes that was like his thing. They had
giant, these giant fucking creepy eyes.

402
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,320
I gotta look this shit up, dude. This guy,

403
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,760
this guy actually made a ton of money.

404
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,570
They were considered cute in like the
70s and I always fucking hated them.

405
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,240
Always hated him. Oh by the way,

406
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:42,630
if you're wondering how the point
system works in F1, you get 25 points.

407
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,420
If you come in first and you get points
the way down to 10th place, it goes 25,

408
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,720
like 15, 12, 10, eight six four two
one. I believe that's how it goes all.

409
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,830
And then everybody else can go
fuck themselves. By the way.

410
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:59,480
How funny was it in that guy drive him
for the Honda's just bitching over the

411
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,650
radio, but what a piece of shit his car
was. He sounded like me in high school,

412
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,670
except if he's driving a
fucking formula one race car.

413
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,540
He said this is the most under powered
race car I've ever driven in my life.

414
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,930
They're all sitting like
guy, dude, not on the radio.

415
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,880
And then they're cut into his car and
it says Honda on the side of it. Um,

416
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,040
anyways, uh, yeah,

417
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,020
it was a really fascinating race because
there was somewhere in the Middle East

418
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,440
and it was, they were worried
about sand blowing onto the track,

419
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,150
which could chew up the tires and
obviously fucked with the traction. Um,

420
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,970
I don't know. The more I get
into it, the more I like it.

421
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:41,900
What the fuck was I looking
at? Okay, creepy big.

422
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,880
I kids paintings

423
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,190
seventies this is always search
for shit. I better get it.

424
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,990
I've to get it. Come on.

425
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,460
The big guide children, the
extraordinary story of an epic art fraud.

426
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,773
No, that's not them.

427
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,390
What does every art gallery have that
older white woman with a really short

428
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,570
hair, like a boy's haircut,
but it's like stylized.

429
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,970
You know like she sings in
oasis or some shit vintage.

430
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,200
Oh, there it is. Is this it? Nah,
that's not them. I guess everybody does.

431
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,040
The big guide thing.

432
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,260
What the f? The big eyes.

433
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,440
What the fuck was that thing
call wasn't called like love is.

434
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,280
That's not a wow. A lot of people are
with the big eyed kids. A big guide.

435
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,340
Kids in fucking big eyed kid.

436
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,290
Love is dot.dot. Big Eyes.

437
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,520
Let's see if that works.
All right. I give up.

438
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,090
I fucking give up now. Show
me a picture of spongebob.

439
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,370
Squarepants freaking out on some drugs.

440
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,370
Do you guys know the ones I was
talking about? They had little bodies.

441
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,980
They had giant heads ne
these big fucking eyes,

442
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,130
these little pink fucking
arms and shit. They just were,

443
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,450
they were creepy as shit and everybody
thought they was so goddamn cube.

444
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,660
I was a dumb kid though. Do you know what?

445
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:19,661
Every time I walked into a Photoshop
back then and they'd have picture frames

446
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,750
and then they will already
have like a picture in it.

447
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,200
Like I thought that you
buy in that picture.

448
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,200
And My mother one time was looking
at picture frames. I was like,

449
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:34,520
why would you want that one? I mean, whose
kids are those? And she just laughed.

450
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,781
She's laughed when she goes, no,

451
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:39,230
you take it out and then you put your
picture in there. I was like, go,

452
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,580
now that I have a kid, I can't imagine
like that's gotta be a terrifying moment.

453
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:52,170
Like, oh my God, is my kid gonna be
homeless? I'll fucking, you know,

454
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,590
he'd come home, you look at you like
dead, dead. Dumbness was not in me.

455
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,800
You know, you come home and you look at
your spouse, that's you. You did that.

456
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,180
That's your strand.

457
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:04,410
A fucking DNA messing up
my 50% thank you very much.

458
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,640
I'm all right. Let me read a little bit
of advertising here for the week. Um,

459
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,220
that's going to drive me nuts. It was
a big, I'd fucking kids. All Right,

460
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,510
wink. When you have a great glass of wine,

461
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,050
it enhances the moment. Yeah.
It's called getting shit faced.

462
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,260

day or with someone you love,

463
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,410

more of those moments.

466
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,460

people's shit face yelling at their kids.

467
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,293

542
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:27,260
make fucking dumplings?
Let's talk about that. Hey,

543
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,290
where any any fucking guns
out there? Any Asians?

544
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,410
Listen to this podcast.

545
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,640
Anybody from the Far
East migrated over here?

546
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,130
Maybe a second generation or maybe your
family's like old school and then kept

547
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,280
the tradition going so you know
how to make fucking dumplings. I,

548
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,480
I love dumplings. All right.
I'm like Oprah right now.

549
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:54,770
I love dark lanes. I
fucking love dumplings.

550
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,750
And I told you the story of when I was
in Singapore and I was on my way to Hong

551
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,870
Kong and I was in the fucking airport
lounge and that count ate all the fucking

552
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,700
dumplings. I swear to God,

553
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,130
I don't know how his belly
wasn't hanging over his pants.

554
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:10,610
He says little skinny motherfucker
was like as a competitive eater,

555
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,750
they kept bringing them out in like in
like groups of like 14 and this fucking

556
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,980
guy would eat like 11 of them.

557
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,360
It's like he was flying around the world
and it was going to be no food in the

558
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:25,070
God damn plane. So the best dumplings
I ever fucking had. I was in Hong Kong.

559
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,850
I went to some dim, some shit. Oh,
I don't know what the hell it was,

560
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:33,650
but it is a fucking art form over there.
But I'll tell you, here in America,

561
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,620
they, they still do a great job,
but the dumplings, the pots,

562
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,470
I love him. All right. I told you
guys a while ago, I was, you know,

563
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:46,440
I wanted to get outside my palette and
I never cooked with any of the Asian

564
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,890
Shit, even though I love it. Right?

565
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,340
So I decided that I'm going to try and
make these fucking dumplings, right.

566
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,900
So of course I don't have any of the
ingredients I need other than the flour,

567
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,160
hot water, sugar, salt. What
the fuck else did I have?

568
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,100
And of course they had some of that
with us. Soy Sauce. I had that.

569
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,170
But everything else I didn't
have, I didn't have anything else.

570
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,290
So I go to the white grocery store, right?

571
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,310
I go to their little Asian section
that's right next to the Mexican section

572
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,360
that's a little bit bigger.

573
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,570
And then everything else is just for
northern Europeans. I mean that's,

574
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,280
that's a white grocery store. That's what
it's like. Okay. So he say to the guy,

575
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:26,420
you got any of these fucking chili sauce?
Do you have any of the dark soy sauce?

576
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,160
And you know,

577
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:32,420
I actually asked an agent dude that worked
at the fish counter and he was like,

578
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,120
Nah man, they don't have that
shit here. And I was like,

579
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:37,880
do you know where I can get it?
And he was like, no, I mean,

580
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,160
I don't know where you live. And
I was like, all right, sorry.

581
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,530
So I ended up going to a a,

582
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,140
whatever was a Korea town titan,
I don't know what the fuck it was.

583
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:51,620
I went and I went to into this grocery
store and I come walk in whole new

584
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:56,150
fucking world, all these fucking noodles,
all of this shit I'm looking at going,

585
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,940
that's the stuff when I ordered,
there it is right there. Right.

586
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,740
So I'm looking for my stuff.
I needed like corn flour

587
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,940
and they didn't have any. So when
I went to the Thai grocery store,

588
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,230
I was looking for it.

589
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,670
And there was this Asian lady there
with their mother and she sees me,

590
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,250
the fucking white dude around.

591
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,380
I hear looking at the shit trying to
figure stuff out. She starts laughing,

592
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,170
she goes, what are you trying to make?
And then I laughed. They sent them,

593
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:24,830
I try to make dumplings. She goes,
all right, what do you need? I said,

594
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,540
I'm trying to find corn flour. And she
goes, Oh, you know, it's just, you know,

595
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,000
since she talks to her mother, I'll
get outta there fucking, you know,

596
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,440
this is the real deal. Shit, you know,

597
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,890
bilingual shit going down and they're
trying to help me find the corn.

598
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,003
They couldn't. So I,

599
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,770
they found this other shit and that
was close to it and we were like, ah,

600
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,590
I don't know if we can use
that. So I was like, fuck it.

601
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,690
Maybe I've got to go to
Chinatown. I have no fucking idea.

602
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,690
So I thank them and they
say good luck and I leave.

603
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,360
Then I'm standing up at the
register and was hilarious.

604
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,510
That same woman came up to me
and this is what she says to me.

605
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:57,780
This is like a minute later she
goes, excuse me? She goes, well, you,

606
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,020
the guy was just talking to and
immediately I'm like, oh my God,

607
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:01,854
we all look alike him.

608
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,743
Okay,

609
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,840
so I laugh, but I go, yeah. And
she goes, I just googled it.

610
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:13,220
You can use this as a substitute. She
took the time out to Google. I was like,

611
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:16,250
you know what, you, you're awesome. She
said, no worries. I said, all right,

612
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:20,420
see you late. So now I got a new
grocery store to go to. So I come home.

613
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,980
So I go to the meat store,

614
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,250
I get my fucking pork and all that
shit and get my ginger, right.

615
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:28,250
All this shit that I'm going to put in
there. So I go to make this, make it.

616
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:32,090
The filling was fucking easy. My Bok
Choy, fucking cutting up the green onions,

617
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:35,540
all of that. It's smelling right. It's
looking right, everything's going good.

618
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,930
Then I go to do the fucking
dough and God damn it,

619
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:43,620
that was a motherfucker not mixing it
up. Mixing it up was easy, but like,

620
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:47,610
just trying to make them
into a round circle was a,

621
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,920
that was not easy. Forget about
folding them up and, uh, so whatever.

622
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,500
I put a little oil in the
pan. It took me forever.

623
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:58,980
It took me like two hours
to do this whole thing.

624
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,580
And I was talking to somebody else
who married into an Asian family.

625
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,820
It was just like, aw man. He goes, when
they do what they fucking, how quickly,

626
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,380
you know,

627
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,740
they can fucking get the dumpling
together and fold it up and make it look

628
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:15,690
right. It's like, it's like a
fucking, it's like magic, you know?

629
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,380
And I'm sitting there all clumsy trying
to get the thing together and it took me

630
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,750
like two hours to get the whole thing
together. And for whatever reason,

631
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,350
this fucking recipe I had like,

632
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,850
yeah.

633
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,670
Oh, how many did I have? I had
like fucking like 40 of them. Yeah.

634
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,020
Almost like I almost quit like
15 times. Just going like,

635
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,500
how many times could I have
ordered dumplings from the
people that invented them

636
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:41,160
that know what the fuck they're
doing? But I plowed ahead, right?

637
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,850
So we get the oil in the pan and
I just follow the thing. You know,

638
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,280
when they get nice and Golden
Brown, then you pour your water in,

639
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,400
you put the lid on them, you steam them
when the water's gone, they're done.

640
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,720
And, uh, I gotta tell you
they were, they were ugly.

641
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,810
On a scale of one to 10,
they were a strong six,

642
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,040
did not look good to many different
sizes. Even though the ladies on the,

643
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:06,750
on the video show me how to do it. I
still fucked that up. And, um, and then,

644
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,330
you know, I'm the worst. I have
to stop fucking doing this,

645
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,630
cause I always go to Nia. Like, was it
good? How does it taste? Is it good?

646
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,280
In the second she knows I want approval.

647
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,070
Okay.

648
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,820
She turns into fucking Simon Cowl. You're
just saying, oh, you know, they're,

649
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,710
uh, you know, it's like,
and I even said, it looks,

650
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,310
and I know these aren't great for first
attempt. It's, that's pretty good,

651
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:30,010
right? I like, you know, insecure
fucking guy that I am. I need a little,

652
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,910
just give me a little fucking feedback
comedian. That's why I like stand up.

653
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,670
How'd you guys like it? Ha ha ha. We
liked it. Dead silence already. Get it.

654
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,610
All right. How about this one now do
you like me? Do you like me again?

655
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,870
You know, that's how I live my life.
I live moment to fucking moment.

656
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:47,380
Not in a zen way. Just in a
completely insecure way. Right?

657
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,460
So she's not given it up and I go,
so we know what's, what's, what's up.

658
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:54,460
She goes, there's something a, I dunno,

659
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,130
the dough is just not a, you know,

660
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,920
she's clearly just opening them up and
just eating the middle. A lot of them

661
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,100
I go to, to like sticky. She goes, no,

662
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,840
that's not the word.

663
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,390
Um,

664
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,780
and immediately I'm just like, Oh God,
I just want to fucking just, yeah.

665
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,830
Oh, I'm gummy.

666
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Is that the work? Go? Yes. Sticky gummy.

667
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,340
You want a thesaurus? How are
you? Say That fucking word.

668
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,990
So this is what happened is, you know,

669
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,470
I learned from the chef that you
gotta be, you know, tasting your food.

670
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,520
I forgot ever. I used to cook
and I wouldn't be tasting.

671
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,180
So I was tasting them the whole fucking
way. And the chef told me, you know,

672
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,430
by the time it's done,

673
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,620
you're not gonna want any because
you've tasted so much of it.

674
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,160
So I'd already had so many fucking
dumplings the time I got it,

675
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:54,730
like I was almost a little sick and I
fucking hate him and I knew that they

676
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,770
weren't right. But I
definitely had a good time.

677
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,720
I think I would quarter that recipe,

678
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,210
so only I only make like
fucking eight of them.

679
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,450
Then I couldn't have fun and
I could actually like take
my time rather than dude

680
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,660
was like, I swear to God, it was so
perfect that I did it during tax time.

681
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,830
Cause that's what it felt like. You know,

682
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,750
when you get all your
receipts all laid out.

683
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,340
I had all these little balls
of fucking flour, but um,

684
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,330
okay.

685
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,960
Oh Dude, this morning, like
I didn't even clean up.

686
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,780
I went downstairs and I was just like
eight dumplings and I had a fucking

687
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:27,080
scotch. I was doing so well on my
diet and next day I fucking woke up,

688
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,620
look like a starving child or they'd
like a distended belly, you know,

689
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,580
if that starving child
was an alcoholic and I'm

690
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,093
psych fucking,

691
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,510
I came upstairs and just the smell of
that fucking soy sauce and all that,

692
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,720
she'd have to all those dumplings
I fucking ate. And I swear to God,

693
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,300
I actually have a new found
respect for that son of a bitch.

694
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,660
They had all the dump
those dumplings in a,

695
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,530
in Singapore. I don't know what the
fuck that guy stomach is made out of,

696
00:40:57,531 --> 00:41:00,830
but dude, you can't eat
all of that dough. So, um,

697
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,220
then of course eating like dad
kind of threw me off my diet,

698
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,630
went to this fucking great cookout
today and I, I, you know, I ate well,

699
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:12,380
but not well, if you know what I mean.
So who knows, whatever I'm doing well,

700
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm doing well with the Diet. I'm still,
I'm still going in the right direction.

701
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,050
Okay. I've shaved off about eight pounds
off for the fucking Christmas Ham here.

702
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,350
Oh, Billy's going to be able to fit in
his suits in about another five pounds.

703
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:26,090
Get down like one 71 71 that's it.
Then we're trying that suit again.

704
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,690
You know why? Because I'm
not a quitter. Alright?

705
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,700
I hung in there with the dumplings,
but I'm not going to go down to that.

706
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:34,860
I'm not going, I'm not
going to be that guy.

707
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:37,820
I told you guys that I'm not going to
be the guy that goes down to the dry

708
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,830
cleaners and it has his
fucking suits let out.

709
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:45,340
She sitting here with the
fucking shoulders slumped.
All right? And if you're,

710
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,010
if you're in that right now,
if you're doing that right now,

711
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,110
you gotta keep one fucking suit,
okay. That you don't do that to,

712
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,960
and I would make it your favorite fucking
suit. The one you look the best. And

713
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,790
that's it. Again, if you have fat suits,

714
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,790
you literally wearing a fat suit like
fucking Eddie Murphy in the clumps,

715
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,870
except when they say cut, you know, in
the end of the day they can't remove it.

716
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:12,140
What do you, what are you doing? Get
on a fucking treadmill. All right.

717
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,130

need switched to dollar shave club.

razor with the laser pointer every year

729
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,200
they make a tiny change of the rate,

730
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,950
tiny change to the razor and then try
to convince you it's totally new and you

731
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,920
need to spend even more forward and

yeah,

762
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,100
the lovely, neat everybody is my
food here. Oh yeah, it's been here.

763
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,470
It's been here. What did I order again?

764
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,480
A salad with chicken. Cause
you're on a diet. Yes.

765
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,290
Everybody knows I was talking
to you about your, your,

766
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,130
your cold calculated
review of my dumplings.

767
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:07,200
What are you talking about? You know how
you do. Hey Sweetie, what's up buddy?

768
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,520
You just woke up. You that smile.

769
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,800
No. Oh, she's, you know what I'm,

770
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:21,490
I know I'm biased, but we got,
we got one cute ass kid. Just,

771
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,960
yeah, yeah. You're dumb.
You, you, you, you,

772
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,690
you made dumplings.

773
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,650
See, this is what I'm talking
about. It's so cold. Yes. You, uh,

774
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:42,090
you, you, you, you may, dumplings
tried. I mean, you know,

775
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:46,050
you made it. I don't mean
you tried. You did make it.

776
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,410
No, you can't eat this. This is, you
can't, you can't give it up ever.

777
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,860
Okay.

778
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,850
I become hard. This is for you.
Give it up. You know, I, I'm,

779
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,620
I feel like I'm very honest with you
is what it is because I respect you,

780
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,350
so, Ooh, you're going to turn this around.

781
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:10,380
That was a nice little flippy duty
did there, because I respect you.

782
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:14,610
I'm going to be honest with you. If I
didn't respect you, I would just be like,

783
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,410
oh yeah, everything you
do is amazing. Well, wait,

784
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,650
that didn't come out right either.

785
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,280
What I'm trying to say is I think
you put forth a great effort.

786
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,320
I'm just gonna let you keep talking your
way down this fucking well. I'm done.

787
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,490
I'm done. I'm done. Yeah.
Okay. Well, you know what?

788
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:40,150
I realize I respect you
too. What does that mean?

789
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,570
It means I'm going to start
being as honest as you are.

790
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,880
That's what I'm going to do. What is it
exactly that you're upset with me about?

791
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,140
Cause you can't just be like, you know
they're there. All right then a great,

792
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:56,230
that would be perfect. But
you have to be like, um,

793
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,420
there's something with the dough. And
I was just like, is it sticky you? Like

794
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,510
it's not too word.

795
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Oh just let me just put two behind my
ear and I'll move on to the next fucking

796
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:13,370
meal. Then you had to finally
just be like, I'm gummy.

797
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,960
Is that the word? That's
what, and then he said,

798
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,620
or gummy means can we
like blow bubbles with it?

799
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:22,560
And I just couldn't even say
anything because if I said anything,

800
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:27,150
I would start laughing because obviously
I don't mean that you can blow bubbles

801
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,350
with it. I know you just,

802
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,790
you're a, you're a tough, you're a
tough one. You're a tough one. It's,

803
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,320
it's tough to get a compliment out of you.

804
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:40,390
I don't feel like dumplings are also
easy to make. You know what I mean?

805
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:44,650
It was your first try. They looked
amazing. The filling was good.

806
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,270
Just the dope part was dope.
That was do is definitely off.

807
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,890
I think I like overcooked it, I
think, I'm not sure, but I'm not,

808
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:56,650
I'm just saying you have
like, you have this dislike.

809
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:59,510
You just take out the sickle
when it's, when it's coming.

810
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,480
You turn to like an Olympic judge to
be like eager to be like yet. I mean,

811
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,730
not the best, but you know,
you'll get them on the next one.

812
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,420
Give me a little pat on the fucking
head. You're just like, nope,

813
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,100
these are not good. Have a nice evening.

814
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,900
I will see you in the morning. All right.

815
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,790
I'll take this opportunity. You won't.

816
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,160
I've been talking to you about
this for fucking 14 years.

817
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,580
Hey Buddy. Oh, can I
take a bite out of this?

818
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,680
Huh? Why can't you say this age forever?

819
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,970
These be these big, big
ball acute. We carry around.

820
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,440
She's got a mischievous look on her
face. You're going to be toughy tonight.

821
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,750
Like last night. Yeah,

822
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,730
I'll tell you it was a rough one, right?

823
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:57,370
Let me finish this up here so I can go
eat my cold fish or chicken or whatever.

824
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:00,460
I ordered chicken. All right.

825
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,430
No, I'm not in your way off the microwave.

826
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,880
Even annoying the shit out of people for
the last five minutes. Okay. All right.

827
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,650
Hey Nia, that that dress is, I mean,

828
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:19,570
it's a dress. You're, you're
wearing it and I still,

829
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:23,820
I can't even do it to you. You look
great asshole. Get out of here. Alright,

830
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,270
wagon, please read. Please read. Hey,

831
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,330
they are Billy baby white man as
the first kid. One. All right.

832
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,080
I heard the email you read a couple
weeks ago about the older guy who was

833
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:40,081
wondering if it was worth it to lay off
the booze and reconnect with his family.

834
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,840
I can tell you I wasn't
as bad as that guy,

835
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,840
but it made me realize I
could be a better person.

836
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,930
I could boozing two days
after I heard his story,

837
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,600
I called my brother and
I started a dialogue.

838
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:54,370
I should have started eight years ago.

839
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,170
I used to listen to you talk about
booze and think it was an excuse to keep

840
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:02,890
boozing, not placing the blame on
you. I'm a moron. Well, yeah, I mean,

841
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,460
I don't know you, so I wouldn't think
that you were trying to blame me.

842
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,100
I wouldn't accept the blame either. Uh,

843
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,120
but then I realized you don't drink all
day every day and that you have a full

844
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,970
career in a kid, in a wife.

845
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,210
I have a plumbing and
heating job and a terrier.

846
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,270
I still smoke weed because
it helps with my arthritis,

847
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,710
which is actually very severe and
prevents me from doing things.

848
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,900
Just picturing you're jerking off. God
Damn it. I can't, I can't sustain it.

849
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,780
It prevents me from doing things like
running and lifting comfortably. Uh,

850
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,900
the call to my brother
initiated, um, well,

851
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:41,600
I bet taken all that booze out of
your system will probably help out.

852
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:45,080
I don't think Busan is good for
your joints. I said I'll let sugar.

853
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,540
I don't, I don't, I always just repeat
shit that I have listened to. I'm sorry.

854
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,080
The call, my brother initiated
his inviting me to Easter. Nice.

855
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:57,620
The first holiday I would spend with
my family in almost nine years. Thanks.

856
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:01,160
And Go fuck yourself. All right, well I
don't know what you think and me four.

857
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,330
You did it. I don't know that
I said anything. By the way.

858
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,390
I wife was watching Dr Phil and
they had this fucking guy on there.

859
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,020
I, I, it was one of the most fucked
up things I've ever seen on TV.

860
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,140
This guy was basically
going on the Internet.

861
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,190
He was into conspiracy theory and he lost
his job and he went and got into this

862
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:27,210
meditating thing and he said he
had reached this spiritual plane,

863
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,680
um, of constant meditation and nobody,

864
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,900
and he couldn't explain
it to anybody around them,

865
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:37,530
like his wife and doctor Phil is trying
to talk to the guy and he goes and he

866
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:42,330
just kept going like, so what are you
trying, you're, you're meditating,

867
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:45,180
you're on the Internet,
you're meditating. And,

868
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,480
and then the guy just kept taking this
arrogant like line with him going yes.

869
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,670
C One once again. I mean
you'd have to read up.

870
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,500
I mean I can't just explain this to you.

871
00:51:55,501 --> 00:52:00,501
I can send you links on to try to get to
my level basically of higher thinking.

872
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:06,630
And then Dr Phil's like,
don't talk down to me. Okay.

873
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:08,490
First of all, you don't know me.

874
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:13,050
I'm one of the most open minded people
you're ever going to meet. First of all,

875
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,750
who the fuck says that
about themselves? Oh,

876
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:20,040
one of the greatest people I've ever
met. Right? So long story short,

877
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,880
they bring in Deepak Chopra. All right,

878
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,510
another whore of spirituality. You know,

879
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,160
he's a whore of psychology
and this fucking jerk-off
comes in with these fucking

880
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,750
bright red sneakers on it,

881
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:38,751
sits down next to this guy and the guy's
freaking out cause he feels like he's

882
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:40,590
on the same plane as this guy.

883
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:46,490
And then he proceeds to basically
say that this guy is a banding.

884
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,800
His family, he picked his words carefully.

885
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,660
I will say that about a old fucking
Depok d to the mother fucking Chopra.

886
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,180
He basically picked his words carefully,

887
00:52:57,181 --> 00:53:02,181
but in the end he said to Dr Phil
that he feels this guy is bipolar.

888
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:10,130
This fucking poor bastard found out that
he was bipolar on national television.

889
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:15,150
Like, Oh, and the guy fucking sits
there. Excellent. He's helping people.

890
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,630
Basically, you're bipolar.

891
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,660
You're not reaching a higher spiritual
plane as much as you are experiencing a

892
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,670
episode.

893
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,003
Um,

894
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,210
yeah, just doing that Judge Judy Shit
where he's talking all tough to this.

895
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,580
I two, two minutes into it, I was like,

896
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:38,420
this guy needs some serious
psychological help, but I don't,

897
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:43,430
I don't know shit fucking deep
pop coming out making this face.

898
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,650
I'm trying to think who the fuck he looks
like. I don't know what he looks like.

899
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:49,484
Liberace.

900
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,330
Yeah,

901
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,050
whatever. Whatever. Matt Chanel,
what is he? Is He Indian? Is like,

902
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:00,840
if India had a Liberace, this, this,

903
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,430
would they ever do the fucking Michael
Douglas, Matt Damon version of Liberace?

904
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,880
If they do within some Bollywood thing,
you gotta you gotta cast that guy.

905
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,283
Um,

906
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,750
and I love that he was just available
too, for, does he live out in Hollywood?

907
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,990
All right.

908
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,760
Anyways, I have no fucking idea.
I don't know any more. You know,

909
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:24,510
one of my favorite things too is
as my wife is on Instagram and I'm

910
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,810
Instagram a pain in the ass
because if you're not on it,

911
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,380
you can't look at the photos and shit and
I just can't join another social media

912
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:31,681
site.

913
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,970
But one of my favorite fucking things
are those people who take up pictures of

914
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:40,020
themselves and their amazing bodies after
they work out and rather than theirs

915
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,470
and in saying, don't I
look fucking amazing?

916
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,970
They actually act like they're
trying to motivate you, you know,

917
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,880
like reach Hashtag reach your goal.

918
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,860
Okay. Um,

919
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,550
hashtag putting that work in. Um,

920
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,110
I just out of, I think I've just,

921
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,150
I've just become an old man now and
I don't understand younger people.

922
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:13,350
I just don't understand like it did the
level of Douche chills that you would

923
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:17,580
take a picture of yourself while
you're working out, you know,

924
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:22,080
under the guys that you're trying
to motivate people, you know, like,

925
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:26,670
this isn't about me guys. This is
in my eight pack. This is about you.

926
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,450
I'm trying to, I try to inspire
people with my beauty [inaudible]

927
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,443
um,

928
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,880
that's why I don't believe in Christ.
When I just see moments like that,

929
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:41,100
it's just like, what is God waiting for?

930
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:45,480
When are you going to send this dude
back? Like, how bad does it have to get,

931
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,850
you know, in a way, I almost
blamed God at this point.

932
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:49,230
It's like you're enabling us.

933
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,610
How long are you gonna keep letting us
have the intelligence to advent these

934
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:56,220
devices to further disappear
up our own assholes?

935
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,880
As I sit in a podcast talking
to myself for a fucking hour.

936
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,170
Oh, Jesus. I swear to God every time
if they can make an appointment,

937
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,200
I just realize what a fucking
hypocrite I am. All right.

938
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,170
Little girl statue in Syria.

939
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:11,880
Okay.

940
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,740
Okay. This sounds like clickbait.

941
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,090
You know when you see little
girl finds a statue in Syria,

942
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,120
what she does next will shock you and
then you click on it and there's one photo

943
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:30,370
and 87 ads. Fuck all of those sites. Um,

944
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,950
alright bill for days people flooded
Facebook and praise of the little girl

945
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:39,220
statue they placed in front of
the Wall Street bull. Everybody,

946
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:44,250
mostly women and social justice
warriors went on about resisting and how

947
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:50,050
powerful the statute
was. I choose to fight.

948
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,300
Um, it turns out the little girl statue
was put up by a media slash marketing

949
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:59,620
company that has zero interest in
doing anything but creating a buzz for

950
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:03,490
themselves. Um, that's not,

951
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,820
that's not all the bullets itself was a
piece of art erected by an independent

952
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,330
artists. It was panned by Wall
Street and they wanted it removed.

953
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:18,400
The people kept it there. Everyone
is a sucker. Uh, whatever that means.

954
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:23,830
Kao And why 2012 I cited a source
below unless the rest of the twats on

955
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:31,390
Facebook. Thank you. Skip some words
there. Sorry for the stomach growling.

956
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm also that white hat document mentoree
that went everywhere about the group

957
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:41,290
of volunteers that came to the aid of
Syrian chemical weapons victims was part

958
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,220
of a huge agenda to make America
mad at the Syrian regime.

959
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,880
International reporters are questioning
the source of those weapons.

960
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,830
Some think it was even, it wasn't even
the Syrian government were all fucked.

961
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,630
Love. You love the congrats
on the little lady. Um,

962
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:03,990
yeah, I believe all that type of
shit. I believe that type of shit. Um,

963
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,520
I don't know about any
of that type of stuff,

964
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:06,590
but I definitely believe that they,

965
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,140
they show images to make us fucking
upset about stuff. You know?

966
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,800
Um, seems very easy to
defeat terrorism. To me,

967
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,920
all you do is just embrace the electric
cars. Just make everything electric.

968
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:21,410
We stopped buying oil from those
guys. They don't have any money.

969
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:23,630
They go bankrupt and next thing you know,

970
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:26,780
they can't afford anything
but rocks were not over there.

971
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,370
They gradually forget about us.

972
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:31,820
They go back to arguing with one
another and we just slowly back away.

973
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,870
Why don't we just do that? You know
why? Because there's no money in that.

974
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,530
That's what I think, but
what do I know? All right.

975
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:43,250
Terrified of a threesome. Can I,

976
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,280
can I click on this link up here? What
is this link? This person sent me?

977
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,770
I don't know why. Oh, I know
why. Cause I don't have it.

978
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,780
I got to click on it when it's in the
email. What's in the when it's an email.

979
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,190
Now, how do I find where the fucking
email is? Live reads, boom. I go to that.

980
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,800
Click on Inbox, retrace all my steps.

981
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,560
Go to the contents, scroll down,

982
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,430
click on the link. Wait for it to open.

983
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,500
It is now trying to load. All right,
I'll get back to that in a minute.

984
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,760
In the meantime, terrified of
a threesome. Hey parentheses,

985
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,180

here. Huge Fan love you.

986
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:24,860
Stand up andF is for family. Thank you.

987
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,510
I'm 20 I'm a 21 year old college student
who has a girlfriend that is bisexual

988
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:33,140
and beautiful as well. God bless you.

989
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:35,510
Woo.

990
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,270
God bless you sir. God bless you.

991
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,990
There's no way you don't believe
in God, man. God bless you.

992
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,370
We've talked about asking girls to join
us in bed and are finally getting ready

993
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:47,330
to have it happen.

994
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:52,760
The girl that's joining us is a girl that
the both of us have gotten with in the

995
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:57,200
past at different times.
Ah, it's just perfect.

996
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,860
The only problem is that I get freaked
the fuck out when I think about this

997
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:04,560
happening. Both of the women
involved are hot and experienced,

998
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,020
which is what scares me.

999
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,270
I'm not that astounding looking of
a guy, not that well endowed doubt.

1000
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:14,770
As far as my dick goes and not experienced
it all could be you going to talk to

1001
01:00:14,771 --> 01:00:18,770
yourself on to this dude
and not experienced it all
compared to these girls.

1002
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,680
How do I get past my fears
and relaxed enough to make,

1003
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:26,600
to be into what's happening and make
sure I make it worthwhile for both these

1004
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:30,950
ladies. Thanks. And Go
fuck yourself. Uh, dude.

1005
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,710
Okay.

1006
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,650
Do not fuck this up. Okay.

1007
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,320
The only way you can fuck
this up is to not show up.

1008
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:42,610
To show up and let nature take over.
Okay. It's all right to be freaked out.

1009
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,280
You're 21 years old. You've got
two fucking smoking hot chicks,

1010
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,240
one of fucking bang at the same time.
That's a lot. That's Rockstar Shit.

1011
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,430
I don't know what you do for a living,

1012
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:55,510
but I'm guessing you're not a fucking
rock star. So, yeah, this is a, this is,

1013
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,040
this is fucking great. This is a
great God damn thing. Um, you know,

1014
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:02,200
and if you want to, I'd just tell
you girlfriend, just be like, yeah,

1015
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,540
I'm excited. Animal. I'm, I've gotta
be launched. I'm a little nervous.

1016
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,540
You guys are both so, but just keep
paying about, cause it's so beautiful now.

1017
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,860
Things should be, don't wear your lax.
Just follow my lead. Just do that.

1018
01:01:11,861 --> 01:01:13,900
Just be open and honest about it.

1019
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,390
But don't take it to the
fucking point that you like.

1020
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,390
Don't say all that other shit. You
know, I'm not vegetable. Good guy.

1021
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,910
I could have had a bigger dick
than she's going to think,

1022
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:26,020
well what the fuck am I doing this with
you for? Don't go that far. All right.

1023
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,530
Here's the thing, dude. You
definitely good looking enough.

1024
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,590
You definitely got a big enough dick.
Oh, none of this shit would be happening.

1025
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,170
Right? Okay. You got
called up to the show.

1026
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:39,550
Okay.

1027
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,060
Okay. Can you get up to the plate
and swing out of your fucking cleats?

1028
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,840
I would let them start. Let them start.
And then you just kind of fucking,

1029
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:50,470
you know, work your way up. That's all.

1030
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,660
Just start making out with both of
them. That's it. Get some fucking,

1031
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:58,440
I don't know. I don't just,
just please, please do,

1032
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:04,650
please for the someday 48 year old
you who probably be doing a podcast by

1033
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,410
himself. Okay? Please
don't fuck this up. Okay?

1034
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:12,100
Don't do not talk yourself out of
this. You getting in your fucking head.

1035
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,130
All right? You've already
gotten with both of them.

1036
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,000
She obviously likes you dick.
She's coming back from war.

1037
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,350
You go friends still there. This is
just like, this is something else, dude.

1038
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,850
And this is a great experience for you
to push past all that fucking low self

1039
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:30,600
esteem. All right, so man, the
fuck up. Have a great time.

1040
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,950
Follow up email please. Alright.
My girl loves me too much. Aw.

1041
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,810
But I can't love myself at all.
All right. Hey Billy Moose knuckle.

1042
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,620
I always forget what that is.
I know what a camel toe is.

1043
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:45,840
I don't know what a moose knuckle is. A,

1044
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:49,800
I'm a 22 is that a Canadian
cameltoe I don't know.

1045
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,030
I'm a 22 year old college student and
I've been with my girlfriend for about a

1046
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,440
year now. Things have been great.

1047
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,760
Only problem is that she's got the
tendency to tell me, I love you,

1048
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,470
or you're so important to me,

1049
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:05,850
or I adore you at least 15 times a
day without any lead up. Oh yeah,

1050
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,860
that's creepy. She just does
it out of the blue. I guess.

1051
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:11,880
It's nice to hear,

1052
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:15,780
but after a point it makes me wonder
if she has some underlying issue.

1053
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,450
I'm the first boyfriend and she still
shocked even after dating for a year that

1054
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:25,050
someone finds her attractive.
Sorry. Hiccups are coming.

1055
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,190
I'm on top of all this. She gets
weird and passive aggressive.

1056
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:32,340
When I suggest I have a night
to myself saying things like,

1057
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,090
I guess I'll stay home alone or I'll
just eat leftover soup and watch the food

1058
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:39,750
network. This shit kills me and
I usually cave and come over.

1059
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,430
I'm an introverted heart and need my time
alone to recharge and study or read my

1060
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:47,220
favorite books when we're
together. We mostly watch movies,

1061
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:49,830
talk about school or fuck, which is fine,

1062
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,720
but I need to be alone once in a while.

1063
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,360
I have too much empathy
and I'm a pushover,

1064
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:58,170
which doesn't help anything and it
doesn't help anything. I need some advice.

1065
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,350
Do you think she has an attachment
problem or is it something else?

1066
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:04,140
Thanks and go fuck yourself. I
would just work on your end of it.

1067
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,670
Whatever her issue is. It might come
to a head when you just say, listen,

1068
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:12,060
I just need alone time sometimes you know,

1069
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,510
and let her pout and do whatever the fuck
she wants to do and eventually she'll

1070
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,890
accept that about you.

1071
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,840
Or she'll tell you why she's too insecure
to not spend the night and you know,

1072
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,900
spend a night alone or she'll flip
the fuck out and you'll be like,

1073
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:30,090
wow, I'm not with the right
person, but I can tell you this,

1074
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,150
I'm not doing what you want to do in
a relationship is the quickest way to

1075
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:37,290
poison the water. Okay.

1076
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:40,530
And I don't mean just going
out and fucking around and
doing all shit like that.

1077
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:44,310
But I mean like, you know, if
you don't like going to Brunch,

1078
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:46,650
you have to tell him you don't
like going to brunch now.

1079
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:48,240
You still have to go to some brunches,

1080
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:51,210
but you're not going to be going
to them all the time. All right?

1081
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,560
To not tell her that you're an introvert
at heart and you need your time alone

1082
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,400
to recharge and study and all that
type of shit. Read your favorite books.

1083
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:00,803
You know,

1084
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,430
she has to respect that about you and
you gotta respect that about you. Okay.

1085
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:09,840
Stop giving into what the
fuck she wants. Um, what you,

1086
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:14,670
you having a night alone every once
in awhile is not a crazy request.

1087
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,750
Okay. And um, I would do that
first and see how she reacts.

1088
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,960
And you might get to the
bottom of why she has to say,

1089
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:27,250
I love you and I adore you and all of
that shit 50 times a fucking day probably.

1090
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,430
Cause you're, she's probably terrified
that it's not going to end well.

1091
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,160
You know, she's, if she's
never had another boyfriend,

1092
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:37,060
I'm guessing she's around your age.
Maybe that gave her some sort of complex,

1093
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,730
I don't fucking know. This
is some few guys to work out,

1094
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,620
but I gotta tell you this right
now. If you need a long time,

1095
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:44,830
you gotta tell her that or else you're
going to end up presenting her and the

1096
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:48,280
whole relationship is going to gradually
start. It's fucking downward spiral.

1097
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:53,180
And, um, that's it. And it crashes and
Burns, right. And fucking corn field.

1098
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,780
Okay. That's it. That's the
podcast, uh, for this week. Um,

1099
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,460
is that everything that I wanted to talk
about, I got Boise, Idaho coming up,

1100
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,130
uh, this weekend. Yes.

1101
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:11,131
Next weekend I'll be out there with
Rosebowl tailgate legend and puck off host

1102
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:15,720
all things, comedy network
podcasts, or, uh, Joe part. Nick.

1103
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,970
We're going to have a great time
when were up there. Um, that is all.

1104
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,750
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
