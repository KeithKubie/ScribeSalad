00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
We're now in the home stretch. We just need to evaluate

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
this third surface integral, which is over in this top part

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
of our little chopped cylinder over here. So let's try to think

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
of a paramaterization- and let me just copy and paste this entire

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
drawing, just so that I can use it down below

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
as I parameterize it. So let me copy it, copy...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
...and then go all the way down here, and let me paste it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
Okay, that is our shape again, our surface,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
and then we go to the layer that I want to get on

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
and then let me start. Let me start evaluating it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
So what we want to care about is the integral over surface three

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
of z, ds.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
In surface 3 here, we see that the x and y values essentially

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
take on all the x and y values inside of the unit circle,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
including the boundary,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
and that the z values are going to be a function of the x values.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
We know that this plane, that this top surface right over here, s3,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
is a subset of the plane z, z is equal to 1-x.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
It's a subset that's kind of above the unit circle in the x-y plane.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
or kind of the subset that intersects with our cylinder

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
and kind of chops it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
So let's think about x and y first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
So first, so x- let's think about it in terms of polar coordinates

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
because that's probably the easiest way to think about it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
I'm going to re-draw kind of a top view,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
so I'm going to re-draw top view so that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
that is my y-axis,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
and this is my x-axis,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
and the x's and y's can take on any value.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
They essentially have to fill the unit circle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
So if you, if you were to kind of project

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
this top surface down onto the x-y plane,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
you would get this Rn surface, that bottom surface,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
which looked like this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
It was essentially the unit circle,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
just like that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
I'm going to draw it a little bit neater than that,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
I can do a better job, so that'll be...all right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
So let me draw the unit circle as neatly as I can,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
so there's my unit circle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
And so we can have one parameter

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
that essentially says how far around

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
the unit circle we're going,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
so essentially that would be our angle,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
and let's use theta,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
because that's, what, just for fun,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
because we haven't used theta

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
as our parameter yet.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
That's theta, but if we had x's or y's,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
it's just a function of theta and we had a fixed radius,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
that would essentially just give us the points

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
on the outside of the unit circle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
But we need to be able to have all of the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
x-y's that are on the outside AND the inside of the unit circle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
So we actually have to have 2 parameters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
We need to not only vary this angle,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
but we also need to vary the radius.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
So we would want to trace out the outside of that unit circle,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
and maybe we would want to shorten it at little bit,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
and then trace it out again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
And then shorten it some more, and then trace it out again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
And so you want to actually have a variable radius as well,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
and so you could have how far out you're going.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
You could call that r.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, for example, if r is fixed

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
And you change the ranges of theta

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
then you would essentially get all of those points

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
right over there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
You would do that for all of the r's,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
and from r to zero, all the way to r1,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
and you would essentially fill up the entire unit circle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
And so let's do that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
So r is going to go between 0 and 1,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
r is going to go between 0 and 1,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
and our theta is going to all the way around.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
So our theta is going to go between 0 and 2π.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
This is- let me write this down;

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
I wrote 0 instead of theta.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Our theta is going to be greater than or equal to 0,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
less than or equal to 2π,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
and now we're ready to parameterize it.
