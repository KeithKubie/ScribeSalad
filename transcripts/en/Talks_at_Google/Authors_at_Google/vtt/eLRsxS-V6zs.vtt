[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.030
HENRY FAULKNER: We are going
to welcome now to the stage.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.990
I feel like this is
like a Lakers game.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.010
You guys are going to
run down the gauntlet,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.530
but let's do it maybe, if
we're going to do it that way,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.520
in order.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.395
Of course, let's bring
up first Frank Miller.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:19.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:28.678
The creator of "The
Dark Knight Returns."

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.303
We're going to go in
a different order.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:31.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.840
Tony Patrick, who has just
done "Batman and the Signal."

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.660
We've got Sean Murphy, who has--

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.450
Just dropped "Batman,
White Knight."

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.820
Frank Miller, the creator
of "Dark Knight Returns."

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.760
Tom King, the current
writer of "Batman."

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.072
And James Tynion IV, the current
writer of "Detective Comics."

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:03.724
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:04.590
All of you, welcome.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.010
Thank you for coming out.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.950
We are super, super excited.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000
So I'm going to jump out
and throw some questions

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.660
out that are for all of you.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.110
Batman is one of
the most well-known,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
well-loved characters in
the world across literature.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.580
And yet, dark, brooding,
tortured, broken, quixotic,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.530
ridiculously wealthy,
basically unrelatable

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.800
in almost every
aspect, how do you

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.732
account for this popularity
of the character?

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.690
FRANK MILLER: I thought
he was a bundle of joy.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.869
HENRY FAULKNER: To write, maybe.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.910
FRANK MILLER: Hey, look,
he's having a good time.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.510
Maybe the crooks
aren't, but he's--

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.980
all right.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.234
He ain't so gloomy.

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:54.150
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.200
FRANK MILLER: He come from
a very dark beginning,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.470
but you don't keep
doing something for that

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.546
long because you're depressed.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.380
HENRY FAULKNER: OK.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.050
TOM KING: So it's just me that
keeps doing the depressing?

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.760
I get it.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.228
FRANK MILLER: No.

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:14.260
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
TOM KING: I'd say
what I relate to is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
he's sort of a machine for
turning pain into hope.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.810
His superpower, the
one power he has

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.767
to stand next to
Batman and Wonder Woman

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.100
is that his parents were killed.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.400
Like, that's an odd
superpower to have.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.460
But what makes him
powerful is that the worst

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.855
moment in his life, he turns
that moment into strength.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.690
And I think a lot of people,
when they look at their lives,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.100
they sort of come to realize
that the pain and the worst

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.280
parts of you become like the
greatest parts of you, that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.470
become sort of what you
rely on in the bad moments.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.559
It's like I've been
through something.

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.100
I've been through
something horrible.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.140
Now, I can handle the
horrible that's coming at me.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.540
FRANK MILLER: Like
Friedrich Nietzsche.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.165
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:55.279
Like Friedrich Nietzsche.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.070
HENRY FAULKNER: OK.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.736
TOM KING: Batman has looked into
the abyss as we all have, and--

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:02.010
JAMES TYNION IV: And
the abyss was afraid.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.260
It's the one time
that's happened.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.650
HENRY FAULKNER: And
so that's all right.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.287
That's a take I had
not seen on that.

00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:12.120
TOM KING: Nailed it.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.360
HENRY FAULKNER: In terms of--

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.150
all right-- a happy and
hopeful Batman, some of that

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.880
seems to revolve
around the family.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.120
And each of you has taken
a different approach

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.230
to giving Batman
a family of sorts.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.560
How have you come at that?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.190
What does a successful
Bat family look like?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.780
FRANK MILLER: Lots and
lots of pointy ears.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.440
And lots of Robins,
bags of Robins.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.150
Short shorts.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.160
One Carmine Infantino cover
that I've always wanted to see

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.390
but never existed
was to have Batman

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.300
on a Batphone in a Batcave
sitting next to the Batmobile,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.330
talking to the Batphone
saying, oh, commissioner, this

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.210
is a tough job.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.530
This may cost me
six, seven Robins.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.607
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:13.940
Once they started killing
one, then they killed another,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.220
around here, it's open season.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.847
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:20.180
HENRY FAULKNER: We don't even
bother with the 900 number

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.121
anymore.

00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:24.120
JAMES TYNION IV: Oh god.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.080
I mean, I think
one of the things,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.450
his family is into the
entire concept of Batman.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.170
Bruce lost family, and is that's
the sort of the founding trauma

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.700
that led him on this path.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.900
So that story ultimately
goes to building family.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.790
That's really the only way
out of where he started.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.680
And it's everything
that you lose when you

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.180
experience that kind of trauma.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.814
He can't find through
himself necessarily anymore,

00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:05.730
but he can find it through
these other people,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.110
these other sources
of light around him.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.400
I mean, that's been sort of
one of the driving principles.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.540
My "Detective Comics" run
is sort of Batman team book.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.790
Now, there are a
million people who

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.980
have been sidekicks to
Batman at different points,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.290
and I just brought a
bunch of my favorites

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.430
and stuck them in one book.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.100
Each one sort of taps into a
different core aspect of Bruce

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.220
that allows him to kind of
approach the light again,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.850
and that's why you get the
incredible bright-colored

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.710
costumes and all
of that compared

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.600
to the blacks and greys.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.450
HENRY FAULKNER: Interesting.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.090
Well, on that note, now the
Robins, or the new protegees,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.790
keep increasing.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.670
We have the Signal.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.296
FRANK MILLER: There's a lot
of people with guns out there.

00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:06.170
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.961
Well, that also explains
the bright colors.

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.070
FRANK MILLER: You need
a good stock of Robins.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.310
HENRY FAULKNER: Brightly-colored
Robins and plenty of them.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.770
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.330
I mean, the Batmobile
is permanently

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.270
parked outside the orphanage.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.948
HENRY FAULKNER: Kids
love cars, it's true.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.280
Getting back to
the newest protege,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.770
so we have the Signal who is
joining this pedigree of sort

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.194
of bat-like heroes.

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:41.360
FRANK MILLER: Cannon fodder.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.610
HENRY FAULKNER: Cannon fodder?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.590
FRANK MILLER: Yes.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.000
HENRY FAULKNER: We hope.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.150
FRANK MILLER: He's
on number three.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.970
HENRY FAULKNER: Let's give
him a little time first.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.303
What makes the Signal different?

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:51.440
TONY PATRICK: I mean, this is
a conversation Scott and I had

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.830
originally, which
was, what's going

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.660
to be the distinction
between Duke Thomas,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:04.170
let's say, and a Dick Grayson,
or Kate, who's Batwoman?

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.230
And I think there's an
opportunity with Duke

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.736
since he is, we can say,
a potential metahuman.

00:07:09.736 --> 00:07:11.360
We'll just say
potential at the moment.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.800
But since he has these
burgeoning powers, it's kind

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.630
of the first time
Batman has a chance

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.210
to kind of get in early on the
ground floor on a new hero.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.610
And I think to kind
of go back here, I

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.910
think because of the
loss of so many Robins,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.580
I think Batman
has an opportunity

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.770
to do it differently
this time and maybe

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.470
discovers he needs the
Robins that he already has--

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.192
hopefully intact--
but Duke Thomas is--

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:45.400
FRANK MILLER: But what the
heck if they aren't, yeah.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:47.960
TONY PATRICK: I mean,
you can only have what,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.670
five or 10 disposable
Robins at a time?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.390
I'm not sure.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.720
But I think Duke Thomas
is an opportunity,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.560
and the Signal in
particular is for Batman

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.550
to operate in a different
kind of mentorship role.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:08.191
It's almost like if
Batman had met Superman--

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:10.190
I'm sorry, now I feel
like I'm in middle school,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.600
like Batman and Superman.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.890
This is what we do all day.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.540
HENRY FAULKNER: Oh,
we're going there.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.470
TONY PATRICK: This is
what we do all day.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:14.825
TOM KING: We're
in the right room.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.033
TONY PATRICK: I know, I know.

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:20.060
But it's almost like
the ground-floor element

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:28.970
of maybe even preventing
another future Rogues Gallery

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.409
from emerging, another
set of metahuman

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.700
who will destroy Gotham.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.960
If he can mentor
Duke in a way, under

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.380
his particular
philosophy, perhaps we'll

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.339
see a different Gotham.

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:44.588
HENRY FAULKNER: Here's hoping.

00:08:44.588 --> 00:08:46.520
But the Robins that don't
die keep turning out

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.292
to be very evil, so--

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:49.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.240
TONY PATRICK: Absolutely.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.620
Go Jason Todd.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.170
FRANK MILLER:
Jerry is just fine.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.100
HENRY FAULKNER: In terms of
the you mentioned the darkness,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.950
that Batman's
ultimately happy, it

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.380
sort of brings into question,
though, this opposite.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:19.190
75 years of Batman is also
75 years of the Joker.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.950
And, Sean, your book
just dropped yesterday.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.840
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.131
HENRY FAULKNER: "White Knight."

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.650
So we see a not only
rehabilitated Joker,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.030
but a sane and heroic,
inspiring heroic Joker.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.920
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.610
HENRY FAULKNER: And
potentially a more

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.240
insane or perceived
insane Batman.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.990
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.650
Like if you took
away the insanity,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.430
then he can be a true genius,
a true Machiavellian enemy.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.695
And he'd be even worse because
his craziness or his imbalance

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:48.600
has handicapped him.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.650
If you took that away, now
he's like a smooth Don Draper.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.170
He gets his record expunged.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.230
He shows it to the cops, just
fudged all the paperwork.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.240
In my version of
Gotham, Joker, it's

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.955
never proven that he ever
did anything super bad.

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:06.580
It's a big ask.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.788
FRANK MILLER: Oh, that cotton
candy was really nasty.

00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:13.910
SEAN MURPHY: But yeah, that's
kind of where I went with mine.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.380
It's like, how do you do
anything new with the Joker

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.890
anymore?

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.670
I know a few writers have
tackled a cured Joker before,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.860
but I really wanted
to see it done,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.929
to really follow that all the
way down the road, you know?

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:27.845
HENRY FAULKNER: So you're
saying that within--

00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:32.390
if Frank, if I'm hearing,
within Batman's brooding,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.790
vigilante violence is an actual
happiness and a hopefulness--

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.300
and you're saying that
within the really psychotic--

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.340
SEAN MURPHY: There's a sane man.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.490
HENRY FAULKNER: Not just
a sane man, but a very

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.769
in control and respectable.

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:50.560
SEAN MURPHY: Right.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.700
Yeah.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.910
I mean, even though we'd all
love to toss the Joker out

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.355
of Gotham, as soon
as he's cured,

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:59.620
he starts creating these
amazing arguments about why

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.230
Batman is causing the problem.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.120
We know a lot about
sociology now.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.200
White crime exists.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.780
And we know that punching
back doesn't make sense.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.104
Like in the '40s, that
comic mostly made sense.

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:12.520
But we know now
that doesn't work.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.720
So what would Gotham be
if it was a real city?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.030
JAMES TYNION IV: So I guess
we should retire the police

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.060
department altogether?

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.980
HENRY FAULKNER: This
is a great question.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.000
SEAN MURPHY: That's issue 3.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.670
HENRY FAULKNER: As we've come
to know more sociologically,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.559
psychologically,
what challenge does

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:27.850
that create for you as writers?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.308
FRANK MILLER: Excuse
me, excuse me.

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:33.490
You're mistaking whatever
the current trend in thought

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.530
is for knowing more.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.742
Sometimes people are
wrong for millennia.

00:11:38.742 --> 00:11:40.450
You know, during the
Spanish Inquisition,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.325
they thought they were
doing the right thing.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.880
HENRY FAULKNER: Your
take is that Batman--

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.530
we can't stay the
course, he stays.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.697
He will keep throwing fists.

00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:54.571
FRANK MILLER: Oh, no.

00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:56.770
I was just talking in
response to what he said.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.220
But no, in terms of
what Batman is, is he's

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.260
just a wonderful,
very versatile myth.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.084
He can be anything from
Deathwish to Robin Hood.

00:12:07.084 --> 00:12:08.490
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.865
TOM KING: But what
you're saying,

00:12:09.865 --> 00:12:11.862
the interesting part
is that yeah, he's a--

00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:15.490
I mean, people ask, could
Batman do better for the world

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.340
and be less guilt if he
just was a billionaire

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.610
and turned it all into charity?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.960
I mean, he probably
could save more people

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.540
as a scientist discovering
cures than he could ever

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.470
save punching--

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.220
FRANK MILLER: Well,
two things about that.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.784
One is he wouldn't do
that because he's--

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.200
TOM KING: I thought
he was a myth.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.533
We can do what we want with him.

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:35.033
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:36.449
FRANK MILLER:
Second is that would

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:37.620
make for one rotten comic.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.370
TOM KING: Oh, see.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.900
That's the one.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.580
It's the second one
that really clicks.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.371
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:45.580
SEAN MURPHY: I think Batman
fixes the educational system,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.080
I don't think I'd
want to draw that.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.757
FRANK MILLER: They tried
that during the late '70s.

00:12:52.757 --> 00:12:53.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.270
FRANK MILLER: They called
it social relevance.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.756
TONY PATRICK: Interesting.

00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:59.380
HENRY FAULKNER: Well,
of all the things

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.210
he could be, there are certain
things that he has to be.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.280
He has to be the World's
Greatest Detective.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.500
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.490
HENRY FAULKNER: How
hard is it to write--

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.360
FRANK MILLER: I think
more than that, he's

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.040
got to be the smartest
guy in the room

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.159
under any circumstances.

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.950
HENRY FAULKNER: But
that means that you all

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.469
have to be the smartest
people in the room.

00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:16.510
SEAN MURPHY: And we are,
especially in this room.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.427
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.427 --> 00:13:19.260
HENRY FAULKNER: Wow.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:19.710
SEAN MURPHY: Google slam.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.626
TOM KING: Google slam.

00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:22.450
TONY PATRICK: Throw
down the gauntlet.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.418
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:26.482 --> 00:13:29.800
HENRY FAULKNER: But really,
is there a challenge in it's

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.440
got to be foolproof, it's got
to be the World's Greatest

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.557
Detective-level
story all the time?

00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:36.640
TOM KING: No, because you
are the smartest person,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.440
but you're also the
stupidest person in the room.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.648
You're everybody in the room.

00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:40.702
You're unity.

00:13:40.702 --> 00:13:42.160
You're the collective
consciousness

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.430
of this entire comic book.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.888
FRANK MILLER: Also, he's a rich
and broad-enough character,

00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:48.700
so he can perform
different functions.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.540
He's also part terrorist
in that they strike terror

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.616
into the hearts of criminals.

00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:57.640
His first night out
in "Dark Knight"

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.330
is a rampage of terror to
make all the criminals scared.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.220
And it continues
through the series.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.230
And he dresses up
like a giant bat.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.120
This guy isn't around
to reassure anybody.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.120
HENRY FAULKNER: What would
you say for each of you,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.860
what is your fingerprint
on the character?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.595
What is the thing you say,
like, I gave Batman that?

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.582
SEAN MURPHY: I gave them a
really high collar like--

00:14:27.582 --> 00:14:29.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.295
Dracula.

00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:32.420
I have this Batmobile, the
exhaust is on the front,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.740
so it's always shooting flames.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.525
And I made Arkham look
like Transylvania Castle.

00:14:38.525 --> 00:14:41.270
So Batman's become
like the devil

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.300
in the city, sort of
a storytelling line.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.430
I mean, because I draw,
people can actually

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.470
see the hard work I do.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.921
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.472 --> 00:14:54.680
TOM KING: Surrounded by
artists, I'm in trouble here.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.430
SEAN MURPHY: Oh wait, no.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.596
I'm with Frank on this, too.

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:58.130
I forgot that you draw.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.005
TOM KING: You forgot
that Frank Miller draws?

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:01.287
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.287 --> 00:15:04.300
Smartest guy in
the room, indeed.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.052
HENRY FAULKNER: We have
some books we can give you.

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:08.510
TOM KING: What did
I add to Batman?

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.337
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:15:10.337 --> 00:15:12.170
TOM KING: Batman's been
around for 78 years.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.934
He's been written
in every medium.

00:15:15.934 --> 00:15:18.350
A guy named Frank Miller wrote
the best Batman story ever,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.690
and you can't write
better than that.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.192
SEAN MURPHY: Did
he draw that, too?

00:15:21.192 --> 00:15:22.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:24.680
TOM KING: Yeah, but the
collars are really low,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.957
so you wouldn't like it.

00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:27.290
HENRY FAULKNER: Very short ears.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.289
SEAN MURPHY: So second-smartest
guy in the room.

00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:33.502
TOM KING: So the only thing, you
can't add new ideas to Batman.

00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:34.710
What you can add is yourself.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.849
You put yourself into
Batman because that's

00:15:36.849 --> 00:15:38.390
the only thing
original you can bring

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.970
is sort of your own
consciousness and experience

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.310
or whatever.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.810
Yeah.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.180
So what I added to
Batman, I don't know.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.930
He's a little more emo.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.145
He stares out windows sadly.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.220
I think added to Batman, or what
I'm trying to add to Batman,

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.150
is happiness and him
trying to be happy.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.350
I mean, I can't make Batman
darker than you made him.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.930
And I can't make him
more of a family man

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.810
than you made him, James, or as
high collared as you made him.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.970
That's the one
place I think we can

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.500
go with Batman that will
create a lot of conflict

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.291
is giving him a little
happiness and seeing

00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:16.047
how that mixes with his bitter.

00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:17.130
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.520
SEAN MURPHY: What about you?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.520
What did you do as
your fingerprint?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.530
TONY PATRICK: I'm working on it.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.640
Book's not out yet.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.830
But a little bit more sunlight.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.130
Since I'm dealing
with daytime Gotham,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.850
I'm giving him a little bit more
Bruce Wayne, a little bit more

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.540
R&amp;R during the daytime,
maybe about 15 minutes.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.082
Coffee breaks, yeah.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.040
SEAN MURPHY: All right.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.490
James?

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.406
FRANK MILLER: My turn?

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:42.000
My turn?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.500
OK.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:52.300
Frederic Wertham, when he wrote
"Seduction of the Innocent,"

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.500
proved that comic books were the
source of all juvenile crime.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.650
He claimed that Batman and
Robin had the perfect homosexual

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.650
relationship.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.755
I made Robin a girl, so there.

00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:09.838
HENRY FAULKNER: Well done.

00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:13.261
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.290
JAMES TYNION IV: Well,
I mean, honestly, I

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:27.980
don't feel like I have put my
fingerprint on Batman himself.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.770
I've been focused much
more on his relationship

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.840
with existing
characters, ones that

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.630
have been playing into the
mythos throughout its history,

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:47.690
and I've tried to sort of hit
iconic moments between him

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.910
and each of the characters that
sum up their dynamics in each

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.730
of those ways.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:18:00.715
And I've been trying to
create a Bruce that says yes.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.090
Like, when they would introduce
a new character coming up

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.220
and a new young
vigilante in Gotham,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.900
there are so many
stories of Batman

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.020
just saying no
Batman just trying

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.510
to shut them down out the gate.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.560
And this is the Batman
who I think is more--

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.720
the idea that Batman
is a loner when

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.360
Robin showed up just a few years
into the creation of Batman.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.520
Batman has been about
family for the whole time.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.980
So the idea of him, how
do we make this work?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.290
How do I bring these people?

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:43.460
How do I create something
bigger, and can it work?

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.310
And is it actually a good
thing, to actually say yes

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.980
to all of these young people
at the same time who are trying

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.907
to work out their issues?

00:18:50.907 --> 00:18:52.490
FRANK MILLER: I say
bring them all in.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.120
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.260
FRANK MILLER: Like 30 Robins.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.830
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.090
I mean, that's
basically "Detective."

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.923
FRANK MILLER: We've got
a major bank robbery

00:18:57.923 --> 00:18:59.260
with machine guns being used.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.680
Send me 10 Robins over there.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.930
I'm too busy over here.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.390
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.515
FRANK MILLER: You know,
one's bound to get through.

00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:05.432
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:07.765
HENRY FAULKNER: Basically
taking the approach of the 300

00:19:07.765 --> 00:19:09.230
and just applying it--

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.356
TONY PATRICK: To Robin.

00:19:10.356 --> 00:19:11.550
HENRY FAULKNER: I like it.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.680
FRANK MILLER: Cannon fodder.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.044
300 naked Robins.

00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:17.960
TOM KING: There we go.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.209
HENRY FAULKNER: It would sell.

00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:21.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.980
There's a market for everything.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.674
You talked about putting
yourself into the character.

00:19:28.674 --> 00:19:32.610
Tom, your background
is in the CIA.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.455
So how has that
influenced your creation?

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.330
TOM KING: I mean, it
influences everything I write.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.610
I mean, that's how
I spent my 20s.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.337
If I was to write
about my current life,

00:19:45.337 --> 00:19:47.420
I'd just be writing about
a guy who writes Batman.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.484
And Grant Morrison
already did that.

00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:51.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.310
So yeah.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.630
That sort of experience of
having seen people really

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.630
be brave and having seen
people really be afraid

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.870
and having been both
of those people,

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.039
I can't talk about directly
because it's all I'll

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:04.580
get arrested.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.140
HENRY FAULKNER: Classified?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.765
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:07.760
HENRY FAULKNER: We get that.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.468
TOM KING: I don't want
to do the secrets,

00:20:09.468 --> 00:20:10.790
but also the arresting is big.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.780
So I put the emotions
in it, and I sort of

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.250
draw from that experience.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.370
I mean, my standard
line is it helps

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.650
writing about getting shot
at if you've been shot at.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.640
But I think that's kind of BS.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.750
I probably just say that.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.560
It doesn't help at all.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.018
HENRY FAULKNER: It
does sound cool.

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:27.530
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.090
It stinks you can't
write realistic.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.130
Like, Batman's famous thing--

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.840
Frank, you did this
better than anyone--

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.298
when he's interrogating
someone, is

00:20:34.298 --> 00:20:36.680
to dangle them off
a building and then

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.511
open his hands up and like, ahh!

00:20:38.511 --> 00:20:40.010
And then they just
start confessing.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.701
That doesn't actually work.

00:20:41.701 --> 00:20:46.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.682 --> 00:20:48.390
FRANK MILLER: It did
the time I tried it.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.530
TOM KING: So you don't
steal the realism too much.

00:20:57.277 --> 00:20:58.360
FRANK MILLER: Oh, hold on.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.960
Hold on.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.020
TOM KING: Are we going
on the roof right now?

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.450
FRANK MILLER: No, no.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.080
Not at all.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.345
It's just he just said
the dreaded word, realism.

00:21:07.345 --> 00:21:09.470
We're talking about a guy
who dresses up like a bat

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.500
and drives in a car
that's 30-feet long,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.200
puts a child in danger every
time he goes out into action.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.449
And we're talking about realism?

00:21:17.449 --> 00:21:18.990
TOM KING: But that's
what I'm saying,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.600
Frank, is you've got to
lean away from the realism,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.809
but you can't lean so far
away that it breaks, right?

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:24.850
FRANK MILLER: Absolutely.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.460
Right.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.300
HENRY FAULKNER: But
that's brings up

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.320
an interesting point
because you do bring

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.500
realism, Frank, into your work.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.400
"Dark Knight" has these
constant, very real

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.970
political themes and through
all three installments,

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.540
from Reaganism to
nationalism run amok.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.200
"Dark Knight Master
Race" as the last one

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.140
is particularly
poignant right now.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.614
So do you come from a
political perspective

00:21:48.614 --> 00:21:50.030
when you're writing
these stories,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.359
or is that just what
happens to fall in?

00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:53.150
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.644
I mean, obviously, there's a
political perspective in life

00:21:58.644 --> 00:22:00.830
if you're awake.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:06.020
But also, when I started the
very first "Dark Knight,"

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.180
it just struck me
as odd that comics

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.840
were so divorced from
everything else in the world.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.650
And that here we have all
this cartooning talent,

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.530
and we're not
using it to do what

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:23.332
cartoonists are most known for,
which is political cartoons.

00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:25.040
So to me, it was just
a natural marriage,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.070
and it also gave the
series a Greek chorus--

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.810
that is, a way for
the rest of the world

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.800
to react to Batman
being out there.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.067
And that's just been a device
that's continued throughout.

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.650
HENRY FAULKNER: One
thing we mentioned

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:44.350
backstage, every installment
of "The Dark Knight Returns"

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.080
has now happened during a
Republican administration.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.820
Coincidence?

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.260
Just that's when the
story came to you?

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.899
FRANK MILLER:
Hell, I don't know.

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:57.440
HENRY FAULKNER: As diplomatic
an answer as we could hope for.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.148
FRANK MILLER: No.

00:22:58.148 --> 00:22:58.740
It's direct.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.860
It's just I've got no idea.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.193
Do you think that--

00:23:06.193 --> 00:23:07.427
I don't know.

00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:08.510
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.760
FRANK MILLER: You got me, pal.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.480
HENRY FAULKNER: I
want to come back,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.480
Tony, to something you
said earlier about you're

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.610
bringing Batman a little
more into the light--

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.020
TONY PATRICK: Right.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.270
HENRY FAULKNER: In doing this.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.910
And you said that
it's Gotham by day.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.210
Gotham itself is
as much a character

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:30.330
in the mythos as Robin
or the Joker, and more so

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.580
than any other setting--

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.480
certainly more than Metropolis.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.280
How has that influenced you?

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.212
How have you played with that?

00:23:39.212 --> 00:23:40.920
Do you guys think of
that as a character?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.490
TONY PATRICK: It's a
big sandbox to play in,

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.140
especially daytime
Gotham because, even now

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.910
as we're working on
it, we're figuring out

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.570
the distinction between
nighttime Gotham, which

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.290
is what mostly we've seen in
the majority of the books,

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.960
and then a new
daytime ecosystem.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:07.080
So is that where new
heroes and new villains

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.995
actually test out there
skill sets, plans?

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.800
Actually, I imagine that daytime
Gotham is a little bit more

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.200
corrupt than nighttime Gotham.

00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:21.900
One of the things that
we're investigating

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.750
is kind of the systems
that run during daytime.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.080
Also, if we talk,
if we get into--

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.660
not to say that we are getting
into politics in Gotham--

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:39.030
but a lot of these corrupt
politicians in Gotham

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.370
are working during the daytime.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.290
So there's a lot of
different opportunities

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.920
I feel that Gotham
by day gives us.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.727
FRANK MILLER: Does he like a
special costume that he wears?

00:24:49.727 --> 00:24:51.060
He'll have his usual camouflage?

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.393
TONY PATRICK: Well, Signal does.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.690
Signal, to give you guys if you
don't know who Duke Thomas is--

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.630
over the last about
five years, he's

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:09.870
gone from just a teenage kid
who helped Batman out in a jam

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.570
to being part of an
autonomous group of Robins.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.530
They lived, most of them, Frank.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.280
FRANK MILLER: [INAUDIBLE]
How many Robins?

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.400
TONY PATRICK: Yeah.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.049
That's right.

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.590
That's right.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.940
Sorry, sorry.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.180
Would you like to
talk about it, too?

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.220
It was a few years ago--

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.050
and this is what got me
invested in Duke Thomas--

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.750
I was at New York Comic Con, and
I walked by a table and I saw

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.500
Black Robin on a
T-shirt, and I was like--

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.744
SEAN MURPHY: Hey, it's
African-American Robin.

00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:39.090
TONY PATRICK: It's narrows--

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.250
nah.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.385
So I saw the T-shirt, and I
was like, I got to get this.

00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:45.467
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:47.550
TONY PATRICK: And I knew
nothing about Duke Thomas

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.710
at that point.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.040
So then I went back and
I read "We Are Robin"

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.390
and filled in the gaps
in, and here I am, man.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.399
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:58.440
Wouldn't be sitting here.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.490
SEAN MURPHY: I'm actually
using him in my book.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.490
TONY PATRICK: Which one?

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.811
SEAN MURPHY: Duke Thomas.

00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:03.561
TONY PATRICK: Who?

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.709
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:07.500
SEAN MURPHY: In my
book, I use Duke Thomas,

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.964
so I have him as some
Marvel character.

00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:15.130
TONY PATRICK: Miles Morales?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.860
SEAN MURPHY: Sorry?

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.610
TONY PATRICK: Who?

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.280
SEAN MURPHY: Oh.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.330
There's a Netflix show.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.535
What's his name?

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:20.535
TONY PATRICK: Luke Cage.

00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:21.240
SEAN MURPHY: Luke
Cage, thank you.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.590
TONY PATRICK: Daredevil?

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.715
SEAN MURPHY: No, Luke Cage.

00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:24.009
Sorry.

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:25.050
Smartest guy in the room.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.966
TONY PATRICK: We don't
know Marvel characters.

00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:28.131
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:30.130
SEAN MURPHY: I have him
as kind of Luke Cage guy

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.504
who's defending
his neighborhood.

00:26:31.504 --> 00:26:34.140
It's like he's in Bed-Sty or
like a rough neighborhood where

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.700
Batman and the police don't go.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.370
So he's just sort of taking
matters into his own hands.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.410
So that's sort of what
I am working with.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.172
I don't know how that fits.

00:26:43.172 --> 00:26:44.880
Mine's Elseworld, so
it's not even canon.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.480
TONY PATRICK: It's not even--

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.660
OK, it's Elseworld.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.312
FRANK MILLER: Someone
said Elseworld?

00:26:48.312 --> 00:26:49.387
Do they still do that?

00:26:49.387 --> 00:26:50.220
JAMES TYNION IV: No.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.760
They should.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.551
SEAN MURPHY: They don't
stamp it like that.

00:26:52.551 --> 00:26:54.490
FRANK MILLER: Oh, Elseworlds.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.740
They made up Elseworlds in
reaction to "Dark Knight"

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.990
because they wanted to
say, this didn't happen.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.170
SEAN MURPHY: Didn't you work
so much of it into canon?

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.440
TONY PATRICK: Yeah.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:04.960
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.751
TONY PATRICK: Yeah.

00:27:05.751 --> 00:27:06.990
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.239
SEAN MURPHY: And I'm following
in your footsteps here,

00:27:09.239 --> 00:27:11.362
I was like let me just
take Gotham, mess with it.

00:27:11.362 --> 00:27:12.570
I'm going to just tear it up.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.294
And whatever you
guys like at the end,

00:27:14.294 --> 00:27:15.960
you can just use that,
just like the way

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.880
you did with "Dark Knight."

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.127
And they thought like, OK.

00:27:19.127 --> 00:27:21.210
They were convinced like,
well, worked with Frank.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.000
Maybe this kid can do
something like that, too.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.770
I don't know.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.770
Not that I would ever
expect to fill your shoes,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.000
but I had you as an example
to throw in their face.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.160
You let Frank do it.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.868
FRANK MILLER: No.

00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:35.640
The idea is that each
guy at bat kicks things,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.680
kicks the bounds as
far out as possible.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.144
And the next guy can do it.

00:27:39.144 --> 00:27:40.810
SEAN MURPHY: I'm
kicking it really hard.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.520
FRANK MILLER: I don't mind
filling anybody's shoes.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.353
HENRY FAULKNER: Well,
in terms of diversity,

00:27:44.353 --> 00:27:47.640
you've created a Bat team
that is not just largely,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.799
it's a majority of women.

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:51.090
JAMES TYNION IV: Well, I mean
there is a lot of great--

00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:00.030
like Batwoman, the Batwoman that
Greg Rucka created or developed

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.870
with JH Williams
was one of, I think,

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:09.720
the best additions to the
mythos in a long time.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.370
But that character had
kind of existed standalone.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:18.200
She had not really interacted
with the Bat family itself.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.040
There had been little
mentions before that there

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.900
is a familial
relationship, so it

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.750
was like bringing in Batwoman
as a kind of mirror to Bruce,

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.550
as his cousin, as someone
who comes with a more

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.720
military background.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.820
And how the two of them
play off of each other

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.050
became sort of core to the team.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.150
But honestly, in building
the team, a lot of it

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.930
was just me asking to use
my favorite characters

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.560
and them saying yes.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.190
HENRY FAULKNER: This
begs the question,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.530
how much freedom do you have
on this iconic character?

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.650
How do you decide
like, all right, he's

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.265
going to be married now?

00:29:03.265 --> 00:29:05.450
That is now literally
the cat's out of the bag.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.570
JAMES TYNION IV:
You start doing it,

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.250
and you see when they say no.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.960
FRANK MILLER: The best
bit is to come in when

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.230
the sales are really low.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.567
That's when you get--

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:17.650
HENRY FAULKNER: That's how
we pitch products here.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.775
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:28.130
TOM KING: Being sales
low is really helpful.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.754
That's why I try to
crash every project

00:29:29.754 --> 00:29:31.100
and then raise it back up.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.010
FRANK MILLER: I mean, I got
"Daredevil2 when they were just

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.776
getting set to cancel it.

00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:37.275
So I got to do
anything I wanted to.

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.300
TOM KING: Oh, the best
thing to happen in comics

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.966
is you get something
nobody cares about.

00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:41.040
FRANK MILLER: Oh, yeah.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.285
You get to knock it
all around the block.

00:29:42.285 --> 00:29:42.410
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.130
That's the best.

00:29:46.896 --> 00:29:49.490
The company and the
editors want a story

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.910
that will capture the public.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.891
They don't want you
to be a cover band.

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:55.265
They don't want you to just
be like, OK, here's the hits.

00:29:55.265 --> 00:29:55.520
FRANK MILLER: They don't?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.200
TOM KING: I'm going to play
them over and over again.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.741
FRANK MILLER: A lot
of times they do.

00:29:58.741 --> 00:30:00.420
TOM KING: No.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.439
FRANK MILLER: But
sometimes, they don't.

00:30:03.439 --> 00:30:04.980
If you get a good
editor, they don't.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.090
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.750
That's right.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.250
You've got to find
the right editor.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.410
That's 100% true.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.309
It's one of those things where
I think maybe the safe option is

00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:15.350
what they want because
that's the easiest way not

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.050
to get fired.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.934
But in their heart,
in their dreams,

00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:19.350
they want to do
something radical.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.960
They want to be the editor
of "Dark Knight Returns."

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.240
They want to be the publisher
who publishes that next thing.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.656
And if you can trick them into
thinking you're doing that,

00:30:25.656 --> 00:30:26.666
then you're cool.

00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:28.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.820
So that's the whole thing
to push a story forward.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.074
But you have to.

00:30:33.074 --> 00:30:34.490
I mean, the whole
point in working

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:35.906
with the Batman
character is there

00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:37.100
is a core to that character.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.671
There is a core, and you're
responsible to the fans,

00:30:40.671 --> 00:30:42.170
you're responsible
to the people who

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.480
came before you not
to destroy that core.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.660
And if you do, then your
story loses its stakes.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.660
If I'm writing a Batman that
doesn't mold to that point of,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.696
then I'm just writing
sort of bad fan fiction.

00:30:53.696 --> 00:30:55.820
And having written some
bad fan fiction in my life,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.377
I'm not ready to go back to it.

00:30:57.377 --> 00:30:58.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.940
So as long as you
stick to that core,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.440
you can move that
character forward.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.231
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:06.950
And it's amazing
how well conceived

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.050
the best characters are.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:14.450
There's not much you can really
wreck about Batman unless you

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:19.840
just completely trashed
it and betrayed it.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.390
He's like Superman
or Wonder Woman.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.724
They're are all such good ideas.

00:31:24.724 --> 00:31:26.723
TOM KING: Oh, he's so
much better than Superman.

00:31:26.723 --> 00:31:27.890
What are you talking about?

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.120
Superman is a boring character.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.495
FRANK MILLER: Hey, Superman
is the one I want to do next.

00:31:31.495 --> 00:31:32.997
TOM KING: Oh, well, never mind.

00:31:32.997 --> 00:31:34.080
SEAN MURPHY: You're lucky.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.313
The sales are low.

00:31:35.313 --> 00:31:39.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.300
I don't know if
that's true actually.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.341
HENRY FAULKNER: Too soon.

00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:43.487
FRANK MILLER: Not true.

00:31:43.487 --> 00:31:44.945
Superman is not a
boring character.

00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:49.472
Just go read some of the stuff
that Siegel and Shuster did.

00:31:49.472 --> 00:31:50.305
Never mind Bizzaros.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.420
TOM KING: You don't like
Mort Weisinger going crazy?

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.410
But to me, Batman is--

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.250
FRANK MILLER: If you're
talking about the stuff

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.708
where he could push
planets around,

00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:01.180
no, that's not real interesting.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.200
Once Once he got more
powerful than God,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.920
he stopped being a really
interesting character.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.110
But he started out
as a character,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.870
he was a great idea that
begat all the rest of them.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.570
TOM KING: But the problem to me,
it's the motivational problem.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.257
You do a Spider-Man, oh, I
let the guy kill my uncle.

00:32:21.257 --> 00:32:23.090
He's has that guilt for
the rest of his life

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.006
and you can always go.

00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:25.730
Batman, my parents died.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.740
There's just a fundamental flaw.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.522
Superman, that's not there.

00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:30.980
There's not that
simple explanation

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.150
of why he does what he does.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.220
FRANK MILLER: He's a
mentally-healthy hero.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.864
TOM KING: Yeah, how boring.

00:32:35.864 --> 00:32:38.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:39.350
FRANK MILLER: I can't wait.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.960
HENRY FAULKNER: At least
for a little while longer.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.880
SEAN MURPHY: Superman,
mentally-healthy hero.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.297
Frank Miller.

00:32:50.297 --> 00:32:51.380
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.410
So geeking out a little
bit, Frank, your Daredevil

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.419
versus your Batman.

00:32:55.419 --> 00:32:56.210
FRANK MILLER: Yeah?

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.636
HENRY FAULKNER: Who would win?

00:32:57.636 --> 00:32:58.510
FRANK MILLER: Batman.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.384
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah?

00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:00.580
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.064
HENRY FAULKNER: No radar, no--

00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:03.480
FRANK MILLER: He
beat up Superman.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.610
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.347
Tom, your Batman versus
your Mister Miracle?

00:33:10.347 --> 00:33:12.430
TOM KING: Well, Mister
Miracle is not a superhero.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.846
All he does is
escape from things.

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:16.510
It's fairly useless
in a fight unless you

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.050
want to escape from the fight.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.920
FRANK MILLER: Would he
escape from the fight?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.630
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.213
Batman would have
trouble holding him,

00:33:24.213 --> 00:33:25.520
but I think beyond that--

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.530
in the who would win,
Batman is always the win.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.580
The only person he loses
against is his writers, right?

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.700
We have the power.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.160
FRANK MILLER: Or his heart.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.076
JAMES TYNION IV: Yeah.

00:33:36.076 --> 00:33:37.060
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.810
JAMES TYNION IV: It's
like the only person

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.110
Batman loses against as Batman.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.650
That's really the
only way to do it

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:50.620
because he represents this
core idea of overcoming things,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.270
overcoming the worst things.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.160
So no matter what the
worst thing is you

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.290
throw at him, to make it a
Batman story he overcomes it.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.580
FRANK MILLER: My first draft
of the first "Dark Knight"

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.785
ended up with him dying in
a hail of police gunfire.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.469
it But that did not become
a usable ending because--

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:09.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:10.270
No.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.980
It didn't work, thematically or
emotionally or anything else.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.624
It wouldn't have
been a good ending.

00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:18.040
HENRY FAULKNER:
So what challenges

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.510
does that create for you?

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:23.020
I mean, when you know going
in, this is the character that

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.075
is undefeatable, that only
Batman can beat Batman,

00:34:26.075 --> 00:34:27.199
how do you keep that fresh?

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.157
FRANK MILLER: Oh, I think
Batman can die, sure.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.429
Keeping it fresh?

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:38.110
That's why they have to
keep replacing us, I guess.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.870
There's just too much
good stuff to do with him.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:44.440
TONY PATRICK: I think
that, for me, it was always

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.060
trying to find his
greatest weakness,

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.679
and for me his greatest
weakness is that extended family

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.960
we're talking about.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.489
So I think each
writer probably has

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.179
the challenge of
figuring out, what

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.000
is your interpretation
of his biggest flaw?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.580
FRANK MILLER: Well, and
these characters that

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.560
have been around for so long
are subject to each writer's

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.290
interpretation, each
cartoonist's interpretation,

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.500
too, because they look different
and they feel different

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.620
and they read different.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.780
And that keeps them
going more than anything.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.220
I can't imagine
people just sticking

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.165
to one hero for 40 years.

00:35:27.555 --> 00:35:28.680
HENRY FAULKNER: Before we--

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.888
FRANK MILLER: Brain aneurysm.

00:35:29.888 --> 00:35:32.710
HENRY FAULKNER: Get to
audience questions, one more.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:37.660
Both Sean and Frank, you draw
the works that you're writing.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.760
Does the story
influence your art?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.080
Do you find that it changes?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.420
And for the rest of
you, does the artist

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.120
you're working with change
how you tell a story?

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.720
FRANK MILLER: In my case, I'd
say yes, yes, yes, and yes.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.316
I adapt my art style to
the story I want to do.

00:35:58.316 --> 00:36:03.890
And with switching from "Sin
City" to "300," for instance,

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.020
there was a switch to a
much more linear style

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.030
because it's going
to be a color book,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.420
but also because color was
such an important factor

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.410
in the story.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.490
The red capes were a
big part of the story.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:22.110
And the Persians were
notoriously wealthy

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.620
and flamboyant in their
costumes and such.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.940
So you have to adapt to each
project you're working on

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.350
or it becomes boring for you
and therefore the audience.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.270
SEAN MURPHY: I think
the secret weapon

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.840
for me is, if I'm writing
and drawing my own stuff--

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.252
these guys are A-level writers.

00:36:41.252 --> 00:36:42.960
A lot of the things
that they talk about,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.076
I haven't even thought
about that yet.

00:36:45.076 --> 00:36:45.951
TOM KING: Damn right.

00:36:45.951 --> 00:36:48.907
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.907 --> 00:36:49.990
FRANK MILLER: He's faking.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.820
TOM KING: I'm faking.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.150
SEAN MURPHY: I can kind
of crank together a plot,

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.680
but I can only do one a year.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.490
I have to draw it.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.230
And if there's any holes, I can
try to draw my way out of them.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.550
So a lot of times, when I
work with a different writer,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.190
there's always
miscommunications.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.466
And it does add up.

00:37:06.466 --> 00:37:08.090
Hopefully most readers
don't notice it.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.690
But when you're
drawing your own,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.480
you know exactly what the
dialogue is, exactly why

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.340
that facial expression works.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.410
And that clean
connection is something,

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.180
as much as I love
working with Scott,

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.860
it's never going to be 100%.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.220
So my failures as
a writer, I think

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.000
I can make up for them by
my connection to myself

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.212
being the artist.

00:37:27.212 --> 00:37:28.920
I mean, there's stuff
I've done and pages

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.781
where Batman, the lights
are out, isn't he impeded?

00:37:31.781 --> 00:37:33.780
It's Gotham, so I'm doing
all these crazy things

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.680
with the art.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.750
Scott doesn't know how
to write that panel

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.650
because you need to visualize
it first and work backwards.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.870
Like Frank can do
that because he

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.930
knows that his artist, who is
himself, knows how to do that.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.210
But most writers
just generally don't

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.340
think moment-to-moment
storytelling

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.691
or using an illustration that
turns into sequential panels.

00:37:53.691 --> 00:37:54.190
It's tough.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.600
You need to talk to your
artists to make sure it'll work.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.320
But when you're the
same guy all in one,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.160
you can do that stuff
more effortlessly.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.490
So there.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.430
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.100
We have questions
from the mics set up.

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:14.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.930
Thanks so much for coming today.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.424
SEAN MURPHY: Thanks
for having us.

00:38:17.424 --> 00:38:18.348
AUDIENCE: This is a
question, and I've

00:38:18.348 --> 00:38:19.800
had it about a lot
of art forms, but I

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.258
think it's a
particularly pertinent

00:38:21.258 --> 00:38:23.400
to yours and to Batman.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.970
When you sit down to write
something new, something that

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.135
has such a long canon,
do you ever have an idea

00:38:29.135 --> 00:38:30.510
and say to yourself,
well, I want

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.150
to check and see if anyone
else has done that before?

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.137
Or are you not
deterred by the concept

00:38:35.137 --> 00:38:36.720
of someone else
having tried something

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.930
and you just want
to make your own

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.200
and give it your shot at it?

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.270
Have you ever walked away
from ideas because they

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.435
weren't necessarily brand new?

00:38:44.435 --> 00:38:45.060
TOM KING: Yeah.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.020
I use this program.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.610
It's called Google.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:52.487
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:52.487 --> 00:38:53.070
No, it's true.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:53.290
SEAN MURPHY: It's a Google slam?

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:54.500
TOM KING: No, but
it's 100% true.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.730
I'll have an idea, and I'll
be like, this has been done.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.146
FRANK MILLER: Your
check is ready.

00:38:58.146 --> 00:38:58.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.443
TOM KING: I will
literally use Google,

00:39:00.443 --> 00:39:01.990
just to suck up a little bit.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.617
I use Google every
day to check ideas

00:39:04.617 --> 00:39:05.950
and to look at the past history.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.658
FRANK MILLER: Your
second check is ready.

00:39:07.658 --> 00:39:08.254

00:39:08.254 --> 00:39:09.295
TOM KING: This is Google.

00:39:09.295 --> 00:39:10.660
We can do five checks.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.200
That's what I'm saying.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.700
FRANK MILLER: Is
there anything else

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.200
nice you'd like to
say about Google?

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:22.287
Or would you like to simply
mention its name about five?

00:39:22.287 --> 00:39:23.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.169
TOM KING: Google
the crap out of--

00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:26.960
Also, I have two nerds
that are my friends.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.945
They run a podcast called
"Comic Geek Speak."

00:39:28.945 --> 00:39:30.195
FRANK MILLER: That was a plug.

00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:31.528
TOM KING: A plug for my buddies.

00:39:31.528 --> 00:39:33.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.180
That's actually
not the name of it.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.900
Anyway, for geeks.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.794
And I use them as a brain trust.

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:42.210
They're bigger nerds than I
am, which is saying something.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.870
FRANK MILLER: Do
they these Google?

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:45.240
TOM KING: No.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.386
They use Yahoo.

00:39:46.386 --> 00:39:50.950

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.720

comes from head.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:56.760
So yes.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.029
That's a long nerdy
suck-up answer.

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.570
SEAN MURPHY: I use
Google a lot, too.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.682 --> 00:40:02.640
TONY PATRICK: Me three.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.450
TOM KING: I got
the checks already.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:04.680
SEAN MURPHY: All right.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.180
Sorry.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.250
JAMES TYNION IV: I've
got like a full bookshelf

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:13.620
of pretty much every major
Batman story that meant

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.200
something to me growing up.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.490
And I spend a lot of time
revisiting those stories.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:25.530
A lot of it is to
make sure that I'm not

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.160
touching on beats from
before, but it's a lot also

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.670
me finding the moments
that moved me the most

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.180
and, not to recreate
them, but to get

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.350
into that mindset of where
I was when I was reading it

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.020
and how to express
what I'm feeling now.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.020
I think Tom said earlier that
it's about putting yourself

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:51.210
into it, and that's the thing
that's never been in the comic

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:51.720
before.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.920
It's my perspective.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.030
My Batman is different
than everyone else's Batman

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:01.230
because there are the stories
that matter the most to me.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.190
It's a different constellation
than any of the other writers

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.480
up here.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.570
So that Batman, how that
Batman reacts in this scenario,

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:16.080
yeah there might be a
story from 20 years ago

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.090
that might touch on
some of the same themes.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.400
And obviously, I want
to be aware of that,

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.430
and I don't want to make
it boring for the reader.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.627
If I feel like I'm saying
something with the story

00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:33.960
I'm trying to tell, and I'm
bringing these characters in

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.510
and using my Batman,
the version of Batman

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:45.465
that I hear in my head when
I write, that is different.

00:41:45.465 --> 00:41:47.910
So I don't concern
myself too much with it,

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.730
but I am conscious of it.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.350
AUDIENCE: Sort of a follow up on
that to the rest of the people.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:57.975
So it sounded like
you kind of grew up,

00:41:57.975 --> 00:42:00.180
and Batman was always
sort of your favorite part

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.785
of the comic universe.

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:04.277
But for everyone else,
is it the same for you?

00:42:04.277 --> 00:42:06.360
You were always, that was
your favorite growing up

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.150
and you were most drawn to it,
or were you more sort of drawn

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.250
to comics generally and you sort
of ended up doing Batman stuff?

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.750
FRANK MILLER: I was
big on "Superboy

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.824
and the Legion of
Super-Heroes" when I was a kid.

00:42:16.824 --> 00:42:18.240
JAMES TYNION IV:
Great characters.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.823
FRANK MILLER: Batman
came a lot later.

00:42:19.823 --> 00:42:22.829
TOM KING: Like the Jim Shooter
written by a 13-year-old?

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:23.620
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.902
It turns out that I ended
up working for that guy.

00:42:29.352 --> 00:42:31.560
JAMES TYNION IV: For me, it
was Batman and the X-Men.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.550
Those were the stories
that I just gravitated to

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.500
over and over and
over again, which

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.500
is why I'm writing the X-Men
starring the Bat family right

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.100
now.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.650
I even just stole
the Danger Room

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.020
because Marvel's not using it.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.989
TONY PATRICK: I started
with X-Men first,

00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:55.530
and then I was lucky
enough to read--

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.040
and Frank's not going
to send me a check--

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.810
then I read "Dark
Knight Returns,"

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:05.520
and that kind of was
a game changer for me.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.070
And then Watchmen, also.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:12.580
And then since then, I just
wanted to write comics.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.170
Milestone, a lot of the
Milestone stuff as well.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.540
So here I am.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.050
SEAN MURPHY: I came from
watching a lot of "Batman,

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:23.130
The Animated Series."

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.463
JAMES TYNION IV: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:43:24.463 --> 00:43:27.600
SEAN MURPHY: And I feel the
stuff I don't know about comics

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.540
is scary.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.414
I don't know how I got this far.

00:43:30.414 --> 00:43:31.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.170
And I usually check
with Scott or you

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.652
or anybody who will listen.

00:43:35.652 --> 00:43:37.110
And I think I have
this great idea,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.490
and Scott will say, yeah,
that's a great idea.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.360
I did last year, or
I'm about to do that,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.892
or I did it years and years ago.

00:43:43.892 --> 00:43:44.850
So I just stop talking.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:45.390
TOM KING: About to do that?

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.510
That's a horrible answer.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.260
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:47.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.148
TOM KING: What a coincidence.

00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:51.700
That exact idea is mine.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.050
FRANK MILLER: I'm
about to do that.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.095
Great idea.

00:43:55.095 --> 00:43:56.580
I just thought of it.

00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:02.580
SEAN MURPHY: But then my
friends, they're like, no no,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.080
you can't get into
comics without reading

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.237
them the Milestone stuff.

00:44:05.237 --> 00:44:07.570
So that's when they gave me
"Dark Knight" and "Watchmen"

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.490
and some Kyle Baker stuff--

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.700
all that indie stuff, too--

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.810
"Sin City," 1 and 2,
all of them, obviously.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.147
I'll take that check later.

00:44:21.573 --> 00:44:23.864
FRANK MILLER: Black and white
comics don't give checks.

00:44:23.864 --> 00:44:24.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:24.692 --> 00:44:25.595
SEAN MURPHY: Damn it.

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:27.970
TOM KING: Do you know when
you're writing well as opposed

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:28.637
to when you're--

00:44:28.637 --> 00:44:31.011
are there things you're like,
man, this is really rolling

00:44:31.011 --> 00:44:32.560
for me and this has problems?

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.600
FRANK MILLER: There are times
when I'm sure it's really good,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.760
and it may be terrible,
or it may be really good.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.160
There are times when I think
this isn't really good when

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.610
it's certainly not good.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.826
SEAN MURPHY: For me, when
Scott Snyder steals my ideas--

00:44:46.826 --> 00:44:48.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:48.594 --> 00:44:49.760
TONY PATRICK: It's an honor.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.302
JAMES TYNION IV: We
know you hate it.

00:44:51.302 --> 00:44:52.135
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:52.135 --> 00:44:52.710
Thanks, guys.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.980
You guys are all great.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.234
GROUP: Thank you.

00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:57.650
HENRY FAULKNER: We have one
more quick question we can do.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:58.110
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:58.610
Hey, guys.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.830
Former DC intern
here, so thank you.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:01.620
TOM KING: Me, too.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.430
Thank you, man.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.660
We got it, too, here.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.370
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
over the last decade or so,

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.360
Batman has become Bruce's
full-time identity or job.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.840
I'd love to hear how you guys
approach writing the Batman

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.100
persona and writing
the Bruce Wayne persona

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.890
and how you balance that.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.960
TONY PATRICK: I mean, isn't
Bruce Wayne actually the mask?

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.710
SEAN MURPHY: Yeah.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.830
FRANK MILLER: Yeah.

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:27.550
TONY PATRICK: That's one
interpretation maybe.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.170
FRANK MILLER: My
feeling was always

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:34.630
that, when Batman retired,
Bruce Wayne started dying.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.430
And Bruce Wayne actually
started steadily

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:41.260
getting younger and healthier
when he put the cowl back on.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.557
So he doesn't feel
comfortable in street clothes,

00:45:43.557 --> 00:45:44.140
I don't think.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.200
JAMES TYNION IV: I forget
who described this first--

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.870
it may have been Mark
Waid-- but there's

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:58.420
an idea for both
Batman and Superman,

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.220
there's a lot of talk
of dual identities,

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.240
but it's actually a
three-part system.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.730
There's Batman, the persona he
puts on to frighten criminals

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:10.770
in the street.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.360
And there is Bruce
Wayne, the persona

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.050
he puts on to mask the
fact that he's Batman.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.540
And then there is the
strange man in the cave.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.180
There is this figure
in the cave who

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.820
is speaking to Alfred,
who is still connected

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.380
to that 8-year-old boy, who
is still that 8-year-old boy

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.430
that he was before.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.580
But he is driven
to be this thing,

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.510
and he's never
going to really be

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:47.170
able to grow up because he
will always be in that moment.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:51.400
When he succumbs fully
one way or the other,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.140
it doesn't quite work.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.030
So it's like he needs
to stay in touch

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:56.488
with that person
in the cave, which

00:46:56.488 --> 00:46:58.780
is why I think that his
relationship with Alfred

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.150
is so powerful, why his
relationship with the Robins

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.880
is so powerful because they
actually know that person,

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.514
and there are very
few people who do.

00:47:06.514 --> 00:47:07.930
FRANK MILLER: What
about Bat-Mite?

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.270
Where does he fit in?

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.310
JAMES TYNION IV: He's
just his biggest fan.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.010
FRANK MILLER: Don't you find it
kind of spooky about how we now

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.500
casually refer to the Robins?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.570
JAMES TYNION IV: Oh yeah.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.484
FRANK MILLER: I mean,
how many Robins?

00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:22.900
TOM KING: Well,
you added a Robin.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.105
You're not innocent in this.

00:47:24.105 --> 00:47:27.242
FRANK MILLER: Yeah,
but I didn't kill her.

00:47:27.242 --> 00:47:28.987
TOM KING: Yet.

00:47:28.987 --> 00:47:30.070
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.730
Well, that's what
we have time for.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:33.100
Thank you very much.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.762
This has been amazing.

00:47:34.762 --> 00:47:38.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.520
We have--
