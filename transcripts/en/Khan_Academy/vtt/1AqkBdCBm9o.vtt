00:00:00.407 --> 00:00:02.783
- [Voiceover] What is the missing number,

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:07.783
100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.450
106 is the missing number,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.783
and then we go 107, 108, 109, 110.

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.650
So, the missing number is 106,
that's the number after 105

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.983
and before 107.

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:22.217
Let's keep going.

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:24.284
What is the missing number?

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:28.617
Well, if I start at 100, the
next number is going to be 101,

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.233
and then we go to 102,
103, 104, we keep going.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:34.817
This is exciting.

00:00:34.817 --> 00:00:39.050
What whole number comes right before 105?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.617
Well, what whole number
comes right before five?

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:42.717
Well, four.

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:45.185
So what number comes right before 105?

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.788
Well, it's going to be 104.

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:52.283
If you're going after 100 you
get 100, 101, 102, 103, 104,

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.233
and then you go to 105.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.717
All right, so they want us to figure out

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:00.483
what the missing number is.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.117
And we see that they're
counting, one, two three,

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:03.517
all the way up to 10 and then here

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:04.950
they're going from 11 to 20.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.183
They're counting all the way up to 120.

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:09.850
But there's a missing square here.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.784
So, this is the number
that is one larger than 118

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:15.650
and one less than 120.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.550
Well, if I was counting, I'd
go 111, 112, 113, 114, 115,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.550
116, 117, 118, 119, and then 120.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:28.257
Nineteen is before 20,

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:32.307
so 119 is gonna be before 120.

00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:36.484
And 19 is after 18 so the number after 118

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:38.400
is going to be 119.

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:40.350
Let's check our answer.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.917
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:43.717
Well, we've done these a lot already.

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:45.083
What number is missing?

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.247
Right after seven comes
eight, so right after 107

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:52.300
comes 108 and then 109 and 110.
