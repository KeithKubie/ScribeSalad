LAURENCE MORONEY:
Today I'm chatting

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.080
with Amit Chopra about
Google's Agency program

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.660
and how it works to connect
developers, customers,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.740
and of course, agencies.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.662
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:16.210
So Amit, we finally
got you on the show.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.620
It's really great
to have you here.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.760
We finally got schedules lined
up and all that kind of thing.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.910
So tell us, what is it
that you do here at Google?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.701
AMIT CHOPRA: Great.

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:25.150
Thank you, Laurence, for
having me on the show.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.170
Super excited.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.180
Before I jump into
what I work on,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.651
let me give a quick introduction
of what my team actually does.

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:32.525
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:34.816
AMIT CHOPRA: So I'm part of
a team called the Developer

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:37.450
Relations Ecosystem
Team, and our team

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.900
is responsible for running
a number of very scalable

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.400
global outreach programs.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.873
AMIT CHOPRA: Some of them
you might have heard of,

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:46.390
the Google Developer groups.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Love the GDGs.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.570
AMIT CHOPRA: Perfect.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.150
Yeah, we have hundred--

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: Good call out.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.798
AMIT CHOPRA: We have
hundreds of chapters

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:54.340
out there, you know, exciting
people to build apps and learn

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.035
about technologies.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:57.370
We also run Woman Techmaker--

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.796
AMIT CHOPRA: --the Launchpad
program, and the Google

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.030
Developer Experts.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Lots of good stuff.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.130
AMIT CHOPRA: Lots of
interesting programs,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.239
very large scale programs.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now you've
added to that with the Agency

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.590
program.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.673
AMIT CHOPRA: Yes, we have.

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:09.640
And the Agency
program is a program

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.000
which is specifically focused
towards development agencies.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.310
Not ad agencies, this is
for development agencies.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.830
I generally call that
out because it gets

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.530
kind of overloaded at times.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: You get a cool
jacket to also describe it, so.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.530
AMIT CHOPRA: Yes, you do.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.010
We have got more
cool swag as well.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.720
You can take some
after the show from me.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's not the
only reason I had you on here.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.360
AMIT CHOPRA: OK, perfect.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.445
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's an
added bonus, but anyway.

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:30.280
AMIT CHOPRA: I
came for your car.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.595
LAURENCE MORONEY: [LAUGHS]

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:31.890
AMIT CHOPRA: This
is pretty nice.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell us
a bit more about the program.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.026
AMIT CHOPRA: OK.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.670
So what the program
does is identifies.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.870
Let me give you what I call
the elevator spiel on this one.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.870
We identify, upscale,
certify, and promote

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.874
development agencies.

00:01:44.874 --> 00:01:46.540
That's quite a mouthful,
but it actually

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.610
summarizes almost
everything that we

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.865
do about this program
with development agencies.

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:52.240
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, in a world

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.531
where there's a demand for
richer and richer and richer

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.830
UX, agencies play a really
important role, right?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.471
So how is it that
you foster that?

00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.720
AMIT CHOPRA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.080
In fact just to
step back a little,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.990
the whole crux of why we
started this program was,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.160
we were looking at--

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.280
my team focuses on making
sure that app quality comes

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.180
out really great.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.010
Anyone who's
developing understands

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.890
what it means to build
a great Android app,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.440
use material design,
use it in the right way.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.470
Not just use it, but
use it correctly.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.820
AMIT CHOPRA: And we were
seeing that a lot of apps

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.720
are not kind of following the
guidelines, UX guidelines,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.400
things to do with
general design,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.070
battery usage, network usage.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.320
And we would go and talk
to a lot of developers.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.960
We would-- through
Google Developer Summits

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.940
or through other events
that we're doing.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.010
But what we found
was that a number

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.440
of these large organizations
are actually using agencies

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.690
to build their apps, you know?

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.626
They basically bring
somebody on board

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:46.750
who does the work for them.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.470
AMIT CHOPRA: And we had no
connection point for them.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.174
AMIT CHOPRA: And
so we said, hey,

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:53.890
let's start a program that
works directly with them.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.100
And this was piloted about
18 months ago back in India.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.440
So one of my colleagues said,
I'm going to experiment.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.230
Like in all Google things,
we're like, yeah, go for it.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.340
And, you know, after a few
months we started looking at,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.910
did it actually make any impact?

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.020
And yes, we started to see
a change in the app quality

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.380
coming out for these apps.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
developers were outsourcing

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.250
to agencies, then it was, if
we can train the agencies,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.140
then we can scale
out really nice.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.765
AMIT CHOPRA: It scales
out really nice.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.720
And you know, if you
train agency once,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.840
all the clients get the benefit.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.550
So this was very
successful in India.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.133
Then we said, OK, let's try it
in a slightly different market.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:30.005
So we went and explored
it in UK and Russia.

00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:30.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.170
AMIT CHOPRA: They were
the other two places

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.640
where we started this thing.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.440
The program turned out really
well in other regions as well.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.500
And then last year
when I came and started

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.320
working on this particular
team, we scaled this out

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.400
in North America as well.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.980
AMIT CHOPRA: So we've had
a pretty good outreach

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.410
of this particular program
running in almost 17 countries

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.910
now.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if somebody
wants to learn about it,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.100
where would they go?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.849
AMIT CHOPRA: So you
can go to our website,

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.820
developers.google.com/agency.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we'll put
a link in the description box.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.630
AMIT CHOPRA: Yeah, we'll always
have a link in the description.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.230
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right down there.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.646
AMIT CHOPRA: OK,
right down there.

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:03.610
And if you were an agency,
you can see all the benefits

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.350
that we generally
provide to an agency.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.480
If you are part of this
particular program,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.699
we invite you to trainings,
we arrange UX reviews,

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:11.740
which is something very--

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really handy.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.000
AMIT CHOPRA: --popular.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.240
Yeah.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.890
I mean, we can't
do a lot of them,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.260
but we kind of identify
the right opportunities.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.959
And make sure before
you submit an app,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.390
we can spend some
time with you on that.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.670
We also provide you
a lot of trainings.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.860
Some of them are trainings
that we dedicatedly

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.569
run for agencies.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.526
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:30.220
AMIT CHOPRA: In fact,
as we are talking,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.500
there is an event
happening in New York where

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.825
we are teaching agencies
how to run design

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:35.950
sprints with their clients.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.583
AMIT CHOPRA: So we bring
them in and we train them

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:40.420
on best practices.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.290
And we also invite agencies
to a lot of other events

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.790
that my team runs
from time to time.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.050
So training is a big focus.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.712
All that information
is on the website.

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:49.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.555
AMIT CHOPRA: Including a
list of certified agencies.

00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:55.846
LAURENCE MORONEY: So before
the certified agencies-- so

00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.580
if I'm an agency and
I want to find out

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.170
about these great trainings
like the one you mentioned

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.180
in New York, that's all
going to be on the site?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.460
AMIT CHOPRA: We don't list all
the trainings on the website.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.543
What do you need to do is,
you go there and apply.

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:08.050
If you're not part of the
program, submit an application.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.420
We generally go through
an evaluation process

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.100
and make sure that
we are inviting

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.200
agencies, the right
kind of agencies,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.770
to this kind of program.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.329
And once you are in
the program and you've

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:21.120
gone through a certain
number of trainings,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.130
we then invite you to
get certified as well.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.329
So tell us about
this certification.

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:26.750
How is that an enhancement?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.708
AMIT CHOPRA: Yeah, so
what certification really

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.990
is designed to do is identify
the best-of-breed agencies.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.810
We do a thorough evaluation
of the Android apps

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.330
that they have built
over the past 18 months.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.010
They go through a
submission process.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.290
And it's very similar
to how we generally

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.590
go about evaluating
apps for editorials.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.770
So that's one aspect.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.830
We look at the
quality of the apps,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.700
the ratings, the download.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.370
We look at the competencies
that the team has.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.120
So based on that overall view
that we built of the agency,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.350
we can give them a
certification status.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.769
And we have that list also
on our website right now.

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:02.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
it sounds really nice.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.750
Like, if I'm a developer
looking to have an app built,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.041
and as you mentioned, they're
usually going to agencies

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.820
anyway, but you're helping join
the dots so that these agencies

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.840
become, first of all, trained
and then also maybe certified.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.640
So now if I'm a
developer, also if I'm

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.860
looking to find an agency,
can I find it on the site?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.026
AMIT CHOPRA: You can
absolutely find it on the site.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.450
We have a directory
of certified agencies,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.110
and you can look them up based
on the place where you are.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.910
And we have, at
this point, roughly

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.640
about 35 agencies that
have been certified.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.005
We certify every six months.

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:35.170
So we just completed
one cycle mid-year.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.457
And so our list is
available on the website.

00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:38.290
You can take a look.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.352
You can contact the agencies
directly from there.

00:06:40.352 --> 00:06:41.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.370
AMIT CHOPRA: And
these are the ones

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.620
that we have worked with
over a period of time

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.077
to feel fairly confident
about what they're doing

00:06:47.077 --> 00:06:48.160
and what they're building.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's a
great benefit if I need an app,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.210
that I can find a
certified agency that's

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.550
been certified by Google--

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.890
AMIT CHOPRA: Yeah.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: --to be able
to build a great app for them.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.234
And if I'm an
agency and I can get

00:06:57.234 --> 00:06:58.900
into that certified
program, it helps me

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.430
to find new customers, right?

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.430
AMIT CHOPRA: Absolutely.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.990
It's a huge benefit, I think,
not just getting more business.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.470
Being certified definitely helps
an agency get more business,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.710
and we're hoping that that
is the case, but I think--

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.495
I especially focus a lot
on upscaling the agencies.

00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:15.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.203
AMIT CHOPRA: A lot of
trainings we have done

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.150
have been at a very
developer level, you know?

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.690
Even teaching them some ins and
outs of using Android Studio.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.500
This saves them a lot of This
has been one of the factors

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.020
that has drawn a lot of
agencies to our training program

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.020
as well where we can give them
these best practices that,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.530
on a day to day basis, help
them save a lot of time, right?

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.420
And that's value.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.470
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, definitely.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.230
AMIT CHOPRA: I mean,
that's the value

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.502
we're adding for them as well.

00:07:38.502 --> 00:07:39.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.170
Now, you started
in India, then you

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.910
extended to Russia
and the UK, and then

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.440
you've come to North America.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.527
I'm sure there's some
great success stories.

00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:48.110
AMIT CHOPRA: Absolutely,
lots of them.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.820
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Always inspired

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.930
by the success stories.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.170
AMIT CHOPRA: Always, yeah.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.870
So what we actually did was,
with the success stories,

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.860
we have started what we call
as the Spotlight video series.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.170
You know, we go out to
these certified agencies,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.940
we spend some time
and talk to them

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.220
about the kind of projects
they have worked on,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.170
the interesting things
that they have done.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.820
A lot of them are
project-dependent,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.282
but I think one interesting
one, and you can actually see

00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:12.240
the TechGenie spotlight
video on that as well--

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.590
AMIT CHOPRA: --was
one of the dev leads.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.500
You know, she said that she
went on a maternity leave,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.850
and when she came
back her team was

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.830
so well-trained because they had
been attending these trainings.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.120
She was really surprised.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.980
AMIT CHOPRA: She
comes out really

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.930
well in terms of
sharing her experiences.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.380
So there are interesting
soft stories,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.220
success stories around certain
aspects of how the agency has

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.360
benefited the agency.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: Excellent.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.190
AMIT CHOPRA: Also a
lot of case studies

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.731
that are in the
spotlight videos that

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:44.080
talk about how they were able
to get UX reviews, for example,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.680
and then get an app out much
faster for the clients, which

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.480
is beneficial to the client
and also for the clients' end

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.590
users, people like you and me
who have to use their apps.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.070
They see a very
consistent design,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.352
they see a very robust
app that you can use.

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:00.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.851
So if I want to learn more, it's
developer.google.com/agency?

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:03.760
AMIT CHOPRA: /agency.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.320
And it's all down there
in the description,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.280
as you called out before.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.685
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right there.

00:09:06.685 --> 00:09:07.976
AMIT CHOPRA: Yeah, right there.

00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:10.300
And if you're an
agency, go sign up.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.980
You know, we have a
show interest form.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.840
And, you know, it's not running
in all the countries right now,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.300
but gradually we
are expanding that.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.862
The expansion, in fact, to
Brazil is coming up very soon.

00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:21.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.670
AMIT CHOPRA: So we'll be signing
up agencies in that region.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.310
And gradually we'll move
to other parts of the world

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.560
as well as we're starting to
see interest from the agencies

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.330
worldwide.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.650
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
never too late to sign up.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.780
AMIT CHOPRA: Never too late
to sign up, absolutely.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.605
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
thanks so much, Amit.

00:09:35.605 --> 00:09:36.689
I've really learned a lot.

00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:38.063
AMIT CHOPRA: Thank
you, Laurence.

00:09:38.063 --> 00:09:40.600
This was great to be here, and
talk to you about the program

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.854
and talk to our audiences
about the program as well.

00:09:42.854 --> 00:09:44.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds
like a great program.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.510
So thanks for watching
this episode of Coffee

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.150
With A Googler.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.090
