[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:03.480
SAM WANG: It's common these days
for voters to feel frustrated.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.160
To feel as if legislators
aren't paying attention

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.610
to them, whether it's the
Flint water crisis in Michigan

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.910
or partisan polarization or
other ways in which legislators

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.430
seem to not heed their
constituents’ opinions.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.250
Legislative seats nationwide
are less competitive

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.390
than they used to be.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.900
And one big reason
why is gerrymandering.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.480
Voters have chosen
to arrange themselves

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.700
in cities and towns
in rural areas,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.010
and then legislators
take that natural pattern

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.950
and draw the lines as they
like to suit themselves.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.500
A major problem is
partisan gerrymandering,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.450
drawing a whole pattern
of districts to suit

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.740
one whole political party.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.900
Redistricting happens
every 10 years.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.340
This leads to a
situation in which

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.610
close to 100 seats in Congress
are less competitive than they

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.300
would be otherwise.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.310
Intuitively we think
about gerrymandering

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.311
as centering around weird
shaped boundaries, right?

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.810
Strangely shaped
boundaries that are

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.600
crooked that have funny
bumps and valleys and so on.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.610
It turns out that's
not such a great way

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.410
to define a gerrymander.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.489
Because voters tend to live in
communities of like mindedness,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.800
imagine a city that
is mostly Democrats

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560
and imagine it surrounded
by a community of voters

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.340
who are mostly Republicans
distributed over space.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.590
It is possible to
creatively draw lines

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.720
where we can pack the
Democrats in one district,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.640
for instance, by
drawing a boundary

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.530
that encompasses
most of the Democrats

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.620
in a single nicely
circularly shaped district,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.870
and then distributing
the remaining Democrats

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.510
over remaining districts
so that in the end

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.730
the Republicans get an
overwhelming advantage.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.170
You can take the same
map and do the opposite.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.680
You can take this nice cluster
of voters in the center

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.400
and now take wedges
out of that center city

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.550
and now create pie slices, and
the first bite of each pizza

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.910
slice will then be just
enough to make that slice

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.459
a secure win for Democrats.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.000
Therefore it's
possible to draw lines

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.210
to make it either running
the table for Republicans

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.190
or running the
table for Democrats,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.620
depending on what
legislators want.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.860
So what's left is to come
up with some standard

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.230
where gerrymandering
can be defined

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.829
without reference to maps.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620
And it turns out there
is a tool available.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.100
The idea is to invoke the
idea of partisan symmetry.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.240
If one side has 75, 80 percent
of the vote in district

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.390
after district, that
side has been packed.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.010
When one side wins
in landslides,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.230
but the other side's
wins are closer,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.900
the question arises,
did this overall pattern

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.730
occur incidentally as if by
chance or by nonpartisan means?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.920
If not, then we would conclude
that one side's voters

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.430
were packed more than the
others as if on purpose.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.080
It turns out this is the
easiest thing that you can test.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.460
In all the sciences
and all of engineering,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.280
the most widely used
test is something

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.890
called Student's T-test.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.510
And it was made possible
by this guy William Gosset.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.300
Gosset lived in the
early 20th century.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.000
He was chief experimental
brewer of the Guinness Company

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.050
in Ireland.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.380
Gosset had this problem of how
to tell if whether hops quality

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.880
was good.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.420
And he was very
pleased about this.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.910
And he said OK, I would
like to publish this.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.690
And his lab notebook said
student’s laboratory notebook.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.530
And he had a bit of
a sense of humor,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.420
and he said, oh I'm a student.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.860
And so to this day it's
called Student's T-test.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.000
The T-test compares
two averages.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.070
Here the two averages
are of the winning vote

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.530
share in Democratic districts
and the winning vote

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.790
share in Republican districts.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.670
The T-test asks whether two
averages are different enough

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.220
that they are unlikely to
have arisen incidentally

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.560
from nonpartisan mechanisms.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.870
For example,
redistricters want to draw

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.040
straight-ish boundaries.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.400
They want to honor
communities of interest.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.360
They want to follow other
rules that are set down in law.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.580
And for those reasons,
averages can sometimes

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.410
be a little bit
different, advantaging

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.970
one side or the other side.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.450
What the T-test asks is,
is that difference so large

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.670
that it could not have
arisen incidentally?

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.890
And if that's the
case, then what we have

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.680
is a likely gerrymander.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.170
A great example of
partisan asymmetry

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.110
that can be detected using
the T-test is North Carolina.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.450
2010 was a wave election
for the Republicans.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.180
And with their new control
over the redistricting process,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.260
they created an
advantage for themselves.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.220
It was a perfect inversion of
what had happened previously.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.620
Democrats ended up with
four congressional districts

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.470
and Republicans ended up with
nine congressional districts,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.320
despite the fact that
Democratic candidates won

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.580
more votes that year.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.000
This pattern was repeated
in 2014 and 2016.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.140
And in each case, the vote
was reasonably closely split,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.560
but in each case, the Democrats
won more lopsided wins.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.870
And the T-test tells
us that this difference

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.420
between Democratic wins
and Republican wins

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.290
could not have arisen by chance.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.350
There is overwhelming
public opinion

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.140
against gerrymandering
and a general sense

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.870
that it ought to be addressed.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.150
And there are two ways.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.230
One is through courts and
the other is by activists.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.010
Courts could say we will define
gerrymandering as violation

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.360
of partisan symmetry.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.160
Are the two parties being
treated fairly and equally?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.964
And if they're not, then
there's partisan asymmetry.

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:04.130
And the Supreme Court has
expressed some willingness

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.980
to do that.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.800
Another route is for activists.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.250
Voters have started to
pass fair districting laws.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.290
The risk is that they
may leave loopholes

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.650
by not thinking ahead and
realizing that in fact there

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.260
is still the possibility
of partisan asymmetry,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.670
so writing into
the law something

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.670
like a simple statistical
test like the T-test would

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.260
close that last loophole.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.050
Here's an opportunity to
make the democratic process

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.250
work a little bit better.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.920
If this effort succeeds, what
we're going to end up with

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.110
is a situation that the
founders envisioned.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.330
The voters pick their
legislators and not

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.300
the other way around.
