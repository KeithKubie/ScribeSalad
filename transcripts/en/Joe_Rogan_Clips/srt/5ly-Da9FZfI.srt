1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,820
My one of my dad's favorite
comics was a Stan hope.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,890
He loves Stan Hope I'll never forget.

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,910
I did a show with Stan hope in Syracuse
actually in in when my dad was sitting

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,880
next to me while we're watching Stan hope
and he leaned over, he was like, man,

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,120
the mind on this guy.
It's like one of the brightest,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,370
brightest people I've ever heard in my
life. Dutch get out more. He, well, he's,

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,330
he's in a grave now.
He's only getting out was a ghost.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,570
He's probably a drunk ghost at some girl's
house right now because he can't find,

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,470
mine was getting ready to film another
special. Yeah, very excited. Watch. Yeah,

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,310
it's going to be great. Sandal
was, he's like the, I don't know.

11
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,920
He's like the equalizer when it
comes to what's going on in society.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,690
It just has a way of being like,
boom,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,990
this is what's going on with gun control
and with people being offended by

14
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,760
terminology and words. Here's
why it's ridiculous. Yeah.
He's good like that. Well,

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,560
he works. He's a guy that he and
he works on his own schedule.

16
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,850
He decides when to write, when to
perform, when the tour, what to do.

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,260
And he was always like,
am I just fucking retire right back at it?

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,770
And you're special coming out next
year. He's always, he's always working.

19
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,270
He always working. He has his own lane.
Yeah, he's amazing. I love watching him.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,310
Glad he's out there cause he's just like,

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,230
he's basically an older version of the
guy. He was like 20 plus years ago.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,430
It's not changed at all other
than like become more wacky.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,350
Was fucking goofy suits and Jay

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,190
let's fucking suits. Every time I see
him, what the fuck? But here's the thing,

25
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:33,270
like that's one of the things like he
owns the solution can wear the suit if you

26
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,320
wear a goofy suit,

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
like a really shitty suit like Stan hope
were peach colored suit with ruffles.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,490
He wears loafers.
Like a old man from caddy shack.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,020
He looks like he used to sell cars
20 years ago and kept the outfit.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Frazier Smith's long lost cousin.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,720
He looks like a 12 Toledo
cousin from Toledo sells cars.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,940
He looks like a ghost from the titanic.
He rents out clowns,

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,900
shoes, those shoes I button. You're
right. That's his, that's his thing.

34
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,903
That's his look.

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,980
No one can do suits and he's been
rocking this look for quite a while now.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,670
Like he used to dress like a
normal person. I mean there was a,

37
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,000
there was always a level of
uh, of eccentric. You have any,

38
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,570
he can replace his
entire wardrobe for $40.

39
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,370
Yeah, I mean you could get that
jacket for $2 and it's amazing.

40
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:36,240
Then he finds him all that seemed to
be tailored. It's like he gets a fraud,

41
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:40,260
he takes these things. He takes these
shitty fabrics to like a real high end.

42
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,640
Taylor. And he has them like slim fit it
and he gets them for tens. He finds them.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,030
He doesn't,
he find someone,

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,070
me definitely get some nice tailored look
at that shirt, bum jacket, the shirt.

45
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,740
And it's not bombed though. It's all
nice and killing. It's nice and clean.

46
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,320
But I'm saying it looks like a bum
that struck it rich real quick.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,450
Like he got money fast and
didn't know what to do.

48
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,400
So he just bought the same suits,
but cleaner.
