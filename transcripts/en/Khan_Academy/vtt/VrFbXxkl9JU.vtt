00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.620
Let's say we have two
entrepreneurs.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.700
And they are both interested
in buying a pizzeria and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.480
eventually turning it into
a public company.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.640
So let's compare the two.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.630
So let me draw a dividing line
here between the first and the

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.260
second entrepreneurs.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.460
And they're actually going
to buy identical assets.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.140
So they're going to buy
a pizzeria with the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.460
ovens inside of them.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.250
And the same amount of cash
in the cash register.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.980
Everything they need to operate
the pizzeria and they

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.550
may be in identical locations.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.790
Maybe right next to each other
at the same intersection.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.220
Or across the street
from each other.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.400
It's the same asset.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.270
Let me draw that out.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.830
I don't want to draw this box.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.620
So that's the asset.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.410
And it costs $100,000.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.910
That includes the building.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.160
It includes the oven.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420
It includes the places where
the customers come sit.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.870
It even includes
the cash needed

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.190
to operate the business.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.800
So you need some cash to pay
vendors just to get started

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.540
and to pay for things
like dough.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.270
And have some money in
the cash register.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.250
And to have a little bit
of a bank account.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.890
Things like that.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.130
So that's all inclusive.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.100
All of the assets needed to
start the firm, the pizzeria.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.820
So this is the assets.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.100
And they both buy identical
assets.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.350
So let me copy and paste that.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.870
They buy identical assets.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.720
Now, the first entrepreneur,
he's very conservative and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.930
he's been saving all his
whole life to do this.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.840
So he actually has $100,000 of
cash to buy his pizzeria, so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.010
he buys it outright.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.115
So he owns it outright so all of
the $100,000 of asset value

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:38.060
is actually his equity.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.875
Let me do equity in
a different color.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.690
It's all his equity.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.040
So that's all his equity.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.060
This guy here, maybe he's a
little bit earlier in his

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170
career, or he's just not as
good at saving money.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.040
So he doesn't quite
have $100,000.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.190
He actually only has $10,000
in his pocket.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.450
But he's a smooth talker.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480
So he goes to the local bank
and says, hey I have this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.350
great idea for-- let me write
this down, $10,000 of equity,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.590
that's what he has-- but he
tells the guy at the bank, and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.676
he buys him lunch, and he says,
I have this great idea

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.080
for a pizzeria.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.630
And they agree to give
him not just $90,000.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.160
This guy, he's a little
ambitious too.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
He thinks not just beside
a pizzeria.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.970
In the name of the pizzeria
he's going to borrow some

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.110
money and then maybe invest that
in stocks or something.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.780
So he gets a sweetheart
deal on the loan.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.970
And he's able to actually borrow
a little bit more than

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.760
what he even needs.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.530
He only needs $90,000, but let's
say he borrows $100,000.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.140
So he borrows $100,000
of debt.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.490
And so, he has $110,000
to play with.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.280
He buys a $100,000 pizzeria.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.150
And then he has another $10,000
left over to do with

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.800
what he wants.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.460
And he puts it in the pizzeria's
name, in the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.100
pizzeria's bank account.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.800
Because he has to show the bank
that it's going towards

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.090
the pizzeria.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.570
But his real intent is to maybe
gamble with it on the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.110
side in the pizzeria's name, and
maybe invest in stocks or

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.600
speculate on pork
belly futures or

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.340
something like that.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.600
But for all intents and
purposes it's cash.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.460
And so they go off and they
start their pizzeria.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.140
Let's see what happens.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.570
So let's look at them over
the course of one year.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.820
So let's say, revenue.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.490
So let's say the first year
they're identical.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.150
They both make $100,000
in revenue.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.890
Let's say their cost of goods
sold is roughly 50% of that.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.340
So it's $50,000.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.020
I'll put a minus there because
it's an expense.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.910
Minus $50,000.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.770
So both of their gross
profit is $50,000.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.510
And then their SG&amp;A
is the same.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.140
If you've watched the video on
depreciation and amortization,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.510
this might even include the
depreciation on some of the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.279
physical assets they've
bought, or maybe the

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.850
amortization on the rights to
the name Super Pizzeria.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.540
In either case.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.730
Maybe the brands
are identical.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.010
So that's another $20,000.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.350
Minus $20,000.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.790
So far they look very,
very identical.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.000
And that's because they have
the same exact asset.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.250
So their operating profit.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.780
50 minus 20 is $30,000.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.020
And now we'll start to see
a little difference.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.210
And this goes back to the
very first video we saw.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.480
It says if you have an identical
asset and it's being

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.060
managed identically, which it
is in this case, they will

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.700
generate an identical amount
of operating profit.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.660
But when I talk about the asset,
I'm talking about only

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.570
the operating assets.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.600
This guy has some non-operating
assets, although

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.690
it's officially part
of the company.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.100
He doesn't need it to operate.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.330
This is cash above
and beyond what's

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.740
needed in the cash register.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.530
And we might have a little bit
of cash here in this asset

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.410
that's needed for the
cash register.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.980
And I'll teach you more
about working capital.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.370
But in order to pay vendors
and things like this.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.480
This is cash above and beyond
what's necessary.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.525
This guy has a little
bit of cash just

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.650
to operate the business.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.310
He just doesn't have this
gambling cash out here.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.830
So now we add an interesting
line.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.120
Non-operating income.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.850
This guy doesn't
make anything.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.150
He's not gambling.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.090
This guy's pretty good
with this $10,000

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.320
of speculation cash.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.300
He makes, say, 20% on it
in this first year.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.060
So he makes $2,000.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.120
And then we have interest
expense.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
This guy has no debt.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.610
Very prudent.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:04.240
He has no interest. So his
pre-tax income is $30,000.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.210
This guy, he does have interest.
And let's say on

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.580
that $100,000 of debt, he
got a really good deal.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.930
Let's say that the Fed thought
that he was systemically

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.390
important to the future of
our financial system.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.290
So he gave him a sweetheart 2%
debt deal, because he was

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.570
afraid that if this pizzeria
were to fail, it would bring

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.930
down the entire financial
system.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.810
So given that 2% on
$100,000 debt.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.190
That's $2,000 of debt a year.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.840
So minus $2,000.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.240
I'll make it a little
bit more realistic.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.990
Let's say it's 5%.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.330
So 5% on $100,000 is $5,000
per year in interest. So

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.440
that's his interest expense.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.910
Let me write that.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.490
This was interest. This
was non-op income.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.690
This was operating profit.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.320
You just have to carry
the lines over.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.330
And so his pre-tax income
is now 30 plus

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.620
2 minus 5 is $27,000.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.010
They both pay 30% in taxes.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.090
And so this guy's
paying $10,000.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.460
Well, actually, $9,000
would be 30%.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.330
And this guy, 30% of 27.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.720
So let's see.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.570
Taxes.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.710
3, 6,000 plus-- 8,100.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.970
Minus $8,100.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.250
Is that right?

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.540
Yeah.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.820
That's $9,000.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.490
And then if you have $3,000
less, you should be $900 less.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.610
Yep, that's right.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.780
And so, we're finally at
the net income line.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.880
This guy makes $21,000.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.390
This guy makes-- what is this?

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:58.140
This is $18,900 net income.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.150
And of course the difference
is the money that he had to

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.900
spend on tax.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.420
On interest expense.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.120
If you net out all of his little
financial engineering,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.290
he had to pay $3,000 more in
interest, if you net out his

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.080
profit he made on his little
cash bets, his side bets.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.000
And that was able to
be a tax deduction.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.420
So the actual effect ends
up being $2,100.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.020
Which is essentially $3,000
of a 30% tax rate.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.280
So, fair enough.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.350
That's not what I
want to do here.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.790
I don't want to focus too much
on the tax savings on

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.559
interest. What I want to do here
is focus on valuation and

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.520
see whether the price to
earnings ratio holds up to

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.669
scrutiny in this situation,
where you have an identical

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.950
asset but very different
capital structures.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.640
So let's say they both
have 10,000 shares.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.070
I'll arbitrarily switch colors.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.380
10,000.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.150
So EPS.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.960
This guy made $21,000
this year.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.480
Divided by 10,000 shares
is $2.10 per share.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.080
This guy, $18,900 divided by
$10,000 is $1.89 per share.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.450
And we could have modeled
out their

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.460
income statements further.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.360
And actually, this guy, even if
the top line, even if the

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.900
revenue grew the same and the
operating profit grew the

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.260
same, because of his leverage
he would actually grow a

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.980
little bit faster.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.380
I'll do another video on how
that works with leverage.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.090
But let's say that someone looks
at this and says, OK,

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.780
it's the same business
and everything.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.250
And if anything, this guy's
growing a little bit faster

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.350
because he's got that leverage,
that extra juice

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.630
from the financials, from the
capital structure he's got.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.060
So they both deserve at least
a price to earnings of 10.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.330
So you say, they both deserve
a price to earnings of 10.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.090
So 10 price to earnings.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.340
You'd say, I'm willing to
pay $21 for this guy.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.410
And I'm willing to pay
$18.90 for this guy.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.860
Now what does that result in
their valuation, or in terms

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.670
of their market cap?

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.050
So in this guy's case,
market cap.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.850
$21 times 21,000 times 10,000
shares, means that you are

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.630
ascribing a-- 21 times 10--
you're saying that the equity

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.330
in this company is
worth $210,000.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.320
In this case, you're saying
that the equity in this

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.850
company is worth $189,000.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.600
So this one's worth a little bit
more, because it's earning

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.170
a little bit more money.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.290
Although I don't want to
complicate it, but you might

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.310
be willing to pay a higher
multiple here.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.400
So something very interesting
is happening.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.980
By applying the same price to
earnings, we're saying that

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.990
the market value of this equity
is $210,000, while the

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:56.590
market value of this equity is--
what was it?-- $189,000.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.710
Something doesn't seem
to make sense.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.740
This guy put up $100,000,
and sure, they invested

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.620
it and did all that.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.650
So now the market's willing to
say, hey, you know what?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.160
This is a pretty profitable
business, more profitable than

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.900
most. You're making
good margins.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.580
And I'll do a bunch of videos
on margins in the future.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.720
We're willing to say that
the market value of

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.020
your equity is $210,000.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.030
Which implicitly means that the
market value of this asset

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.230
is $210,000.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.340
They're saying, this
is worth $210,000.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.810
That's because this must
be worth $210,000.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.140
But if you look here, by giving
the same price to

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.990
earnings, because they're
the same business.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.750
And maybe this guy's even
growing faster, so maybe

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.060
they're being conservative by
only giving this guy a 10

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.190
price to earnings.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.590
You get a $189,000 market
cap for this equity.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.880
Which, all of a sudden, this guy
only put in $10,000, and

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.490
people are saying it's
worth $189,000?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.740
And if this little fraction
right here is $189,000, then

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.890
it implies what about
this asset?

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.600
What does it imply about the
value of that asset?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.990
You have $189,000 as the
value of this equity.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.320
The value of this debt
is $100,000.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.070
So the market is saying, the
right-hand side of the balance

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.870
sheet is what?

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.780
It's $189,000 plus $100,000.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.125
It's $289,000.

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.845
And let's say this cash
is still cash.

00:12:18.845 --> 00:12:20.270
It's worth $10,000.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.340
So if you subtract it out, the
market is saying, this is

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.380
$289,000 minus this
$10,000, $279,000.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.960
So something is very
bizarre right here.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.490
That the market-- just because
of how this guy has

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.780
capitalized his company--
if they just apprised a

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.540
superficial price to earnings of
10 to both companies, it's

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.080
willing to say that this asset
is worth $279,000, and this

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.970
asset's only worth $210,000,
even though

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.190
they're identical assets!

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.983
So I've already used more than
enough time on this video, so

00:12:52.983 --> 00:12:54.290
I'll let you ponder
that a little bit.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.220
In the next video, I'll show you
that the reason why this

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.590
is kind of breaking down is
because a price to earnings

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.790
ratio does break down to a
certain degree when you start

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.580
comparing things with different
capital structures.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.590
And in the next video, I'll
introduce you to other ways of

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.900
comparing things with a
different capital structures,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.730
or essentially deleveraging
them.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.620
That when you just talk about
price to earnings or market

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.820
capitalization-- when you
just looked at market

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.030
capitalization, it looked OK.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.150
Oh, they're similar
businesses.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.490
This one's worth a little
bit more because

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.880
this one has debt.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.270
But when you actually back out
the implicit value of the

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.150
asset, all of a sudden you
realize that you're really

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.960
overpaying for this asset.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.340
So think about that
a little bit.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.810
What's the conundrum here?

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.830
What went wrong?

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.300
And in the next video I'll
give you some tools to

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.470
actually do this right.
