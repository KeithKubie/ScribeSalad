00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:05.205
Voiceover:Below is a drawing
of vectors U,V, and W.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.745
Sort the cards according

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:08.726
to the quantity they represent.

00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:11.217
If a card doesn't represent
any of the quantities,

00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:12.890
it should be left unsorted.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.275
Let's see what they have over here.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.525
This, they've drawn vector V here in blue,

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:19.238
vector W here in magenta,

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:21.585
and then vector U here in purple.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.290
Let's see what they choices are.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.505
The rectangular coordinates 3,4.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:32.551
If we go 3 along the X axis
in the positive direction,

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.213
and then we go up 4, 1,2,3,4,

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:39.894
we get to the head of vector V.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:42.701
It's tail, it started at the origin.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:48.254
This could, right over
here, represent vector V.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:49.998
If we say hey look, the tail of our vector

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:51.089
is going to be the origin,

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.862
then this coordinate, right over here,

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:54.241
represents the head of a vector.

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.974
This could be a
representation for vector V.

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.493
Another way to think about it is vector V,

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:01.963
from it's tail, goes 3 in
the horizontal direction

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.577
and 4 in the vertical direction.

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:05.973
That's another way to think about it.

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:07.518
I would say that's definitely

00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:09.023
a representation of vector V.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:11.406
The number 5.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.910
The number 5 won't represent a vector.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.525
This is just a number.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:17.750
This could be a magnitude,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.603
but to be a vector,

00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:20.666
we need a magnitude and a direction.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.679
Right over here we have
the magnitude of vector V.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.652
Let's think about whether 5

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.307
could be the magnitude of vector V.

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:29.466
If 5 is the magnitude,

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.318
it would be the length of this vector.

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:32.913
We could think about that

00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:34.405
from the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:37.365
This side, right over here, has length 3.

00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:39.859
That side over there has length 4.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.918
You might recognize this
as a 3,4,5 triangle.

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:45.073
Another way to think about it

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:46.662
if we use the Pythagorean theorem

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:51.665
3 squared is 9 plus 4
squared plus 16 is 25,

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.851
which is going to be
this magnitude squared.

00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.416
The magnitude of vector V is 5.

00:01:57.308 --> 00:01:59.044
We could throw that right over here.

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:01.031
The magnitude of vector V is 5.

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:05.918
The length of this, how
we depicted the vector.

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:08.869
Let's look at vector U.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.810
Vector U is just a shifted
representation of vector V.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.401
Notice, we started its tail,

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:21.160
3 to the right and 4 up.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.858
Vector U is really the
same thing as vector V.

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:27.739
We don't care about where they start.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.510
We just care about, from
the tail to the head,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.093
how much do you move in
the horizontal direction,

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:34.883
and how much do you move
in the vertical direction,

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:37.207
and for both of them, you move positive 3

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:40.022
in the horizontal and
positive 4 in the vertical.

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:43.972
Vector U really is the
same thing as vector V

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:45.815
if we're thinking in vector terms.

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:52.026
Vector W, if we start at the tail

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:54.023
to go to the head, we have to

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:56.605
go negative 3 in the X direction

00:02:56.605 --> 00:03:00.014
and negative 4 in the Y direction.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.254
Vector W is the negative of vector V,

00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:04.865
or the negative of vector U,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.950
but it's not equal to either one of them.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.553
We're all done, we have set up.

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:11.534
These are the quantities that

00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:14.495
are in the appropriate buckets.
