00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.450
Thought I would do
a video on communism

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.430
just because I've been talking
about it a bunch in the history

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.006
videos, and I haven't given
you a good definition of what

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.130
it means, or a good
understanding of what it means.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.370
And to understand
communism-- let

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.580
me just draw a spectrum here.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.820
So I'm going to start
with capitalism.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
And this is really just
going to be an overview.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.630
People can do a whole PhD
thesis on this type of thing.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.800
Capitalism, and then I'll
get a little bit more--

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.710
and then we could
progress to socialism.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.480
And then we can go to communism.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.230
And the modern
versions of communism

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.630
are really kind
of the brainchild

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.680
of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.620
Karl Marx was a
German philosopher

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.110
in the 1800s, who, in his
Communist Manifesto and other

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.680
writings, kind of created the
philosophical underpinnings

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.900
for communism.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.580
And Vladimir Lenin, who led
the Bolshevik Revolution

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.710
in the-- and created,
essentially, the Soviet Union--

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.710
he's the first person to make
some of Karl Marx's ideas

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.770
more concrete.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.030
And really every
nation or every country

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670
which we view as
communist has really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.077
followed the pattern
of Vladimir Lenin.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:08.660
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.200
But first, let's talk about
the philosophical differences

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.230
between these things,
and how you would move.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.420
And Karl Marx himself
viewed communism

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.040
as kind of a progression
from capitalism

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.480
through socialism to communism.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.930
So what he saw in capitalism--
and at least this part

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.550
of what he saw was
right-- is that you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.590
have private property,
private ownership of land.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.780
That's the main
aspect of capitalism.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.300
And this is the world that
most of us live in today.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.820
The problem that he
saw with capitalism

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.750
is he thought,
well, look, when you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.220
have private property, the
people who start accumulating

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.590
some capital-- and when
we talk about capital,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.010
we could be talking
about land, we

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.180
could be talking
about factories,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.750
we could be talking about any
type of natural resources--

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.500
so the people who start
getting a little bit of them--

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.130
so let me draw a
little diagram here.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.990
So let's say someone has
a little bit of capital.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.090
And that capital could be a
factory, or it could be land.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.740
So let me write it.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.030
Capital.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.410
And let's just say it's land.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.170
So let's say someone starts
to own a little bit of land.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.290
And he owns more
than everyone else.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.630
So then you just have
a bunch of other people

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.762
who don't own land.

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:22.720
But they need, essentially--
and since this guy

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.365
owns all the land, they've got
to work on this guy's land.

00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:28.130
They have to work
on this guy's land.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.690
And from Karl Marx's point
of view, he said, look,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.140
you have all of these laborers
who don't have as much capital.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.120
This guy has this capital.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.520
And so he can make
these laborers work

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.740
for a very small wage.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.400
And so any excess
profits that come out

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.532
from this arrangement,
the owner of the capital

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:49.490
will be able to get it.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.560
Because these laborers
won't be able to get

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
their wages to go up.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.720
Because there's so much
competition for them

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.597
to work on this guy's farm or
to work on this guy's land.

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:01.430
He really didn't think
too much about, well,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.662
maybe the competition
could go the other way.

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:06.620
Maybe you could have a
reality eventually where

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.090
you have a bunch of people with
reasonable amounts of capital,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.580
and you have a
bunch of laborers.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.900
And the bunch of people would
compete for the laborers,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.760
and maybe the laborers could
make their wages go up,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.649
and they could eventually
accumulate their own capital.

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.940
They could eventually start
their own small businesses.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.773
So he really didn't
think about this reality

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:27.770
too much over here.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.840
He just saw this reality.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.224
And to his defense--
and I don't want

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.140
to get in the habit of
defending Karl Marx too

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.990
much-- to his
defense, this is what

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.290
was happening in the
late 1800s, especially--

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.010
we have the
Industrial Revolution.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.750
Even in the United
States, you did

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.310
have kind of-- Mark Twain
called it the Gilded Age.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.600
You have these
industrialists who

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.070
did accumulate huge
amounts of capital.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.830
They really did have
a lot of the leverage

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.860
relative to the laborers.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.870
And so what Karl Marx
says, well, look,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.450
if the guy with all the
capital has all the leverage,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.471
and this whole arrangement
makes some profits,

00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:02.220
he's going to be able
to keep the profits.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.020
Because he can keep all
of these dudes' wages low.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.710
And so what's going to happen
is that the guy with the capital

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.650
is just going to end
up with more capital.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.820
And he's going to have
even more leverage.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.500
And he'll be able to keep these
people on kind of a basic wage,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.779
so that they can never acquire
capital for themselves.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.610
So in Karl Marx's point of
view, the natural progression

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.870
would be for these people
to start organizing.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.070
So these people maybe start
organizing into unions.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.620
So they could collectively
tell the person who

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.460
owns the land or the factory,
no, we're not going to work,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.650
or we're going to go on strike
unless you increase our wages,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.910
or unless you give us
better working conditions.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.390
So when you start talking
about this unionization stuff,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.350
you're starting to move in
the direction of socialism.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.010
The other element of moving
in the direction of socialism

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.970
is that Karl Marx
didn't like this kind

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.900
of high concentration-- or
this is socialists in general,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.810
I should say-- didn't like this
high concentration of wealth.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.630
That you have this
reality of not only

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.110
do you have these people
who could accumulate all

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.000
of this wealth-- and
maybe, to some degree,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.541
they were able to accumulate it
because they were innovative,

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.500
or they were good
managers of land,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.630
or whatever, although
the Marxists don't

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.727
give a lot of credit to
the owners of capital.

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:18.310
They don't really
give a lot of credit

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.476
to saying maybe they did
have some skill in managing

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:22.060
some type of an operation.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.530
But the other problem is is
that it gets handed over.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.110
It gets handed over
to their offspring.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.200
So private property, you have
this situation where it just

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.630
goes from maybe father to son,
or from parent to a child.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.020
And so it's not even based
on any type of meritocracy.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.630
It's really just based
on this inherited wealth.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.720
And this is a problem that
definitely happened in Europe.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.730
When you go back to
the French Revolution,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.560
you have generation after
generation of nobility,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.720
regardless of how incompetent
each generation would

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.824
be, they just had so much wealth
that they were essentially

00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:56.865
in control of everything.

00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:59.730
And you had a bunch of
people with no wealth

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.830
having to work for them.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.829
And when you have that
type of wealth disparity,

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.090
it does lead to revolutions.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.920
So another principle of moving
in the socialist direction

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.320
is kind of a
redistribution of wealth.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.570
So let me write it over here.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.320
So redistribution.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.030
So in socialism, you can
still have private property.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.467
But the government
takes a bigger role.

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:24.800
So you have-- let me write this.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.787
Larger government.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.370
And one of the roles
of the government

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.760
is to redistribute wealth.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.380
And the government
also starts having

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.010
control of the major
factors of production.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.320
So maybe the
utilities, maybe some

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.810
of the large factories that do
major things, all of a sudden

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.390
starts to become in the
hands of the government,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.490
or in the words of communists,
in the hands of the people.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.170
And the redistribution
is going on,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.540
so in theory, you don't
have huge amounts of wealth

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.920
in the hands of a few people.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.920
And then you keep-- if
you take these ideas

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.020
to their natural
conclusion, you get

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.980
to the theoretical
communist state.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.950
And the theoretical
communist state

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.900
is a classless, and
maybe even a little bit--

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.230
a classless society, and in Karl
Marx's point of view-- and this

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.485
is a little harder to
imagine-- a stateless society.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.820
So in capitalism, you
definitely had classes.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.096
You had the class
that owns the capital,

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:29.470
and then you had
the labor class,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.710
and you have all
of these divisions,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.293
and they're different
from each other.

00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:35.830
He didn't really imagine a
world that maybe a laborer could

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.060
get out of this, they could
get their own capital,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.210
then maybe they could
start their own business.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.790
So he just saw this tension
would eventually to socialism,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.970
and eventually a
classless society where

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.220
you have a central--
Well, he didn't even

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.390
go too much into the details
but you have kind of equal,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.340
everyone in society has
ownership over everything,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.770
and society somehow
figures out where

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.170
things should be allocated,
and all of the rest.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.790
And it's all stateless.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.510
And that's even harder to think
about in a concrete fashion.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.710
So that's Karl Marx's
view of things.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.810
But it never really
became concrete

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.400
until Vladimir Lenin shows up.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.450
And so the current
version of communism

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.190
that we-- The current thing that
most of us view as communism

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:25.350
is sometimes viewed as a
Marxist-Leninist state.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.080
These are sometimes
used interchangeably.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.380
Marxism is kind of the pure,
utopian, we're eventually

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.500
going to get to a world
where everyone is equal,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.390
everyone is doing
exactly what they want,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.409
there's an abundance
of everything.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.042
I guess to some
degree, it's kind

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:44.500
of describing what happens in
Star Trek, where everyone can

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.322
go to a replicator and
get what they want.

00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:48.030
And if you want to
paint part of the day,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.664
you can paint part of the day,
and you're not just a painter,

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.080
you can also do
whatever you want.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.992
So it's this very utopian thing.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:54.950
Let me write that down.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:00.010
So pure Marxism is kind
of a utopian society.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.400
And just in case you don't
know what utopian means,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.810
it's kind of a perfect society,
where you don't have classes,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.340
everyone is equal, everyone
is leading these kind

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.970
of rich, diverse,
fulfilling lives.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.990
And it's also, utopian is also
kind of viewed as unrealistic.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.650
It's kind of, if you view it
in the more negative light, is

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.840
like, hey, I don't
know how we'll ever

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.540
be able to get there.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.140
Who knows?

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.681
I don't want to be
negative about it.

00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:23.680
Maybe we will one day
get to a utopian society.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.370
But Leninist is kind of the more
practical element of communism.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.790
Because obviously, after the
Bolshevik Revolution, 1917,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.300
in the Russian Empire, the
Soviet Union gets created,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.200
they have to actually
run a government.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.860
They have to actually
run a state based

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.810
on these ideas of communism.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.240
And in a Leninist
philosophy-- and this

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.660
is where it starts to become
in tension with the ideas

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.490
of democracy-- in a
Leninist philosophy,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.910
you need this kind
of a party system.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.680
So you need this-- and he
calls this the Vanguard Party.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.480
So the vanguard is kind of
the thing that's leading,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.210
the one that's
leading the march.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.490
So this Vanguard
Party that kind of

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.010
creates this constant
state of revolution,

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:10.660
and its whole job is to guide
society, is to kind of almost

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.130
be the parent of society,
and take it from capitalism

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.020
through socialism to this
ideal state of communism.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.710
And it's one of
those things where

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.010
the ideal state of
communism was never--

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.140
it's kind of hard to
know when you get there.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.490
And so what happens
in a Leninist state is

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.430
it's this Vanguard Party, which
is usually called the Communist

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.990
Party, is in a constant state
of revolution, kind of saying,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.810
hey, we're shepherding the
people to some future state

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.750
without a real clear definition
of what that future state is.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.787
And so when you talk
about Marxist-Leninist,

00:10:42.787 --> 00:10:44.370
besides talking about
what's happening

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.390
in the economic
sphere, it's also

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.470
kind of talking about this party
system, this party system where

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.800
you really just have one
dominant party that it will

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.465
hopefully act in the
interest of the people.

00:10:56.465 --> 00:11:02.800
So one dominant
communist party that

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.360
acts in the interest
of the people.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.837
And obviously, the negative
here is that how do

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.420
you know that they
actually are acting

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.440
in the interest of people?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.481
How do you know that they
actually are competent?

00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:16.120
What means are
there to do anything

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.750
if they are misallocating
things, if it is corrupt,

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.220
if you only have a
one-party system?

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.630
And just to make it clear,
the largest existing communist

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.460
state is the People's
Republic of China.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.700
And although it is controlled
by the Communist Party,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.306
in economic terms it's really
not that communist anymore.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:36.430
And so it can be confusing.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.560
And so what I want to do is
draw a little bit of a spectrum.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.070
On the vertical axis, over
here, I want to put democratic.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.070
And up here, I'll put
authoritarian or totalitarian.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.920
Let me put-- well,
I'll put authoritarian.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.800
I'll do another video
on the difference.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.820
And they're similar.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.940
And totalitarian is more an
extreme form of authoritarian,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.600
where the government
controls everything.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.662
And you have a few people
controlling everything

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:08.870
and it's very non-democratic.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.100
But authoritarian is kind
of along those directions.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.720
And then on this spectrum, we
have the capitalism, socialism,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.250
and communism.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.870
So the United States,
I would put-- I

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.290
would put the United
States someplace over here.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.150
I would put the United
States over here.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.270
It has some small
elements of socialism.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.771
You do have labor unions.

00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:31.020
They don't control everything.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.790
You also have people working
outside of labor unions.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.240
It does have some elements
of redistribution.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.790
There are inheritance taxes.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.420
There are-- I mean it's not an
extreme form of redistribution.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.950
You can still inherit
private property.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.360
You still have safety
nets for people,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.720
you have Medicare,
Medicaid, you have welfare.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.820
So there's some
elements of socialism.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.110
But it also has a very
strong capitalist history,

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.940
private property,
deep market, so I'd

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.880
stick the United
States over there.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.390
I would put the USSR--
not current Russia,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.950
but the Soviet Union
when it existed-- I

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.540
would put the Soviet
Union right about there.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:21.000
So this was the-- I would put
the USSR right over there.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.040
I would put the current
state of Russia,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.856
actually someplace over here.

00:13:28.856 --> 00:13:30.730
Because they actually
have fewer safety nets,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.722
and they kind of have
a more-- their economy

00:13:32.722 --> 00:13:34.430
can kind of go crazier,
and they actually

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.100
have a bigger
disparity in wealth

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.840
than a place like
the United States.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.640
So this is current Russia.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.490
And probably the most
interesting one here

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.790
is the People's Republic of
China, the current People's

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.970
Republic of China,
which is at least

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.060
on the surface, a
communist state.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.730
But in some ways, it's more
capitalist than the United

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.530
States, in that they don't have
strong wealth redistribution.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.400
They don't have kind of
strong safety nets for people.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.210
So you could put some
elements of China--

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.170
and over here,
closer to the left.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.900
And they are more-- less
democratic than either the US

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.097
or even current Russia,
although some people would

00:14:13.097 --> 00:14:15.430
call current Russia-- well,
I won't go too much into it.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.910
But current China, you could
throw it here a little bit.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.405
So it could be even a
little bit more capitalist

00:14:19.405 --> 00:14:20.540
than the United States.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.960
Definitely they don't even have
good labor laws, all the rest.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.540
But in other ways, you do
have state ownership of a lot,

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.850
and you do have state
control of a lot.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.150
So in some ways, they're kind
of spanning this whole range.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.960
So this right over
here is China.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.840
And even though it is called a
communist state, in some ways,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.970
it's more capitalist
than countries

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.637
that are very proud
of their capitalism.

00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:47.053
But in a lot of other ways,
especially with the government

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.070
ownership and the government
control of things,

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.760
and this one dominant
party, so it's

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.640
kind of Leninist with less
of the Marxist going on.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.570
So in that way, it is more
in the communist direction.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.310
So hopefully that clarifies
what can sometimes

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.410
be a confusing topic.
