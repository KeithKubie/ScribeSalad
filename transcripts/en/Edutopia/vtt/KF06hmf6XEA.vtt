00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:07.656
&gt;&gt;Derick: When you look at the
whole big picture as one big thing,

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:11.226
it's gonna be like, it looks
super scary, but you take it

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:13.306
like piece-by-piece,
you can get through it.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:16.796
&gt;&gt;Derick: Having the same advisor for
four years, they get a relationship

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.826
with someone that's not just
a teacher, a real person.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.036
Being able to be an important
part of their lives.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.906
And you can see the maturity level that
they take, and you see them change.

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:28.176
You see the growth in them.

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:30.546
&gt;&gt;Derick: It's stressful, lot
of stuff going on, it happens.

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:32.246
But you got it girl, you
got it, you're smart!

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:44.196
&gt;&gt;Gary: Advisory is a
small group of students,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.166
fifteen typically with an Advisor.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.346
They stay with that advisor
for four years.

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:53.346
The Advisor speaks a lot on
the behalf of the student

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:56.356
to community members or internships.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.496
The Advisor's in constant
communication with the parents.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.096
Anything that happens with that
student, it's like it happens with you.

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:07.436
&gt;&gt;Alex: I'm doing poetry,
songwriting, a short story.

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.746
That's another thing
that I'm pretty iffy

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:12.136
about when it comes to these things.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:13.306
&gt;&gt;Gary: So in that, just think

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.986
about what gives you the best
case scenario to be successful.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:21.476
&gt;&gt;Alex: Advisory gives a chance to work
on all of our schoolwork from the day.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:26.206
And our Advisor, he will sit down
with us and actually take the time

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:29.806
to work one-on-one with us and make
sure that we have what we need.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.896
&gt;&gt;Laura: The most important
thing in ninth grade Advisory

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:37.246
from Day One is setting what
the culture will be like.

00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:43.766
Teaching them how to manage their time,
their projects, due dates, syllabuses.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:46.296
Reflecting, journaling,
we do that every day.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:50.396
That happens at the very beginning,
so whatever I'm doing that I want them

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.586
to kind of take with them all four
years, it's something I model every day.

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:55.606
&gt;&gt;Laura: Don't forget your
Reflection's due Friday.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:57.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, Mr. Brown was
just talking about that today.

00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:58.736
&gt;&gt;Laura: He talked about that today?

00:01:58.736 --> 00:02:01.546
&gt;&gt;Chae: Because of the relationships
that you build within the Advisory,

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:06.116
people feel comfortable saying, "Hey,
this is what you've done well in.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.646
And these are some things
that you should work on,

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.136
because they will help you be better."

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:12.896
When a student can relate
and they know that you care,

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:14.156
that makes a big difference.

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:16.736
&gt;&gt;Laura: Just make sure you do
the tracking for these two weeks.

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.316
&gt;&gt;Laura: And if it were me,
I might pick somebody in here

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:22.456
who will hold you accountable,
and make sure that they check

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:24.196
in with you every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:25.766
&gt;&gt;Dexter: Advisory's important,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.806
because you could have people
that will always help you.

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:30.386
People that'll always support you.

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:34.486
But if you fail, then there'll be there
to pick up the pieces, and help me.

00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:37.686
&gt;&gt;Laura: Advisory is so fundamental
because as they move forward they see it

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:39.766
as a family, they see it
as people they can trust.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:40.726
&gt;&gt;Gary: Everything good?

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:41.606
&gt;&gt;Zetty: Yeah, everything's fine.

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:43.536
&gt;&gt;Gary: Okay, mom's good?

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:46.756
&gt;&gt;Gary: Has anybody called home
and said, "Zetty is killing it.

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.066
Zetty is doing so much better?"

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:49.806
No. Okay, I need to do that.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:52.516
&gt;&gt;Gary: We have a very open
and honest relationship.

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.526
And really, there's nothing off-limits,
and I like to take that approach,

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:59.746
because I know at the end of the
day that I know the real student.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:02.556
&gt;&gt;Gary: Okay, y'all, let's get
it started, let's get it jumping.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.806
&gt;&gt;Gary: Every first Friday,
we pick a menu,

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.266
and every person has a responsibility.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:11.036
They bring in their food
and we eat together

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:13.056
and we hang together
and we laugh together.

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:14.896
&gt;&gt;Gary: Robert, the lasagna's good!

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:15.416
&gt;&gt;Robert: Thank you!

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:16.626
&gt;&gt;Gary: Did your mom make it?

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:17.396
&gt;&gt;Robert: I made it.

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:18.076
&gt;&gt;Gary: What?!

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:21.146
&gt;&gt;Gary: That's just my way of
bringing them all back to this space,

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:24.646
and refocusing our energy
and hitting home the idea

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:26.646
that we're a unit, and
we're moving forward.

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:30.246
&gt;&gt;Robert: We've grown so
close from freshman year.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:34.706
And whenever we have a personal
issue, or school-related issue,

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:38.226
we talk together as a class, and we try
to help each other out all the time.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.936
&gt;&gt;Gary: Make sure that you look at
your exhibition date and time and put

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:44.386
that in your phone and
tell your parents about it.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.536
&gt;&gt;Damon: He has given me the foundation
to go out on my own and be able

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.686
to succeed in everyday life.

00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:53.786
He's given me tools and wisdom
that nobody else has given me.

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:57.306
&gt;&gt;Derick: You don't really realize
the impact you have on students

00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:00.716
until you really spend a lot
of time with them, you know,

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:01.966
and you see the growth in them.

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:03.336
&gt;&gt;Gary: And what about, how do you feel?

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:05.376
&gt;&gt;Zetty: I'm happier that
my grades are better.

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:07.966
&gt;&gt;Gary: I have this fulfillment
at the end of the line,

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:12.206
and you see this finished work, you
understand the growth that was achieved,

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:15.686
and they understand that, and that's
what makes the journey worth doing.

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:18.666
&gt;&gt;Gary: You feel like you've got it now?

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.506
&gt;&gt;Alex: Yes, I think.

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:21.526
&gt;&gt;Gary: Excellent!

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:22.056
&gt;&gt;Alex: Really?

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:25.390
[laughter]
