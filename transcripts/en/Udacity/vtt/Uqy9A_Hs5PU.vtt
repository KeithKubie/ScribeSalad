When I say stress I know you know what I'm talking about. Everyday we hear

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.074
people talk about how stressful different things are, and the fact is we live

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:11.695
in a stressful world. That's why this lesson is so important and relevant to

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:15.165
your everyday life. It's important to understand what stress is and how to

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.180
manage our stress levels, because of the psychological and physiological fact

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.230
stress has on us. And we're going to break this lesson into three main chunks.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.124
First, we'll talk about what stresses psychologically and the physiological

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:30.846
effects it has on us. Then we'll talk about different ways to deal with stress

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:34.516
which is what we called coping. And, at the end, we'll talk about how stress

00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:36.750
and coping affect our health.
