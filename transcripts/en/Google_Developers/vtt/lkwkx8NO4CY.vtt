00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.620
JOSH ESTELLE: All right.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.360
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.000
Thanks for coming.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.820
So my name's Josh Estelle.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.975
I'm a software engineer.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.840
I work on Google Translate.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.380
I've been working on that for
about seven years, and I lead

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.730
our frontend and mobile teams.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.420
Today, we're going to talk to
you about Google Translate.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.630
And this is my colleague, Rohit,
who's going to talk to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.470
you about the API towards the
second half of the talk.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.240
We're going to talk
about why machine

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790
translation is important.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.830
We're going to talk about how
Google Translate works, and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.190
then we're going to talk
about the API.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.345
So the first thing I always like
to express to people is

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:38.120
that translation is hard.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.770
This is not an easy task.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.930
Forget about computers.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.400
Forget about machines.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.600
Just translating is
hard, even for us.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.610
Even for the most multilingual,
most talented

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.670
linguists, translation is
a time-consuming task.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.000
It takes a lot of energy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.360
It takes a lot of domain
knowledge.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.080
This is a tough task.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.970
So I like to really get that
out there before we kind of

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.320
get into teaching machines
to do that tough task.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.200
This is already a hard
task for humans.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.600
But at Google, we like
hard problems.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.730
And I'm really proud
that we're able

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.270
to tackle this problem.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.360
But we're not the first.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.520
About 60 years ago, people
were already trying to do

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.820
machine translation.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.430
A lot of people argue that
translation was actually the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.650
first non-numerical task that
people tried to apply

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.710
computers to, right?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.290
Before that, it was all
numerical calculations.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.920
And this was still in the early
days of computing, but

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.925
they were already starting
about doing translation.

00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:39.410
And at Georgetown, with a joint
project with IBM, they

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.290
started a project to do
machine translation.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.710
In 1954, they did a public
demonstration.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.910
Their demonstration was on the
IBM 701, which was the first

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.690
commercially-available
mainframe.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.260
This was a big, old, slow
computer, but they did

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.190
translation on it.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.660
Their system was very simple.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.080
It had 250 vocabulary words and
six rules of grammar, and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.250
their demo only did
60 sentences

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.470
from Russian to English.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.990
Simple system, but really
impressed the public.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.730
This really got people
excited and engaged.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.170
And they were like, wow, these
amazing computer things.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.240
They can do translation.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.650
And tons of excitement, national
media coverage, and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.090
it really excited the research
going on at that time.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.910
And they predicted that they
would solve translation within

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.990
three to five years.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.510
Three to five years, we'll
have this thing done.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.880
Anyone who works on translation
now or has used

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.620
machine translation probably
realizes we didn't quite get

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.470
there in three to five years.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.730
But we're getting closer.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.425
There's been a lot of good
research and a lot of things

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:46.120
that have happened, especially
in the past 10 to 15 years,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.670
that are getting us
a long ways along.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.900
The first big one is
computational power.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.240
I don't have to tell this
audience what's the amazing

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.530
things that we can do with
computers these days, and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.970
especially comparing
to that IBM 701.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.340
That machine could do two
multiplications every second.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.790
The phones in our pockets
can do billions of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.070
computations a second.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.110
And for Google Translate, we
use data centers full of

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.180
machines with amazing
computational power.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.340
The second piece we have now
is data, tons of data.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.150
We train our system off all the
content on the web, right?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.260
Think of how big that is.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.460
Think about how many documents
are out there.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.460
We use all of it to build
the translation system.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.110
And then the last bit is where
research has come.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.560
This is academic research,
industry research.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.450
We've benefited from all that,
and we write our papers back

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.930
to that community as well.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.150
But it has led to statistical
machine translation, which is

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.140
a different approach to
translation than that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.590
rules-based system
of 50 years ago.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.850
Rules-based machine translation
uses grammar

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.650
rules, and you try to hard
code those rules into a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.680
computer and then run some
code that follows them.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680
Statistical machine translation
uses statistics

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.080
and probability to learn
language and learn how to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.220
translations work from
lots of examples.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.530
And I'll tell you more
about that later.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.560
So let's get to Google
Translate.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.590
So Google's mission, I hope
many of you know, is to

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.190
organize the world's information
and make it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.450
universally accessible
and useful.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.460
That piece of being universally
accessible, we see

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.640
machine translation as an,
essential part of that.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.899
Without machine translation,
there's tons of content out in

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.600
the world that you're never
going to be able to

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.440
understand.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.460
Now we're mostly English
speaking here, right, so we

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.870
maybe don't see this
as big a problem.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.750
But we think about our
colleagues in China and Tokyo

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.740
and other places that have less
internet penetration, and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.470
most of the internet is
not accessible to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.810
them in their language.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.290
So we think that machine
translation can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.110
really enable that.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.360
So let's get into a little
history of Google Translate.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.520
All the way back in 2001, we had
our first system launch.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.290
This was a third-party system
that we licensed, but this was

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.330
just three years after
Google was founded.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.300
Larry and Sergey saw that need
for machine translation.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.740
We had five languages initially
and then a couple

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.690
years later added a few more,
but all still licensed

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.990
third-party technology.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.220
This technology was
state-of-the-art at the time,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.020
but it was still that
rules-based machine

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.980
translation--

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.880
not all that different
from the Georgetown

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.830
experiment 60 years ago.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.170
It improved, had definitely
gotten better, but still

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.390
wasn't that great.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.090
So then in 2003, we started
taking a Google approach to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.830
machine translation, to using
lots of data and lots of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.230
computational power.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.020
Think about how web search
works, right?

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.810
We use all that content on the
web, all the links between

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.080
pages, and from that we try to
find good search results.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.040
We wanted to try the same
thing for translation--

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.510
use all those documents out on
the web, all those sentences,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.840
all those translations, and
see if we could learn from

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.790
that data and come up with
good translations.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.620
We weren't sure this
would work.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.580
But then two years later, we
participated in the NIST

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.090
Machine Translation
evaluation.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.620
NIST is the National Institute
for Standards and Technology.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.230
And we were pleasantly surprised
that our system

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.130
really worked.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.450
We outperformed all the other
competitors evaluated at that

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.570
evaluation, and we were really
proud of our system.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.460
It proved our data-driven
approach could work and

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.120
established us as a leader
in the field.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.670
Although at that time, our
research system, we only

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.310
translated 1,000 sentences for
that competition, and it took

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.510
us 40 hours to translate them.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.740
You can imagine just a single
web page might have 1,000

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.590
sentences, and we translate
many of those now.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.700
So this was way too slow.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.140
We needed to make this fast.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.940
So that was the next thing we
worked towards, and it took us

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.410
a couple more years before
we launched in 2006.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.450
The first languages that we
launched were Chinese and

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.680
Arabic, and then a little later
that year, Russian.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.640
So we kept going from there.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.830
Here's a little slide of
all of our languages.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.980
2007, we launched nine more,
and we replaced that

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.790
third-party system.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.590
So now it was completely
our own technology.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.790
2008, another 21 languages.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.860
And the big deal that year was
before 2008, we couldn't

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.140
translate to any other language

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.100
besides English, right?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.910
So Arabic to English, Chinese to
English, French to English.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.920
In 2008, now you could translate
between any of our

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.700
languages, right?

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.340
So you could go Vietnamese to
Greek and then to Serbian to

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.360
Slovak, and go between any of
the languages we support.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.440
We kept going from there,
launching lots more languages.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.900
In 2011, we launched the
commercial API that we're

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.640
going to talk about later.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.020
And now in 2013, my slide says
66 languages, and that's

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.560
what's listed there.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.230
But I crossed it out, because
the beauty of continuing to

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.170
launch new languages is
my slides get out

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.620
of date really fast.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.340
So I added this new slide.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.750
We're now up to 71 languages,
just as of a

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.280
week and a half ago.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.680
And the last five languages we
just launched are Bosnian,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.210
Cebuano, Hmong, Javanese,
and Marathi.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.080
So you see that we're starting
to get into languages that

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.080
really have a much smaller
amount of speakers out in the

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.980
world and much less data, which
is a big challenge for

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.440
us to get enough data to
build these systems.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.420
So that's a little
of the history.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.780
Let me get a little deeper
into how things work.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.470
So people and machines, we
learn to translate very

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.250
differently than each
other, right?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.240
So when humans learn to
translate or learn another

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.400
language, we learn
some vocabulary.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.060
We start learning those
grammar rules.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.430
We learn the exceptions to the
rules, the exceptions to the

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.280
exceptions, and the exception
to the exceptions to the

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.420
exceptions, and so on.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.810
Anyone who's learned another
language knows what I mean.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.760
With statistical machine
translation, that's not how

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.420
computers learn.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.940
They just see lots and
lots of examples.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.030
It's like just trying to read
hundreds of thousands of books

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.600
in two languages and just coming
out at the end and

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.620
knowing that language.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.809
So instead of describing exactly
how that works, I'm

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.460
going to try to teach
you how to learn the

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.460
way a computer does.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.780
So I'm going to start
with this example.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.100
This is a Chinese menu, right?

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.220
We've got some soups, and this
menu has both the English menu

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.920
item and then the Chinese
for the same menu item.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.410
This is a single parallel
example of text.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.980
And if you look at the one
highlighted there, you can see

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.600
"egg drop" only appears in the
English text in three of the

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.300
items, and then we can find that
Chinese character that

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.460
only appears in those
same three items.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.480
Now, I don't know for sure that
Chinese character means

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.170
"egg drop," but I think
it does, right?

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.465
It seems a good correspondence.

00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:21.100
It probably does.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.180
What about "chicken"?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.340
So can you guys figure out
which character means

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.720
"chicken?" Raise your hand
once you figure it out.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.230
OK, OK.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.870
Good.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.890
Yeah, so you don't know Chinese,
but now you know the

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.800
Chinese character for
"chicken," right?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.315
So there it is for you,
for those of you who

00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:40.120
are a little slower.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.770
This also works for
phrases, right?

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.360
So "corn cream" aligns to these
two Chinese characters.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.970
And my first example, right,
was "egg drop," two English

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.340
words to a single Chinese
character.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.190
And then what about "soup"?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.080
Can you find the Chinese
character for "soup"?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.690
Yeah, so that one's a little
bit interesting.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.700
So there's "soup."

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.590
But you'll notice in menu item
60, on the English side we say

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.530
"Cantonese wonton soup," but on
the Chinese side, we don't

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.290
see that character for "soup."
And then on 65, on the English

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.380
side, "egg drop wonton mix," but
then on the Chinese side,

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.020
we do have the character
for "soup."

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.080
So this shows that even in
situations where the

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.940
translations aren't precisely,
exactly the same word-for-word

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.090
kinds of things that we can
still learn that that

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.470
character means "soup," even
though it doesn't always work.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.900
That's how a statistical
system works, right?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.340
We learn all these probabilities
of translations

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.590
and that sort of thing.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.350
So that was one document.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.960
We need a lot more than
one document, right?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.180
We need billions and billions
and billions of documents.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.850
And the kind of documents we use
are less so like a Chinese

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.020
menu where both texts are
there, and they're more

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.010
parallel documents.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.490
So we find a web page that the
original version might be in

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.620
English, but then they've
localized into 10 more

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.440
languages, and we would find all
those parallel documents.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.380
Other good examples of parallel
documents are the

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.450
United Nations.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.500
They publish all of their
documents in their six

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.800
official languages.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.870
The European Parliament
publishes all of their

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.860
documents in 21 languages.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.910
And that's all really
good data for us.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.020
The UN data and the European
Parliament data, it's very

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.200
high-quality data, but it's
actually a very tiny amount.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.860
It's like a little drop
in the bucket of the

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.760
amount of data we need.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.960
The majority of our data, like
I was saying earlier, comes

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.820
from the web, right?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.100
Tons of data on the web.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.590
The problem with the web is
that data is noisy, right?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.670
It is a mess.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.930
Anyone who's done anything on
the web with processing web

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.720
data is like, this
stuff is crazy.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.170
You find all sorts of messy
junk on the web.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.910
But our system is able to learn,
and sort of in the same

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.000
way, that soup thing, right?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.720
Imperfect things, right, we can
still learn from that data

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.430
and learn good translations.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.040
So here's a diagram of how
our system works, a

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.570
simple version of it.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.500
We've been talking mostly about
the translations in

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.410
parallel corpora.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.170
The other part is modelling
and the model structure of

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.530
language that we use.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.340
So this kind of describes
that.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.650
So here's a German sentence
translated to English.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.070
And we use a phrase-based
translation model.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.570
And the way we model this is by
assigning probabilities to

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.660
certain aspects of
language, right?

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.380
The first one is segmentation.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.550
We need to figure out how to
break that sentence up.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.810
For German, at least we know
how to break up words.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.420
Other languages, like
Lao, don't have

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.490
spaces between words.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.230
So that becomes an even harder
problem, because you have to

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.550
find the space where the
word boundaries are.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.680
At least German, we have the
word boundaries, but we still

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.910
find phrase boundaries, right?

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.640
We decide that "nach Kanada" is
a phrase, and we don't look

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.796
at just "nach" and
just "Kanada."

00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:47.570
The second piece
is translation.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.850
That's the sort of obvious one,
that a phrase translates

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.910
to another phrase, right?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.230
So "nach Kanada" that translates
to "in Canada." .

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.860
So we have probabilities
for particular phrase

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.990
translations.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.980
And then distortions, like
reordering, right?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.870
So you can see how some of these
phrases flip around.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.090
What our system does is we model
language in that way,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.980
based on these probabilities.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.670
This formula gives us the
probability of this English

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.370
sentence given the
German sentence.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.960
And from data, we learn those
probabilities for lots of

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.260
phrases and possible ways of
doing this translation.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.530
Then when you give us some new
text, we do a search process

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.430
through all the possible phrases
we've seen, all the

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.590
different things, to
produce the most

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.180
probable translated text.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.680
Make sense?

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.930
Cool.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.220
OK.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.790
So where are we today with
Google Translate?

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.730
Google Translate,
translate.google.com, is our

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.070
main property.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.620
We also have great mobile
apps on Android and iOS.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.420
And Chrome is a really
interesting case.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.860
A lot of you have probably
seen this.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.160
When you land on a Chinese
page, it'll pop a little

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.680
banner down and say, hey,
this is Chinese.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.630
Do you want to translate it?

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.090
And you're like, sure.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.240
And then a second later--

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.350
less than a second later--

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.540
you've got a translated
web page.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.120
We're seeing this really change
how people use the web,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.120
because you're no longer running
into that language

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.160
barrier of like, oh, I wanted
to read about this temple in

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.620
China, but all I can find is
English guidebook things.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.460
But really, I want to read what
the locals think about

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:17.550
this thing.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.970
You can find some document
written in

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.560
Chinese and read it.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.330
I think that's a really
incredible thing we can do

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.210
with Chrome.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.790
We've got some really
cool numbers too.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.140
So we've got over 200 million
users of Google Translate.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.800
This is across our mobile apps
and our desktop apps.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.130
92% of those users come
from outside the

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.020
United States, right?

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.810
So that's a big user base, and
not even big here in the

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.960
United States.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.970
We're doing a billion
translations a day, and that's

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.730
the equivalent of the amount
of text you'd find in a

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.300
million books.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.040
Every day, we're translating
that amount of text, and

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.890
that's more text than all of
the world's professional

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.330
translators translate
in an entire year.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.610
So every day, we're translating
a massive amount

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.040
of content.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.115
Cool.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:02.890
So now I'm going to jump
into some demos.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.920
And live demos always fail,
so we'll see how they go.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.710
So I'm going to start with,
here's our desktop UI.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.740
Hopefully, a lot of you are
familiar with that.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.620
And I can type in to transition
"Google I/O 2013 is

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.040
the best." And then here,
you can see the Chinese

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.290
translation.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.770
We can hover over these
phrases and

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.490
see how they align.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.300
You can make edits.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.820
You can click on this.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.580
And the numerical date is fine,
but I'm going to change

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.280
it to the Chinese characters
here, because that helps me

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.250
learn the pronunciation
of those characters.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.380
And then a newer feature we
launched just about a month

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.590
ago, it's called Phrasebooks.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.240
This lets you save
translations that

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.070
are useful to you.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.670
You can see that I'm vegetarian,
and so when I'm

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.560
traveling, I try to make sure I
have some phrases with me of

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.220
how to tell people in different
languages that I

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.010
don't eat meat.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.050
So I've been saving
a bunch of those.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.200
I'll save this one I just put
in here, which gives me the

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.290
chance to show you something
we launched in mobile just

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.290
last week, I think.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.940
Let's see if can
switch to my--

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.645
oh, that's my son.

00:16:07.645 --> 00:16:09.197
All right, I'm going to
switch away, so you

00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:10.447
don't see my password.

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:14.630
OK, we're back.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.120
So here's our translate app on
Android, and I've already

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.100
switched to the Phrasebook
view.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.940
You can see those
same phrases.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.240
And I can sync, and hopefully
we'll see-- yup, there's that

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.480
new phrase that I just put
in on the desktop.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.790
In the Phrasebook, you can open
that up, and then we can

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.420
listen to that.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.300
So I want to say this to my
friend I just met at I/O that

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:33.930
speaks Chinese.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.840
[COMPUTER SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.860
JOSH ESTELLE: Pretty good?

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.790
How's my Chinese?

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.255
We got any Chinese speakers?

00:16:42.255 --> 00:16:42.510
Pretty good?

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.440
Yeah, all right.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:44.960
Cool.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.210
You can also use this supersize
mode, right?

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.440
So if I need to reach someone
way in the back of the room,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.060
they can read that.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.270
Or this is great for showing a
cab driver where you need to

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.060
go, that sort of thing.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.180
You don't have to hand
them your phone.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.140
You're just kind of like,
look at this.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.390
So that's that.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.560
Some of the other things I'm
really excited about in our

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.550
mobile app is some of the
ways we're dealing

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.160
with inputting text.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.810
So when you're traveling, it's
not always so easy to get text

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.079
into your app.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.056
The first one is handwriting
input.

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:18.359
Us Americans, right, we're used
to keyboards like this.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.089
But there's a lot of people in
the developing world that are

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.010
coming to mobile phones as their
first computing device,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.869
and they're maybe not used to
ASCII keyboards, right?

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.730
They might be used to just
drawing Chinese characters.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.440
That's how they've
always written.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.570
So this handwriting is really
great for that.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.390
I don't know that much Chinese,
but I know one.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.370
I didn't quite get it right.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.715
I know one kind of interesting
character.

00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:41.835
Did I get it?

00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:42.190
Come on.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.955
Ah, shoot.

00:17:44.955 --> 00:17:47.690
I'm going to try it
one more tine.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.680
I assure you, this is not
our system's fault.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.480
This is my terrible
Chinese fault.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.125
Can I get "fire"?

00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:56.440
Yeah, fire.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:56.540
ROHIT KHARE: Fire.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:56.680
JOSH ESTELLE: Wait, no.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.230
There's not a fire.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.670
Don't worry.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.890
Cool, so that's handwriting.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.440
The next one is camera input.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.810
So let's imagine we're
in a zoo in Tokyo.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.550
Rohit's going to help me out.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.550
He's going to be my zoo sign.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.230
What does this say?

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.280
I have no idea.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.430
Well, I'm in Tokyo, so I better

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.580
change this to Japanese.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.393
I'll just take a picture
of that, get

00:18:18.393 --> 00:18:22.290
that lined up in there.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.320
And so this will recognize the
text, and then I can just

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.830
swipe my finger over the text
I want to understand.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.650
And now, oh, there we go.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.650
The amphibious reptile house
must be over there somewhere.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.970
Watch out for amphibians
if you're sitting in

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.330
that side of the room.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:37.840
Cool.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.830
And then also if you, need to
talk to someone, we have

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.206
conversation mode, which
will handle your voice.

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.890
Since we're in conversation
mode, I can just be like,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.350
"Hey, do you know where the
amphibious reptile house is?"

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:57.180
[COMPUTER SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.660
JOSH ESTELLE: All right.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.780
Of course, I just read the sign,
so I'm not sure why I

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.340
needed to ask that.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.725
I was just double checking.

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:04.660
So that's conversation mode.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.010
And then the last thing, I'm
really excited about-- we

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.850
launched pretty recently--

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.120
is what if you're at a
conference and the wireless is

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.480
really terrible, and you just
can't seem to get the

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.720
translations you need?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.630
I'm going to simulate that by
going into airplane mode.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.410
Now I'm just going
to type here.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:28.075
"Hello." Oh, and I still
have a translation.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.520
"How are you?" So this
translation is all happening

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.020
offline, on my device, no
network connection.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.000
Pretty cool, huh?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.970
So this is a great when
you're traveling.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.130
You've got expensive data.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.280
You've got maybe no data at
all, but you can still do

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.130
translation.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.330
Now this does require you to
download some language packs.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.530
So each language is about
100 megabytes of data.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.680
But once you have it, you can do
offline translations, which

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.350
we're really excited about.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.290
Cool.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.000
So let me just talk
a little bit more

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.550
about where we're going.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.730
What's next for Google
Translate?

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.560
More languages.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.820
We're up to 71.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.570
That's a great number, but
there are thousands of

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.180
languages in the world, and we
want to keep adding more.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.370
So I'm sure someone after this
talk is going to come ask me,

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.350
what about my language?

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.050
We get that all the time, and I
promise we're working on it.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.140
It always becomes a matter of if
we can get enough data for

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.040
a particular language.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.160
So usually the best thing
people can do is get

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.500
translated content out on the
web where it can be crawled.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.570
And we'll find it, and we'll
learn from it, and it'll help

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.880
our system.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.990
We want better quality,
of course.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.160
We're really proud
of our quality.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.090
We think our translations
are really usable.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.650
They can help you understand
a document.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.110
They can help you communicate.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.970
They're not perfect though.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.070
You don't necessarily want to
localize your website just

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.150
straight up and trust the
machine translation without

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.120
anyone reviewing it, right?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.060
You want to be careful.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.830
But we want to get there.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.500
We want our translations to
get better and better.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.170
We also want translation
to be ubiquitous.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.800
No matter where you are, you
should have access to a

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.990
translation.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.466
So if you're browsing a website
in Chrome, boom, you

00:21:04.466 --> 00:21:05.370
get it translated.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.510
You run into a sign, you pull
out your phone, you get it

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.330
translated.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.250
There are still places that
are hard for people to get

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.890
translations.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.930
We want to make sure any time
you encounter text that you

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.860
can get it.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.340
And we want real-time
communication.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.970
So we want you to be able to
translate things instantly,

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.750
quickly, right when
you need it.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.080
We want those conversations to
happen, spoken, real-time

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.860
conversations in other
languages too.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.501
So with that, I'll turn it over
to Rohit, and he's going

00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:32.090
to tell you more
about the API.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.270
ROHIT KHARE: Yeah.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.750
Thank you, Josh.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.870
Glad for the introduction to
the science behind Google

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.450
Translate, and I think I want
to talk to you about what we

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.320
do with it and what you
can do with it.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.720
What's important to realize that
we think translation's

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.620
important in context.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.440
So if I receive a Gmail that's
happens to be in Japanese,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.430
notice that we have that link
right there to convert that

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.610
back to English.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.220
Now, we use this in our consumer
applications, like

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.460
Docs and Spreadsheets.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.550
We use it in our internal
applications, like approving

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.420
advertising, and understanding
how Search queries should be

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.910
indexed and shared
across languages.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.320
But we use our own
dog food here.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.600
We use and API, and we make them
over with third parties.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.790
So this is a screenshot from a
partner called The Backplane.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.730
They are a social site that
started out with Lady Gaga's

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.830
management company and are now
working with other brands like

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.170
Nike and Coke and so on.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.610
And they create communities
for fans.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.090
And unlike, say, a friendship
community of people you met at

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.910
college, who will probably all
speak the same language, the

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.350
superfans around the world
really are passionate and love

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.510
to connect, but they
don't always

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.960
speak the same language.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.050
So here in this chat, we can
see that an English speaker

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.290
and an Italian speaker
are able to go

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.610
fluidly back and forth.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.870
And they're using the same
API technology as

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.420
we do here at Google.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.810
So the important thing I want to
say up front is that a lot

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.670
of the translate technology we
just saw is very advanced, and

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.440
there's some very amazing things
you can do by combining

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.440
speech and handwriting and
image recognition.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.200
But I want to say that the core
technology is very much

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.210
open for business.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.670
It's part of the Google Cloud
Platform, and you've heard a

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.790
lot about that this week at
Google I/O. We have basic

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.330
services in compute, like App
Engine and Compute Engine,

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.060
storage services, but also a
great way to take advantage of

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.350
the best of that Google has to
offer, from apps to Maps to

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.900
APIs for data processing and
advertising analytics, and

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.390
including Translate.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.350
Translate's been around
since late 2011.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.580
It's one of our larger and more
successful businesses

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.600
within the cloud.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.790
Over 3 million developers use
the Cloud Platform projects,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.760
and 300,000 folks come
and work on the

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.720
platform every month.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.720
And we'd like keep growing that,
and this is a key part

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.152
of that strategy.

00:23:32.152 --> 00:23:35.450
And it's $20 per million
characters translated.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.090
And it's not always easy to get
your head around that, but

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.470
$1 for localization can often
get just a word or two.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.690
But in machine translation, that
can be over 100 pages of

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.950
English content.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.560
It's often the case people say,
well, is $20 per million

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.960
characters expensive or not?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.740
And it's actually quite
reasonable.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.990
It's best to get out there and
start experimenting, and you

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.670
can scale up.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.240
Until you even have
Wikipedia-style content, you

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.370
will still not be taking that
much that goes out of your

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.640
data quota limits.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.500
So how do you call it?

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.490
Real briefly mechanics.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.560
It's really quite simple.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.590
As said, there's Core
2 core services.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.080
In this case, we're doing a
GET request with your API

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080
console key.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.370
Here's "hello world." I want
the target in German.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.910
We're automatically detecting
the source language and giving

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.340
you the output, "hallo welt,"
and telling you that we

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.620
thought it was English source.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.050
We also do great things with
automatic HTML parsing.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.040
We're often doing an input
that's coming in from the web.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.520
And in this case, this is that
phrase about going to the

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.110
conference.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.280
And the conference, you'll here
notice is capital K in

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.750
German, and the word "fly" is
in bold, in bold markup.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.780
And here's the output where
"fly" is in bold, but notice

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.340
it's much earlier
in the sentence.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.310
The C in conference has
been lowercased.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.090
So it's always great for
realizing that you can use

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.050
HTML markup, and the
markup will float

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.190
with the correct phrase.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.590
So this again makes it a little
easier to integrate in

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.645
your websites.

00:24:46.645 --> 00:24:49.040
And it's available also in
products like Google Apps

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.320
Script, if you're working for
lightweight prototyping in our

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.256
Spreadsheets or Docs.

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:55.610
Here's the same phrase
in Spanish.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.920
So the important thing you need
to realize is that we're

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.000
taking the two most important
core things about our

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.140
Statistical Machine Translation
engine, which is

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.110
language detection, which is
that you know what your

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.000
input's coming in as, and
language translation between

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.560
our supported languages.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.610
Sometimes we do a release.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.330
Our most recent languages
will be in Alpha.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.550
We're working on our data.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.600
Some of them are not yet
supported in the API, but by

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.855
and large, as they graduate,
they are always available to

00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:18.050
you through the API.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.600
Now, of course, we have a lot
of products where we make it

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.610
free to our consumers.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.770
For commercial use, for you as
third-party developers, we

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.810
definitely want to
encourage that.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.020
But we have kind of two
key rules of the road.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.500
One is attribution.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.810
It's really important that
humans know that this is

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.695
machine-translated output
in case there

00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:35.280
are errors or omissions.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.120
It's really important to us that
humans know that it's our

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.030
machine-translation output,
and if you want to use the

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.440
Google logo, there are some
additional rules and

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.470
suggestions about
how to do that.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.100
But it's also important that
machines know that it's

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.880
machine-translation output.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.670
As he mentioned, the way machine
translation works is

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.100
by building upon all the work
in the parallel corpora, the

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.670
parallel text that are out
there that humans create.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.080
And the last thing we want to
see is taking content from our

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.090
API and republishing it back on
the web in a way that makes

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.260
other research groups and

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.580
developers' input less reliable.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.130
So with that, the rules of the
road on how it works and how

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.730
to call it, I want to talk about
when it gets used, and

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.340
talk about two broad cases I
looked at when we saw our

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.030
traces of who was using
our API and for what.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.160
Now, some developers are
offline, are some developers

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.840
are on the web.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.740
So in looking at our logs, I
found a couple of clusters of

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.940
people who I thought
were offline.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.660
And one huge area of growth is
mobile applications, and

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.250
you're delivering the experience
on Android or iOS

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.380
or BlackBerry.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.120
You could simply make an
internet call, a REST call,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.120
and display that online on
the tablet, on the phone.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.150
We've see business process
applications.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.780
For example, at Google we use
all of our bug reports that

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.930
come in from the field.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.620
We have clustering algorithms
and train people who look at

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.020
the field reports, but we have
to bring them back into a

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.130
common language, say
English, to do so.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.720
So these are back office
processes.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.120
There are media monitoring
applications, where you want

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.640
to know how your brand or
company is being perceived

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.390
around the world.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.950
And so rather than just
translate the name of your

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.300
products and see how many times
it gets mentioned in the

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.220
media, why not bring all that
media in, translate those

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.650
entire articles, and be able to
look at the sentiment and

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.680
look at the themes and the
content around the world.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.430
And another subclass was around

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.880
hybrid translation companies.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.690
So you take machine-translation
output,

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.560
and you might have expertise in
medical or real estate or

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.530
in a certain country,
and you have a staff

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.690
that makes that better.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.750
So there are companies that
have used our API to help

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.750
bootstrap the translation
process.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.980
But most visibly, you've
probably seen Google Translate

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.790
on the web.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.600
And an obvious place
is e-commerce.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.250
If you can put it in
a box and FedEx it,

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.320
you can be an exporter.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.690
But you can't export
much unless your

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.710
customers can find you.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.130
And so we want to do our best
to make sure that you can

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.580
create your product listings,
your product reviews, get them

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.050
indexed, get them visible, and
attract new customers.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.060
But I was also surprised to find
out the largest customer

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.030
within e-commerce turned out to
be stuff you can't put in a

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.880
box and export.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.500
It was hotels and hostels
and vacation rentals.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.330
And it wasn't the product

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.290
descriptions, it was the reviews.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.450
It's what people said when
they came from abroad,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.990
reviewed a place, and allowed
other travelers who maybe also

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.260
didn't speak that language to
know what they thought of it.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.210
And this theme was really
enlightening to me.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.735
And we'll come back to some of
the lessons I learned from

00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:13.100
that later.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.960
But that's a case where, even
if you think you're a local

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.530
merchant running B&amp;B in
Monterrey, you should probably

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.770
still consider translation.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.760
I can have an impact
on your business.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.940
Multimedia content.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.140
There's a lot of content on the
web today that's video,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.730
that's images, that's
photographs and newswire

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.800
photos or product imagery that's
perfectly usable in

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.760
multiple languages.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.770
You don't need to
read to use it.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.610
But you can't find it unless
that metadata, caption,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.657
program guide, and so
on is available to

00:28:39.657 --> 00:28:42.360
people in those languages.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.450
Language learning.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.430
This was a smaller sector, but
it was interesting that even

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.690
machine translation, which can
be approximate at times, can

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.230
be very useful in an interactive
setting where you

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.360
are in a game or you're in
a community classroom or

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.150
somewhere where a TA
can help you out.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.590
So places where you have an
interactive application can be

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.210
also a really good
fit for our API.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.830
And finally, social
communities.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.080
And it was important to think
that it wasn't just

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.050
communication applications,
like SMSes or places where

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.370
people are communicating across
borders, but places

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.570
where you can find shared
passions and communities--

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.680
forum sites, rare diseases,
passionate collectors of

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680
various items.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.390
These are cases where your
community might be better

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.750
served by pulling it all in one
place than having separate

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.700
language communities and
separate language sites.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.366
So from these bunch of examples
of companies that are

00:29:25.366 --> 00:29:26.220
using it on the web,
let's talk about a

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.210
couple of key themes.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.590
One is think about machine
translation when you need to

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.000
get the gist of things.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Human translation is great, but
the sheer cost and scale

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.420
says that we're not going to
be able to organize the

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.690
world's information unless we
use machine translation.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.750
But it's important to know its
strengths and weaknesses.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.810
And the thing was, when you're
looking at reviews, like a

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:45.130
hotel review, I didn't need
to worry about whether the

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.620
grammar was perfect in the
way that you expect of a

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.630
well-written YouTube comment.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.870
Comments and reviews are really
great content, even if

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.700
you can only get the
sense of it.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.170
You have to think about reach,
which is, are you building a

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.490
site or an app where your
audience is going to be

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.320
reaching you in multiple
languages and multiple

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.230
communities?

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.180
And that's often earlier
than you think.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.840
You might assume that your
audience is only shipping to

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.660
one country in Europe, say in
France, but that doesn't mean

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.940
that you only need to
communicate in French.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.310
You also have French
consumers who

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.390
speak all the EU languages.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.170
And bulk.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.910
Think about machine translation
when there are

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.900
applications that no one ever
thought of doing with human

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.710
translation because it
was so obviously

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.690
prohibitive to do so in cost.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.220
But if you can look at media
monitoring or look at your old

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.690
customer reports or look at a
large amount of text, and work

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.690
with all of your reviews rather
than just a few that

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.420
seem to be for the top hotels.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.080
And finally, look for cases
where the user is in control.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.940
Machine translation is great if
the user has initiated or

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.270
requested the translation
process, or is aware that I'm

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.110
flipping between the original
Turkish and the English.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.100
Or if the user is the one who's
creating the content in

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.810
the first place, and they have
the chance or the opportunity

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.400
to know that, by telling us
that you're OK with this

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.390
language, that your review will
now be read by people

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.350
visiting this pizza place
from all over the world.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.220
So with this, I'd like to bring
it back together and say

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.440
these are part of the whole
suite of tools at Google and

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.730
at other places in the world
to help you go global with

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.290
your site or your app.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.200
There are new markets.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.020
There are no more monolingual
markets.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.230
Even in the United States,
Hispanic consumers control

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.540
over a trillion dollars
in household spending.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.290
There is a reason for growth,
because you have to be able to

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.680
take in input and feedback
that you're getting and

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.630
understand what your customers
are telling you and how you

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.220
can expand.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.890
There are opportunities to
make sure that you are in

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:28.730
compliance.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.820
There are a variety of
rules and cultural

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.700
norms around the world.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.430
And even if you're not yet
operating in that language, at

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.730
least knowing what your users
are saying in those languages,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.610
so you can review that and
be sure that that's in

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.860
compliance.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.010
And to help create
connections.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.530
Because I think the next wave
of global growth isn't by

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.440
franchising your business and
saying, I'm going to create a

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.260
.ru site and a .jp site.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.030
But try and see if you can
create a network effect and

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.060
connect your user base around
the world in one product.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.500
So that's where we'd like to
wrap up, is that our mission

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.860
is to help organize the world's
information and make

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.930
it universally accessible
and useful.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.160
We found this to be an
incredibly powerful tool

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.620
across a range of
Google products

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.050
and business processes.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.710
We've taken the best of that and
the core of that product

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.400
knowledge and made it
available to you.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.250
And I'd like to hear now if
you have questions and

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.000
resources about how we can help
other folks do the same.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.916
So thank you very much.

00:32:15.916 --> 00:32:18.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.570
ROHIT KHARE: Some of
our related links.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.190
JOSH ESTELLE: So if there's
questions, there's two

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.740
microphones if people
want to stand up.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.246
We've got about five minutes
for questions.

00:32:27.246 --> 00:32:28.200
ROHIT KHARE: Please.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.670
AUDIENCE: Hi I'm Luc, and I just
wanted to ask about the

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.450
offline translation.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.340
Would you make this available
for business

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.710
developers and so on?

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.030
JOSH ESTELLE: So we don't
have plans to now.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.820
But this is good feedback,
right?

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.440
We're always looking for ways
of what the next thing we

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.460
might add to the API or how
we can expand that.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.130
We're really excited about
offline now, and we can

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.570
understand that developers
would be too.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.880
So it's something we
can look into.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.310
ROHIT KHARE: Yeah, I'd love to
hear more about your use case.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.560
Thank you.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.140
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.650
Do you provide a confidence
score in the API?

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.300
So I could know when the
confidence is little, I would

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.030
call in a human translator, and
if it's high, I'm good to

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.720
go and can ship it out?

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.070
JOSH ESTELLE: Yeah.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.490
So right now we don't.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.720
Providing confidence for
machine translation is

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.130
actually a really, really
hard problem.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.860
You can imagine if you would
solve the problem of

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.910
confidence, you would just
generate a bunch of

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.270
translations and just pick the
one that had the highest

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.810
confidence.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.580
So in some ways, generating
confidence is as hard as doing

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.770
translation is.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.460
So internally, we've tried some
things around confidence,

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.370
that sort of thing.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.820
None that we're happy with
enough that we've even exposed

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.190
in our UI in anyway, or think
you would actually benefit

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.770
from in the API.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.220
It's an understandable
thing to want.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.020
We want it too, but it's
really hard to do.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.160
So right now, we don't have
a way to do that.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.105
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:50.500
JOSH ESTELLE: Yeah.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.190
OK.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.110
Any other questions?

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.243
ROHIT KHARE: Well, we'll be
around for a few minutes.

00:33:55.243 --> 00:33:57.155
We'll be glad to talk about
individual scenarios.

00:33:57.155 --> 00:33:57.470
Thanks very much.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.690
JOSH ESTELLE: And we
have stickers if

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.730
anyone wants stickers.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.530
ROHIT KHARE: Yes, we have lots
of Translate stickers.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.030
Thank you very much.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.280
JOSH ESTELLE: Thanks.
